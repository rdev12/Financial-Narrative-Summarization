Sustainability review CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
During 2015, we continued to make significant progress in enhancing 
the overall efficiency of our operations. Although we experienced  
some challenges, Acacia remains on track to deliver long-term value.
Dear shareholders,
2015 was another year of transformation 
for Acacia as we progressed the 
mechanisation of Bulyanhulu and 
commenced underground operations  
at North Mara. We delivered increased 
production for the third consecutive 
year, albeit at marginally lower levels 
compared to original expectations.  
With our continued investment into  
the turnaround of Bulyanhulu, costs 
remained flat year on year, which 
together with the average realised  
gold price being over US$100 per  
ounce lower year on year, impacted  
on free cash generation. 
Our ongoing turnaround has taken place 
against a negative market backdrop  
for the broader mining industry. The 
economic slowdown in China impacted 
demand for the majority of industrial 
metals and commodities, leading to  
a significant fall in physical prices which 
has been reflected in equity valuations. 
The gold price was by no means 
immune from the broader mining sector 
malaise, and reached a six-year low  
of US$1,049 per ounce in December. 
Having performed very strongly towards 
the end of 2014, Acacia’s share price 
fell by 29.5% over 2015, reflecting the 
lower gold price and the operational 
challenges experienced during the year. 
In light of the poor market conditions, 
both the Board of Directors and the 
Executive Leadership Team have 
unanimously volunteered to take  
a 10% reduction in pay in 2016.
“To demonstrate our commitment  
to providing returns to shareholders 
and our confidence in the ability  
of the business to generate cash flow, 
the Board has recommended a final 
dividend of US2.8 cents per share.”
Board composition
2015 was a year of stability for the Board as 
we embedded the talent added over the past 
two years. As part of this process, we undertook 
an extensive review of Board activities. We  
also undertook our first externally-facilitated 
Board performance evaluation. This confirmed 
that the Board, and its respective Committees, 
had operated effectively throughout the 
reporting period and has helped to shape  
our focus areas for 2016.
All Directors will stand for re-election at the 
2016 AGM, save for Graham Clow who has 
decided not to stand in order to concentrate on 
other interests. We would like to thank Graham 
for his many contributions to the Company  
and wish him well for the future.
Final dividend
In 2014, we amended our dividend policy 
to ensure that it is more closely aligned with 
the cash generation potential of the business. 
As such, it is now based on operational cash 
flow after sustaining capital and capitalised 
development but before expansion capital and 
financing costs, rather than on net earnings.
As a result of the net cash decrease for  
the year, strictly following our dividend policy  
would imply no final dividend be recommended 
for the year. However, to demonstrate our 
commitment to providing returns to shareholders, 
the strength of our balance sheet and to  
signal our confidence in the ability of our 
business to generate cash flow, the Board has 
recommended a final dividend of US2.8 cents 
per share. Subject to shareholder approval  
of this recommendation at the AGM on  
21 April 2016, the final dividend will be paid  
on 27 May 2016 to shareholders on the register 
as of 6 May 2016. The ex-dividend date is 5 May 
2016. Together with our interim dividend of 
US1.4 cents per share, this represents a full 
year dividend of US4.2 cents per share.

Outlook
Whilst we encountered challenges in the 
year, the team continued to make significant 
improvements to the business as we moved 
through 2015. The hard work and commitment 
of the management team and those at the 
operations led to increased production from 
2014 levels, and has orientated the business 
to deliver positive cash flows in 2016 at levels 
well below the current gold price. 
Looking forward to 2016, we plan to consolidate 
the significant changes that the team has 
made over the past two years to provide a 
platform for operational stability going forward. 
We will continue to identify and implement 
further potential efficiencies within the 
Company, and our focus this year will be on 
improving productivity as we have now largely 
completed the re-engineering of our operations 
and the rightsizing of our workforce. 
On behalf of the Board, I sincerely thank all 
Acacia employees for their hard work and 
dedication over the past year. I would also like 
to thank our shareholders for their continued 
support and commitment to the Company.

FOCUSED 0N  
FREE CASH FLOW
as our primary 
driver of value
10 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 “In light of the lower gold price 
environment we are redoubling  
our efforts to remove further costs 
from the business in order to return  
to free cash generation.”
Introduction
I am pleased with the progress we have made 
across the business over the past 12 months 
as we continued to transform Acacia into a 
leading company in Africa, although the speed 
of the turnaround is slower than I had hoped  
to achieve. While we did not realise our primary 
aim of generating free cash flow in 2015 as  
a result of the challenges we faced, primarily  
in the third quarter, we did see an increase  
in production over 2014. This production  
was, however, lower than planned, which  
had a knock-on effect on costs.
Clearly we are disappointed that we did  
not achieve some of our goals. However,  
to address the combined effects of Q3 
performance and the continuation of a lower 
gold price we decided to accelerate a wide-
ranging rightsizing of our workforce in Q4.  
This process has now largely been completed  
and means we have a leaner, more nimble 
organisation that is set up to deliver in 2016 
and beyond, as was evident in our improved  
Q4 performance.
Year in review
Much was accomplished in 2015 as we 
progressed the mechanisation of Bulyanhulu 
and successfully transitioned North Mara  
into a combined open pit and underground 
operation. As a result, production increased for 
the third consecutive year to 731,912 ounces, 
2% higher than 2014, but marginally below the 
initial guidance range for the year. Production 
increased by 5% at North Mara to 287,188 
ounces driven by the contribution of the newly 
commissioned Gokona Underground and by 
17% at Bulyanhulu to 273,552 ounces as we 
saw a full year of operations of the re-claimed 
tailings project. At Buzwagi, production fell  
by 19% as a result of operations being focused 
on low grade areas in the open pit. 
On the cost side, we continued to demonstrate 
discipline and began to show the full benefit  
of the changes we have made to the cost base 
over the year in the fourth quarter, with all-in 
sustaining costs (‘AISC’) of US$1,004 per 
ounce. This represents a US$700 per ounce 
reduction in our quarterly AISC since Q3 2012. 
Although we delivered strong cost performance 
in Q4, the impact of lower than expected 
annual production, together with continued 
investment into the development of Bulyanhulu, 
led to full year AISC of US$1,112 per ounce 
sold, broadly in line with 2014 and marginally 
above our initial guidance range. Encouragingly, 
we continued to show strong capital discipline 
whilst delivering increased production, with capital 
expenditure being down by 30% over 2014. 
We ended the year with net cash of US$105 
million and US$233 million of cash on our 
balance sheet, a reduction over the previous 
year of US$61 million. This included costs 
incurred of US$20 million on exploration, 
US$17 million on dividends, US$10 million  
We continue to look for ways to drive productivity 
and efficiencies within each of our operations.

STRATEGIC REPORT PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED
on restructuring our workforce and US$15 
million spent on the first repayment of our 
outstanding project debt for the CIL expansion 
at Bulyanhulu. In the fourth quarter we added 
US$7 million in cash to the balance sheet, at  
a time when the gold price hit a six-year low, 
and we believe that with the expected reduction 
in costs this year we will add cash to the balance 
sheet in 2016 at levels well below the current 
gold price. Given our planned production profile 
we expect this to occur primarily in the second 
half of the year. 
Total revenue for the year amounted to US$868 
million, which was 7% below 2014 as a result  
of the US$104 per ounce lower average realised 
gold price and despite the 2% increase in sales 
ounces. EBITDA was similarly affected by the 
gold price, at US$175 million, down from 
US$253 million in 2014. We had a loss for the 
year of US$197 million, primarily as a result of a 
US$189 million non-cash impairment at Buzwagi, 
with adjusted earnings of US$7 million.
Reserves and resources
The continuing weakness in the gold price 
throughout 2015 has led to a reduction in the 
gold price assumption we have incorporated 
into our reserve and resource calculations.  
Our reserve pricing is now US$1,100 per 
ounce, down from US$1,300 per ounce, and 
our resource pricing at our mines has been 
reduced by US$100 per ounce to US$1,400 
per ounce. This reduction in gold price, in 
tandem with updated operating assumptions  
at Bulyanhulu, following a detailed block by 
block re-appraisal of our reserves, has led to  
a total reduction of approximately 3.7 million 
ounces of gold reserves, with around 90%  
of the reduction being at Bulyanhulu. Whilst  
this is disappointing, Bulyanhulu continues  
to have a mine life in excess of 20 years and 
unchanged total reserves and resources of  
17 million ounces. Our planning will be focused 
on the continued optimisation of our operating 
performance and on ultimately bringing as 
many of these ounces as possible back into 
our reserve base. This will only be once we  
are fully satisfied that they meet our return 
criteria at current prices. At North Mara,  
we more than replaced reserves in the Gokona 
Underground as an improved understanding  
of the ore body allowed us to both extend  
and add stopes within the mine plan to bring  
in additional profitable ore tonnes. 
Carrying value review
As a result of the continued decrease in the 
gold price during 2015, the gold price used to 
assess the carrying value of our operating 
assets and exploration properties was reduced 
in line with market expectations to US$1,100 
per ounce for 2016, US$1,150 for 2017 and 
US$1,200 from 2018 onwards. This change 
required us to test the carrying value of each  
of our operating mines for potential impairment. 
The impairment review resulted in no change  
to the carrying value at either Bulyanhulu or 
North Mara, but due to the impact of the lower 
gold price on the short life of mine at Buzwagi, 
where we have assumed a flat US$1,100 per 
ounce gold price, we have incurred a non-cash 
post-tax impairment charge of US$188.7 
million at the mine. Following the impairment 
our total carrying value for the Company has 
decreased to US$1.7 billion, with Buzwagi  
now carried at US$81 million.
Expanding our footprint
We continue to look to enhance our portfolio of 
assets, and during 2015 expanded our exploration 
portfolio in Burkina Faso and made our first 
entry into Mali. We believe that exploration is  
a significant driver of value for the business 
over the long term and now is the time to invest, 
which is a contrarian view to many in the market. 
We also had a successful year within our 
existing exploration portfolio as the drilling 
programmes in West Kenya identified 
encouraging potential across the Liranda 
Corridor, and we announced in December 2015 
that we had intercepted multiple lenses of  
high grade mineralisation which will be followed  
up in 2016. In Burkina Faso, programmes on 
the South Houndé joint venture have expanded 
both the oxide and fresh rock resources and 
our joint venture partner Sarama Resources 
announced in February 2016 an increase of 
600,000 ounces of inferred resources at the 
project, giving a total resource of 2.1 million 
ounces at 1.5 grams per tonne (calculated  
and, where relevant, declared in accordance 
with JORC requirements). 
We have also formed an earn-in joint venture 
with OreCorp Limited to progress our Nyanzaga 
Project in Tanzania. The structure of the joint 
venture allows us to continue our focus of 
delivery from our existing mines whilst retaining 
the optionality to participate in the potential 
future development of a large-scale gold mine. 
We believe that the team at OreCorp, having 
previously run large-scale projects in Tanzania, 
are well placed to advance the project.
Safety
We are pleased to report that we saw an 
improvement in safety performance in 2015  
as the behavioural safety programme, “Tunajali”  
or “We Care”, began to take effect across all of 
our operations. As a result our total reportable 
incident frequency rate improved by 21% despite 
a toughening of the criteria we use to assess 
the measure. Whilst we experienced no fatal 
incidents in 2015, regrettably, in January 2016 
one of our contractors at North Mara passed 
away as a result of a haul truck accident. We 
continue to target zero injuries and having every 
person going home safely every day.
Cost saving initiatives
As we move into 2016, our focus continues to  
be the delivery of free cash flow. We successfully 
returned to free cash generation in Q4 2015, 
despite the costs associated with the significant 
reduction in workforce, and expect to generate 
free cash for the full year 2016. To strengthen 
our ability to generate free cash flow, we have 
taken further action to reduce costs across the 
business, including:
• US$25 million annual saving from the 
restructuring of the workforce announced 
in late 2015
• US$10 million further reduction in capital 
expenditure (based on the bottom of 2016 
guidance range)
• US$10 million reduction in corporate 
administration costs; spend reduced by 
50% since 2012
• US$10 million of annualised savings 
targeted through renegotiation of contracts 
across supply chain 
• The Board of Directors and the Executive 
Leadership Team have volunteered to take 
a 10% reduction in salary
Mitigation of gold price risk at Buzwagi
In February 2016, Acacia entered into zero cost 
collars in relation to 136,000 ounces of 2016 
production from Buzwagi in order to mitigate 
cash flow risk associated with a potential fall  
in the gold price. The agreements provide a 
guaranteed floor price of US$1,150 per ounce 
and also provide exposure to the gold price  
up to an average of US$1,290 per ounce.  
This was a prudent step in locking in a gold 
price in excess of our planning price at Buzwagi, 
where mining activities are due to complete  
in 2017 followed by approximately two years  
of stockpile retreatment. We are, and plan to 
remain, fully unhedged at our long-life assets, 
Bulyanhulu and North Mara.
12 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 Acacia Kilimanjaro Challenge
In June 2015, a team of Acacia staff, led  
by CEO, Brad Gordon and CFO, Andrew Wray 
raised over US$420,000 for CanEducate,  
a charity that provides educational 
sponsorships to impoverished and at-risk 
children primarily in Tanzania, by completing  
the challenge of reaching Uhuru Peak;  
the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro.
Mount Kilimanjaro, in Tanzania, is the highest 
freestanding mountain in the world and  
Uhuru Peak, at 5,895 metres, is the highest 
point in Africa. To get there the climbers spent  
seven days tackling a variety of climates and 
terrain, along with physical challenges such  
as altitude sickness.
Uhuru means freedom and we believe education 
brings freedom through choice, which is why 
CanEducate is the perfect recipient of funds 
raised through the climb. Acacia’s relationship 
with CanEducate began in 2010 when the 
initiative covered 158 students at Bulyanhulu 
and it has now grown to cover over 2,100 
students in 2015, and has supported over 
7,000 students since 2010.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED
Our operating environment
Currency depreciation
Over 2015, the US dollar strengthened 
against many of the global currencies  
as a result of stronger economic growth and 
expectations of an increasing interest rate 
environment. Emerging market currencies, 
including the Tanzanian shilling, performed 
particularly poorly as their growth outlook 
weakened due to their higher proportional 
exposure to the commodity markets. 
In Tanzania this led to a 25% fall in the 
value of the Tanzanian shilling over the year. 
This had a twin impact on Acacia. On the 
positive side, it provides a small operational 
benefit to Acacia as approximately 15% of  
our cash costs are denominated in Tanzanian 
shillings and the impact of the exchange  
rate differential is yet to be removed through 
inflation. However, on the negative side,  
we also have US$110 million of outstanding 
indirect tax receivables owed to Acacia  
by the Government of Tanzania which are 
denominated in TSH. As Acacia reports in 
dollars, these are re-valued each quarter and 
result in mark-to-market losses in proportion 
to the exchange rate changes. In 2015, these 
amounted to a loss of US$28 million.
General elections
Tanzania’s general election cycle runs  
every five years and under electoral law, the 
sitting President, having served two terms, 
was unable to stand again in 2015. Peaceful 
multi-party elections took place in October  
and were closely watched by international 
observers. The election was preceded by  
a closely fought campaign, primarily focused 
on reduction of corruption in the country, 
between the candidates of the ruling party, 
Chama Cha Mapinduzi (‘CCM’) and Chadema, 
the main opposition. Ultimately CCM 
prevailed and President John Magufuli  
has been inaugurated as Tanzania’s fifth 
President. During the electoral process 
Acacia continued to operate well.
Our commodity environment
Gold
The market price of gold has a significant 
impact on Acacia’s ability to generate cash 
flows. Gold price volatility continued to be 
elevated during 2015 with the gold price 
ranging from a high of US$1,302 per ounce  
to a low of US$1,051 per ounce and closing 
the year at US$1,061 per ounce. Market gold 
prices averaged US$1,160 per ounce in 2015, 
an 8% decline from the prior year average  
of US$1,266. The price of gold was negatively 
influenced during the year by US economic 
growth, which led to a strong dollar and 
exchange traded fund (‘ETF’) outflows.  
These were partially offset by strong physical 
demand in Asia, particularly China and India, 
and central bank buying. In December 2015, 
the US Federal Reserve increased its interest 
rates by 0.25% from its previous historical 
lows which led to further US dollar strength 
and gold weakness.
During 2015, Acacia did not undertake  
gold hedging, but in February 2016, in order  
to mitigate the cash flow risk associated  
with the potential fall in the gold price,  
Acacia has entered into zero cost collars that  
cover 136,000 ounces of production from  
Buzwagi at an average floor price of US$1,150 
per ounce and also provide exposure to  
the gold price up to an average of $1,290  
per ounce. We are, and will remain, unhedged  
at Bulyanhulu and North Mara.
Copper
Acacia also produces copper as a co-product 
which is recognised as a part of revenue. 
Copper traded between US$2.05 and  
US$2.92 per pound in 2015. The average 
market copper price for 2015 was US$2.49 
compared to US$3.11 per pound in 2014.  
The price of copper was negatively influenced 
during the year by weakening demand from 
China, the world’s largest consumer.
During 2015 we utilised an option collar 
strategy whereby 24% of our expected annual 
copper production was hedged at an average 
floor price of US$3.08 per pound and an 
average ceiling price of US$3.35 per pound, 
resulting in a realised gain of US$1.4 million 
for the year. In 2016, we currently have  
no copper collars in place but continue to 
monitor prices to target prices with floors 
above the current budget rates.
Fuel
At our operations we consume diesel within 
our mobile mining fleet and to self-generate 
power when required. Diesel is refined from 
crude oil and is therefore subject to the same  
price volatility affecting crude oil prices and  
has a significant impact on our production  
costs. We consumed approximately 455,000 
barrels of diesel in 2015 (2014: 496,000). 
During 2015, Brent Crude oil traded between  
US$36 and US$68 per barrel and averaged 
US$54 per barrel (2014: US$100 per barrel). 
Crude oil has been impacted by the strength 
of the US dollar and increased supplies from 
OPEC countries as sanctions were lifted, 
resulting in an oversupplied market. 
During 2015, we utilised an option collar 
strategy to hedge 75% of our estimated  
diesel consumption at an average floor  
price of US$97 per barrel and average  
ceiling price of US$110 per barrel, resulting  
in a realised loss of US$13.6 million. In 2015,  
we have continued this strategy and put  
in place protection on approximately 75%  
and 68% of our expected 2016 and 2017 
consumption respectively, with average floors 
of US$72 and US$50 and average ceilings  
of US$94 and US$81 per barrel respectively.
MARKET OVERVIEW
14 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 Outlook
Whilst the Group delivered strong performance  
in the fourth quarter, full year delivery in 2015 
was below expectations despite a very successful 
year at North Mara. As a result, we have 
incorporated the learnings from this as well as 
our primary focus on free cash flow into our mine 
plans for 2016 and beyond. We expect production 
to increase to 750,000–780,000 ounces,  
a 5% increase over 2015 at the mid-point of  
the range. We also expect a reduction in AISC  
of approximately 15% to US$950–980 per ounce, 
with cash costs expected to fall to US$670–700 
per ounce. Due to the grade profile at Buzwagi  
in Q1, we expect a production ratio of 45:55  
in terms of the first half versus the second half  
of the year.
At Bulyanhulu we have fundamentally  
re-engineered the operation over the past two 
years and delivered a 40% production increase 
in that time. We have made significant progress 
in the mechanisation of the mine, increasing 
workforce productivities and improving 
underground operating metrics. 
Our focus is on free cash flow and accordingly 
we have reviewed reserves based on the lower 
gold price assumption and a more detailed 
mine design approach. Following this review, 
and our experience in 2015, it was determined 
that within the Upper East Zone, which was 
expected to ramp up significantly in 2016, 
further definition drilling on the Reef 2 series  
is required in order to define the geological 
complexity and as a result we have deferred 
the planned increase in mining rates. As a 
result, we expect production in 2016 to be 
broadly in line with 2015 and with our focus  
on cost reduction measures we expect AISC  
to fall by more than 15% year on year. 
We are still confident that Bulyanhulu will 
produce 350,000 ounces per annum over the 
medium term and are assessing the potential 
above this production rate through an ongoing 
three-year drilling programme, primarily on  
the Reef 2 series. 
North Mara is expected to continue to  
perform strongly as the Gokona Underground  
is fully ramped up and a second access portal 
is developed to provide additional flexibility.  
As a result of the increased proportion of  
mill feed being sourced from the underground 
we expect to see a 5% increase in production, 
with a similar reduction in AISC in 2016  
over 2015.
At Buzwagi, we expect the mine to generate 
solid cash flows over 2016, with production 
expected to be 10% higher than 2015 with 
AISC down by approximately 15%. As a result  
of delays in waste movement in 2015, there  
will be a focus on waste stripping in Q1 2016  
to reduce the backlog. This will result in the 
deferral of some of the high-grade material 
previously planned to be mined in the year  
into Q1 2017 and will mean that approximately  
35% of the mill feed in the first quarter will 
come from lower-grade stockpiles. 
We have continued to improve our capital 
discipline and expect a further 5% reduction  
in capital expenditure in 2016 to US$175–180 
million driven by a further reduction in sustaining 
capital to approximately US$60 million as we 
focus on production critical initiatives at each 
of the mines. Our investment in waste stripping 
and underground development is expected  
to be in line with 2015 as we continue to build 
flexibility in the underground operations at 
Bulyanhulu and North Mara. 
As previously indicated, we plan to maintain  
our exploration spend at approximately US$20 
million, as we progress projects in Kenya, 
Burkina Faso and Mali and look to further  
add prospective land packages to our portfolio. 
Corporate administration costs are expected  
to fall by over 25% to US$25 million as we  
see the impact of a reduction in headcount, 
travel and other central expenses.
Finally, I would like to thank all of my colleagues 
for their commitment, enthusiasm and hard 
work throughout what has been another year  
of transformation at Acacia. We have made 
good progress to date and believe we are  
on the cusp of making this Company a leader  
in Africa. I would also like to thank our Board  
for their support and guidance through the year 
and I am looking forward to 2016 and beyond.

STRATEGIC REPORT PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION OUR STRATEGY
T o be the leading gold  
producer in Africa.
We will do this through  
focusing on the following  
strategic pillars.
Throughout 2015, we continued to make progress against  
our refreshed strategic approach and our ambition to become  
a leading company in Africa.
Our business 
We have made significant technical changes to our business 
to ensure that each of our mines are correctly engineered, set up 
to deliver free cash flow and able to drive operating efficiencies. 
Each mine is transitioning to operate as its own commercial 
business unit, with regulatory and strategic oversight being 
provided by the central offices.
Our people
Our people are our core asset and we are focused on 
creating a high-performance culture where our people are 
held accountable, but are given the tools to succeed. In order 
to achieve this we have significantly reduced the levels of 
management, restructured our corporate offices, rightsized 
the workforce and promoted local talent.
Our relationships
We have focused on improving our relationships with the 
communities around our mines and with the Government. 
We have engaged more actively with the community, the media 
and our broader stakeholders. We have also worked hard to 
strengthen our relationships with local and national authorities 
to ensure that we receive the appropriate support for our 
business in order for us to continue to be a key economic 
development driver for our host countries.
Our future
We believe that exploration is a significant driver of value for 
the business over the long term and now is the time to invest, 
which is a contrarian view to many in the market. As a result, 
we are focused on building a significant land package across 
Africa in the most geologically prospective belts to provide  
our exploration group the best opportunity to discover our next 
mines, as well as other opportunities to drive shareholder 
value over the long term.

Benefiting our host communities 
We are committed to assisting our 
communities by providing opportunities to 
generate livelihoods. One of the programmes 
we undertake is the IMTT, where Acacia 
sponsors students who have completed fourth 
form English and Mathematics to undertake  
a range of multi-year technical training courses. 
The programmes include learning to become  
a welder (two years), Electrician (three years), 
Auto Electrician (three years) and Diesel 
Mechanic (three years) amongst others. 
The sponsorship includes transport, tuition 
fees, practical attachments, course textbooks, 
accommodation and bursaries for living 
expenses and nearly 150 students have now 
graduated from the programme. One of those 
who benefited from the sponsorship, Antony 
Juma Steven, who completed his fourth-form 
studies at Mwalimu Nyerere Secondary School 
in Segese, says; “After successfully completing 
my fourth-form studies I applied for sponsorship 
through my village government and after  
a short while I was invited to go through the 
registration process. I was subsequently 
admitted! I did not believe it as getting 100% 
sponsorship is no joke. Everything is provided 
for by Bulyanhulu and in our group, we joined 
30 students all being paid for by Acacia.”
We aim to work as a partner with our local  
communities to drive lasting shared benefits  
for all of our stakeholders.

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
We assess our performance against the following key performance 
indicators, each of which is linked to our long-term strategy. 
OPERATIONAL MEASURES
Performance 
Gold production was 731,912 ounces,  
2% higher than 2014, as a result of  
the range of improvements made within  
our operations. 
Relevance to strategy 
Gold production is the aggregate of the 
Group’s equity interest in gold ounces 
produced from our mines and one of the  
key measures used to track progress  
made in increasing our productivity levels.
Performance 
Cash cost per ounce sold for the year was 
US$772 per ounce, an 8% increase on 2014, 
as a result of increased operating costs and 
similar levels of production. 
Relevance to strategy 
Cash cost per ounce sold is calculated by 
dividing the aggregate of cash costs by gold 
ounces sold. It is one of the key indicators  
that we use to monitor and manage those 
factors that impact production costs on  
a monthly basis.
Performance 
Cash cost per tonne milled for the year  
was US$60 per tonne, an 2% reduction  
on 2014, as a result of achieving improved 
process throughput.
Relevance to strategy 
Cash cost per tonne milled is calculated  
by dividing the aggregate of cash costs by ore 
tonnes milled. We use it to track cash costs 
against productivity.
Performance 
Total reserves and resources for the year 
amounted to 28.6 million ounces of gold,  
a reduction of 1.5 million ounces from 2014 
due to a combination of revised gold price and 
operating assumptions together with depletion.
Performance 
AISC for the year was US$1,112 per ounce 
sold, broadly in line with 2014 as increased 
production was offset by increased  
operating costs.
Relevance to strategy 
AISC is used to provide additional information 
on the total sustaining cost for each ounce 
sold in order to provide additional clarity  
as to the full cost of production. It is one  
of the key indicators that we use to monitor 
and manage those factors that impact 
production costs on a monthly basis.
Relevance to strategy 
Calculated as the total of proven and probable 
reserves, plus measured, indicated and 
inferred resources expressed in contained 
ounces. It measures our ability to discover  
and develop new ore bodies and to replace  
and extend the life of our operating mines.
Performance 
Total reportable injury frequency rate (‘TRIFR’) 
was 0.68 for the year, compared to 0.86  
in 2014, as a result of an enhanced safety 
programme (WeCare) that was rolled out  
in 2015 to improve safety performance.
Relevance to strategy 
TRIFR tracks all employee and contractor 
reported workplace injuries that require 
medical treatment, including lost time and 
restricted duty. We use it to measure progress 
towards our health and safety goal of zero 
harm. It is calculated as total reportable 
injuries multiplied by 200,000 then divided  
by total number of hours worked.

FINANCIAL MEASURES
Performance 
EBITDA for the year was US$175 million,  
a 31% decrease on 2014 mainly as a result  
of lower gold prices and higher cost of  
goods sold. 
Performance 
Operating cash flow per share was  
US38.2 cents per share, 46% down from  
2014 largely due to the lower gold price  
and working capital investment. 
Performance 
Net loss per share was 48.1 cents,  
compared to earnings of 22.1 cents  
in 2014. The loss was primarily driven  
by an impairment at Buzwagi.  
Relevance to strategy 
EBITDA is a valuable indicator of our ability  
to generate operating cash flow to fund  
working capital and capital expenditures  
and to service debt obligations.
Relevance to strategy 
Operating cash flow per share is the cash 
generated from, or utilised in, operating 
activities, divided by the weighted average  
of the number of Ordinary Shares in issue.  
It helps to measure our ability to generate  
cash from our business.
Relevance to strategy 
Net earnings per share is calculated  
by dividing net earnings by the weighted  
average number of Ordinary Shares in issue.  
It serves as an indicator of our profitability  
and is often used to determine share price  
and value.
Performance 
Total shareholder return (‘TSR’) in 2015  
was negative 28.7% due to a reduction in  
share price following the fall in the gold price 
and operational challenges over the year. 
Performance
Total community investment was  
US$12.9 million, an increase on 2014  
due to a focus on completing commitments 
under the VBIAs at North Mara and increased 
Acacia Maendeleo Fund spending. 
Performance 
Total CO
2
 emissions for 2015 amounted  
to 370,092 tonnes, in line with 2014. Further 
information as regards our GHG emissions 
reporting is provided on page 84.
Relevance to strategy 
TSR is the return on investment a shareholder 
receives over a specified time frame based  
on our share price appreciation/depreciation 
and dividends received. It is used to compare 
our performance against industry peers.
Relevance to strategy 
This represents the amount of money  
that we invest across our corporate social 
responsibility programmes. It helps us to  
track progress made as regards our objective 
to support socio-economic development in  
our operating environment.
Relevance to strategy 
GHG emissions are measured on the  
basis of total tonnes of CO
2
 produced  
by our operations as a way of assessing  
our carbon footprint.
  
These KPIs are linked  
to Executive Directors’ 
remuneration. For full

RISK MANAGEMENT
We assess the principal risks to our business as part of ongoing 
business performance and operational reviews, as follows:
•  We conduct Group-level risk workshops to consider overall  
strategic risks to the business
•  We conduct operational risk workshops focused on specific 
operational risks in the context of each of our operations
•  We conduct functional risk workshops to assess key matters which 
could affect underlying support functions, such as treasury, tax, 
technical services and business improvement, required for our 
long-term business plans
•  We ensure that principal risks are assessed as material components 
of our monthly operational and financial performance reporting
Principal risks (by residual risk) 
1. Security, trespass and vandalism 
2. Implementation of enhanced operational systems 
3. Significant changes to commodity prices 
4. Environmental hazards and rehabilitation
5. Political, legal and regulatory developments 
6. Continuity of power supply (new for 2015)
7. Equipment effectiveness 
8. Safety risks relating to mining operations 
9. Single country risk
Our annual business plan and budgeting process incorporates risks 
identified as a result of these reviews. Residual risks are then identified 
based on the effectiveness of existing controls and mitigating action 
plans. The principal risks identified via this process are then monitored, 
assessed and reviewed throughout the year by the Executive Leadership 
Team in the first instance, the Audit and EHS&S Committees where 
relevant to their respective remits of responsibility, and ultimately by  
the Board, as part of Acacia’s continuing assessment of risk trends  
and developments. 
Further detail as regards the outcome of the Board’s internal control and 
risk management review for the year is provided on page 54 and below. 
The successful delivery of Acacia’s strategy depends on our ability  
to manage risks appropriately in a manner that does not jeopardise  
the interests of our stakeholders.

Risk governance and management 
As part of continuing assessments for our  
risk management practices and in light of  
the enhanced requirements introduced for  
risk management, monitoring and assessment 
under the 2014 edition of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, this year we conducted  
a robust assessment of our risk management 
and internal controls framework, with the 
assistance of Deloitte LLP. This assessment 
covered a review of material components  
of the risk management and internal controls 
practices outlined opposite, the role of our 
internal audit function as regards internal 
controls and risk management and the 
interface of risk management with our wider 
compliance programmes.
In this regard, we assessed our practices  
in the context of risk governance, culture, 
ownership and accountability, infrastructure  
and identification, assessment and evaluation, 
reporting, monitoring, review and assurance. 
From a governance perspective, we also 
reviewed the allocation of risk oversight 
responsibilities for our principal risks between 
the Audit and EHS&S Committees and the 
Board. Further details of the allocation of 
principal risk oversight are provided as part  
of the principal risk table and Committee 
reports. Overall, the review identified a number 
of key strengths and good practices and did not 
identify any material or business critical gaps 
within the framework we use. It also identified 
suggestions for improvement for consideration 
in the context of the continuing evolution of  
our risk management process in areas such  
as risk assessment and evaluation, and  
training and assurance practices in order to 
further enhance and integrate our framework 
and systems. 
2015 Principal risk review
For 2015 our principal risks have continued to 
fall within four broad categories: strategic risks, 
financial risks, external risks and operational 
risks. Generally, the makeup of our principal 
risks has not significantly changed throughout 
the year from those identified as principal  
risks in 2014. However, there have been 
changes in certain risk profiles as a result  
of developments in our operating environment 
and developments or trends affecting the  
wider global economy and/or the mining 
industry. For the time being, this has resulted 
in risks relating to occupational health and 
life-threatening diseases being removed from 
those risks previously viewed as principal  
risks to Acacia and its operations, given the 
decreased impact of Ebola in West Africa  
and the threat that this disease was perceived 
to have to the wider African continent. We will  
of course continue to assess the potential 
impact of all material occupational health  
and wider health risks on our business as part 
of our general health monitoring practices. In 
addition, we increased our assessment of the 
potential impact of a significant environmental 
event on our business in light of the impact  
of the Samarco tailings dam failure in Minas 
Gerais, Brazil. However, in this regard we  
would highlight that our assessment of the 
probability of such an event occurring remains 
unchanged from 2014. Lastly, we have decided 
to reintroduce the continuity of power supply  
as a principal risk, due to increasing and 
continuing fluctuations and stoppages in 
TANESCO power supply experienced during  
the year. 
As a result of the review, at the end of 2015  
we viewed our principal risks as relating to  
the following: 
• Single country risk 
• Significant changes to commodity prices 
• Political, legal and regulatory developments 
• Security, trespass and vandalism 
• Safety risks relating to mining operations 
• Implementation of enhanced operational 
systems 
• Equipment effectiveness 
• Environmental hazards and rehabilitation 
• Continuity of power supply
The principal risk matrix opposite shows how 
we have allocated residual risk ratings across 
these principal risks for 2015. In addition, the 
table entitled principal risks and uncertainties 
on page 80 sets out a description of each  
of our principal risks, along with commentary 
regarding management responsibility, 
Committee and Board oversight, mitigating 
action and key progress made in 2015 for 
further information purposes. In addition  
to those risks stated, there may be additional 
risks unknown to Acacia and other risks, 
currently believed to be immaterial or that 
relate to the wider gold mining industry,  
that could turn out to be material to the  
Group. Additional discussions of certain  
trends and uncertainties that may affect  
our operations are provided in other parts  
of this Strategic report.
Assessment of viability 
In addition to risk management reviews, this 
year we also conducted additional reviews relating 
to business viability relevant to our assessment 
of Acacia’s ongoing viability and the related 
confirmations required to be made in this regard. 
Accordingly, the Directors confirm that they 
have a reasonable expectation that the  
Acacia Group will continue to operate and  
meet its liabilities, as they fall due, for the  
next three years. The Directors’ assessment 
has been made with reference to the Acacia 
Group’s current position and prospects, its 
strategy and the Acacia Group’s principal risks 
and how these are managed, with particular 
regard to those which are viewed as having  
the most relevance to Acacia continuing in 
operation, when assessed in terms of financial 
and operational planning and impact over  
a three-year period, being: environmental 
hazards and rehabilitation; implementation  
of enhanced operational systems; significant 
change to commodity prices; political, legal  
and regulatory developments; safety risks 
relating to mining operations and equipment 
effectiveness. Further details as regards these 
risks are provided in the principal risks and 
uncertainties table at page 80.
A three-year assessment period has been 
selected on the basis of the key components 
and criteria underpinning the Acacia Group’s  
life of mine planning process. This process is 
built on a mine by mine basis using a detailed 
physical and financial model. It makes certain 
assumptions as regards the ongoing gold price 
environment and the performance level of  
each mine. Each component of the plan is  
then stressed tested for market sensitivities  
as part of ongoing reviews. The key components 
of the plans, associated principal risks and 
relevant scenario testing to this planning 
process are reviewed by the Directors at least 
annually. In addition, the life of mine planning 
process is underpinned by regular Board 
briefings as part of ongoing periodic operational 
performance reviews and the discussion  
of any operational initiatives to be undertaken  
in the ordinary course of business.
The information relating to Acacia’s performance 
included on pages 24 to 47 (inclusive) of this 
Annual Report and the information relating  
to its principal risks and uncertainties on  
pages 80 to 83 (inclusive) of this Annual Report, 
is incorporated by reference into this Strategic 
report and is deemed to form part of this 
Strategic report.

24 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 Operating performance
Gold production for the year of 273,552  
ounces was 17% higher than the same period  
in 2014. This was due to ounces produced  
from underground mining increasing by 8% over 
2014, driven by an 8% increase in throughput 
as access to stopes improved; and the new CIL 
circuit delivering 33,508 ounces, against 2014 
production of 12,405 ounces. Gold sold for  
the year amounted to 265,341 ounces, 23% 
higher than 2014 but 3% lower than production 
due to the timing of production at year end 
impacting the shipment of ounces. 
Copper production of 6.3 million pounds for  
the year was 19% higher than in 2014 due to 
higher copper grades combined with higher run 
of mine throughput.
Cash costs for the year of US$797 per ounce 
sold were 2% lower than 2014 (US$812) mainly 
due to the higher production base and lower 
labour costs driven by lower international and 
national employee headcount, partly offset  
by increased contracted services driven by 
increased development contractor activity  
and increased consumables costs as a result  
of the additional reagents required in the  
larger CIL circuit.
AISC per ounce sold for the year of US$1,253 
was 1% lower than 2014 (US$1,266) driven  
by the impact of the higher production base, 
partly offset by increased sustaining capital 
expenditure mainly relating to investments  
in equipment, tailings infrastructure and 
underground ventilation and refrigeration. 
We have fundamentally re-engineered the 
operation over the past two years and have 
made significant progress in the mechanisation 
of the mine, increasing workforce productivities 
and improving underground operating metrics. 
Our focus is on free cash flow and accordingly  
we have reviewed reserves based on the lower 
gold price assumption and a more detailed mine 
design approach. This has led to a reclassification 
of 3.4 million ounces of reserves to resources at 
the mine, with reserves now 6.1 million ounces, 
and total reserves and resources remaining 
unchanged at 17.1 million ounces. Underground 
reserve grade has also reduced to 8.9g/t as  
a result of increased mining width assumptions. 
We expect production in 2016 to be broadly  
in line with 2015 and with our focus on  
cost reduction measures we expect AISC  
to fall by more than 15% year on year. We are  
still confident that Bulyanhulu will produce 
350,000 ounces per annum over the medium 
term and are assessing the potential above  
this production rate through an ongoing 
three-year drilling programme, primarily  
on the Reef 2 series.
Capital expenditure for the year before 
reclamation adjustments amounted to 
US$101.3 million, 23% lower than the 2014 
expenditure of US$131.5 million, mainly  
driven by lower expansionary capital spend, 
partially offset by increased sustaining  
capital spend. Capital expenditure consisted 
mainly of capitalised underground development  
costs (US$59.8 million), investment in mobile 
equipment and component change-outs 
(US$5.4 million), investments in tailings  
and infrastructure (US$15.1 million) and 
investments in an underground refrigeration 
plant (US$12.0 million). The credit in 
expansionary capital expenditure relates  
to the reversal of amounts over-accrued  
on 2014 expansionary capital projects.

26 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 Operating performance
Gold production for the year of 171,172 ounces 
was 19% lower than 2014, as head grade 
reverted towards reserve grade, due to mining 
being concentrated away from the main ore 
zone. This was partially offset by a 2% increase 
in recoveries due to initiatives focused on 
managing the plant’s stability and performance. 
Gold sold for the year amounted to 166,957 
ounces, 2% below production due to the timing 
of concentrate production at year end.
Total tonnes mined for the year of 25.0 million 
tonnes were 2% higher than 2014 due to a 
focus on the accelerated mining of lower-grade 
ore in order to supplement the low-grade 
stockpiles in the first half of the year and the 
focus on increased waste movement in the 
second half of the year to improve access  
to higher-grade areas in 2016. 
Copper production of 8.7 million pounds for  
the year was in line with 2014.
Cash costs for the year of US$1,046 per ounce 
sold were 32% higher than in 2014 (US$791). 
Cash costs were primarily impacted by a lower 
capitalisation of mining costs given the lower 
strip ratio, the lower production base and higher 
freight and warehouse related costs. This was 
partially offset by lower energy and fuel costs 
due to lower oil prices and lower labour costs 
driven by a decrease in international employees. 
AISC per ounce sold for the year of US$1,187 
was 13% higher than 2014 (US$1,055). This 
was mainly driven by the higher cash cost and 
lower production base as discussed above.
As a result of delays in waste movement  
in late 2015, there will be a focus on waste 
stripping in Q1 2016. This will result in the 
deferral of some of the high-grade material 
previously planned to be mined in the year  
into Q1 2017 and will mean that 35% of  
the mill feed in the first quarter is expected  
to come from the lower-grade stockpiles.  
Over the full year we expect production to be 
10% higher than in 2015, with AISC expected  
to fall by more than 15% year on year.
Capital expenditure for the year before 
reclamation adjustments of US$12.3 million 
was 72% lower than 2014 (US$44.2 million). 
This was mainly due to mining taking place  
in the final stage of the open pit resulting in 
lower capitalised stripping costs. Key capital 
expenditure for the year consists of component 
change out costs (US$6.6 million) and 
investments in tailings and infrastructure  
of US$2.3 million.

28 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 Operating performance
Production for the year of 287,188 ounces was 
5% higher than the prior year period as a result 
of higher head grades. Higher-grade Gokona 
Underground stoping ore supplemented the 
lower-grade Nyabirama ore from the open pit 
during the year with approximately 65,800 
contained ounces being mined from the 
underground. Gold ounces sold for the year  
of 288,905 ounces were in line with production, 
and 5% higher than the prior year due to the 
higher production base. Open pit mined grade 
decreased due to an increased proportion  
of ore being sourced from the lower-grade 
Nyabirama pit as the Gokona open pit was 
completed in Q3 2015.
Cash costs of US$590 per ounce sold were  
5% lower than 2014 (US$623) driven by the higher 
production base and lower fuel costs, partly 
offset by increased contracted services costs  
as a result of the Gokona Underground project. 
AISC per ounce sold for the year of US$915 
was 3% lower than 2014 (US$947) primarily 
due to the impact of increased sales volumes, 
lower cash costs and lower sustaining capital 
expenditures.
The mine is expected to continue to perform 
strongly in 2016 as the Gokona Underground  
is fully ramped up and a second access portal 
is developed to provide additional flexibility.  
As a result of the increased proportion of  
mill feed being sourced from the underground 
we expect to see a 5% increase in production, 
with a similar reduction in AISC.
Capital expenditure for the year before 
reclamation adjustments of US$69.0 million 
was 15% lower than in 2014 (US$81.1 million). 
Key capital expenditure included capitalised 
stripping costs (US$30.1 million), capitalised 
underground development costs (US$18.2 
million), investment in mobile equipment  
and component change-outs (US$6.8 million) 
and investment in tailings and infrastructure 
(US$3.5 million). In addition, US$6.4 million 
was spent on land acquisitions primarily around 
the Nyabirama open pit. Land acquisition costs 
are included in capital expenditure above as 
they are included in AISC but are treated as 
long-term prepayments in the balance sheet.

30 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 2015 was a successful year for exploration with the  
key highlights including successful drilling at our 
greenfield joint venture projects in Kenya, our entry  
into highly prospective acreage in western Mali, 
expansion of our exploration acreage in Burkina Faso, 
and further successful drilling results from  
our brownfield exploration projects at Bulyanhulu  
and North Mara.
Greenfield projects
West Kenya Joint Venture Project
An extensive exploration programme was 
completed in 2015, including the drilling of  
121 aircore holes (8,221 metres), 79 reverse 
circulation holes (8,744 metres) and 57 diamond 
core holes (21,750 metres) across the West 
Kenya Joint Venture Project. The majority of this 
work occurred on the Liranda Corridor Project  
in the Kakamega Dome Camp, however,  
regional targets in the Lake Zone Camp were 
also advanced. 
Kakamega Dome Camp
In early 2015, an initial diamond core drilling 
programme tested 12 gold anomalies derived 
from aircore drilling of gold-in-soil anomalies 
along the 12 kilometre long “Liranda Corridor”. 
The drilling programme was successful  
in identifying gold mineralisation occurring  
in multiple locations along the corridor.  
A second and ongoing phase of diamond core 
and reverse circulation drilling commenced in  
late 2015, targeting three of the larger zones  
of mineralisation, namely the Bushiangala, 
Acacia and Shigokho shoots. A total of  
64 diamond core holes (23,250 metres)  
have now been completed within the Liranda 
Corridor since 2014, of which 45 diamond 
holes for 19,391 metres were completed in 
2015. To date, 38 holes have intersected 
mineralised zones of >1g/t Au, 25 holes  
>4g/t Au and 14 holes >8g/t Au.
The gold mineralisation is mostly characterised 
by grey quartz veins within mudstones and  
pillow basalts with associated silica-sericite-
carbonate-pyrite-pyrrhotite alteration. The 
higher-grade intersections display green mica 
alteration (fuchsite and roscoelite). As part  
of the current phase of diamond core drilling, 
eight holes targeted mineralisation between  
300 and 500 vertical metres to test the down 
plunge continuity of the higher-grade shoots  
at Acacia, Bushiangala and Shigokho. Results 
from two holes, LCD0053 (Bushiangala shoot) 
and LCD0057 (Acacia shoot), returned multiple 
high-grade zones showing the potential for  
an economic discovery. At LCD0053, results 
included 3m @ 62.3g/t from 32m, 3m @ 
10.8g/t from 241m, 5m @ 9.02g/t from 271m 
and 3m @ 3.36g/t from 301m. At LCD0057 
results included 3.4m @ 30.5g/t from 437m, 
4m @ 10.2g/t from 453m, 6m @ 4.98g/t  
from 461m, 6m @ 19.4g/t from 473m and  
4m @ 9.88g/t Au from 673m. 
The diamond core results from the deeper 
drilling are very encouraging and show the 
potential for significant extensions both  
laterally and vertically to both the Bushiangala 
and Acacia shoots. 
In 2016, the drilling will continue to test 
both the Bushiangala and Acacia shoots, 
with step out drilling along strike and at depth 
to determine the size potential of the system. 
We expect to drill to 1,000 metres vertical 
depth on 160 and 80 metre spaced holes, 
targeting an Inferred resource that indicates 
we could have a deposit that meets Acacia’s 
economic thresholds. Additionally, other shoots 
within the Liranda Corridor will be targeted with 
a second phase of deeper diamond core drilling 
to look for higher-grade domains.

Lake Zone Camp
A diamond core and reverse circulation drilling 
programme following up selected gold targets 
with associated Induced Polarisation (‘IP’) 
geophysical anomalies was undertaken 
throughout the Lake Zone Camp. A total of  
12 diamond core holes and 73 shallow reverse 
circulation holes were completed across the 
Abimbo, Viyalo, Kitson and Barding prospect 
areas. Gold mineralisation was intersected at 
all prospects and their potential is presently 
being reviewed for further drilling programmes.
During 2015, exploration programmes  
included the acquisition, processing and 
interpretation of high resolution satellite 
imagery, airborne magnetic and radiometric 
surveys, ground induced polarisation gradient 
array and pole-dipole surveys, mapping, 
alteration and structural studies, geochemical 
sampling programmes, auger (652 holes for 
4,012 metres), aircore (492 holes for 26,368 
metres), reverse circulation (80 holes for  
9,176 metres) and diamond core (30 holes  
for 7,663 metres) drilling. 
While drill programmes primarily targeted  
the Tankoro Corridor prospects, including the 
MM Zone, MC Zone, Phantom, Obi, Kenobi, 
Dlarakoro, Autres and Guy prospects, 
reconnaissance aircore drilling was also carried 
out on regional targets such as Bini, Tyikoro  
and Ouangoro. Results from deeper diamond 
drilling into the MM and MC zones have been 
mixed; more work is needed to understand 
controls on high-grade mineralisation.  
Results from step-out reconnaissance and 
aircore drilling have intersected several new 
wide zones of mineralisation and the results 
from more regional targets are considered 
interesting and warrant follow-up. 
As a result of the 2015 drilling programmes, in 
February 2016, Sarama announced an updated 
JORC compliant Inferred Resource of 2.1Moz  
at 1.5g/t Au. Work during 2016 will continue  
to focus on expanding the existing resource and  
on defining high-grade underground potential 
beneath MM and MC Prospect. Additionally, 
further drilling will test targets within the 
Tankoro Corridor as well as regional targets. 
Burkina Faso Projects
South Houndé Joint Venture 
In November 2014, Acacia entered into an 
earn-in agreement with Sarama Resources Ltd 
(‘Sarama’) whereby Acacia can earn an interest 
of up to 70% with the expenditure of up to 
US$14 million over a number of years, at 
Sarama’s highly prospective South Houndé 
Project in Burkina Faso (the ‘Project’). Acacia 
may increase its interest in the Project to  
75% on satisfaction of certain conditions 
relating to resource delineation. Over 2015, 
Acacia provided approximately US$3.5 million 
of funding for project exploration activities.
32 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 Pinarello and Konkolikan Projects 
In March 2015, Acacia increased its exploration 
footprint in the Houndé Belt through the 
execution of an earn-in arrangement for the 
Pinarello and Konkolikan Projects. The earn-in 
agreement required an upfront payment  
of US$400,000 to acquire a 51% interest in  
the projects with the potential to earn up to  
a 75% interest through exploration expenditure 
of US$1.5 million over the next two years.  
The projects comprise six exploration licences 
which are contiguous with other Acacia joint 
venture properties. 
During 2015, we completed regolith and 
geological mapping, mapping of artisanal sites 
and a regional surface geochemical sampling 
programme (soil, termite, quartz lag and rock 
chip samples) comprising 6,075 samples. 
Results from this first pass wide spaced 
reconnaissance sampling (800m x 100m) are 
considered extremely encouraging. Significant 
gold-in-soil/auger geochemical anomalies were 
outlined along major structures defined from 
geological and airborne magnetic interpretation. 
Anomalous gold trends on these properties 
confirm known regional anomalous trends that 
host gold occurrences, prospects and deposits, 
the most significant being the Ouro, Legle,  
and Tangolobe-Nlzele gold-in-soil anomalies 
identifiable over a 13 kilometre strike length.  
A gradient array induced polarisation (‘IP’) survey 
was also carried out to follow-up a gold-in-auger 
anomaly located on the Tankoro-Bantou 
mineralised corridor. The IP survey has defined  
a number of targets associated with coincident 
chargeability – resistivity anomalies some 
associated with anomalous gold geochemistry 
and an obvious structural disconformity. 
Work during 2016 will consist of follow-up of 
regional targets, induced polarisation gradient 
array surveys, auger, AC, RC and diamond 
drilling of geochemical and geophysical 
anomalies and conceptual geological targets.
Central Houndé JV Project
The Central Houndé Project is a grassroots 
exploration project between Acacia and  
Thor Explorations Ltd covering three exploration 
licences over an area of 474km
2
 located within 
the southern part of the prospective Houndé 
Belt. The project is contiguous with other Acacia 
joint venture properties. 
During 2015, we completed regolith and 
geological mapping, mapping of artisanal sites, 
and a regional surface geochemical sampling 
programme (soil, termite, quartz lag and rock 
chip samples) comprising 3,293 samples. 
Results from this first pass wide spaced 
reconnaissance sampling (800m x 100m) are 
considered extremely encouraging. Significant 
gold-in-soil/auger geochemical anomalies were 
defined along major structures defined from 
geology and airborne magnetic interpretation. 
Anomalous trends on the property extend from 
known regional anomalous trends that host 
gold occurrences, prospects and deposits,  
the most significant of these being the Legue 
Anomaly comprising three parallel zones over  
a strike length of more than 7 kilometres. 
Work during 2016 will consist of follow-up of 
regional targets, induced polarisation gradient 
array surveys, auger, AC, RC and diamond 
drilling of geochemical and geophysical 
anomalies and conceptual geological targets.
Mali 
Tintinba Project
In June 2015, Acacia began exploring in  
Mali when it acquired interests in the Tintinba 
Project by entering into an earn-in agreement 
with a local partner. The project comprises 
three exploration licences covering 
approximately 150 square kilometres within  
the Keneiba-Kedougou Inlier situated along  
the world class Senegal-Mali Shear Zone.
Despite the earlier than expected start  
to the rainy season we managed to conduct 
reconnaissance field investigations, mapping  
of artisanal sites and commencement of  
a regional surface geochemical sampling 
programme (soil, termite, quartz lag and  
rock chip sampling). To the end of December 
2015, 1,460 samples had been collected.
Work during 2016 will consist of follow-up of 
geological and regolith mapping, infill sampling, 
trenching, induced polarisation gradient array 
surveys and AC and RC drilling.

Brownfield Projects
In 2015, brownfield exploration was focused  
on the Bulyanhulu ore body where surface  
and underground diamond core drilling  
targeted extensions to both Reef 1 and Reef 2 
mineralised systems. The surface drilling 
demonstrated further resource potential on  
the Reef 2 vein series up to 3 kilometres west 
of existing underground infrastructure, while 
underground drilling continued to intersect 
multiple narrow high-grade Reef 2 series veins 
as part of the resource expansion programme. 
Aircore programmes were also undertaken 
within 5 kilometres of the mine targeting 
satellite discoveries, with several follow-up 
targets emerging.
Geological interpretation from the recent  
holes indicates four near-vertical narrow  
gold bearing quartz vein structures striking 
north-westerly. The highest assay returned  
was from the most northern vein, 146.7g/t 
weighted over a metre (‘gram metre’).  
The drill intersections to date prove the  
Reef 2 structures continue west of the  
current resource although proving continuity  
of high-grade intersections will require more  
closer spaced drilling than Reef 1 to move  
the resource from Inferred to Indicated and  
into reserve.
An infill drilling programme of 25,000 metres 
will be completed in 2016 to reduce the drill 
spacing to 100 metres across a 400 metre 
vertical area along the 1,000m strike length 
extension. The next phases of the underground 
exploration drilling programme require 
development of drill access drives in order  
to provide drill platforms for continued step-out 
drilling to the west. We plan to complete the 
first of these drill access drives by Q3 2016 
and we expect to commence drilling in Q4 
2016. The next exploration drilling phase will 
target extensions to the Reef 2 vein series  
on 200 metre spaced fans a further 800 metres 
west of the current phase. Additionally, from 
these platforms, drilling will also target a 200 
metre extension of Reef 1 to the northwest.
Bulyanhulu
Reef 2 Underground Drilling
The programme is a multi-phase, multi-year 
drilling programme targeting a total resource 
increase of 5 million ounces from extensions of 
the Bulyanhulu Reef 1 and Reef 2 series veins 
outside the current resource model. The 2015 
programme focused exclusively on the Reef 2 
series west of the current resource and was 
drilled from several underground drill platforms 
with a total of 9,240 metres of diamond core 
completed from 18 holes. The drill holes  
were planned to intersect the Reef 2M zone  
at 200 metre centres across a total strike 
length of 1,000 metres.

Bulyanhulu
Bulyanhulu North-Western Extensions  
and Nose Zone
Historic drilling northwest of the currently 
defined resources on Reef 1 and Reef 2  
at Bulyanhulu shows that gold mineralisation 
extends at least a further 3 kilometres.  
During 2015, programmes of aircore drilling  
and diamond core drilling were undertaken to 
test for indications of economic mineralisation 
within 2-5 kilometres of the Bulyanhulu mine.  
In the Northwest and Nose Zone areas a  
total of 103 aircore holes for 4,583 metres  
and four diamond core drill holes for 1,856 
metres were drilled to test several targets 
primarily associated with the Reef 2 series  
vein extensions. All the diamond core holes 
intersected gold mineralisation in a series  
of 2-5 veins per hole similar to those types  
of reefs intersected on Reef 2. These results, 
together with those from previous drilling 
programmes, confirm the presence and  
lateral extension of the targeted multiple  
reefs associated with the Reef 2 series veins.  
Follow-up programmes in late 2016 or early 
2017 will aim at testing the down-plunge 
potential of higher-grade shoots. 
Aircore drilling was undertaken across  
Nose Zone and extensions of this area  
further northwest of the diamond core drilling. 
The aircore drilling targeted a 2km x 0.5km 
gold-in-soil anomaly that had received very little 
drill testing in the past. A programme totalling 
275 holes for 10,909 metres of AC drilling 
completed over 11 drill fences with positive 
results received. These results confirm the 
presence of north-westerly mineralised zones/
structures (possible reefs) warranting further 
follow-up drilling to test mineralisation potential 
at depth and continuity along strike.
North Mara 
Nyabirama
During late 2014 and H1 2015 we completed  
a drilling programme of 29 holes for 5,421 
metres in the Nyabirama pit primarily designed 
to confirm the geological and resource model  
of the Stage 4 cutback, but also to assess the 
potential for a future underground operation. 
The drilling programme was completed on  
time and under budget and provided enhanced 
structural understanding and predictability  
of high-grade zones within the geological model 
and confirmed the resource model. As a result, 
we have identified four principal lodes below the 
final pit outline which appear to demonstrate 
continuity of high-grade mineralisation between 
300m and 600m vertical depth. 
In 2016 we will undertake an initial deeper 
drilling programme of seven holes for a total of 
5,000 metres targeting underground potential. 
This is aimed at improving the 3-D geological 
model and predictability of high-grade 
mineralisation for underground resource 
estimations and if successful is expected  
to form a basis for potential underground 
mining studies.

In a lower gold price environment, we protected  
our balance sheet strength whilst continuing  
to improve our cost discipline.
Introduction
The continued cost discipline during the year 
was partially offset by the ongoing weak gold 
price environment in 2015, with the average 
realised gold price US$104 per ounce  
(8%) lower than the prior year period. This is 
reflected in the Acacia Group financial results 
for the year ended 31 December 2015:
• Revenue of US$868.1 million was  
US$62.1 million lower than 2014 driven  
by the 8% decrease in the average realised 
gold price to US$1,154 per ounce sold 
(US$1,258 per ounce sold in the prior year 
period), partly offset by an increase in sales 
volumes of 17,523 ounces (2%).
• Cash costs increased to US$772 per ounce 
sold from US$732 in 2014, driven by lower 
capitalisation of development costs, higher 
contracted services costs and higher general 
and administrative costs, partly offset by 
lower labour costs and lower energy and fuel. 
• AISC was broadly in line with 2014 at 
US$1,112 per ounce sold with higher 
sustaining capital expenditure and higher 
cash costs offset by the higher production 
base and lower capitalised development 
costs.
• EBITDA decreased by 31% to US$175.0 
million, mainly driven by a lower gold price, 
higher cost of sales, and the impact of 
negative foreign exchange revaluations  
of indirect tax receivables as a result of  
the weakness in the Tanzanian shilling  
of US$26.7 million. 
• Impairment charge, after tax of US$188.7 
million, relating to Buzwagi following the 
change in gold price assumption.
• As a result of the above we incurred a loss  
of US$197.1 million, compared to a profit  
of US$89.9 million in 2014.
• Adjusted net earnings of US$6.8 million, 
were 93% lower than 2014. Adjusted 
earnings per share, mainly excluding a 
US$188.7 million non-cash impairment 
adjustment, restructuring costs and prior 
year North Mara tax positions recognised, 
amounted to US1.7 cents, down from 
US24.1 cents in 2014.
• Operational cash flow of US$156.5 million 
was 46% lower than 2014, primarily as  
a result of lower revenue and increased 
operating costs, combined with unfavourable 
working capital outflows due to a build-up in 
the indirect tax receivable from the Tanzanian 
Government driven by the timing of refunds 
and a reduction in accounts payable as  
a result of timing of payments. 
The following review provides a detailed 
analysis of our consolidated results for the  
year ended 31 December 2015 and the  
main factors affecting financial performance.  
It should be read in conjunction with the 
audited consolidated financial statements  
and accompanying notes on pages 94 to 143, 
which have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted for use in the European Union (‘IFRS’).

STRATEGIC REPORT PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
Revenue
Revenue for 2015 of US$868.1 million was 
US$62.1 million lower than 2014. The 8% 
decrease in the average realised gold price from 
US$1,258 per ounce sold in 2014 to US$1,154 
in 2015 as a result of lower market prices more 
than offset the 2% increase in sales volumes 
(17,523 ounces). The increase in sales ounces 
was due to the higher production base. 
Included in total revenue is co-product revenue 
of US$35.7 million for 2015, which decreased 
by 21% from the prior year period (US$45.3 
million) due to a 23% lower realised copper 
price. The 2015 average realised copper price 
of US$2.33 per pound compared unfavourably 
to that of 2014 (US$3.01 per pound), and was 
driven by the lower market price for copper. 
Cost of sales
Cost of sales was US$734.2 million for 2015, 
representing an increase of 7% on the prior 
year period (US$688.3 million). The key aspects 
impacting the cost of sales for the year were  
a reduction in capitalisation of direct mining 
costs as discussed below combined with 
realised losses on fuel hedges and higher 
depreciation and amortisation costs as  
a result of the higher production base.
Gross direct mining costs of US$639 million  
for 2015 were 1% lower than 2014 (US$646 
million). Individual cost components comprised:
• A 23% reduction in energy and fuel 
expenses across all sites due to lower 
diesel usage and lower global fuel prices.
• An 18% reduction in labour costs, mainly as  
a result of an 18% reduction in international 
employees and an 8% reduction in national 
employees across the sites, driven by 
localisation efforts and restructuring and the 
savings associated with the local labour costs 
given the devaluation of the Tanzanian shilling. 
• A 28% increase in contracted services  
mainly as a result of contracted development 
activities at Bulyanhulu, the contracted 
development of the North Mara underground 
project combined with increased maintenance 
and repairs contractor charges at Buzwagi. 
• A 17% increase in general administration 
costs driven by warehouse related costs  
at Buzwagi and increased freight costs  
due to higher consumable usage due to the 
expanded Bulyanhulu CIL circuit operating  
for the full year. 
• A 4% increase in consumables costs mainly 
at Bulyanhulu due to increased processing 
activity with the new CIL circuit.
• A 2% increase in maintenance costs  
mainly at Bulyanhulu driven by increased 
maintenance activity, specifically relating  
to investments to improve underground 
equipment availability and to improve  
Group maintenance practices.

Total capitalised direct mining costs (117,961) (151,576)
Total capitalised direct mining costs
Capitalised development costs were 28% lower than 2014, driven by the decrease in capitalised 
waste stripping costs at Buzwagi and North Mara, partly offset by increased capitalised 
underground development costs at North Mara. The investment in inventory was US$29.7 million, 
marginally higher than in 2014 due to a build-up of ore inventory at North Mara and Buzwagi  
due to increased ore mining rates. 
Central costs
Corporate administration expenses totalled US$34.5 million for 2015, a 5% increase on 2014 
(US$32.7 million) driven by increased consulting fees for security, partly offset by lower legal  
fees and lower World Gold Council fees. The decrease in the share-based payment expense was  
a result of the weaker share price performance over 2015, specifically when compared to our 
peers and the global mining index impacting on the valuation of share-based payment liabilities  
to employees.

Exploration and evaluation costs of US$19.7 
million were incurred in 2015, 8% higher  
than the US$18.3 million spent in 2014.  
The key focus areas for 2015 were exploration 
programmes at the West Kenya Joint Venture 
project amounting to US$8.2 million, exploration 
programmes in Burkina Faso for US$6.2 million 
and extension drilling on both Reef 1 and 2  
at Bulyanhulu (US$4.3 million). 
Corporate social responsibility expenses
Corporate social responsibility costs incurred 
for 2015 amounted to US$12.9 million 
compared to the prior period of US$10.8 
million. The main projects for 2015 related  
to Village Benefit Implementation Agreements 
(‘VBIAs’) at North Mara and contributions  
to general community projects funded from  
the Acacia Maendeleo Fund, amounting to 
US$7.6 million.
Other charges
Other charges amounted to US$28.1 million, 
41% lower than 2014 (US$47.9 million).  
The main contributors were: (i) non-cash foreign 
exchange losses mainly related to indirect  
tax receivables due to the weakening of the 
Tanzanian shilling, slightly offset by gains on 
accounts payable (US$23.1 million), (ii) legal 
costs of US$5.4 million mainly relating to a 
North Mara lawsuit, (iii) retrenchment costs of 
US$9.9 million and (iv) one off legal settlement 
costs relating to a North Mara commercial 
dispute of US$4.9 million. These costs were 
partly offset by the following main contributors: 
(i) Acacia’s ongoing programme of zero cost 
collar contracts to mitigate the negative impact 
of copper, rand and fuel market volatility,  
which resulted in a combined mark-to-market 
revaluation gain of US$2.3 million (as these 
arrangements do not qualify for hedge 
accounting these unrealised gains are recorded 
through profit and loss), (ii) a gain on the  
sale of the previous corporate office in Dar  
es Salaam and other assets (US$1.3 million),  
(iii) the reversal of a deferred consideration 
liability (US$5.3 million), (iv) a reduction in 
discounting provisions related to long-term 
indirect taxes of US$5.9 million and (v) the 
de-recognition of finance lease liabilities at 
Buzwagi of US$3.9 million.
Finance expense and income
Finance expense of US$12.6 million for 2015 
was 26% higher than 2014 (US$10.0 million). 
The key components were borrowing costs 
relating to the Bulyanhulu CIL Expansion  
project (US$5.1 million) which are no longer 
capitalised, accretion expenses relating to the 
discounting of the environmental reclamation 
liability (US$3.7 million) and US$2.2 million 
relating to the servicing of the US$150 million 
undrawn revolving credit facility. 
Other costs include bank charges and interest 
on finance leases. Finance income relates 
predominantly to interest charged on non-
current receivables and interest received on 
money market funds. Refer to note 12 of the 
consolidated financial statements for details.
Impairment charges 
As a result of the continued decrease in the 
gold price during 2015, we reduced the gold 
price assumption used to calculate the 
recoverable amount of our assets as well  
as the reserve and resources estimations.  
For the reserve calculation we have used 
US$1,100 per ounce, with our carrying value 
review using the same figure for 2016, before 
rising to US$1,150 in 2017 and to US$1,200 
per ounce over the longer term. In the case  
of Buzwagi, management has considered  
the gold price assumption in light of the fact 
that the remaining mine life is the shortest, 
consisting of just over one year of mining 
followed by just over two years of processing 
stockpiles. As a result, the current spot price 
has a heavier weighting in terms of likely 
achieved price for Buzwagi with a more limited 
period to benefit from any increase in the 
market price of gold. As such, management 
considered it more appropriate for Buzwagi to 
use a flat spot based price for the remaining 
life of mine of US$1,100 per ounce. 
This required us to reassess the operating 
performance of each cash generating unit 
(‘CGU’) in order to ensure optimised returns 
and cash flows in the lower gold price 
environment. Each of the operating mines  
and the exploration business are classified  
as separate CGUs. 
The impairment review resulted in a post-tax 
impairment to the long-lived assets at Buzwagi 
of US$149.0 million and supplies inventory of 
US$39.7 million (2014: no impairment charge). 
On a gross basis, and before taking into 
account the impact of reduced future operating 
performance on deferred tax assets, the total 
impairment charge amounted to US$146.2 
million at Buzwagi. Refer to note 7 of the 
consolidated financial statements for details.
Taxation matters
The taxation charge was US$73.0 million for 
2015, compared to a charge of US$26.0 million 
in 2014. The tax charge was made up solely  
of deferred tax charges and reflects mainly  
the impact of the profitability on a year to date 
basis and the tax impact relating to the release 
of deferred tax assets as a result of reduced 
future operating performance of US$42.5 
million. The effective tax rate in 2015 amounted 
to 59% compared to 23% in 2014. 
The increase in the effective tax rate is mainly 
driven by the increase in losses for exploration 
and corporate entities for which no deferred  
tax assets are recognised as well as the 
de-recognition of a large portion of Buzwagi’s 
deferred tax asset previously recognised due  
to the impairment expense recognised in 2015.
Net loss
As a result of the factors discussed above,  
the net loss for 2015 was US$197.1 million, 
against the prior year profit of US$89.9 million. 
A lower gold price, higher cost of sales, corporate 
administration costs, impairment charges, 
finance costs, increased foreign exchange 
losses and a higher tax expense contributed  
to the variance. 
Loss per share
The loss per share for 2015 amounted to 
US48.1 cents, a decrease of US70.2 cents 
from the prior year earnings per share  
of US22.1 cents. The decrease was driven  
by the lower net profit, with no change in the 
underlying issued shares. 
Adjusted net earnings
Adjusted net earnings of US$6.8 million 
compared to US$98.7 million in 2014. The 
factors impacting the net loss in the year as 
described above have been adjusted for the 
impact of items such as impairment charges, 
restructuring costs, legal settlements and  
prior year tax positions recognised. Refer to 
page 165 for a reconciliation between net loss 
and adjusted net earnings.
Financial position
Acacia had cash and cash equivalents on hand 
of US$233.3 million as at 31 December 2015 
(US$293.9 million as at 31 December 2014). 
The Group’s cash and cash equivalents are 
with counterparties whom the Group considers 
to have an appropriate credit rating. Location  
of credit risk is determined by physical location 
of the bank branch or counterparty. Investments 
are held mainly in United States dollars, with 
cash and cash equivalents in other foreign 
currencies maintained for operational 
requirements. 
During 2013, a US$142 million facility 
(‘Facility’) was put in place to fund the bulk of 
the costs of the construction of the Bulyanhulu 
CIL Expansion project (‘Project’). The Facility  
is collateralised by the Project, and has a  
term of seven years with a spread over LIBOR 
of 250 basis points. The seven-year Facility  
is repayable in equal instalments (bi-annual)  
over the term of the Facility, after a two-year 
repayment holiday period. The interest rate  
has been fixed at 3.6% through the use of  
an interest rate swap.

STRATEGIC REPORT PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
The full facility of US$142 million was drawn  
in 2013 and the first repayment of US$14.2 
million was made in H2 2015. At 31 December 
2015, the outstanding capital balance is 
US$127.8 million (2014: US$142.0 million).
The above complements the existing undrawn 
revolving credit facility of US$150 million  
which runs until November 2018.
The net book value of property, plant and 
equipment decreased from US$1.43 billion 
in December 2014 to US$1.39 billion in 
December 2015. The main capital expenditure 
drivers have been explained in the context  
of cash flow used in investing activities below,  
and have been offset by depreciation charges 
of US$133.4 million and an impairment to 
property, plant and equipment of US$37.5 
million. Refer to note 20 to the consolidated 
financial statements for further details.
Total indirect tax receivables, net of the impact 
of discounting applied to the non-current  
portion, increased from US$108.1 million  
as at 31 December 2014 to US$110.2 million 
as at 31 December 2015. The increase was  
mainly due to a gross increase in current VAT 
receivables of approximately US$113.8 million 
and a decrease in the impact of discounting  
of US$5.9 million, partly offset by refunds  
of US$85.6 million received during 2015 and 
foreign exchange losses of US$26.7 million.  
The net deferred tax position increased from  
a liability of US$11.1 million as at 31 December 
2014 to a liability of US$84.0 million as at 
31 December 2015. This was mainly as a  
result of the reversal of the deferred tax asset  
at Buzwagi which was adjusted in line with the 
reduced future operating performance, taxable 
income in 2015 and the impact of timing 
differences.
Net assets decreased from US$2.00 billion in 
December 2014 to US$1.79 billion in December 
2015. The decrease reflects the current year 
loss of US$197.1 million and the payment of  
the final 2014 dividend of US$11.5 million and 
the interim dividend of US$5.7 million.
Cash flow from operating activities was US$156.5 million for 2015, a decrease of US$133 million, 
when compared to 2014 (US$289.5 million). The decrease relates to a lower operating profit  
due to a lower gold price and higher operating costs and unfavourable working capital outflows  
of US$4.8 million compared to inflows of US$20.2 million in 2014. The working capital outflow 
relates to a build-up in long-term ore stockpiles at Buzwagi and North Mara and a build-up in the 
indirect tax receivable from the Tanzanian Government driven by the timing of refunds.
Cash flow used in investing activities was US$181.4 million for 2015, a decrease of 29% when 
compared to 2014 (US$257.0 million), driven by lower capitalised development at Buzwagi and 
lower expansionary capital expenditure at Bulyanhulu. 
Sustaining capital
Sustaining capital expenditure includes investments in tailings and infrastructure (US$21.0 
million), investment in mobile equipment and component change-outs (US$18.8 million), 
investment in the Bulyanhulu refrigeration plant (US$12.0 million) and other sustaining capital 
expenditure across sites of US$15.6 million. During the year, capital accruals from December 
2014 of US$15.9 million were paid.
Expansionary capital
Expansionary capital expenditure consisted mainly of capitalised drilling at North Mara  
(US$1.0 million), offset by the reversal of accruals relating to the Bulyanhulu CIL Expansion  
project (US$1.0 million).

Capitalised development includes 
Bulyanhulu capitalised underground 
development (US$59.8 million), capitalised 
stripping (US$30.1 million) and underground 
development (US$18.2 million) at North 
Mara and capitalised stripping at Buzwagi 
(US$1.5 million).
Non-cash capital
Non-cash capital was US$51.9 million and 
consisted mainly of a decrease in capital 
accruals (US$15.9 million) and reclamation 
asset adjustments (US$31.9 million). The 
reclamation adjustments were driven by 
changes in estimates of future reclamation 
cash flows, partly offset by lower US risk free 
rates driving lower discount rates. 
Other investing capital
During 2015 North Mara incurred land 
purchases totalling US$6.4 million. This  
was partly offset by proceeds from the  
sale of property, plant and equipment of 
US$3.7 million and a decrease in Tanzanian 
Government receivables of US$2.0 million. 
Cash flow used in financing activities for 2015 
was an outflow of US$32.3 million, an increase 
of US$13.3 million on an outflow of US$19.0 
million in 2014. The outflow relates to payment 
of the final 2014 dividend of US$11.5 million, 
the 2015 interim dividend of US$5.7 million, 
the payment of the first capital instalment  
of the borrowings related to the Bulyanhulu  
CIL Expansion project of US$14.2 million and 
finance lease payments of US$0.8 million.
Dividend
The final 2014 dividend of US2.8 cents per 
share was paid to shareholders on 29 May 
2015 and the interim dividend of US1.4 cents 
per share was paid to shareholders on 
25 September 2015. The Board of Directors 
has recommended a final dividend for  
2015 of US2.8 cents per share, payable  
to shareholders in May 2016.
Significant judgements in applying 
accounting policies and key sources 
of estimation uncertainty
Many of the amounts included in the 
consolidated financial statements require 
management to make judgements and/or 
estimates. These judgements and estimates 
are continuously evaluated and are based on 
management’s experience and best knowledge 
of the relevant facts and circumstances, but 
actual results may differ from the amounts 
included in the consolidated financial 
statements included in this report. Information 
about such judgements and estimation is 
included in the accounting policies and notes  
to the consolidated financial statements,  
and the key areas are summarised below.
Areas of judgement and key sources of 
estimation uncertainty that have the most 
significant effect on the amounts recognised in 
the consolidated financial statements include:
• estimates of the quantities of proven  
and probable gold and copper reserves;
• estimates included within the life of mine 
planning such as the timing and viability  
of processing of long-term stockpiles;
• the capitalisation of production stripping 
costs;
• the capitalisation of exploration and 
evaluation expenditures;
• review of goodwill, tangible and intangible 
assets’ carrying value, the determination of 
whether a trigger for an impairment review 
exists, whether these assets are impaired 
and the measurement of impairment 
charges or reversals;
• the estimated fair values of cash generating 
units for impairment tests, including 
estimates of future costs to produce proven 
and probable reserves, future commodity 
prices, foreign exchange rates and discount 
rates;
• the estimated useful lives of tangible and 
long-lived assets and the measurement  
of depreciation expense;
• property, plant and equipment held under 
finance leases; 
• recognition of a provision for environmental 
rehabilitation and the estimation of  
the rehabilitation costs and timing of 
expenditure;
• whether to recognise a liability for loss 
contingencies and the amount of any such 
provision;
• whether to recognise a provision for 
accounts receivable, and in particular the 
indirect tax receivables from the Tanzanian 
Government, a provision for obsolescence 
on consumables inventory and the impact  
of discounting the non-current element  
of the indirect tax receivable;
• recognition of deferred income tax assets, 
amounts recorded for uncertain tax 
positions, the measurement of income tax 
expense and indirect taxes;
• determination of the cost incurred in the 
productive process of ore stockpiles, gold in 
process, gold doré/bullion and concentrate, 
as well as the associated net realisable 
value and the split between the long-term 
and short-term portions;
• determination of fair value of derivative 
instruments; and
• determination of fair value of share options 
and cash-settled share-based payments.
Going concern statement 
Acacia Group’s business activities, together with 
factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position, are set out in the 
operational and financial review sections of this 
report. The financial position of Acacia Group,  
its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing 
facilities are described in the preceding 
paragraphs of this financial review. 
At 31 December 2015, the Group had cash  
and cash equivalents of US$233.3 million with 
a further US$150 million available under the 
undrawn revolving credit facility which remains 
in place until November 2018. Total borrowings 
at the end of the period amounted to US$127.8 
million, of which US$28.4 million will be paid  
in 2016.
Included in other current assets are amounts 
due to the Group relating to indirect taxes  
of US$57.6 million which are expected to be 
received within 12 months, but these will be 
offset to an extent by new claims submitted for 
input taxes incurred during 2016. The refunds 
remain dependent on processing and payments 
of refunds by the Government of Tanzania. 
In assessing Acacia Group’s going concern 
status the Directors have taken into account 
the above factors, including the financial 
position of Acacia Group and in particular its 
significant cash position, the current gold and 
copper price and market expectations for the 
same in the medium term, and Acacia Group’s 
capital expenditure and financing plans. After 
making appropriate enquiries, the Directors 
consider that it is appropriate to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements.

Acacia’s direct economic contribution is made  
up of the economic value we add by paying 
our employees, Governments, suppliers, 
shareholders, contractors and communities. 
However, our true economic contribution is far 
greater once the wider effects of our presence 
are considered. These include the indirect 
effects of people spending their wages, 
Governments distributing tax and royalty 
revenues, and neighbouring communities using 
the infrastructure developed for our operations. 
Our direct economic contribution in 2015 was  
US$889 million compared to US$920 million  
in 2014.
We contribute to the economic growth of our host communities, 
regions and countries to assist the progression of sustainable  
socio-economic development.
The distribution of Acacia’s taxes includes 
royalties, indirect taxes (VAT payable on 
domestic goods and fuel levies), payroll taxes 
(inclusive of social security payments and other 
taxes such as withholding taxes), stamp duties 
and environmental levies. Geographically,  
the majority of our taxes are paid in Tanzania, 
being the location of our operating mines.  
Our net taxation contribution was US$109 million 
in 2015, compared to US$121 million in 2014, 
as a result of the reduction in our workforce 
reducing payroll taxes.

SUSTAINABILITY REVIEW CONTINUED
Community relations
We continued to make good progress across  
all of our community relations initiatives during 
the year, with our efforts being recognised  
in Tanzania as North Mara emerged as the 
overall CSRE Champion in the Presidential CSRE 
awards, as well as the winner in the large mining 
companies category. Buzwagi also emerged  
as the winner in the community infrastructure 
category.
During the year we spent US$12.9m on a range 
of community-related initiatives, primarily through 
the Acacia Maendeleo Fund. These included:
• upgrading of the Bwirege Secondary School 
near North Mara;
• upgrading the Bugarama Health Centre  
near Bulyanhulu; and
• revamping of Nyangoto Water pipeline  
near North Mara.
We also launched two initiatives in 2015 to  
build local community cohesion. We championed 
the Mahusioano sports tournament involving 
teams from our surrounding communities 
across a range of sports and formed a strategic 
partnership with Sunderland Football Club for 
grassroots football coaching and development 
for youths in the communities around our mines. 
In addition, we progressed our planning for  
the development of an artisanal and small- 
scale mining project, in collaboration with  
the World Bank, AngloGold Ashanti and the 
Tanzanian Ministry of Energy and Minerals. 
Initial recommendations of this project  
include establishing a processing centre; it is 
anticipated that this will lead to improved gold 
production, increasing earnings for the miners, 
whilst minimising the health and environmental 
impacts associated with the current artisanal 
gold recovery processes.
In 2015, we continued our efforts to publicise 
the availability of the Grievance Mechanism  
at all the sites and encouraged the reporting  
of any grievances through this Mechanism.  
As a result, we have seen an increase in the 
registration of some categories of grievances, 
including human rights grievances, against the 
2014 reporting period, with a total of 248 new 
grievances lodged during the year compared  
to 77 new grievances in 2014. The majority  
of these grievances are at North Mara and 
relate to land issues at North Mara, where 
speculative investments have delayed the  
land compensation/resettlement programmes  
as well as intruder related human rights related 
grievances. Whilst our assessment is that a 
number of these grievances are not justified, 
we are encouraged by the increased usage of 
the Grievance Mechanism which demonstrates 
that this Mechanism is accessible and seen  
as a credible option by members of the 
communities in which we operate.  
Acacia Maendeleo Fund
We established the Acacia Maendeleo 
Fund in 2011 as part of our commitment 
to promoting sustainable development  
in the communities in which we operate. 
Since that time we have invested  
US$35.0 million into a range of areas 
including education, health, water, 
infrastructure and livelihoods.

44 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 Ending child labour in artisanal  
and small-scale mining
In May 2015, Acacia and Search for Common 
Ground (‘SFCG’) co-funded a six-month 
project aligned with Acacia’s initiative to  
end children in mining, something which 
remains prevalent in Tanzanian rural mining 
areas. Child labour in mining is classified by 
the International Labour Organization (‘ILO’)  
as the worst form of child labour. 
The project involved members of the  
Unity Peace Club, a youth group originally  
set up by SFCG with funding from Acacia  
to transform the inter-clan conflicts in the  
surrounding area. Many of the Unity Peace 
Club students worked at artisanal and 
small-scale sites on weekends and holidays, 
and knew other children who were working  
on these sites full-time. 
Eighty of the Unity Peace Club students  
were selected to participate in the  
project to research the reason for children  
in mining, and their reports would be  
used as a basis for adults taking action. 
They decided to call themselves The  
Voice of North Mara Youth. 
In June 2015, they were trained by SFCG 
media experts and Tanzanian journalists  
on data collection and how to write and 
produce articles, presentations, social  
media entries and radio programmes. 
Equipped with recorders, cameras and 
notepads, the students interviewed men  
and women, old and young, workers on  
mine sites and others who had never set  
foot there. They then held presentations  
with the results of their interviews for village 
leaders and community members, asking  
for their leaders to take action.
As a result, a valuable discussion began  
on the importance of education and the 
need to end all child labour, not just in 
mining. With support from SFCG, child 
protection committees were created in  
each village around North Mara, and the 
community leaders began finding strategies 
to identify children in their community  
who were out of school, and mapping out 
the reasons why. They also committed to 
fundraising for school fees as a community, 
and supporting each other to keep the 
children in school.
During the year, we developed Acacia’s  
new “Sustainable Communities” strategy.  
This new ambitious strategy advances  
beyond traditional models of corporate social 
responsibility as it is anchored on the concept  
of creating “shared value” within the Acacia 
business and the communities in which we  
live and work. Shared value strategies engage 
the scale and innovation of companies such  
as Acacia to advance social progress. The  
focus is on creating value, developing people’s 
capabilities and enhancing resilience both within 
the Acacia business and the communities in 
which we live and work.
Our “Sustainable Communities” strategy  
will help to contribute to more prosperous 
communities and greater alignment of interests 
between the community and Acacia, and will 
focus on advancing three connected areas:
• A thriving local economy: We will invest  
to provide training and support to promote 
local business development and help  
to build an enterprising economy that  
can create employment opportunities  
for local people and reduce dependency  
on our operations. 
• Strategic social infrastructure: We will  
invest in strategic social infrastructure  
in order to enhance communities’ ability  
to generate wealth. 
• Community cohesion: We will invest in 
initiatives to enhance the social capital 
between the communities near our 
operations and the mines, with a focus  
on sport, music and culture. 
We will start to implement the new strategy  
in 2016, working in partnership with others 
including NGOs, social enterprises and 
Governments to implement our strategy.  
We will also align our commitments to 
“Sustainable Communities” with national 
government development ambitions,  
and the new UN international Sustainable 
Development Goals.

SUSTAINABILITY REVIEW CONTINUED
Employees
We continued to make noticeable progress 
across a variety of employee initiatives 
throughout 2015, whilst maintaining 
acceptable levels across core employee 
metrics. Annual turnover across our 
operations was approximately 27.8%, a 
considerable increase on 2014 (23%) due 
to ongoing organisational and labour reviews 
across all the mine sites and offices which 
have resulted in a significant right-sizing 
of the workforce. We continued to progress 
our commitment to the localisation of our 
workforce throughout 2015, with annual 
national employment levels amounting to 
approximately 96% of our total workforce, 
an increase on 2014 levels (94%).
We continued to invest in training and 
development programmes throughout 
the year, notably through the continuation 
of Tufanikiwe Pamoja, our cultural 
transformation programme, the WeCare 
programme, our enhanced health and 
safety training programme, and a number 
of additional business improvement and 
project management programmes. We  
also maintained our focus on longer-term 
training programmes, such as our Rainbow 
leadership training programme for first line 
leaders which is ready for roll out in 2016. 
51 apprentices graduated from the Integrated 
Mining Technical Training (‘IMTT’) programme.
Approximately 9% of our overall workforce 
is comprised of women, something which 
is reflective of gender diversity generally 
within the mining industry. Of this, female 
representation across our management 
structures equalled approximately 10%  
at Board level and 17% at senior leadership 
level. All levels are broadly consistent with 
female representation levels in 2014.
Health and safety
Group-wide Total Reportable Injury Frequency 
Rate (‘TRIFR’) was 0.68 for 2015 compared  
to 0.86 in 2014, a 21% improvement. A key 
driver behind the commendable improvement 
was the full implementation of the WeCare 
programme (‘Tunajali’). This behavioural safety 
programme is now embedded as part of  
the safety culture at each of the mine sites  
and is expected to contribute, together with 
other health and safety initiatives, to further 
improvements in Acacia’s safety and health 
performance. 
Over the past year we have continued to evolve 
our critical risk control standards covering  
the top 11 risks that Acacia personnel are 
exposed to. As part of this we have focused  
on those risks at each mine site where the 
majority of the High Potential Incidents occur. 
These are regarding light vehicles, mobile 
equipment, ground control, explosives, working 
at height and lifting operations. As a result,  
and to drive further improvement in safety 
performance, we will implement and audit 
updated standards covering these risks  
during 2016.
We also progressed a number of initiatives 
within an occupational health and safety 
context to increase the effectiveness of  
existing occupational health programmes and 
continued to progress health assessments, 
including malaria control assessments,  
for our employees and wider community base. 
This is incorporated into an updated Acacia 
Occupational Health and Safety Management 
System which will be rolled out in 2016.

Environment
Environmental performance for 2015 was 
good overall, with the Group successfully 
completing the majority of key initiatives 
and priorities for the year. Key achievements 
include the environmental approval for Gokona 
Underground mining at North Mara mine, 
agreement with the Ministry of Energy and 
Minerals as regards the requirement to post 
rehabilitation bonds for each of the mine sites, 
implementation of Acacia’s environmental 
management system in line with the ISO14001 
requirements and enhancement of the mine 
site environmental team capabilities through 
training to better identify and manage the 
identified environmental risks at our mines.  
We continue to be fully ICMI compliant at  
North Mara and Buzwagi. Bulyanhulu is in  
the process of implementing an action plan  
to regain full ICMI certification in order to 
address historical WAD cyanide inconsistencies 
within the TSF which occurred as a result of  
the commissioning of the new carbon-in leach 
circuit. We expect to complete this programme 
in 2016 at which point we will re-apply for 
certification.
Acacia’s GHG emissions continued to be 
impacted by interruptions to the electricity 
supply in Tanzania and our reliance on  
self-generation of power. Overall, 2015 GHG 
emissions equalled 370,092 tonnes of CO
2
,  
in line with 2014 levels. However, our energy 
usage, assessed on the basis of mega joules  
of energy used per tonne of ore milled, 
decreased by 12% when compared to  
2014 usage levels as a result of increased 
throughput at Bulyanhulu. Further information  
on Group GHG emissions is provided on  
page 84.
Our water usage in 2015 decreased by 4% as  
a result of increased throughput at Bulyanhulu, 
partially offset by marginally increased  
water usage. We will look to enhance water 
management practices further in 2016 as part 
of overall Group water management practices.
Security and human rights
The positive progress made in security in 
2014 continued into 2015. This was based upon 
a five-pronged security strategy: understanding 
our operating environment; striving for 
operational excellence; people – valuing and 
helping to develop ourselves and others; 
improving our reputation and engagement with 
stakeholders; and ensuring sufficient resources 
are in place to deliver on the strategy. At  
North Mara, this strategy has resulted in an 
improvement in day to day operational security 
and a reduction in security related fatalities  
and injuries. Furthermore, the integration of 
security operations with our community relations  
efforts has had a positive effect, resulting  
in a reduction in confrontations. Across the 
Company, improvements have been made to  
the information and investigation functions with 
a focus on improving policies and procedures  
to ensure meaningful oversight and compliance 
measures are in place. This will continue to  
be an area of focus through 2016 to ensure 
transparency and compliance. 
We completed an annual assessment of our 
performance against a number of international 
standards and principles, including the 
Voluntary Principles on Security and Human 
Rights and use of force protocols. The 
outcome of these reviews was encouraging, 
showing consistent levels of improvement 
across all operations. A review of the 
Company-wide Grievance Mechanism was 
also conducted, resulting in revisions to 
procedures and processes to embed learnings 
from prior years. We increased specialist 
staffing in this area at North Mara over the 
course of 2015 in order to increase capacity 
and expedite the resolution of grievances.  
An overview of the grievances lodged in 2015 
utilising the Company Grievance Mechanism 
is set out on page 44.
We affirmed our commitment to the activities  
of Search for Common Ground (‘SFCG’), 
an international NGO focused on conflict 
transformation and building sustainable  
peace through dialogue, media and community 
engagement. Search for Common Ground 
conducted over 180 sessions with more than 
16,000 stakeholders in the communities 
around Buzwagi, Bulyanhulu and North Mara, 
most of them large-scale open-air meetings 
together with government, civil society and 
village leaders. Land issues, environmental 
impact and mine intrusion were some of the 
topics addressed. 
According to SFCG, perception surveys 
and focal group discussions with more than 
1,000 community members in 2015 have 
shown remarkable improvements to the 
relationship between the community and 
the mines, especially in North Mara. SFCG 
provided training to almost 1,000 members 
of Tanzanian Police units based in the vicinity 
of our operations on the Voluntary Principles 
on Security and Human Rights, which teaches 
international standards in the use of force 
and firearms, procedures for arrest and 
detention, and prevention of sexual 
harassment. 
ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 47
STRATEGIC REPORT PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION SUMMARY OF THE BOARD’S WORK IN 2015
The Board focused on the following areas in 2015:
Conducting externally facilitated performance evaluations
Conducting risk management governance and framework reviews  
in light of enhanced UK Corporate Governance requirements
Reviewing processes and procedures and other factors relevant  
to its assessment of viability and going concern in light of new  
UK Corporate Governance requirements
Overseeing further optimisation and cost control reviews,  
including organisational structure reviews
Overseeing operational, financial and exploration project performance
 
As regards asset optimisation and cost control reviews, the Board 
continued to oversee management plans as regards life of mine planning 
for all of Acacia’s operations.
THE BOARD’S PLAN FOR 2016 
The Board’s focus areas for 2016 include:
Continuing focus on risk management and internal controls
Conducting additional strategy and risk reviews 
Overseeing operational, financial and exploration  
project performance 
Monitoring ongoing cost control and optimisation programme 
implementation
Reviewing growth opportunities
 
The makeup of the Board’s focus areas for 2016 will not significantly 
change from 2015 and still comprises key monitoring activities as 
regards Company performance across core business areas (financial, 
operational and exploration) and further strategic and risk reviews  
to support longer-term growth objectives. Furthermore, the focus areas 
reflect any suggestions made as a result of the 2015 performance 
evaluation, details of which are available on page 56. 
These were conducted in light of wider market 
factors that placed operational and financial 
constraints on our industry throughout the  
year. In addition, this year we undertook various 
governance processes, procedures and 
systems reviews, as necessary, to support  
the enhanced statements we have made in  
this Annual Report in the context of internal 
control and risk management assessment 
and monitoring, ongoing business viability and 
going concern. Further details regarding these 
assessments and the relevant statements can 
be found on pages 23, 41 and 54. 
Lastly, and again in line with Board commitments 
made in the 2014 Annual Report, this year 
we engaged Lintstock Limited (‘Lintstock’), 
to undertake our first externally-facilitated 
performance evaluation. This comprised an 
assessment of the Board as a whole, each 
of its Committees and individual Directors 
(including myself). The evaluation was 
conducted via a two-stage process, comprising 
the completion of tailored questionnaires  
and participation in individual interviews  
by each Director. The findings were presented 
to, and collectively considered by, all Directors. 
Overall, the Board concluded it had operated 
effectively throughout the reporting period. 
Dear shareholders, 
In 2015 we continued to review our governance 
model to ensure we maintain appropriate 
alignment with best practice requirements  
as well as Acacia’s operational objectives  
in order to support management and our 
business model. 
In line with areas identified in last year’s 
governance report, in 2015 we continued to 
perform key oversight and monitoring activities 
in the context of operational and financial 
performance reviews, with a particular focus 
on supporting management in the execution of 
further cost control and asset optimisation reviews. 
Nevertheless, and as should be expected 
from any effective evaluation process, 
opportunities for improvement and specific 
priorities were identified and these have  
been taken into account when structuring  
our focus areas for 2016. Among other actions,  
the Board agreed it should continue its visits 
to major operations in order to maintain 
appropriate knowledge of the business, to 
ensure it remains visible to the operations 
and has access to a broad group of executives 
and employees. It also agreed to consider 
revising the time scheduled for some meetings, 
to review the allocation of time to core topics 
and, in particular, to review opportunities to 
schedule additional strategy and risk sessions.
Further details as to the scope of the 
evaluation and its recommendations are 
provided on page 56.

52 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
Board composition
As at 31 December 2015, the Board comprised a Non-Executive 
Chairman, one Executive Director and eight Non-Executive Directors,  
of whom seven were independent.
Board changes during 2015
There were no new Board appointments during the reporting period.
Retirement and re-election
In line with the requirements for annual re-election under the  
UK Corporate Governance Code, save for Graham Clow all other 
Directors will offer themselves for re-election at the forthcoming AGM. 
The Board determines all of these Directors to be eligible for re-election. 
Graham Clow will step down from the Board at the forthcoming AGM.
Board leadership
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
In line with best practice, the roles of Chief Executive Officer and 
Chairman, and their related responsibilities, are separated. The divisions 
of responsibility and the specifications of each role are set out in  
writing and reviewed periodically as part of annual corporate governance 
reviews. Responsibilities are divided so as to ensure that the Chairman 
remains principally responsible for the leadership of the Board and 
ensuring that the Board plays a full and constructive part in the 
development and determination of the Company’s strategy and  
overall commercial objectives. The Chief Executive Officer is primarily 
responsible for all executive management matters affecting Acacia  
and is principally responsible for running the Company’s business.  
All members of the ELT report directly to him.
Senior Independent Director
Mr Tomsett is Acacia’s Senior Independent Director (‘SID’). The 
responsibilities and duties of the SID are determined in accordance with 
the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code. In particular, 
the SID is required to:
• act as a sounding board for the Chairman;
• act as an intermediary for other Directors, when necessary;
• ensure that an annual appraisal of the Chairman is conducted by the 
Non-Executive Directors, without the Chairman present; and
• be available to shareholders for discussion purposes, in cases where 
contact between such shareholders and the Chairman and/or CEO 
has been ineffective or is otherwise inappropriate.
Matters reserved
There is a schedule of matters that the Board has specifically reserved 
for its decision. This schedule was reviewed during the year and includes 
matters such as setting the Group’s strategic aims and objectives, 
approving significant contractual commitments (including merger and 
acquisition activity), approving capital-raising, approving changes to the 
Group’s share capital and corporate structure, approving financial reports 
and ensuring maintenance of a sound system of internal control and  
risk management.
Delegation of authority
The Board has delegated responsibility for certain matters to four 
Committees: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee,  
the EHS&S Committee and the Nomination & Governance Committee. 
The membership, chairmanship and activities of each of these 
Committees are set out in each Committee report on pages 58 to 62  
and as part of the Remuneration Report.
Board effectiveness
Board meetings and attendance
Board decisions are predominantly made by achieving a consensus at 
Board meetings. In exceptional circumstances, decisions may be taken 
by the majority of Board members. Questions arising at any meeting  
are determined by a majority of votes. In the case of an equality of  
votes, Acacia’s Articles of Association do not provide the Chairman with 
a second or casting vote. All Directors are required to take decisions 
objectively and in the best interests of the Company. As part of their 
duties as Directors, Non-Executive Directors are expected to apply 
independent judgement to contribute to issues of strategy and 
performance and to scrutinise the performance of management.
The Board is scheduled to meet at least four times a year, and at such 
other times as are necessary to discharge its duties. The Board met  
a total of five times in 2015. All meetings were held in person. Details  
of individual attendance are provided in the table overleaf. 
Board briefings and development
The Board receives monthly management reports and quarterly reports 
outlining all material operational, financial and strategic developments. 
These ensure that Board members remain properly briefed on the 
performance and financial position of the Group on a continuous  
basis. Board and Committee papers are circulated prior to all meetings 
to allow Directors to be briefed in advance of discussions. Board 
meetings include quarterly operational, financial and exploration project 
performance reviews to ensure that, in addition to specific scheduled 
matters and any other business, core business performance is 
monitored and assessed on a continuous basis. In addition to scheduled 
Board meetings, all Directors have access to members of the Executive 
Leadership Team and to whatever further information they need to 
perform their duties and to satisfy their responsibilities. Acacia’s 
independent Non-Executive Directors and Committee Chairmen meet 
with members of the Executive Leadership Team to receive more 
in-depth briefings on Board and Committee matters whenever required  
or requested. In addition, all Directors continue to have free access  
to visit operations outside of scheduled Board arrangements and  
each Director is expected to participate in at least one operational  
site visit per year. Board training and development needs are reviewed  
on an ongoing basis. Directors may take independent professional 
advice, as necessary, at the Company’s expense in the furtherance  
of their duties. In addition to this, each Board Committee is entitled  
to seek independent professional advice at the Company’s expense, 
where necessary, to assist or guide the Committee in the performance  
of its functions.

STRATEGIC REPORT PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT CONTINUED
Internal control
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control  
and risk management and for reviewing its effectiveness. In line with  
this responsibility, the Board has established ongoing processes and 
systems for identifying, evaluating and managing principal risks that  
the Group faces, which have been in place throughout the year and  
up to the date of approval of the Annual Report. 
The Board principally bases its monitoring and review of the 
effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems on its 
review of management reports and assessments, and on the quarterly 
reports it receives on the status of Acacia’s risk management and 
internal control environment. This is supported by the risk profile  
reviews that Acacia’s internal audit function carries out to help the  
Board identify and manage the most significant risks and events that 
could affect the Company’s operations, financials and performance  
on an ongoing basis. Where necessary, the Board is assisted by its 
Committees in reviewing internal systems and controls, particularly the 
Audit Committee, which is responsible for reviewing the effectiveness  
of the Group’s internal control and risk management framework systems, 
as components of the Company’s internal control framework. 
In compliance with its obligations, the Board conducted a review of the 
effectiveness of the Company’s risk management and internal control 
systems for the reporting period with the assistance of Deloitte LLP.  
This review took into account the enhanced monitoring, review and 
assessment requirements introduced by the 2014 edition of the  
UK Corporate Governance Code and the FRC’s Guidance on Risk 
Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business 
Reporting that has been introduced to replace the Turnbull Guidance  
for financial reporting periods commencing on or after 1 October 2014.
The review also covered a review of all material controls, including 
financial, operational and compliance controls and considered all 
significant aspects of internal control for the reporting period. During  
the course of the review the Board did not identify or hear of any  
failings or weaknesses that it determined to be material. Therefore  
a confirmation of any necessary actions undertaken is not required.
Additional information regarding the internal control and risk 
management process specifically in relation to the financial reporting 
process and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  
is provided as part of the Audit Committee report and the notes to  
the consolidated financial statements.
Further detail as regards the governance structure used for Acacia’s 
approach to risk management and the processes and procedures  
used in the context of risk management is provided on pages 22 to 23  
of this Annual Report. The Company’s viability statement is also provided 
in this context on page 23.

54 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 Majority shareholder
Barrick is the Group majority shareholder, holding approximately 64% of 
Acacia’s issued shares as at the date of this report. Acacia’s relationship 
with Barrick is governed by the terms of a Relationship Agreement, the 
principal purpose of which is to ensure that the Acacia Group is capable 
of carrying on its business independently of the Barrick Group and that 
any transactions and relationships with the Barrick Group are conducted 
at arm’s length and on normal commercial terms. The Relationship 
Agreement will continue for so long as Acacia is listed on the London 
Stock Exchange and Barrick owns or controls at least 15% of Acacia’s 
issued share capital or voting rights.
The Relationship Agreement provides Barrick with certain Director 
appointment rights in line with a sliding scale, structured as follows:
Barrick percentage shareholding Barrick Director appointment rights
40% or more The higher of three Non-Executive 
Directors and the maximum that may 
be appointed under the UK Corporate 
Governance Code
25% up to 40% The higher of two Non-Executive 
Directors and one less than the 
maximum number of Non-Executive 
Directors that may be appointed 
under the UK Corporate  
Governance Code
15% up to 25% The higher of one Non-Executive 
Director and two less than the 
maximum number of Non-Executive 
Directors that may be appointed 
under the UK Corporate  
Governance Code
In addition to Director appointment rights, and subject to certain 
exceptions, as part of the terms of the Relationship Agreement, Barrick 
has undertaken that members of the Barrick Group will not carry on the 
exploration of gold or silver in Africa or acquire, whether through an asset 
purchase or the purchase of securities, a gold or silver mining business 
in Africa that competes with Acacia without giving Acacia the option to 
exercise certain rights of first refusal for so long as Barrick holds 30%  
or more of the issued share capital or voting rights of Acacia. Acacia has 
given a reciprocal non-compete commitment to Barrick in this regard.
Acacia entered into the Relationship Agreement at the time of its  
initial public offering in 2010. It was amended in 2014 to ensure full 
compliance with the independence requirements introduced to the 
Listing Rules, which took effect in November 2014. Following these 
amendments the Relationship Agreement expressly provides that:
(i)  any and all transactions with Barrick (or its associates) shall be 
conducted at arm’s length and on normal commercial terms;
(ii)  neither Barrick, nor any of its associates, will take any action that  
will prevent Acacia from complying with its obligations under the 
Listing Rules; and
(iii)  neither Barrick, nor any of its associates, will propose or procure the 
proposal of a shareholder resolution which is intended or appears to 
be intended to circumvent the proper application of the Listing Rules.
In addition, the Listing Rules now require premium listed companies with 
controlling shareholders to provide a confirmation in their annual reports 
that all of the independence provisions contained in their relationship 
agreements have been complied with. In line with this requirement,  
the Board has assessed Barrick and Acacia’s compliance with the 
Relationship Agreement’s independence requirements, as amended, and 
has assessed compliance with these requirements, in line with practices 
employed in any event since the IPO. As such, the Board can confirm  
that Acacia has complied with the independence requirements stated 
above since their adoption and, so far as the Board is aware, Barrick  
and its associates have also complied with these requirements. In this 
regard, all members of the Board support the giving of this statement 
and no independent Non-Executive Director has raised any objections  
in this regard.
Dialogue with the investment community 
Acacia has a designated investor relations team which acts as the 
primary point of contact with the investment community and is 
responsible for maintaining Acacia’s ongoing relations with investors and 
shareholders. Acacia conducts regular investor meetings and telephone 
calls with the investment community to discuss results, and participates 
in mining conferences to meet with current and prospective investors.  
In addition to its annual and half-year reports, Acacia publishes quarterly 
reports to the market, which provide further information on production 
and financial results, and updates on its business and operations. 
Acacia’s investor relations team also arrange operational site tours  
for members of the analyst community, as and when appropriate.
AGM
Acacia’s 2016 AGM will be held on 21 April 2016 at 14.00 (UK time).  
The business of the meeting will be conducted in accordance with 
Companies Act 2006 requirements and standards promoted by  
the UK Corporate Governance Code. The Chairman of the Board and  
the Chairmen of the Audit, Compensation, EHS&S and Nomination  
& Governance Committees will be available to answer questions put  
to them by shareholders at the meeting. The AGM Notice is included  
in the documentation that has been provided with this Annual Report  
and is also available on the Company’s website. In accordance with  
best practice, the notice has been sent to shareholders at least  
20 business days prior to the date of the meeting.
Conflicts of interest
Mr Dushnisky and Mr Galbraith are nominee Directors appointed by 
Barrick. These individuals hold a number of cross directorships with 
members of the Barrick Group, which give rise to situations in which 
these Directors could have a direct or indirect interest that conflicts,  
or possibly may conflict, with those of Acacia. In addition, as a result  
of their employment within the Barrick Group, these individuals also  
hold interests under Barrick’s restricted stock unit plan and other 
employee incentive plans.
ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 55
STRATEGIC REPORT PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT CONTINUED
The Companies Act 2006 requires directors to avoid situations where 
they have, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or  
may possibly conflict, with company interests. However, the Act does 
allow directors of public companies to authorise conflicts and potential 
conflicts of interest where a company’s articles of association contain  
a provision to that effect. Acacia’s Articles of Association contain such 
provision and a procedure for this. In accordance with this procedure,  
the conflicts outlined above were declared and authorised by the Board.
The monitoring and, if appropriate, authorisation of any actual or 
potential conflict of interest is an ongoing process. Directors are  
required to notify the Company of any material changes in positions  
or situations that have already been considered and any new situations. 
 In addition, Directors are required to declare interests in potential  
or actual transactions and are required to abstain from voting on such 
transactions, subject to permitted exceptions. If a question arises  
as to whether any interest of a Director prevents him or her from voting 
or being counted in a quorum in the context of a potential or actual 
transaction, the matter is referred to the Chairman, whose findings  
are final and conclusive. In the context of questions relating to any such 
conflict of the Chairman, the question may ultimately be decided by a 
resolution of the other Directors. The Board reviews conflicts of interest 
on a periodic basis and maintains a record of all declared conflicts.
Specifically as regards nominee Directors appointed by Barrick, the 
Relationship Agreement provides that if any transaction or arrangement 
arises directly between a member of the Barrick Group and a member  
of the Acacia Group and does or could, in the opinion of a majority of 
Directors (excluding any Director(s) appointed by Barrick), give rise to a 
conflict of interest between Acacia and any Director appointed by Barrick, 
any such matter must be approved and authorised at a duly convened 
Board meeting or in writing by a majority of Directors (excluding any 
Director(s) appointed by Barrick) prior to the Company taking further 
action in relation to such matter. Save for the matters set out above,  
no other conflicts of interest were disclosed to the Board during the 
reporting period.
Performance evaluation
The Board believes that annual evaluations are helpful and provide a 
valuable opportunity for continuous improvement. In 2015, we engaged 
Lintstock to undertake our first externally-facilitated performance 
evaluation of the Board, its Committees and individual Directors 
(including the Chairman). 
The first stage of the review involved Lintstock engaging with the 
Chairman and the Company secretariat to set the context for the 
evaluation, and to tailor the surveys used to the Company’s specific 
circumstances. All Board members were requested to complete an online 
survey addressing the performance of the Board and its Committees,  
the Chairman and individual Directors. Survey topics covered a range  
of areas including composition, skills, knowledge and experience of  
the Board, the respective roles and responsibilities of the Non-Executive 
and Executive Directors, quality of strategic and risk debate, the 
effectiveness of decision making and interactions with management. 
Interviews were then conducted with members of the Board by  
two partners from Lintstock to expand upon the issues raised in  
the questionnaires. The anonymity of all respondents was ensured 
throughout the process in order to promote the open and frank  
exchange of views.
Lintstock subsequently produced a report which considered the  
following areas of Board performance:
• The size and composition of the Board and the key changes that 
ought to be made over the next 3–5 years to match the Company’s 
strategic goals.
• Board members’ understanding of Acacia’s operations and the 
environment and market in which the Company operates. 
• The use of time at meetings, the quality of management 
presentations and Board materials generally. 
• The induction and ongoing training of Board members.
• The involvement of the Board in determining Acacia’s strategic 
direction, Board performance in testing and developing strategy  
and reviewing progress against strategic pillars. 
• The Board’s oversight of sustainability performance. 
• The Board’s focus on risk and the oversight of culture and behaviours 
throughout the organisation.
The findings were presented to, and collectively considered by, all 
Directors. Overall, the Board concluded that it had operated effectively 
throughout the reporting period. Nevertheless, opportunities for 
improvement and specific priorities were identified and these have been 
taken into account when structuring our focus areas for 2016. Among 
other things, the Board agreed that it should continue with its visits  
to major operations in order to maintain appropriate knowledge of the 
business and to ensure that it remains visible to the operations and has 
access to a broad group of executives and employees. It also agreed  
to consider revising the amount of time scheduled for some meetings, 
and to review the allocation of time to core topics and, in particular, to 
review opportunities to schedule additional strategy and risk sessions.
As regards Committee reviews, as noted above the effectiveness of  
each Board Committee was also assessed through this exercise and  
an individual Committee report produced in each case. The reports  
and recommendations have been reviewed and discussed by each 
Committee and some minor improvement opportunities identified. 
It is envisaged that the 2016 Board and Board Committee performance 
evaluation, whether conducted internally or externally facilitated, will  
be designed to build upon learnings gained this year to ensure that  
the recommendations agreed are implemented and that year-on-year 
progress is measured.
56 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 Corporate governance compliance
For the year under review, as a UK company with a premium listing on  
the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange, Acacia is required to 
make certain statements regarding the way it is governed, as required  
by the 2014 edition UK Corporate Governance Code, which is available  
at www.frc.org.uk. Accordingly, this report explains how Acacia has applied 
the Main Principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code during 2015.
Generally, Acacia seeks to comply with all relevant provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code wherever possible and for the reporting year 
it is the Board’s view that Acacia has complied with all such provisions, 
save for the following:
• Mr Dushnisky was not independent on appointment as Chairman  
and an external search consultancy was not used in connection  
with his appointment. Given Mr Dushnisky’s experience within the 
mining sector, his skill set and his familiarity with the operating and 
geographical environment in which the Company’s assets are located, 
the Board believes his appointment to be in the best interests of the 
Company irrespective of this (Provisions A.3.1 and B.2.4).
• Acacia has not adopted a formal diversity policy. In this regard 
however, we ensure that all recruitment is conducted on the basis 
that we hire the best candidate for all positions, at all levels, including 
Board and senior management positions, irrespective of gender or 
race (Provision B.2.4).
Lastly, the UK Corporate Governance Code requires that the Board 
provides a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of Acacia’s 
position and prospects in its external reporting. Accordingly, the 
Directors were responsible for the preparation and approval of this 
Annual Report and consider the Annual Report and Accounts for 2015, 
taken as a whole, to be fair, balanced and understandable and believe 
that it provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
Acacia’s position and performance, business model and strategy.
Acacia’s external auditors have reviewed those parts of this statement, 
which they are required to review under the Listing Rules. In addition  
to compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, as part of 
commitments given in connection with Acacia’s secondary listing on the 
Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange, the Board has undertaken to comply 
with the Corporate Governance Guidelines issued by the Tanzanian 
Capital Markets and Securities Authority to the extent that these 
requirements are equivalent to applicable UK corporate governance 
standards. In the case of any conflict between the two, the requirements 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code prevail.

Introduction
I am the Chairman of the Committee and have over 25 years of 
financial and management experience within the mining industry.  
I am a CPA, CA, CGA (Canada), and together these provide me  
with the relevant financial experience required for my position under 
applicable corporate governance standards. Rachel English and  
Peter Tomsett act as the other members of the Committee. Details  
of members’ experience and qualifications are provided on pages 50 
to 51 as part of the Board of Directors’ biographies. Our terms of 
reference require us to meet at least four times a year, and in 2015 
we met five times. The Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, 
the Chief Compliance Officer, the Head of Risk and Internal Audit, 
members of the Company’s finance function and the external auditors 
also attend Committee meetings on a regular basis by invitation.  
We also hold individual meetings with Acacia’s external auditors  
and the Head of Risk and Internal Audit without management present 
to discuss matters within our remit of responsibilities.
Key responsibilities
Our key responsibilities include oversight of financial reporting and 
internal controls over financial reporting, overseeing the Group’s 
relationship with its external auditors and Acacia’s internal audit 
function, overseeing the external and internal audit processes 
generally and reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s systems of 
internal control, including its risk management framework. In addition, 
this year the Company appointed a Chief Compliance Officer who 
reports to the Committee and as a result our remit of responsibilities 
has been extended to include oversight of this function in the context 
of anti-fraud, anti-bribery and anti-corruption work by the Company, 
these being directly related to our oversight of whistleblowing 
arrangements and related policy reviews. 
Activities in 2015 and plans for 2016
Our activities during the year were wide ranging, comprising in particular 
the following:
• Reviewing Committee composition based on succession planning, 
skill set and qualification requirements
• Reviewing our terms of reference and our remit of responsibilities  
in light of corporate governance developments
• Reviewing the external auditors’ terms of engagement, plans, scope 
of work, compensation, the findings arising from all external audit 
work and external auditor performance
• Reviewing Acacia’s periodic financial reporting
• Reviewing key accounting policies and developments in financial 
reporting and regulatory environment
• Reviewing the internal audit plan together with internal audit reports, 
findings and monitoring related action plans
• Reviewing enterprise risk registers, tax disputes and other litigation
• Reviewing the progress of the annual Anti-Corruption Compliance 
Programme
• Reviewing whistleblowing arrangements to support reporting 
requirements under Acacia’s Code of Conduct and Anti-Fraud  
and Anti-Corruption policies and other reports from the Company’s 
compliance function
• Receiving periodic risk management reports and updates as regards 
the principal risks for which the Committee has delegated oversight 
on behalf of the Board
• Participating in the risk management governance and framework 
review conducted by the Board with the assistance of Deloitte LLP
• Participating in the Committee’s annual performance assessment 
In 2016, the Committee will continue to focus on the majority of the 
above matters, these being core to its remit of responsibilities.

58 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 Significant issues considered by the Committee in 2015
In addition to carrying out the activities referred to above, we reviewed 
and considered the following in the context of significant issues relating 
to Group financial statements:
Indirect tax recoverability
As part of ongoing monitoring and review of taxation matters, we have 
reviewed the status, recoverability and classification of the Company’s 
indirect tax receivables relating to VAT charged on imports and the 
domestic supply of goods and services. In this regard, we have received 
reports from management on the status of discussions and negotiations 
of such matters between management and the Tanzanian Revenue 
Authority (‘TRA’); we have reviewed management’s ongoing calculations 
of amounts so outstanding; the procedure established to recover refunds 
and amounts due under the escrow account established to fund refunds 
due in respect of portions of the receivable; the audit process followed 
to confirm such refunds; and the overall time frame for the receipt  
of such refunds against amounts outstanding under the receivable  
from time to time. The Committee has also taken into account the  
views and contributions of the external auditors regarding recoverability  
and classification of relevant indirect tax receivables. Based on the 
foregoing, the Committee has satisfied itself that the Company’s  
indirect tax receivables are recoverable and appropriately classified  
in the circumstances and is satisfied with the suitability of the related 
disclosures contained in this Annual Report.
Uncertain tax positions
A number of tax assessments have been raised by the TRA in prior years 
which have been challenged by members of the Group. We have reviewed 
the basis of these assessments and discussed with management their 
views as to why the assessments are incorrect, along with the status  
of appeals and recent correspondence with the TRA. We also discussed 
these matters with the external auditors. Based on this review the 
Committee concluded that the Company had sufficiently provided for  
any uncertain tax positions and that any material contingent liabilities 
had been adequately disclosed. In addition, the Committee reviewed  
the amount of deferred tax recognised with respect to losses incurred  
in previous periods and was comfortable with the amounts recognised.
Impairment assessment
As part of ongoing monitoring of impairment assessments, during  
the year the Committee has reviewed and examined key assumptions 
used by management for impairment testing, in particular the long-term 
average gold price used and the factors relevant to this selection,  
such as: the Company’s operating cash cost levels, the basis on which 
these assumptions were made, and related factors underpinning relevant  
mine planning, budgets and forecasts. Views and contributions of  
the external auditors as regards the impairment testing procedures  
and key assumptions used formed part of the Committee’s review of  
all impairment test calculations. Following these reviews, the Committee 
satisfied itself that key assumptions used to ascertain the carrying  
value of the Company’s cash generating units had been appropriately 
reviewed and challenged and were therefore sufficiently robust for use. 
The Committee also reviewed the disclosure contained in this Annual 
Report and, in particular, the disclosure contained in the notes to  
the consolidated financial statements as regards impairment in order to 
satisfy itself of the accuracy and suitability of the disclosures so made.
Inventory level assessments
As part of ongoing cost control and inventory management reviews,  
the Committee has reviewed and scrutinised management’s inventory 
level maintenance processes, existing inventory carrying values and  
the approach taken to ascertain write-downs, particularly with respect  
to inventory at Buzwagi. Management reported to the Committee on  
the procedures undertaken to determine and monitor inventory levels 
across the Group and overall supply chain procedures required to 
achieve optimal inventory levels. In addition, management reported  
to the Committee on all adjustments required to be made to inventory 
calculations, something which was further expanded through discussions 
with the external auditors as regards their analysis and consideration  
of these issues. Based on this process the Committee is satisfied that 
management’s valuation and presentation of the Company’s inventory 
and related costs are suitable in the circumstances.
Going concern review
In addition to the matters stated above, all of which are relevant to  
the Board’s assessment of Acacia’s position as a going concern, the 
statement relating to which is provided at page 41, the Committee also 
reviewed other matters relevant to Acacia’s liquidity, namely the ongoing 
availability of net cash balances, Acacia’s hedging strategy and policy, 
and the availability of funds under existing credit facilities. Management 
reported to the Committee on each of these matters and was questioned 
accordingly. In this regard, the Committee has also taken into account 
the views of the external auditors in order to satisfy itself of the position 
taken by the Board as regards to the appropriateness of the going 
concern assumption contained in this Annual Report.
Risk reviews 
As mentioned elsewhere in this Annual Report, during the year the  
Board conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s 
risk management and internal control systems for the reporting period 
with the assistance of Deloitte LLP. This assessment took into account 
the enhanced assessment requirements introduced by the 2014 edition 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code and the FRC’s Guidance on  
Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business 
Reporting. Following this assessment and from a risk governance 
perspective it was determined that the Committee would continue to 
have delegated oversight of certain financial-related principal risks and 
would also have continuing oversight of the Company’s risk management 
framework itself, as a component of internal controls systems generally. 
Further information regarding risk management and risk governance  
is provided on pages 22 to 23. 
Fair, balanced and understandable review
At the request of the Board, the Committee has also reviewed  
the narrative content of the Annual Report in order to make a 
recommendation that the report satisfies revised narrative reporting 
requirements in that the Annual Report, when taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Company’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy. In this regard the Committee has taken 
advice from the Company’s legal function to satisfy itself of the relevant 
legal and regulatory framework underpinning this disclosure standard.

STRATEGIC REPORT PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION AUDIT COMMITTEE CONTINUED
Internal and external audit reviews
As regards internal audit, throughout the year the Committee received 
regular reports on matters under review by the internal audit function, 
and has reviewed such matters and raised questions with the Head  
of Risk and Internal Audit accordingly. We also reviewed the internal  
audit charter, mandate and performance in order to assess ongoing 
effectiveness, following which the Committee concluded that the  
internal audit function remains effective and performs in accordance  
with requirements of the business.
We have also assessed the effectiveness of the external audit process 
via responses to surveys received from the Chief Financial Officer, 
members of the finance and treasury function, and in particular members 
of the Company’s financial reporting team and the Company secretariat. 
The survey comprised a range of factors including the following:
• Progress achieved against the agreed external audit plan
• Competence with which the external auditors handled key accounting 
and audit judgements and communication of the same between 
management, the Committee and the external audit team
• Compliance with relevant regulatory, ethical and professional 
guidance on rotation of lead audit partners
• Qualifications, expertise, resources and the external auditors’  
own assessment of their quality control procedures
• The stability and continuity provided to the business as a result of  
the continued appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (‘PwC’)  
as external auditors
Based on this assessment, the Committee concluded that the  
external auditors remain effective and we will be recommending the 
reappointment of the external auditors at the forthcoming AGM in light  
of this assessment.
As regards external audit tender considerations, PwC have acted as 
external auditors for the Group since its listing on the London Stock 
Exchange in March 2010. In this regard, we note that the Statutory Audit 
Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use  
of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) 
Order 2014 (‘Order’), which requires mandatory tendering of audit 
services (at least every ten years) by FTSE 350 companies, came into 
effect on 1 January 2015 and applies to financial reporting years as  
of this date. The Committee has reviewed the requirements of this  
order and determined that an audit tender will be required in respect  
of the 2019 financial year at the earliest. We are therefore compliant 
with the requirements of the Order. 
With respect to non-audit services provided by the external auditors,  
the Committee reviews the status of all non-audit services on a quarterly 
basis and is required to consider, and where appropriate provide prior 
approval for, the provision of all non-audit work by the external auditors 
to ensure that any such work can be conducted without adversely 
affecting auditor independence. The Committee also reviews the 
proposed provision of non-audit services against the backdrop of UK  
and EU prohibitions regarding the provision of non-audit services to 
ensure the Company complies with all restrictions and requirements 
applicable to it. 
The auditors are precluded from engaging in non-audit services  
that would compromise their independence, objectivity or violate any 
professional requirements or regulations affecting their appointment  
as auditors. The auditors may, however, provide non-audit services which  
do not impair their independence, and where their skills and experience 
make them a logical supplier, subject to pre-approval by the Committee. 
For example, this may include the conduct of certain matters relating to 
taxation, given the materiality of taxation considerations to the financial 
assessment and external audit of the Company. The Company’s 
procedures require that any non-audit services proposed to be provided 
by the auditors be supported by a justification as to why the appointment 
of the external auditors to provide the services is in the Company’s  
best interests, and how auditor independence would be safeguarded  
in the specific context of the proposed services. In addition to this,  
the lead audit partner rotates at least every five years.
Fees for non-audit services incurred during the year amounted to 
approximately US$0.2 million (2014 – approximately US$0.6 million) 
representing 20% of the 2015 audit fees. Audit related and non-audit 
services provided by the external auditors included their review  
of the Company’s half year report. Further information on audit and 
non-audit fees paid to PwC can be found in note 11 to the consolidated 
financial statements.
As a Company we also maintain a strict discipline on the recruitment of 
any former employees of the external auditors to ensure independence  
is not undermined. In line with this, the Committee has adopted a written 
policy regarding the recruitment of former employees of the external 
auditor. The policy prohibits the hiring of any former member of the 
external audit team into any financial oversight role or as an officer of  
the Company for a period of two years following their association with the 
audit, save in instances where the appointment has been pre-approved 
by the Committee. Between meetings, the Committee Chairman has 
delegated authority to deal with such appointments at his discretion.  
Any such interim approval must be ratified at the next meeting of the 
Committee. In addition, any employee of the external auditor who 
accepts employment with the Acacia Group whatever the role must 
cease all audit activity immediately and tender their resignation to  
the audit firm.

Introduction
I am the Chairman of the Committee, a position that I assumed  
as a result of my experience within an African socio-economic and 
political context, having served in a number of public and private 
sectors in Tanzania and within the East African Community over  
the years. Graham Clow and Rachel English acted as the other 
members of the Committee in 2015. For 2016, Brad Gordon  
will replace Graham Clow on Graham’s departure from the Board.  
Details of members’ experience and qualifications are provided  
on pages 50 to 51 of the Board of Directors’ biographies. Our terms  
of reference require us to meet at least twice a year, and in 2015  
we met four times. The Chief Executive Officer and those involved in 
the Company’s environmental, health, safety and security (‘EHS&S’)  
and corporate social responsibility (‘CSR’) functions also attend 
Committee meetings on a regular basis by invitation, in order to 
report on EHS&S/CSR developments and performance. 
Key responsibilities 
Our key responsibilities focus on the oversight and review of  
activities that are of core importance to Acacia’s social licence to 
operate. These include Acacia’s strategy and policy on environmental, 
occupational health and safety, CSR and security matters; reviewing 
the effectiveness of Group EHS&S systems and controls; and 
generally overseeing management’s monitoring and evaluation  
of emerging CSR issues to assess the potential impact on Acacia’s 
business and operations. In addition, at the end of the year we 
extended the remit of our oversight to human rights, in line with 
similar oversight responsibilities assumed by EHS&S Committees  
or their equivalent in peers across the mining industry.
Activities in 2015 and plans for 2016
Our activities during the year were wide ranging, and comprised the 
following in particular:
• Reviewing Committee composition, based on succession planning, 
skill set and qualification requirements
• Reviewing our terms of reference and our remit of responsibilities  
in light of ongoing developments within the Company’s business  
and operating environment
• Reviewing Group-wide EHS&S and CSR strategies and priorities, 
performance, metrics, trends and incident reports
• Reviewing key risks in the Group’s operating environment regarding 
EHS&S and CSR
• Reviewing key regulatory and other developments relevant to the 
EHS&S and CSR operating environment
• Reviewing and monitoring the status of occupational, health and 
safety targets and systems
• Identifying and reviewing specific focus areas in the context  
of performance and strategic reviews, as relevant to EHS&S and  
CSR matters
• Reviewing progress and the status of Acacia Maendeleo Fund 
initiatives
• Receiving periodic risk management reports and updates regarding 
the principal risks for which the Committee has delegated oversight 
on behalf of the Board
• Participating in the risk management governance and framework 
review conducted by the Board with the assistance of Deloitte LLP
• Participating in the Committee’s annual performance assessment
• Conducting a site visit of Acacia’s operations to review CSR 
programmes 
• Overseeing the review of Acacia’s CSR strategy
In 2016, the Committee will continue to focus on the majority of  
the above matters, these being core to its remit of responsibilities.  
In addition and as mentioned elsewhere in the Annual Report, during  
the year the Board conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of  
the Company’s risk management and internal control systems for the 
reporting period with the assistance of Deloitte LLP. This assessment 
took into account the enhanced assessment requirements introduced  
by the 2014 edition of the UK Corporate Governance Code and 
supporting FRC guidance. Following this assessment and from a risk 
governance perspective it was determined that the Committee would 
continue to have delegated oversight of certain EHS&S-related principal 
risks, given its remit of responsibilities. The specific principal risks  
for which the Committee has delegated oversight are identified as  
part of the principal risks and uncertainties table on pages 80 to 83.

Introduction
In addition to acting as the Chairman of the Board, I also act as 
Chairman of the Nomination & Governance Committee. Ambassador 
Juma V. Mwapachu and Peter Tomsett act as the other members  
of the Committee. Details of members’ experience and qualifications 
are provided on pages 50 to 51 as part of the Board of Directors’ 
biographies. Our terms of reference require us to meet at least  
twice a year, and we did so in 2015. The Chief Executive Officer  
and members from the Company secretariat also attend Committee 
meetings by invitation to discuss matters within our remit of 
responsibilities.
Key responsibilities
We play a leading role in reviewing the structure, size and composition 
of the Board and in reviewing prospective new Board appointments 
and succession planning requirements. We also have primary 
responsibility for making recommendations to the Board on the 
composition of Board Committees and we manage recommendations 
for the retirement and replacement of Directors. In addition, our  
remit of responsibilities includes delegated authority from the Board 
to oversee and review Acacia’s corporate governance policies and 
procedures, including independence reviews and the monitoring of 
Company procedures for the management of actual and/or potential 
conflicts of interest.
Activities in 2015 and plans for 2016
Our activities during the year were wide ranging, and comprised the 
following in particular:
• Reviewing Committee composition based on succession planning, 
skill set and qualification requirements
• Reviewing our terms of reference and our remit of responsibilities  
in light of ongoing developments within the Company’s business  
and operating environment and developments within a corporate 
governance context
• Reviewing the Board’s structure, size and composition in the context 
of the Company’s strategic and business objectives
• Reviewing the Company’s core corporate governance policies in line 
with best practice developments and recent trend developments
• Participating in the Committee’s annual performance assessment 
• Providing oversight and review of the Board’s and Board Committees’ 
annual performance evaluation and overseeing the adoption of  
recommendations for 2016 work plans. In this regard an overview of 
the 2015 externally facilitated assessment is provided on page 56
• Reviewing periodic training and development requirements  
for Directors
In 2016, the Committee will continue to focus on the majority of the 
above matters, these being core to its remit of responsibilities. 
In the context of diversity, whilst the Company has not adopted  
a formal policy, we base all recruitment on the premise that we strive  
to attract a broad mix of individuals from both the traditional and 
non-traditional mining labour markets in order to create a diverse 
workgroup and maintain a unique company culture. Above all, we aim  
to hire all individuals on the basis of the best candidate for all positions, 
at all levels, including Board and senior management positions, 
irrespective of gender.
Save for appointments made by Barrick under nomination rights 
contained in the Relationship Agreement, Board appointments are  
made on the basis of pre-determined job descriptions which include,  
as regards independent Non-Executive Directors, estimates of time 
commitment requirements. From a recruitment and candidate search 
perspective, our existing Directors provide access to a wide network of 
potential Board appointment candidates, particularly within the extractive 
industry, as a result of their collective experience and standing within  
the extractive sector. In addition to this, we look to retain external  
search consultants to assist us in identifying potential candidates  
for Board positions, when appropriate to do so. We did not make  
any new appointments to the Board this year and, as such, no external 
recruitment consultants were retained during the year for Board 
recruitment purposes.

62 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 Dear shareholders,
We have continued to transform the business over the course of the  
year and although we are pleased with the overall progress made at  
a difficult time for our industry overall, we did not realise our primary  
aim of generating free cash flow in 2015. In addition and as a result of 
challenges faced primarily in the third quarter of the year, our production 
and cost levels did not meet the expectations we set out at the beginning 
of the year. As explained in the Chairman’s statement and Chief 
Executive’s review, the CEO and all other members of the Executive 
Leadership Team have made voluntary elections to waive a proportion  
of their base salaries (10%) for 2016. Our Directors have also made  
an equivalent election to waive 10% of their annual base fee for 2016, 
details of which are provided on page 74. This represents and confirms 
management’s and the Board’s commitment to the business and to 
driving long-term value for our shareholders. The Company will review  
the suitability of reinstating prior base salaries and Director fees at an 
appropriate time in the future.
With respect to the 2015 bonus assessment, Company-wide 
performance was assessed as 12% overall, an unsatisfactory outcome. 
Whilst all members of the Board and the management team are 
disappointed with this outcome, we nevertheless achieved improvement 
in our overall performance when compared to 2014 and we had already 
begun to see noticeable improvements in performance in Q4 2015. 
Further details as regards the CEO’s 2015 bonus assessment are 
provided on page 74. We will continue to adopt strenuous executive 
performance requirements for the vesting of bonus awards in 2016  
to ensure that vesting levels remain focused on the achievement  
of target and above target performance.
We have not made any significant changes to our compensation 
practices in 2015 and throughout the year we have continued to act 
within the parameters of the approved remuneration policy, which 
garnered strong support from our shareholders at the 2014 AGM.
As regards 2015 corporate governance developments, we note  
the increasing prevalence of bonus deferrals and the introduction  
of holding periods for long-term incentives, such that overall  
performance and holding periods for LTIP awards is no less than  
five years. The Committee continues to believe that it would be 
inappropriate to introduce these practices at this stage, in light  
of the overall structure of our compensation packages. In making  
this assessment we have taken into account that our current  
practices remain consistent and in line with practices adopted by 
international mining companies and that the structure of our packages 
already ensure that executive compensation is heavily weighted  
towards at risk components, with bonus and long-term incentive  
award weightings being equivalent to approximately 70% of the  
CEO package. The Committee will continue to monitor best practice  
in these areas, and in the area of malus provisions, and will consider  
the appropriateness of these practices again in time for the next  
vote on Acacia’s Remuneration Policy at the 2017 AGM. 
As required under the Large and Medium-sized Companies and  
Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013, the 
remaining content of this Remuneration Report is divided into elements 
of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy (pages 64 to 70), which are 
provided for continuing information purposes, and the Annual Report  
on Remuneration for 2015 (pages 71 to 79), which will be subject  
to an advisory shareholder vote at the 2016 AGM.

Compensation Committee Chairman
ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 63
STRATEGIC REPORT PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
REMUNERATION REPORT Summary table for Executive Directors’ remuneration policy
Fixed remuneration
Base salary Pension Benefits
Purpose To provide an appropriately competitive level of 
base salary with due regard to the size and nature 
of the responsibilities of each role, as well as an 
individual executive’s experience.
To help provide  
for an appropriate 
retirement benefit.
To provide benefits which are competitive in  
the market in which the individual is employed.
Operation Reviewed annually, with any adjustments effective 
1 January and made at the discretion of the 
Compensation Committee.
Salaries are benchmarked against international 
gold mining, general mining and FTSE listed 
companies of similar size and complexity.
The Compensation Committee also takes into 
account corporate and individual performance and 
experience; general market conditions; and salary 
increases applied within the Company as a whole.
Executive Directors 
receive contributions 
into a personal 
pension scheme  
of their choice, or a 
cash supplement of 
commensurate value.
The Group does not 
operate any defined 
benefit schemes.
 
Executive Directors receive benefits, which  
usually include the provision of a company car  
or cash alternative, health and life insurance,  
liability insurance, fitness club membership  
and professional membership; however, the 
Compensation Committee retains discretion to 
approve any other form of benefit that it deems 
appropriate to award depending on individual 
circumstances. For example, relocation allowances 
and international transfer-related benefits are  
often provided for, when required, in line with  
general industry practices for the recruitment  
of international employees.
Opportunity To avoid setting expectations of Executive Directors 
and other employees, no maximum salary is set 
under the Remuneration Policy. It is not anticipated 
that salary increases for Executive Directors  
will exceed those of the wider workforce over the 
period during which this Remuneration Policy is 
effective. Where increases are awarded in excess 
of the wider employee population, the Committee 
will provide the rationale in the relevant year’s 
Annual Report on Remuneration.
Executive Directors 
receive contributions 
or an equivalent cash 
supplement equal to 
a percentage of gross 
base salary in line 
with market norms  
at the relevant point  
in time.
The value of benefits will generally be assessed  
on the basis of market norms at the relevant point 
in time.
The Compensation Committee retains the  
discretion to approve a higher total cost of benefits 
in exceptional circumstances (e.g. relocation) or in 
circumstances where factors outside the Company’s 
control have changed materially (e.g. increases in 
medical coverage inflation).
Short-Term Incentive (‘STI’)
Purpose To reinforce the delivery of key short-term operational objectives on an annual basis in order to promote performance  
as regards business priorities for each financial year in the context of individual and Company performance.
Operation Performance measure weightings and targets are set at the start of the year and weighted to reflect business priorities.  
At the end of the year, the Compensation Committee determines the extent to which targets have been achieved, taking into 
account Company-wide performance and the individual performance of each Executive Director.
STI payments are delivered in cash; clawback provisions apply to any STI payment made to an Executive Director in the event  
of individual misconduct or financial misstatement/misreporting.
Opportunity The STI provides Executive Directors with an annual bonus opportunity in the range of 0% to 150% of base salary,  
with target bonus opportunity of up to 75% of base salary.
Performance measures Bonus outcomes are assessed by the Compensation Committee on a scorecard assessment, based on the achievement  
of the targets set for each performance measure and the Committee’s broad assessment of Company performance.
Performance measures are based on challenging budget and stretch targets for Company-wide financial and operational 
performance and, where appropriate, individual performance. Performance measures may include financial, operational,  
growth, production, cost and capital expenditure control and sustainability metrics. Performance measures are selected 
annually to reflect key strategic initiatives and matters underpinning the key financial and non-financial performance indicators 
used to manage performance across the Acacia Group. Performance measures will be weighted appropriately each year 
according to the business plan. Weightings of performance measures may vary, typically up to 10% and 50%, with the range  
of performance required under each measure calibrated to reflect the Company’s annual published guidance range, particularly 
as regards production, cash costs and capital expenditure. For threshold performance, the STI is anticipated to be up to  
75% of Executive Director base salary, unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee.
Whilst performance measures, weightings and targets for any given year will not be disclosed on a prospective basis due  
to commercial sensitivities, the Compensation Committee aims to provide such details retrospectively as part of the Annual 
Report on Remuneration, unless ongoing commercial sensitivities discourage such disclosures.
Directors’ remuneration policy
64 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015
REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’)
Purpose To reinforce an enterprise culture that promotes and protects shareholders’ long-term interests, so as to reward long-term 
decision making and performance that support the delivery of shareholder returns and drive shareholder value over the  
long term.
Operation Awards of conditional shares, options or restricted stock units (‘RSUs’) may be granted annually, with the maximum value  
that may be awarded to each Executive Director defined as a percentage of base salary at the date of grant. Vesting is based  
on Acacia’s corporate performance over a three-year period. There is no retest provision.
Clawback provisions are included in the LTIP for Executive Directors, whereby an award is subject to clawback for one year from 
the vesting date (or exercise date, if relevant) in the event of exceptional circumstances of individual misconduct or financial 
misstatement/misreporting.
Opportunity The LTIP permits a maximum award with a value equal to 200% of base salary at the time of grant to be made each year  
under normal circumstances. The Committee may exceed this limit in exceptional circumstances only. Such circumstances 
would include, for example, specific recruitment or retention scenarios. The exercise of this discretion would be assessed  
in each case on the circumstances in question.
The level of LTIP awards granted to Executive Directors each year is determined by the Committee, within the limits set out 
above, with reference to a range of factors including individual performance ratings. Maximum performance, which will be 
assessed as 35% outperformance of the median TSR over the three-year performance period going forward, can deliver  
vesting of up to 2x the value of the award granted, e.g. an award with a value of 150% of base salary at the time of grant would, 
if maximum performance were achieved, vest at a value equal to 300% at the time of vesting.
Additional RSUs are credited to reflect dividends paid on Acacia Ordinary Shares prior to the vesting date. Such RSUs are 
subject to the same vesting provisions as the underlying awards.
Performance measures Subject to continued employment and Acacia’s relative TSR performance over a three-year performance period when compared 
to the constituents of the Euromoney Global Gold Index, TSR performance must be at least equal to that of the TSR comparator 
group in order to receive any payment under LTIP awards, at which level 50% of the target award will vest. If no entitlement has 
been earned at the end of a three-year performance period, awards will lapse.
The Compensation Committee reviews the comparator group of international gold miners against which TSR performance is 
measured from time to time to ensure it remains appropriate. The Compensation Committee has the discretion to determine 
the treatment of comparators in the event of their delisting or otherwise in any event which, in the opinion of the Committee, 
compromises the suitability of a company as a comparator for Acacia. Additionally, the Committee may, at its discretion, reduce 
the number of awards vesting in the event that the achievement against the performance condition is not a genuine reflection  
of the underlying performance of the Company. More generally, the performance measures applied to LTIP awards are reviewed 
periodically to ensure they remain aligned with shareholder interests and, in this regard, the Committee retains discretion to 
employ performance measures other than TSR to the LTIP in order to allow for performance assessments to evolve over time.
Share Option Plan (‘SOP’)
Purpose To reinforce an enterprise culture that promotes and protects shareholders’ long-term interests, so as to reward long-term 
decision making and performance that support the delivery of shareholder returns and drive shareholder value over the  
long term.
Operation Whilst the LTIP is expected to be used as the main long-term incentive for Executive Directors going forward, the Committee 
retains the ability to grant stock options under the SOP where appropriate, such as in recruitment or retention scenarios.
The Compensation Committee will set a vesting period for SOP awards appropriate to the circumstances at the time of grant. 
Historically, this has included vesting in equal parts over four years or vesting after three years. All awards expire seven years 
from the date of grant. There are no clawback provisions included under the SOP.
Opportunity The SOP permits a maximum share option award with a value equal to 200% of base salary at the time of grant to be  
made each year under normal circumstances. The Committee may exceed this limit in exceptional circumstances only.  
Such circumstances would include, for example, specific recruitment or retention scenarios. The exercise of this discretion 
would be assessed in each case on the circumstances in question.
In the event that a stock option award was used for annual incentive purposes, such awards would ordinarily be granted at  
a target level equal to 150% of base salary at the time of grant. In this regard, the Committee would look to use an appropriate 
valuation model, for example, the Black-Scholes model, for purposes of ascertaining the fair value of any award made.
Performance measures The Compensation Committee determines the performance metrics applying to share option awards as appropriate to  
the circumstances at the time of grant, based on the purpose of making such award, i.e. whether for recruitment, retention  
or as a matter of annual performance incentive. Generally, in the event that the Committee were to grant an SOP award as  
an incentive, it would look to apply an appropriate performance condition.

STRATEGIC REPORT PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION Shareholding guidelines
Purpose To align the interests of Executive Directors with shareholders through the building up of a significant shareholding in the 
Company.
Operation Executive Directors are required to establish a minimum shareholding equivalent to two times base salary over a period  
of five years. Shareholding requirements may be satisfied by interests under LTIP awards.
Pay-for-performance: scenario analysis
The chart below provides an estimate of the potential future reward 
opportunity for the CEO, and the potential split between the different 
elements of remuneration under three different performance scenarios: 
Minimum, On-target and Maximum.
Potential reward opportunities are based on the Remuneration Policy.  
In each scenario, the STI and LTIP are based on the level of maximum 
opportunities in 2016 applied to the CEO’s 2015 salary (i.e. before  
the 10% reduction). Note that the LTIP awards granted in a year do not 
normally vest until the third anniversary of the date of grant, and the 
projected value excludes the impact of share price movement. 
The minimum scenario reflects the 2016 base salary, pension and prior 
year benefits (i.e. fixed remuneration) which are the only elements of the 
Chief Executive Officer’s remuneration package not linked to performance.
The on-target scenario reflects fixed remuneration as above, plus target 
STI (75% of salary) and target vesting of the LTIP (200% of salary).
The maximum scenario reflects fixed remuneration, plus maximum 
payout under all incentives (150% of salary under the STI and full vesting 
of an LTIP award at maximum performance, which would be equal to 
400% for an award granted at target of 200% of base salary).

Use of Compensation Committee discretions
Generally, it is not possible for any remuneration policy to pre-empt every 
possible scenario and for this reason the Compensation Committee has 
been provided with the ability to apply various discretions and judgements 
in order to ensure the achievement of fair outcomes and to maintain the 
flexibility required to balance the interests of individuals and those of the 
Company. For example, the Compensation Committee may be required  
to exercise discretion when determining whether or not the outcomes  
of performance measures and targets applicable to incentive plans are  
fair in context, or if realities encourage the use of upward or downward 
adjustments. By means of illustration, this may be the case as a result 
of the impact of wider socio-economic or political factors or market-wide 
developments that were generally unforeseeable or remote at the time  
of setting performance measures, but nonetheless occur during  
a performance period. It is for such reasons that the Compensation 
Committee retains a number of discretions for the operation of all 
incentive schemes (STI, LTIP and SOP) including, but not limited to,  
the ability to determine the following:
• Scheme participants
• The timing of grant and size of awards
• Appropriate treatment of vesting of awards in the context of 
restructurings and/or takeovers
• Appropriate adjustments to awards in the event of variations to the 
Company’s share capital
• Absent specific bad leaver scenarios, the ability to determine and 
designate leavers as good leavers in order to determine appropriate 
treatment of awards in exit scenarios
• Treatment, size and grant of awards in a recruitment context
• The application, scope, weighting and targets for applicable 
performance measures and performance conditions from time to 
time, including any amendments to existing performance measures/
conditions and related targets
Whilst it may not be possible to give an exhaustive list of Compensation 
Committee discretions, the exercise of discretions and the rationale 
underpinning their use, if any, will generally be provided in context, as 
part of the Annual Report on Remuneration. In this regard we can confirm 
that no discretions were exercised during 2015.

REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Approach to recruitment of Executive Directors
When determining the remuneration package for a new Executive Director the Compensation Committee aims to offer a package that is sufficiently 
competitive, to attract, motivate and retain candidates of the calibre and experience required to run our business. This will generally be determined  
in each case not only in the context of the skills required for a position and those of each candidate, but will also be determined on the basis  
of recruitment trends within the global mining industry and any additional considerations relevant to the recruitment of executives. In addition,  
our approach to recruitment will also depend on whether we use external recruitment or internal promotion routes.
External recruitment
In determining appropriate remuneration for an external candidate, the Compensation Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors 
(including quantum, the nature of remuneration and the jurisdiction the candidate was recruited from) to ensure that arrangements are in the best 
interests of the Company and its shareholders. For such purposes, the Compensation Committee may make use of all of the existing components  
of the Remuneration Policy as follows:
Component Approach
Maximum annual 
grant value
Fixed  
remuneration
Base salary The base salaries of new appointees will be determined by reference to relevant market data, 
experience and skills of the individual, internal relativities and their current basic salary. Where new 
appointees have initial basic salaries set below market, any shortfall may be managed with phased 
increases over a period of two to three years subject to their development in the role.
N/A
Pension New appointees will receive pension contributions or an equivalent cash supplement, which is 
equivalent to that received by existing executives and in line with market norms.
N/A
Benefits New appointees will be eligible to receive benefits which may include (but are not limited to) the 
provision of a company car or cash alternative, private medical insurance and any necessary 
relocation expenses.
N/A
Variable  
remuneration
STI The STI described in the Summary Table for Executive Directors’ Remuneration Policy will apply to  
new appointees with the relevant maximum being pro-rated to reflect the proportion of employment 
over the year. Targets for the individual element will be tailored towards the executive.
150% of salary
LTIP New appointees will be granted awards under the LTIP on the same terms as other executives,  
as described in the Summary Table for Executive Directors’ Remuneration Policy. 
200% of salary

SOP New appointees may be granted awards under the SOP, as described in the Summary Table for 
Executive Directors’ Remuneration Policy.
200% of salary
1
1  Based on target level; award can be higher in circumstances deemed by the Committee to be exceptional, i.e. where it is necessary to buy out incentive arrangements  
or make offers equivalent to sign-on bonuses.
The Compensation Committee may also make an award under the terms 
of one of the Company’s incentive plans outlined above in respect of  
a new appointment to buy out incentive arrangements forfeited on 
leaving a previous employer. In doing so, the Committee will consider 
relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to these 
awards, the likelihood of those conditions being met and the term 
remaining to their vesting. In addition, where candidates are recruited 
from overseas, the Committee may be required to consider additional 
benefits received in the home jurisdiction or arrange for a form of 
substitution of such benefits in addition to the payment of suitable 
relocation allowances. The Compensation Committee may also consider 
it appropriate to grant an award under a structure not included in  
the Remuneration Policy, exercising the discretion available under  
Listing Rule 9.4.2 R where necessary. Such an award would include,  
for example, a sign-on payment. In connection with this, and as explained  
in assurances given at the time of publishing the 2013 Annual Report, 
the Compensation Committee confirms that, following discussions with 
shareholder representatives, any arrangement specifically established  
to recruit an individual would take the form of performance-related 
variable remuneration. On recruitment, the value of this remuneration 
would be capped at the limits contained in the LTIP and SOP or the value 
of awards which the individual had to surrender in order to be recruited, 
whichever is the greater. The policy that exists for current Executive 
Directors would then apply to the balance of the individual’s remuneration 
package. In addition, the Compensation Committee does not envisage 
that a cash payment such as a “golden hello” would be offered.
ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 67
STRATEGIC REPORT PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION Internal promotion
In cases of appointing a new Executive Director by way of internal 
promotion, the Committee will be consistent with the policy used for 
external appointees detailed above. Where an individual has contractual 
commitments made prior to his or her promotion to Executive Director 
level, the Company will continue to honour these arrangements even  
in instances where they would not otherwise be consistent with the 
prevailing Remuneration Policy at the time of appointment.
Approach to Executive Director exit arrangements
Executive Director service contracts, including arrangements for  
early termination, are carefully considered by the Compensation 
Committee and are designed to recruit, retain and motivate directors  
of the quality required to manage the Company. The Committee 
considers appointments of an indefinite term and with a notice period  
of one year to be appropriate. The service contract used for the 
Company’s current CEO, being the sole Executive Director at present, 
provides for compensation of 12 months’ salary in the event of early 
termination. The Company has the discretion to pay such compensation  
in instalments, requiring the Executive Director to mitigate loss  
(i.e. by gaining new employment) over the relevant period, or in  
a lump sum. If notice to terminate is served by either the Executive 
Director or the Company, the Executive Director can continue to  
receive basic salary, benefits and pension for the duration of his/her 
notice period during which the Company may require the individual  
to continue to fulfil his/her current duties or may assign a period of 
garden leave, depending on the circumstances in question. The service 
contract used for any new hire would be based on similar terms. The 
CEO’s service contract is available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office.
Generally, in an exit scenario the Company will honour all contractual 
entitlements, this being a matter required by the operation of law, and  
for individuals who relocated from overseas, reasonable relocation costs 
will be considered as appropriate in the circumstances.
The treatment of incentive arrangements in exit scenarios are considered 
on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the relevant contractual 
terms of the individual, the circumstances of the exit and any applicable 
duty to mitigate. Generally, the payment of incentives as part of exit 
arrangements is determined on the basis of good leaver/bad leaver  
and change of control scenarios.

The Committee may exercise discretion to award a bonus for the performance year. Such discretion  
would generally only be used in good leaver scenarios. If an award is made, the award will be made on

subject to applicable STI performance measure and target assessments for the year in question.

68 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015
REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Summary termination, termination for gross misconduct or gross 
negligence or termination in circumstances which would justify summary 
termination are all examples of bad leaver scenarios. Good leavers 
include individuals who have left the Company as a result of retirement, 
injury, disability or death. In addition, the Compensation Committee 
retains the discretion to determine any leaver that is not a bad leaver  
as a good leaver. This discretion is viewed as necessary by the Company 
given the vast range of scenarios in which an individual may leave the 
Company where conduct is not at issue. The availability of this discretion 
is particularly relevant in exit scenarios in which an individual’s 
performance per se is not at issue. Whilst it is not possible to provide an 
exhaustive list of such scenarios, examples would include circumstances 
in which the Board determines a need to change the Company’s strategic 
direction or focus, or is required to review Board and management 
composition generally, as a result of operational or market developments, 
or other developments in the business, such as entry into new markets 
or a restructuring of the business. In any event, when exercising such 
discretion the Compensation Committee would always recognise and 
take into account the balance of shareholder interests and those of the 
departing individual.
The table opposite summarises how the variable incentives are  
typically treated in specific circumstances, subject to the exercise  
of the discretions described above.
Executive Director external appointments
It is the Board’s policy to allow Executive Directors to accept  
non-executive directorships of other quoted companies for which  
they would normally be allowed to retain fees. Any such directorships 
must be formally approved by the Chairman of the Board. Currently,  
no such positions are held by the Company’s sole Executive Director.
Approach to Non-Executive Director remuneration
The Board aims to recruit Non-Executive Directors of a high calibre  
with broad commercial, international and other experience relevant to 
mining operations. Non-Executive Directors are appointed by the Board 
on the recommendation of the Nomination & Governance Committee.  
Their appointment is for an initial term of three years, subject to  
annual re-election by shareholders at each AGM in accordance with  
the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code. Upon the 
recommendation of the Nomination & Governance Committee, they may 
be re-appointed for two additional terms of three years, subject to their 
continuing to satisfy requirements for continuing appointment and, again, 
subject to annual re-election by shareholders. The terms of engagement 
of the Non-Executive Directors are set out in a letter of appointment. 
These letters do not contain any provision for compensation for early 
termination of office. Requirements for notice periods are reviewed  
on a case by case basis. All letters of appointment for Non-Executive 
Directors are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office.
Non-Executive Director remuneration primarily focuses on the  
payment of fees. Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to participate 
in any of the incentive plans available to Executive Directors. However, 
Non-Executive Directors may participate in the Company’s DSU Plan.  
This plan provides Non-Executive Directors with the option to receive 
some or all of their annual fees in return for a deferred right  
to a cash payment, payable only after a participant ceases to hold  
office with the Company. Broadly, cash payments under this plan  
are calculated by reference to the fair market value of the Company’s  
shares at the time of payment and remain subject to market fluctuations 
in the context of the Company’s share price until the time of payment.  
This plan was adopted by the Company in 2012 to address certain 
equivalent practices and trends of North American mining companies  
to ensure that our practices for Non-Executive Director compensation 
structures remain flexible and competitive against our global peers. 
DSUs are granted annually, usually in April of each year. In addition,  
to align Non-Executive Director interests with shareholders, the Company  
has adopted Non-Executive Director shareholding guidelines for its 
independent Non-Executive Directors, which require relevant individuals 
to acquire a minimum shareholding equivalent to their annual base fee 
within five years from election to the Board, which may be satisfied 
through the purchase of Acacia Ordinary Shares or by DSUs holdings.
Details as regards current outstanding awards under the DSU Plan  
and Acacia Ordinary Shares currently held by Non-Executive Directors  
are provided on page 79.
ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 69
STRATEGIC REPORT PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION Summary table for Non-Executive Director remuneration policy
Fees
Purpose To attract and retain candidates with the required skill and experience to form part of the Board and to ensure fees paid to the 
Non-Executive Directors are competitive and comparable with other companies of equivalent size and complexity operating 
within the global mining industry.
Operation The base fee for Non-Executive Directors is reviewed annually, with any adjustments effective 1 April each year. Fees payable  
to the Chairman are determined by the Compensation Committee, while the base fee and any other fee payable to the other 
Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Chairman of the Board on behalf of the Board. 
In addition to the base fee, additional fees are payable for acting as Senior Independent Director and as chair of any of the 
Board’s Committees (Audit, Compensation, EHS&S, Nomination & Governance) and for individual membership of such 
Committees. These additional fees are also reviewed annually, with any adjustment effective 1 April each year. In the event that 
the Board requires the formation of an additional Board Committee, fees for the chair and membership of such Committee will 
be determined by the Board at the time.
No base fee or fee for membership of Board Committees is payable to Non-Executive Directors appointed by Barrick pursuant  
to the nomination rights contained in the Relationship Agreement.
Non-Executive Director fee levels are benchmarked against international gold mining, general mining and FTSE listed companies 
of similar size and complexity. Time commitment, responsibility, and technical skills required to make a valuable contribution  
to an effective Board are taken into account when reviewing fee levels.
Opportunity Non-Executive Director fee increases are set in response to the outcome of the annual fee review. Fees for the year ending 
31 December 2015 are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration. The maximum aggregate annual fee for all Directors 
provided in the Company’s Articles of Association is £3,000,000. 
Deferred Share Unit Plan (‘DSU Plan’)
Purpose To ensure Acacia Non-Executive Director compensation structures remain flexible and competitive against global peers.
Operation Non-Executive Directors can receive some or all of their annual fees in return for a deferred right to a cash payment  
under the DSU Plan. The value of additional DSUs is credited to reflect dividends paid on Acacia Ordinary Shares over the  
period of participation.
Cash payments become payable only after a participant ceases to hold office with the Company.
Cash payments are calculated by reference to the fair market value of Acacia’s Ordinary Shares at the time of payment and 
remain subject to market fluctuations in Acacia’s share price until payment.
Awards lapse in the event that an individual is summarily terminated for: (i) breach of contract; (ii) breach of Director’s duties;  
or (iii) misconduct, or if an individual resigns in circumstances justifying summary termination.
Opportunity Non-Executive Directors can waive up to 100% of their annual fee. 
Approach to recruitment of Non-Executive Directors
In the case of hiring or appointing a new Non-Executive Director, the Board will utilise the Remuneration Policy summarised in the table entitled 
Summary Table for Non-Executive Director remuneration policy, above. A base fee which is aligned with the prevailing fee schedule would be payable 
for Board membership, with additional fees payable for acting as Senior Independent Director or as Chair of any of the Board’s Committees and  
for individual membership of such Committees. Non-Executive Directors would also be eligible to waive some or all of their annual fees in return  
for a deferred right to a cash payment under the DSU Plan.
Approach to Non-Executive Director exit arrangements
As regards Non-Executive Director resignation, retirement or termination, base fee and any additional fees would be payable to the resignation/
retirement/termination date and treatment of any awards under the DSU Plan would be as follows:
DSU Plan
Event Timing of vesting Calculation of vesting/payment
Retirement, injury, disability and death

REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Compensation Committee membership in 2015
As of 31 December 2015, the Compensation Committee comprised  
four Non-Executive Directors, all of whom were and remain independent:
• Michael Kenyon (Chairman)
• Graham Clow
• Peter Tomsett
• Steve Lucas
The following individuals also attended meetings by invitation during the 
year and provided information to the Committee to enable it to make 
informed decisions:
• Brad Gordon, Chief Executive Officer
• Peter Geleta, Executive General Manager, Organisational 
Effectiveness
No Director is present when his or her own remuneration is being 
determined. The Compensation Committee met five times during the 
year and details of members’ attendance at meetings are provided on 
page 54. An overview of Committee activities during the year is provided 
as part of the Committee Chairman’s introduction to this report.
Advisers
During the year, the Committee received independent advice on 
executive compensation matters from Kepler, a brand of Mercer which 
forms part of the MMC group of companies (‘Kepler’). Kepler was first 
appointed by the Compensation Committee in 2010 and retained during 
the year. The Compensation Committee evaluates the support provided 
by its advisers annually and is comfortable that the Kepler team provides 
independent remuneration advice to the Committee and does not have 
any connections with the Company that may impair its independence. 
Kepler is a founding member and signatory of the Code of Conduct  
for Remuneration Consultants, details of which can be found at  
www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com
In 2015, Kepler provided independent advice on trends and 
developments, reporting regulations, the LTIP TSR performance  
condition and benchmarking data for the Executive Leadership Team. 
Kepler does not advise the Company on any issues outside 
compensation and governance thereof. Kepler’s total fees for the 
provision of remuneration services in 2015 were £61,527 on the basis  
of time and materials. Other than advice on remuneration, no other 
services were provided by Kepler (or any other part of the MMC group  
of companies). The Committee also received legal advice from Travers 
Smith LLP as regards certain remuneration practices during the year,  
the total fees for which equalled £7 ,832.

STRATEGIC REPORT PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION Executive Director salaries
The CEO base salary for 2015 was £475,000. As explained in the Committee Chairman’s letter, Mr Gordon has elected to waive a proportion of base 
salary (10%) for 2016, which will result in his 2016 base salary being £427,500. This adjustment took effect as of 1 January 2016. This continues to 
be noticeably below peer group market average for the industry in which Acacia operates. The Committee will review the suitability of reinstating prior 
base salary levels at a suitable time in the future. 
Non-Executive Director fees
For the year ending 31 December 2015, no fees were paid to Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, appointed by Barrick pursuant to  
its nomination rights under the Relationship Agreement. Non-Executive Director fees are assessed in April each year. The table below reflects fees 
payable in respect of 2015, effective as of 1 April 2015. 
Fee component Amount 
Base fee £85,000
Senior Independent Director fee £25,000
Chair of Audit Committee fee £20,000
Chair of Compensation Committee, EHS&S Committee,  
and Nomination & Governance Committee fee
 
£15,000
Board Committee membership fee £5,000
As explained in the Committee Chairman’s letter, all independent Non-Executive Directors have elected to waive 10% of their base fee for 2016,  
such that the base fee for 2016 purposes will be £76,500. This adjustment will apply as of 1 April 2016. All other fee components remain unchanged. 
Executive Directors’ Short-Term Incentive awards
For the year ending 31 December 2015, Executive Director STI awards were earned on the basis of Company-wide performance (80%), this being 
representative of the overall leadership, management and performance of an individual holding this position and also includes a component  
to assess individual performance (20%). Company-wide performance measures continue to focus on the core metrics which we use to assess 
performance as regards safety, production, cost control and profit generation. These performance metrics were assessed on the basis of individual 
weightings and in line with a range of performance targets to provide for threshold, target and maximum performance, as outlined in the table 
opposite. The Committee has given careful consideration to the retrospective disclosure of 2015 annual bonus targets and considers that these 
remain commercially sensitive at this time. It is intended that targets will be disclosed at the earliest opportunity in the next three years, provided 
they are no longer commercially sensitive at that time.
As regards the 2015 bonus assessment, Company-wide performance was assessed as 12% overall, an unsatisfactory outcome (equivalent to  
7% of the CEO’s salary following application of the Company STI weighting). This is due to the Company’s underperformance against the production,  
free cash flow and AISC targets that we set at the outset of 2015. Whilst all members of the Board and the management team are disappointed  
with this outcome, we had already begun to see noticeable improvements in performance in Q4 2015. 
As regards the CEO’s individual performance, whilst Company-wide performance was not as we had hoped when we started 2015, Brad Gordon’s 
commitment to the business has been unwavering and he has continued to show strong leadership of the Company to drive core initiatives and 
programmes, notably through progressing Bulyanhulu’s mechanisation, transitioning North Mara into a combined open pit and underground operation 
and the implementation of the wide-ranging right-sizing of our workforce in the last quarter. Taking into account his personal achievements and 
commitment this year, the Board has assessed his personal performance levels as equivalent to 18% of base salary overall. When combined with  
the assessment of Company-wide performance, this equates to a bonus rating of 25% of base salary, compared to a target of 75%, which is equal  
to a payment of £119,700 for the year. 
For 2016, the CEO’s STI opportunity will be 75% of base salary and will be assessed against his 2015 base salary level (i.e. excluding the 10% of 
base salary waived) for target performance with a maximum opportunity of 150% for maximum performance. Broadly, performance measures for 
2016 will continue to focus on production, costs, safety and profitability and will be assessed on the same basis as 2015, Company performance 
(80%) with an element of individual performance (20%).

period and the vesting date is 15 February 2019.
As explained in the introduction to this report, in the event that maximum performance is achieved, the TSR performance condition operates  
so as to deliver up to two times the value of the initial award at the date of vesting. For all awards, additional RSUs are granted to reflect dividends 
paid on Acacia Ordinary Shares prior to the vesting date.

As part of his recruitment package Brad Gordon received a stock option award equal to 841,308 Acacia Ordinary Shares on 21 August 2013, 
representing an award with a fair market value (at the time of grant) equal to one year of base salary (£425,000). The fair market value of the award 
was ascertained using the Monte Carlo Simulation valuation (31.5% of the market value of an Acacia Ordinary Share). The market price of Acacia 
Ordinary Shares at the time of this award was £1.60, assessed on the basis of the average of middle market quotations from the Daily Official List of 
the LSE for the day of grant and the following two dealing days. The award vests in equal parts over four years and expires seven years from the date 
of grant. Vesting is subject to the satisfaction of a TSR performance condition similar to that outlined above for the RSU award made to Mr Gordon  
in 2013. No SOP awards were granted in respect of 2015.
As disclosed in last year’s report, the first tranche of Mr Gordon’s 2013 SOP award was tested for performance as at 20 August 2014. Over the 
relevant period, Acacia TSR of 101.3% exceeded the weighted mean of comparators by 109.4%, which resulted in 100% of this tranche vesting. 
Consequently, 210,327 options became exercisable to Mr Gordon on 20 August 2014. The second tranche of Mr Gordon’s 2013 SOP award  
was tested for performance as at 20 August 2015. Over the relevant period Acacia TSR of 92.9% exceeded the weighted mean of comparators by 
142.8%, and consequently a further 210,327 options became exercisable to Mr Gordon on 20 August 2015. As at 31 December 2015, Mr Gordon 
had not exercised any of these vested awards. 
Percentage change in CEO remuneration
The table below shows the percentage change in CEO remuneration from the prior year compared to the average percentage change in remuneration 
for ELT members. Given that the Company operates across a number of diverse economies with pay levels and structures reflecting local market 
conditions, the Compensation Committee believes that using the ELT as a subset for purposes of comparing CEO remuneration, provides a more 
meaningful comparison than using pay data for all employees.
The CEO’s remuneration includes base salary, taxable benefit and STI payments and for 2015 includes the sum of payments made to Brad Gordon. 
ELT data is based on a consistent set of employees, i.e. the same individuals appear in the 2014 and 2015 populations.

Executive Director exit arrangements (audited)
As noted in the 2013 and 2014 Annual Remuneration Reports, due to a number of commercial sensitivities, the Board took the decision to place 
Greg Hawkins on garden leave following his departure from the Company in August 2013, in accordance with the flexibilities provided to address  
exit arrangements under Executive Director service contracts. As such Greg’s official termination date was 20 August 2014. During this period  
Greg continued to receive a monthly salary and the benefits afforded under his service contract as regards permanent health insurance,  
life assurance and the use of a company car/payment of a car allowance. The exit arrangements also provided for the following:
• The determination of outstanding LTIP awards on a good leaver basis to allow for vesting in accordance with existing vesting schedules,  
subject to satisfaction of applicable performance conditions at the end of each performance period
• Relocation arrangements, up to a maximum amount of £100,000, given his status as an international employee and country of origin  
and the payment of certain legal fees in relation to the execution of exit arrangements
• The cancellation of all outstanding stock options

STRATEGIC REPORT PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION As a result, during the year, Mr Hawkins’ remaining and outstanding LTIP award continued to subsist, subject to being pro-rated to reflect time  
of employment during the relevant performance periods. Vesting is assessed against the TSR performance condition in place at the time the awards 
were granted. The applicable TSR performance condition provides for the assessment of the Company’s TSR performance on a weighted mean 
average against a comparator group of international gold mining companies. The comparator group and basis of assessment under the structure  
of this performance condition is as follows:
Comparators
Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd. IAMGOLD Corp.
AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. Kinross Gold Corporation
Buenaventura Mining Company Petropavlovsk PLC
Centamin plc New Gold Inc
Centerra Gold Inc. Randgold Resources Ltd.

The RSU award granted to Greg Hawkins in February 2013 vested post year end in February 2016. Over the relevant three-year performance period, 
the Company’s TSR was -56%, which was 13.4% above the weighted mean of the applicable comparator group. As a result 167% of the original 
interests awarded were due to vest, subject to pro-rating (as a percentage) made to reflect Mr Hawkins’ official termination date of 20 August 2014,

Directors’ interests in Acacia Ordinary Shares and shareholding requirements (audited)
Executive Directors are required to acquire a minimum holding in Acacia Ordinary Shares equivalent to two times base salary over a period of  
five years. For these purposes, LTIP awards are taken into account but stock options awards made under the SOP are not taken into account when 
assessing whether or not shareholding requirements have been satisfied. Independent Non-Executive Directors are required to acquire a minimum 
holding equivalent to their annual base fee within five years of election to the Board, which may be satisfied via the acquisition of Acacia Ordinary 
Shares or by the receipt of DSU awards under the Acacia DSU Plan. The table opposite shows the shareholding of each Director against their 
respective shareholding requirement as at 31 December 2015 along with the form of their interests in Acacia Ordinary Shares.

Notes:
(a)  RSUs and stock option awards vest subject to a relative TSR performance condition.
(b)  The Company’s DSU Plan for Non-Executive Directors provides Non-Executive Directors with the option to receive some or all of their annual fees in return for a deferred right  
to a cash payment, payable only after a participant ceases to hold office with the Company. Broadly, cash payments under this plan are calculated by reference to the fair  
market value of Acacia’s Ordinary Shares at the time of payment and remain subject to market fluctuations in the context of Acacia’s share price until the time of payment.
(c)  As regards Executive Directors this is calculated by reference to annual base salary at the time of the relevant individual’s appointment against the value of relevant awards at  
the time of grant. As regards existing Independent Non-Executive Directors, this is calculated by reference to either: (i) the annual Non-Executive Director’s base fee at the time  
of adopting the guidelines, if appointed to the Board at that time; or (ii) the annual Non-Executive Director base fee at the time of appointment, assessed against the higher of:  
(i) the number of shares multiplied by the mid market price on the last trading day before the valuation date; or (ii) the number of shares multiplied by the share price on the  
date of acquisition of each relevant interests during the applicable five-year acquisition period. 
(d)  Consists of options awarded on recruitment which vest subject to a relative TSR performance condition.
Subsequent to year end, Brad Gordon’s interests in RSUs were increased to reflect the 2015 LTIP award, taking his aggregate unvested RSUs  
to 1,539,940 RSUs. Details of this award are provided on page 75 of this report. There have been no other changes in Directors’ shareholdings 
between 31 December 2015 and 8 March 2016.
Summary of shareholder voting at the 2015 AGM
The following table shows the results of the advisory vote on the 2014 Remuneration Report at the 2015 AGM:
Total number of votes % votes cast
Directors’ Remuneration Report 2014
For 354,352,718 94.27

Votes cast (excluding withheld votes) 375,879,770 –
Votes withheld 1,879,299 –
Total votes cast (including withheld votes) 377,759,069 –
In the context of shareholder voting, the key area of concern focused on the CEO salary increase for 2015, which represented an increase of 11.5% 
on a year on year basis. However, when taking into account the fact that this represented one increase over a two-year period, this represented  
an increase of only 5.7% per annum since appointment. As noted above, there will be no CEO salary increase for 2016 and as a result of the  
CEO’s election to waive 10% of base salary, the 2016 salary will remain below market norms. The Directors’ Remuneration Policy was last subject  
to a binding vote at the 2014 AGM, when 98.37% of shareholders voted in favour of the relevant resolution.

Strategic Risks 
Single country risk
All of Acacia’s revenue is derived from production at its three operations in 
Tanzania. In order to ensure continued growth, the Group needs to identify new 
resources and development opportunities through exploration and acquisition 
targets. This is particularly the case in the context of the identification of  
potential growth opportunities in other territories, something which is required  
to strengthen the business through geographic diversification in order to mitigate 
the effects that significant in-country developments could have on our operations 
and business.
CEO/CFO/Vice President, 
Exploration
Board Acacia assesses a wide range of potential 
growth opportunities to build on its existing  
portfolio, particularly acquisition and development 
opportunities outside Tanzania to maximise growth 
potential and to help mitigate the effects that 
significant developments in Tanzania could have 
on our business.
• Continuing evaluation of corporate 
development opportunities across Africa. 
• Continued progression of exploration 
projects in Kenya, Burkina Faso and Mali.
High Please see 
our Exploration 
review.
Financial Risks
Significant changes to commodity prices 
Acacia’s financial performance is highly dependent on the price of gold and, 
to a lesser extent, the price of copper and silver. Fluctuations in the pricing of 
these commodities, which are largely attributable to factors beyond Acacia’s 
control, will likely have a corresponding impact on Acacia’s financial condition, 
particularly in the context of rapid pricing fluctuations.
CFO Board Acacia’s strategic objective is to provide maximum 
exposure to the price of gold and we will only 
implement gold hedging in specific short-term 
scenarios to protect viability of certain assets. Acacia 
may enter into hedging arrangements for certain 
commodity exposures (copper, silver and diesel) to 
attempt to mitigate the impact of pricing fluctuations 
for such commodities. We also monitor our exposure 
to commodity price fluctuations as part of financial 
and treasury planning and controls procedures.
• Ongoing review of commodity price 
fluctuations as part of financial 
management controls.
• Ongoing review of hedging policies  
for certain commodities. 
High Please see our 
Financial review.
External Risks
Political, legal and regulatory developments
Acacia’s exploration, development and operational activities are subject to 
extensive laws and regulations governing various matters in the jurisdictions in 
which it operates. Acacia’s ability to conduct its business is dependent on stable 
and consistent interpretation and application of laws and regulations applicable 
to mining activities and its operations, particularly in Tanzania. Changes to existing 
applicable laws and regulations, a more stringent application or interpretation 
of applicable law and regulation, or inconsistencies and irregularities in the 
interpretation of applicable law and regulation by relevant Government authorities 
could adversely affect the progression of Acacia’s operations and development 
projects. Acacia’s operations and financial condition will also be adversely affected 
if existing Mineral Development Agreements are not honoured by the Tanzanian 
Government. The Group may also be adversely affected by changes in global 
economic conditions, and political and/or economic instability in Tanzania  
or any of its surrounding countries.
CEO/Vice President, 
Corporate Affairs
Board Acacia management assesses legal and political 
risks as part of its evaluation of potential projects.  
It actively monitors legal and political developments 
in countries in which its existing operations are 
located. Acacia management actively engages in 
dialogue with Governments and legal policy makers  
in regions in which it is present to discuss all key 
legal and regulatory developments applicable  
to its operations. 
• Continuing enhancement of Governmental 
and regulatory engagement and dialogue.
High Please see the 
Strategic report.
Continuity of power supply
Power stoppages, fluctuations and disruptions in power supply, particularly 
electricity supply in Tanzania, could result in production stoppages and, as a  
result of increased dependency on diesel usage, could increase operating costs.
CEO/CFO Board Acacia has made a number of investments in power 
generation capacities at its operations, such that 
we have capacity for the self generation of power  
to maintain critical systems across sites. We also 
assess our power supply sources to introduce cost 
saving efficiencies where possible. 
• Continued assessment of power 
improvement projects. 
• Continued review of additional power 
stabilisation options for operations.

of applicable law and regulation, or inconsistencies and irregularities in the 
interpretation of applicable law and regulation by relevant Government authorities 
could adversely affect the progression of Acacia’s operations and development 
projects. Acacia’s operations and financial condition will also be adversely affected 
if existing Mineral Development Agreements are not honoured by the Tanzanian 
Government. The Group may also be adversely affected by changes in global 
economic conditions, and political and/or economic instability in Tanzania  
or any of its surrounding countries.
CEO/Vice President, 
Corporate Affairs
Board Acacia management assesses legal and political 
risks as part of its evaluation of potential projects.  
It actively monitors legal and political developments 
in countries in which its existing operations are 
located. Acacia management actively engages in 
dialogue with Governments and legal policy makers  
in regions in which it is present to discuss all key 
legal and regulatory developments applicable  
to its operations. 
• Continuing enhancement of Governmental 
and regulatory engagement and dialogue.

Strategic report.
Continuity of power supply
Power stoppages, fluctuations and disruptions in power supply, particularly 
electricity supply in Tanzania, could result in production stoppages and, as a  
result of increased dependency on diesel usage, could increase operating costs.
CEO/CFO Board Acacia has made a number of investments in power 
generation capacities at its operations, such that 
we have capacity for the self generation of power  
to maintain critical systems across sites. We also 
assess our power supply sources to introduce cost 
saving efficiencies where possible. 
• Continued assessment of power 
improvement projects. 
• Continued review of additional power 
stabilisation options for operations.

EHS&S Acacia’s security management system provides 
for a number of measures that protect employees, 
assets and operations. Measures include the 
ongoing development of security personnel and the 
implementation and, where appropriate, upgrading 
of security infrastructure, such as perimeter fencing, 
surveillance equipment and security checks and 
procedures. Where appropriate, Acacia also works

Directors’ indemnity and insurance
In accordance with Acacia’s Articles of Association and to the extent 
permitted by the Companies Act 2006, Acacia may indemnify its 
Directors out of its own funds to cover liabilities incurred as a result  
of their office. The relevant provision contained in the Articles can be 
categorised as a “qualifying third-party indemnity provision” under  
the Companies Act 2006. Acacia has adopted Directors’ and Officers’ 
liability insurance, which provides insurance cover for any claim brought 
against Directors or officers for wrongful acts in connection with their 
positions. The insurance provided does not extend to claims arising from 
fraud or dishonesty and it does not provide cover for civil or criminal fines 
or penalties imposed by law.
Global GHG emissions data for period 1 January 2015  
to 31 December 2015
According to the GHG Protocol developed by the World Business Council 
for Sustainable Development and the World Resources Institute, GHG 
emissions are classified as either direct or indirect, and from there are 
divided further into Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions. Direct 
GHG emissions are emissions from sources that are owned or controlled 
by the reporting entity. Indirect GHG emissions are emissions that are  
a consequence of the activities of the reporting entity but that occur at 
sources owned or controlled by another entity. Each scope is classified 
as follows:
• Scope 1 emissions: direct emissions from sources owned or operated 
by our Company.
• Scope 2 emissions: indirect emissions attributable to our Company 
due to its consumption of purchased electricity, notably our 
consumption of electricity from TANESCO.
• Scope 3 emissions: all other indirect emissions associated with 
activities that support or supply our Company’s operations.
For 2015, in light of practicalities, we have calculated Acacia’s Scope 1 
and Scope 2 emissions footprint on the basis of carbon dioxide emissions 
only and will look to measure and report on other greenhouse gases in 
future reporting years. Going forward, we will also look at opportunities 
to monitor and calculate Scope 3 emissions.

Total CO

 emissions for 2015 amounted to 370,092 tonnes, a 0.4% 
decrease on 2014 (371,508 CO
2
). The reduction in Scope 1 emissions 
was offset by increased consumption of purchased electricity from 
hydropower sources as part of our energy conservation strategy. 
In addition, the Company monitors its GHG emissions ratio on  
the basis of CO
2
 produced per tonnes of ore milled. For 2015 this 
equated to 0.0399 per tonne of ore milled, this being a 10% decrease  
on 2014 (0.0444), due to increased throughput at Bulyanhulu.

in Notes 2 and 32 to the consolidated financial statements contained

Material agreements containing change of control 
provisions/significant agreements with Directors/ 
Controlling Shareholders 
The Directors consider the following as material agreements/
arrangements for Acacia’s business and operations, which alter or 
terminate on a change of control of Acacia and/or significant agreements 
with Directors/Barrick:
• Relationship Agreement: see page 55 of this report for an overview of 
the Relationship Agreement. In addition to the Relationship Agreement, 
Acacia entered into a Services Agreement with Barrick in February 
2010 as part of arrangements for the IPO, under which Barrick 
provides certain services to the Acacia Group for the ongoing 
operation of the business. These services include support for 
information technology, technical services and other administrative 
and corporate functions. The agreement’s termination events include 
a basis for either party to terminate the agreement with immediate 
effect in the event of specified breaches of the agreement, insolvency, 
analogous events or a change of control. Whilst this agreement 
remains in force, limited services are provided under it and no 
services provided are deemed to be material or significant.
• Credit Agreement: an overview of the Credit Agreement between, 
among others, the Company and Citibank International plc as 
administrative agent, is provided in Note 30 to the consolidated 
financial statements on page 134. A change of control is a mandatory 
prepayment event under the Credit Agreement and, subject to certain 
exceptions, a termination event.
Acacia’s mining concessions are held by its operating companies in 
Tanzania. Under applicable law, a change of control of the operating 
companies requires the consent of the Minister of Energy and Minerals 
in Tanzania. In addition, each Acacia Group operating mine has a Mineral 
Development Agreement (‘MDA’) with the Tanzanian Government. The 
material terms and conditions of each MDA are substantially similar and 
include provisions governing royalty payments, taxes and other charges, 
banking arrangements, local procurement obligations, and import rights. 
The MDAs also provide for no expropriation or nationalisation rights. 
Broadly, these rights provide that the Tanzanian Government will not 
nationalise or compulsorily acquire the whole or any part of Acacia’s 
interest in the applicable special mining licences or any of its property  
or its contractors’ or subcontractors’ property used for the purpose of 
mining operations or in relation to the applicable special mining licences, 
without adequate compensation. Each MDA is governed by Tanzanian 
law. Adherence to the terms and conditions of the MDAs is of significant 
importance to Acacia’s business, given the agreements’ overall 
importance to our operations.
Certain employment contracts for members of the Company’s Executive 
Leadership Team, excluding the current CEO, contain change of control 
provisions, which provide entitlements to severance payments in the 
event of being dismissed without cause or resigning for good reason in 
the 12 months following a change of control. Any payment made under 
these arrangements would replace the entitlement to receive payment 
under applicable contractual notice periods in each case. Special 
provisions also allow the early exercise of awards made under the 
Company’s Stock Option Plan (‘SOP’) and early vesting of awards made 
under the Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’), in the event of a takeover, 
reconstruction or winding up. In such circumstances, the Compensation 
Committee determines whether and to what extent options or awards 
become exercisable, by taking into account all relevant facts and 
circumstances including, but not limited to, satisfaction of any applicable 
performance condition. When determining the vesting of LTIP awards or 
options, the Compensation Committee may proportionately reduce the 
award depending on the time which has elapsed between the first day of 
the performance period and the date of change of control. Alternatively, 
awards may be exchanged for new equivalent awards where appropriate.
Going concern
The Directors’ statement on Going Concern is contained on page 41  
of this Annual Report.
Corporate governance compliance
The corporate governance statement as required by Rule 7.2.1 of  
the UKLA’s Disclosure Rules and Transparency Rules is set out in the 
corporate governance report on pages 48 to 62 of this Annual Report.  
All information detailed in the corporate governance statement is 
incorporated by reference into this Directors’ Report and is deemed  
to form part of this Directors’ Report.
Articles of Association
The Company’s Articles of Association may be amended by special 
resolution of the shareholders.
Shareholder rights
The rights and obligations attaching to the Ordinary Shares contained  
in the Articles of Association are as follows:

Articles of Association for any class of share, at any general meeting 
every member who is present in person or by proxy shall, on a show of 
hands, have one vote and every member present in person or by proxy 
shall, on a poll, have one vote for each share of which he or she is the 
holder. A resolution put to a vote of the meeting shall be decided on a 
show of hands, unless a poll is duly demanded. Subject to the provisions 
of the Companies Act 2006, a poll may be demanded by the Chairman; 
by at least five members who have the right to vote at the meeting; by  
a member or members representing not less than one-tenth of the total 
voting rights of all the members having the right to vote at the meeting; 
or by a member or members holding shares conferring a right to vote  
at the meeting, being shares on which an aggregate sum has been paid 
up equal to not less than one-tenth of the total sum paid up on all the 
shares conferring that right. Unless the Directors otherwise determine,

been issued with a notice pursuant to Section 793 of the Companies Act 
2006 (requiring disclosure of interest in shares) and has failed to provide 
the required information within 14 days from the service of the notice.
Dividend rights
The Board may declare and pay dividends on any class of shares carrying 
a fixed dividend expressed to be payable on fixed dates and may from 
time to time pay interim dividends as it thinks fit. Final dividends shall  
be declared by ordinary shareholder resolution, in accordance with Board 
recommendations. No dividend declared by shareholders shall exceed 
the amount recommended by the Board. Provided that the Board acts in 
good faith, it shall not incur any liability to shareholders for any loss that 
they may suffer by the lawful payment of any fixed or interim dividend  
on any shares ranking after or pari passu with those shares. Except as 
otherwise provided by the rights attached to shares, all dividends shall 
be apportioned and paid proportionately to the amounts paid up on the 
shares during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which 
the dividend is paid, but if any share is issued on terms providing that it 
shall rank for dividend as from a particular date, it shall rank for dividend 
accordingly. No amount paid up on a share in advance of the date on 
which a call is payable shall be treated as paid up on the share.
Payment of any dividend declared may be satisfied wholly or partly by  
the distribution of specific assets, and in particular of paid up shares or 
debentures of the Company, with shareholder approval. The Directors may 
retain any dividend or other money payable on or in respect of a share on 
which the Company has a lien and may apply the same towards satisfaction 
of the monies payable to the Company in respect of that share.
Unless the Directors otherwise determine, the payment of any dividend 
or other money that would otherwise be payable in respect of shares  
will be withheld, and the Company shall have no obligation to pay  
interest on it, if such shares represent at least 0.25% of the nominal 
value of the issued share capital of their class and the holder, or any 
other person appearing to be interested in those shares, has been 
issued with a Section 793 notice and has failed to supply the information 
required by such notice within 14 days. Furthermore, such a holder  
shall not be entitled to elect to receive shares instead of a dividend.  
The payment by the Board of any unclaimed dividend or other monies  
on or in respect of a share into a separate account shall not constitute 
Acacia a trustee in respect thereof. All dividends unclaimed for a period 
of 12 years after having been declared or become due for payment  
shall be forfeited and shall revert to Acacia.
Transfer of shares
Subject to any applicable restrictions, each member may transfer all  
or any of his or her shares, which are in certificated form, by instrument 
of transfer in writing in any usual form or in any other form acceptable  
to the Board and may be under hand only. Such instrument shall be 
executed by or on behalf of the transferor and (in the case of a transfer 
of a share which is not fully paid up) by or on behalf of the transferee. 
The transferor shall be deemed to remain the holder of such share until 
the name of the transferee is entered in the register in respect of it.
All transfers of shares which are in uncertificated form shall, unless the 
CREST regulations otherwise provide, be effected on a relevant system.
The Directors may, in their absolute discretion and without giving any 
reason, refuse to register any transfer of a share in certificated form  
(or renunciation of a renounceable letter of allotment) unless:
(i) it is in respect of a share which is fully paid up;
(ii) it is in respect of only one class of shares;
(iii) it is in favour of not more than four joint transferees;
(iv) it is lodged duly stamped (if so required) at the transfer office;
(v) it is accompanied by the relevant certificate for the shares to which  
it relates and such other evidence as the Directors may reasonably 
require to prove the title of the transferor and the due execution  
of the transfer or, if the transfer is executed by some other person  
on his behalf, the authority of that person to do so; and
(vi) in the case of partly paid shares listed on the London Stock 
Exchange, such refusal would prevent dealings in such shares from 
taking place on an open and proper basis.
Unless the Board otherwise determines, a transfer of shares will not  
be registered if the transferor or any other person appearing to be 
interested in the transferor’s shares has been issued with Section 793 
shares in respect of shares representing at least 0.25% of their class 
and the relevant information has not been supplied within 14 days. This 
restriction on transfer will not automatically apply if the member is not 
personally in default as regards supplying the information required and 
the proposed transfer is only part of the member’s holding, provided that 
certain requirements are satisfied at the time of presenting the transfer 
for registration.
Division of assets on a winding up
If the Company is wound up the liquidator may, with the sanction of  
a shareholder special resolution, divide the whole or any part of the 
Company’s assets between shareholders. In such circumstances  
the liquidator may value any assets and determine how the division  
shall be carried out as between the shareholders or different classes  
of shareholder. Subject to certain requirements, the liquidator may also 
vest any part of the assets in trustees on such trusts for the benefit  
of the shareholders, but no shareholder shall be compelled to accept  
any assets on which there is a liability.
Variation of rights
If at any time the share capital of the Company is divided into shares  
of different classes, rights attached to a class may only be varied in  
such manner (if any) as may be provided by prescribed rights or, in the 
absence of any such provision, either with the consent in writing of the 
holders of not less than three-quarters in nominal value of the issued 
shares of the class or with the sanction of a special resolution passed  
at a separate general meeting of the holders of shares of the class duly 
convened and held.

STRATEGIC REPORT PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION Powers of Directors 
Managing the business
Acacia’s business is managed by the Board, and the Articles of 
Association permit the Board to exercise all of the Company’s powers  
in this regard. These powers may be exercised by any meeting of the 
Board at which a quorum of two Directors is present. The power of the 
Board to manage the business is subject to any limitations imposed  
by the Companies Act, the Articles of Association or any directions  
given by special resolution of the shareholders applicable at a relevant 
time. The Articles contain an express authority for the appointment  
of Executive Directors and provide the Directors with the authority to 
delegate or confer upon such Directors any of the powers exercisable  
by them upon such terms and conditions and with such restrictions  
as they see fit. The Articles contain additional authorities to delegate 
powers and discretions to Board committees and subcommittees.
Borrowing powers
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, the CREST 
regulations and any other applicable law, the Directors may exercise  
all the powers of the Company to borrow money, guarantee, indemnify, 
mortgage or charge its undertaking, property (present and future) and 
uncalled capital or any part or parts thereof and issue debentures and 
other securities, whether outright or as collateral security for any debt, 
liability or obligation of Acacia or of any third party up to a maximum 
amount of two times the aggregate of the Group’s adjusted total equity, 
calculated in accordance with the procedure contained in the Articles  
of Association. Borrowings in excess of this amount require prior 
shareholder approval.
New issues of shares
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, the CREST 
regulations and every other enactment for the time being in force relating 
to the Directors’ authority to allot shares and/or the disapplication  
of pre-emption rights and to any resolution of the Company in general 
meeting regarding the same, the Directors may allot (with or without 
conferring a right of renunciation), grant options over or otherwise 
dispose of them to such persons, at such times and on such terms  
as they think appropriate.
Acacia’s shareholders passed the following resolutions relating to  
the allotment and pre-emption right disapplications at the 2015 AGM:
(i) The Directors were granted authority to allot new shares (or grant 
rights to subscribe for or convert securities into shares) up to a 
nominal value of £13,532,821, equivalent to approximately 33%  
of the total issued Ordinary Share capital of the Company, exclusive 
of treasury shares, at the time of passing the resolution. In addition 
to this, the Directors were also granted authority to allot additional 
new shares (or grant rights to subscribe for or convert any security 
into shares) up to a further nominal amount of £13,532,821, but  
only in connection with a rights issue.
(ii) Pre-emption rights were disapplied over new shares allotted  
for cash pursuant to the authority granted at (i) above, but only:  
(a) in connection with a pre-emptive offer or rights issue; or  
(b) otherwise up to a nominal value of £2,050,427 (equivalent  
to approximately 5% of the Company’s total issued Ordinary Share 
capital at the time of passing the resolution).
These authorities have not been exercised during the reporting  
period and will expire on the date of the forthcoming AGM. Equivalent 
resolutions for a renewal of these authorities will be put to the 
shareholders at the forthcoming AGM, as amended to reflect the 
Pre-Emption Group’s revised Statement of Principles that provide  
for certain non-pre-emptive allocations in the context of acquisitions  
and specified capital investments.
Appointment and replacement of Directors
Shareholders may appoint any person who is willing to act as a Director 
by ordinary resolution and may remove any Director by ordinary resolution. 
The Board may appoint any person to fill any vacancy or as an additional 
Director, provided that they are submitted for re-election by the 
shareholders at the AGM following their appointment.
Specific conditions apply to the vacation of office, including cases where 
a Director becomes prohibited by law or regulation from holding office,  
or is persistently absent from Directors’ meetings, or if three-quarters  
of appointed Directors request his or her resignation or in the case of 
mental incapacity or bankruptcy. Barrick’s rights to appoint Directors  
are summarised on page 55. Additional information regarding Director 
re-election requirements is provided on page 53 as part of the corporate 
governance report.

88 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015
OTHER INFORMATION CONTINUED Under applicable UK law, the Directors are responsible  
for preparing the Annual Report, the consolidated financial 
statements and parent company financial statements  
in accordance with applicable law and regulation.
Responsibility for financial statements
The Companies Act 2006 requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have 
prepared the Group and parent company financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’)  
as adopted by the European Union. Under company law, the Directors 
must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied  
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group  
and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently
• Make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent
• State whether applicable IFRS as adopted by the European Union 
have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements
• Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it 
is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions  
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial  
position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure  
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, 
as regards the Group’s consolidated financial statements, Article 4 of 
the IAS Regulations. They are also responsible for taking such steps as 
are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Company 
and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of  
the Company’s website and legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement required by Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules 
The Directors, whose names and functions are set out on pages 50  
to 51 of this Annual Report, confirm to the best of their knowledge that: 
• The financial statements, prepared in accordance with applicable 
accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and  
the undertakings included in the consolidation as a whole.
• The management report, which is incorporated into the Directors’ 
Report, includes a fair review of the development or performance of 
the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation as a whole, together with a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

STRATEGIC REPORT PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES STATEMENT Mineral reserves and mineral resources estimates contained in this 
Annual Report have been calculated as at 31 December 2015 in 
accordance with National Instrument 43-101 as required by Canadian 
securities regulatory authorities, unless otherwise stated. Canadian 
Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (‘CIM’) definitions were 
followed for mineral reserves and resources. Calculations have been 
reviewed, verified (including estimation methodology, sampling, analytical 
and test data) and compiled by Acacia personnel under the supervision 
of Acacia Qualified Person: Haydn Hadlow, Technical Services Manager. 
However, the figures stated are estimates and no assurances can be  
given that the indicated quantities of metal will be produced. In addition, 
totals stated may not add up due to rounding.
Mineral reserves have been calculated using an assumed long-term 
average gold price of US$1,100 per ounce, a silver price of US$15.00 
per ounce and a copper price of US$2.50 per pound. 
Reserve calculations incorporate current and/or expected mine plans 
and cost levels at each property and reflect contained ounces.
Mineral resources at Acacia mines have been calculated using an assumed 
long-term average gold price of US$1,400 per ounce, a silver price of 
US$15.00 per ounce and a copper price of US$2.50 per pound and 
reflect contained ounces. 
Mineral resources at Acacia exploration properties have been calculated 
using an assumed long-term average gold price of US$1,500.00  
per ounce.
Resources have been estimated using varying cut-off grades, depending  
on the type of mine or project, its maturity and ore types at each 
property. Reserve estimates are dynamic and are influenced by changing 
economic conditions, technical issues, environmental regulations and 
any other relevant new information and therefore these can vary from 
year to year. Resource estimates can also change and tend to be 
influenced mostly by new information pertaining to the understanding  
of the deposit and secondly the conversion to ore reserves. In addition, 
estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of an 
economic analysis and it cannot be assumed that all or any part of an 
inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. 
Therefore, investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of 
an inferred mineral resource exists, that it can be economically or legally 
mined, or that it will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Likewise, 
investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of measured  
or indicated mineral resources will ever be upgraded to mineral reserves. 
Definitions 
A Mineral Resource
A concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in or 
on the Earth’s crust in such form, grade or quality and quantity that there 
are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. The location, 
quantity, grade or quality, continuity and other geological characteristics 
of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific 
geological evidence and knowledge, including sampling. Material of 
economic interest refers to diamonds, natural solid inorganic material,  
or natural solid fossilised organic material including base and precious 
metals, coal, and industrial minerals. Mineral Resources are sub-divided, 
in order of increasing geological confidence, into Inferred, Indicated and 
Measured categories. An Inferred Mineral Resource has a lower level  
of confidence than that applied to an Indicated Mineral Resource.  
An Indicated Mineral Resource has a higher level of confidence than  
an Inferred Mineral Resource but has a lower level of confidence than  
a Measured Mineral Resource.
An Inferred Mineral Resource 
The part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or quality 
are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling 
gathered through appropriate sampling techniques from locations such 
as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes. Geological evidence 
is sufficient to imply but not verify geological and grade or quality 
continuity. An Inferred Mineral Resource has a lower level of confidence 
than that applying to an Indicated Mineral Resource and must not be 
converted to a Mineral Reserve. It is reasonably expected that the 
majority of Inferred Mineral Resources could be upgraded to Indicated 
Mineral Resources with continued exploration. 
An Indicated Mineral Resource
The part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, 
densities, shape and physical characteristics are estimated with 
sufficient confidence to allow the application of Modifying Factors in 
sufficient detail to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic 
viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is derived from adequately 
detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing and is sufficient 
to assume geological and grade or quality continuity between points  
of observation. An Indicated Mineral Resource has a lower level of 
confidence than that applying to a Measured Mineral Resource and  
may only be converted to a Probable Mineral Reserve. 
A Measured Mineral Resource 
The part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, 
densities, shape, and physical characteristics are estimated with 
confidence sufficient to allow the application of Modifying Factors to 
support detailed mine planning and final evaluation of the economic 
viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is derived from detailed  
and reliable exploration, sampling and testing and is sufficient to confirm 
geological and grade or quality continuity between points of observation. 
A Measured Mineral Resource has a higher level of confidence than that 
applying to either an Indicated Mineral Resource or an Inferred Mineral 
Resource. It may be converted to a Proven Mineral Reserve or to  
a Probable Mineral Reserve.
A Mineral Reserve
The economically mineable part of a Measured and/or Indicated Mineral 
Resource. It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses, which 
may occur when the material is mined or extracted and is defined by 
studies at Pre-Feasibility or Feasibility level as appropriate that include 
application of Modifying Factors. Such studies demonstrate that, at the 
time of reporting, extraction could reasonably be justified. Mineral 
Reserves are sub-divided in order of increasing confidence into Probable 
Mineral Reserves and Proven Mineral Reserves. A Probable Mineral 
Reserve has a lower level of confidence than a Proven Mineral Reserve.
Modifying Factors
These are considerations used to convert Mineral Resources to Mineral 
Reserves. These include, but are not restricted to, mining, processing, 
metallurgical, infrastructure, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, 
social and governmental factors.
A Probable Mineral Reserve
The economically mineable part of an Indicated, and in some 
circumstances, a Measured Mineral Resource. The confidence in the 
Modifying Factors applying to a Probable Mineral Reserve is lower than 
that applying to a Proven Mineral Reserve. Probable Mineral Reserve 
estimates must be demonstrated to be economic, at the time of 
reporting, by at least a Pre-Feasibility Study.
A Proven Mineral Reserve
The economically mineable part of a Measured Mineral Resource.  
A Proven Mineral Reserve implies a high degree of confidence in  
the Modifying Factors. Proven Mineral Reserve estimates must be 
demonstrated to be economic, at the time of reporting, by at least  
a Pre-Feasibility Study.

ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 93
STRATEGIC REPORT PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION REPORT ON THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our opinion
In our opinion, Acacia Mining plc’s Group financial statements  
(the “financial statements”):
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 
31 December 2015 and of its loss and cash flows for the year  
then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the  
European Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements  
of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
What we have audited
The financial statements, included within the Annual Report  
and Accounts (the “Annual Report”), comprise:
• the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2015;
• the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement  
of comprehensive income for the year then ended;
• the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year  
then ended;
• the consolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended; and
• the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary  
of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the 
Annual Report, rather than in the notes to the financial statements. 
These are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are 
identified as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs  
as adopted by the European Union.
Our audit approach
Overview
Materiality • Overall Group materiality: US$5.7 million  
which represents approximately 5% of 
three-year average profit before tax adjusted  
for “Impairment charges” and items included 
within “Other Charges” (as presented on the 
face of the consolidated income statement  
and detailed within notes 7 and 10).
Scope • We identified three mine sites located in 
Tanzania which, in our view, required an  
audit of their complete financial information.
• We conducted other audit procedures in 
London, South Africa, and Tanzania.
• Taken together, the territories and functions 
where we performed our audit work accounted 
for 100% of revenue and approximately 88%  
of absolute profit before tax (i.e. the sum of  
the numerical values without regard to whether 
they were profits or losses for the relevant 
territories and functions).
Areas of focus • Impairment assessments of goodwill, intangible 
assets and property, plant & equipment.
• The recoverability of the supplies inventory 
balance at the Buzwagi site.
• Taxation including provisions for uncertain 
deferred tax positions and the recoverability  
of indirect taxes.
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards  
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the  
risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, 
we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for 
example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved 
making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently 
uncertain. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of 
management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether 
there was evidence of bias by the Directors that represented a risk  
of material misstatement due to fraud. 
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our 
audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are identified 
as “areas of focus” in the table opposite. We have also set out how  
we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in order to provide  
an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments 
we make on the results of our procedures should be read in this context. 
This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit. 
94 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ACACIA MINING PLC Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Impairment assessments of goodwill, intangible assets  
and property, plant & equipment
Refer to page 58 (Audit Committee report), page 106 (critical accounting 
estimates and judgements), page 111 (principal accounting policies)  
and note 7.
Acacia Mining has goodwill of US$127.9 million, indefinite-lived intangible 
assets of US$83.3 million and property, plant and equipment of 
US$1,390.7 million as at 31 December 2015 primarily contained within  
the following cash generating units (“CGUs”); Bulyanhulu, North Mara,  
and Buzwagi.
The Bulyanhulu CGU which has a carrying value of $1,257.3 million contains 
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and therefore must be tested 
for impairment on an annual basis. 
Management must also determine the recoverable amount for other assets 
including property, plant and equipment when impairment indicators are 
identified.
As at 31 December 2015, being management’s testing date, the Buzwagi 
and North Mara CGUs had a carrying value of $269.4 million (excluding 
impairment charges of $188.7 million) and $284.9 million respectively  
and management identified an impairment indicator due to the continued 
decrease in the gold price during the year which reduced the price 
assumption used to calculate the mines’ reserve and resource estimations.
The determination of recoverable amount was based on the higher of 
value-in-use and fair value less costs to dispose, which requires judgement 
on the part of management in valuing the relevant CGUs.
Recoverable amounts are based on management’s views of variables  
such as future commodity prices, the most appropriate discount rate  
and timing and approval of future capital and operating expenditure.
As a result of its assessment, management has recorded a pre-tax 
impairment charge of US$146.2 million in relation to assets within  
the Buzwagi CGU which includes an allocation to non-current inventory  
and supplies inventory.
We considered management’s impairment trigger analysis and agreed 
that an indicator existed.
In assessing the valuation of the CGUs, we evaluated management’s 
future cash flow forecasts for each CGU, and the process by which they 
were drawn up, including verifying the mathematical accuracy of the  
cash flow models and agreeing future capital and operating expenditure 
to the latest Board approved budgets and the latest approved life of  
mine plans. 
For each CGU we used our valuation specialists to assist us in  
evaluating the appropriateness of key market related assumptions in 
management’s valuation models, including both short-term and long-term 
gold prices, and discount rates. 
We assessed the reasonableness of management’s future forecasts  
of capital and operating expenses included in the cash flow forecasts  
in light of the historical accuracy of such forecasts and the current 
operational results.
We performed sensitivity analysis around the key assumptions within  
the cash flow forecasts using a range of higher discount rates and lower 
long-term gold prices based on what, in our view, a market participant 
may apply. 
For the Buzwagi CGU, the estimation of recoverable amount is highly 
sensitive to changes in gold price assumptions. However, due to the 
short remaining mine life, changes to the discount rate do not have  
a significant impact on recoverable amount. We formed an independent 
view of the gold price that a market participant might use in a fair value 
less cost to dispose scenario which indicated a range of possible values 
for the CGU. Management’s estimate of recoverable amount was in  
the mid-point of this range and was considered reasonable. The carrying 
value exceeded this estimated recoverable amount, resulting in the  
need for an impairment charge. We considered the allocation of the 
impairment charge between supplies inventory, non-current inventories 
and property, plant and equipment and were satisfied that the 
methodology applied was appropriate. 
With regards to the North Mara and Bulyanhulu CGUs, management’s 
estimated recoverable amounts supported the carrying value of these 
assets as at 31 December 2015. In assessing the level of headroom  
at these CGUs we performed downside sensitivities based on a range  
of possible gold prices and discount rates, concluding that headroom 
was maintained under these scenarios. Consequently, no impairment 
charge was considered necessary, although the estimate of recoverable 
amount remains sensitive to changes in these key assumptions. 
We validated the appropriateness of the related disclosures in note 7 of 
the financial statements, including the sensitivities provided with respect 
to the CGUs.
The recoverability of the supplies inventory balance at the Buzwagi site
Refer to page 58 (Audit Committee report), page 106 (critical accounting 
estimates and judgements), page 109 (principal accounting policies) and 
note 17.
The Group has a material supplies inventory balance at the Buzwagi site.  
We focused on this area because of the risk of existence of the large 
quantity of supplies inventory on hand, in addition to the short remaining  
life of mines that could have an adverse impact on the valuation of the 
inventory.
As part of the impairment assessment noted above, management has 
booked a provision of $39.7 million for supplies inventory at Buzwagi that  
is not expected to be used during the remaining mine life. The net carrying 
value as at 31 December 2015 is US$35.1 million.
We considered the methodology applied by management to identify  
slow moving and surplus supplies inventory including validating the 
identification of aged items and considered it an appropriate method  
to determine an estimate of recoverability. 
With regards to the existence of supplies inventory, we attended 
inventory sample counts performed by local management at year end  
at all three mine sites. During these counts we observed management’s 
count procedures and performed independent test counts by selecting a 
sample of items from both the accounting records and from the inventory 
on hand. Management’s count procedures were considered appropriate. 
No significant exceptions in management’s count procedures, or 
unexplained variances from our test counts were identified.

STRATEGIC REPORT PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough 
work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, 
taking into account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting 
processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates. 
The Group’s assets and operations are primarily located at three mine 
sites in Tanzania, representing the Group’s three CGUs noted above. 
Financial reporting processes related to the activities of these mine  
sites are undertaken at shared business centres (“SBCs”) located  
in Dar es Salaam and Johannesburg.
In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we determined 
the type of work that needed to be performed at each of the three  
mine sites and the SBCs by us, as the Group engagement team, and  
by component auditors from other PwC network firms operating under  
our instruction. We requested that full scope audits were performed  
at each of the three main mine sites which included the relevant SBC.  
In addition, we conducted other audit procedures in London, South Africa 
and Tanzania, including specified procedures performed by a component 
audit team in South Africa over exploration expenses incurred within 
Acacia Exploration Kenya due to the quantum of costs incurred during 
the current year. Where the work was performed by component auditors, 
we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit 
work at those sites and SBCs to be able to conclude whether sufficient 
appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion 
on the Group financial statements as a whole.
Involvement of the Group engagement team included site visits at two of the 
three mines, attendance at Acacia’s Tanzanian and South African offices, 
conference calls and meetings with the Tanzanian audit team, review  
of the Tanzanian auditor work papers, attendance at local audit clearance 
meetings, and other forms of communication as considered necessary 
depending on the significance of the accounting and audit issues arising.
Taken together, the territories and functions where we performed our audit 
work accounted for 100% of revenue and approximately 88% of absolute 
profit before tax (i.e. the sum of the numerical values without regard to 
whether they were profits or losses for the relevant territories and functions).
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. 
We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together 
with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope  
of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures  
on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and  
in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the 
financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for  
the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall Group 
materiality
US$5.7 million (2014: US$8.45 million).
How we  
determined it
Approximately 5% of three-year average profit before tax 
adjusted for “Impairment charges” and items included 
within “Other Charges” (as presented on the face of the 
consolidated income statement and detailed within notes 
7 and 10).
Rationale for 
benchmark  
applied
In 2014 our benchmark for materiality was the profit  
before tax for the year, adjusted for other charges to 
eliminate the impact of the volatility resulting from those 
charges. This year, there has been further volatility resulting 
from movements in the gold market. To eliminate this 
further volatility, we changed our materiality benchmark  
to the average adjusted profit over the last three years.  
We continued to determine materiality based on 5%  
of our chosen benchmark. The result is, nonetheless,  
that our materiality is significantly lower than last year. 
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Taxation including provisions for uncertain deferred tax positions  
and the recoverability of indirect taxes
Refer to page 58 (Audit Committee report), page 106 (critical accounting 
estimates and judgements), page 114 (principal accounting policies)  
and note 34.
The Group has material deferred tax balances which include prior year  
tax loss assessments that continue to be in dispute with the Tanzanian 
Revenue Authority.
In addition, the Group has recorded significant indirect tax receivables,  
of which a material amount has not been refunded in a timely manner.
We read correspondence between management and the Tanzanian 
Revenue Authority and assessed management’s position in relation  
to the specific matters disputed. Refer to note 34 for tax related 
contingencies disclosed.
In relation to deferred tax, we also assessed the availability of estimated 
future taxable income to utilise recognised carry forward losses and  
the reversal of temporary deferred tax differences by comparing the 
estimates to the latest Board approved budgets and the latest approved 
life of mine plans. We assessed the impact of the revised life of mine 
plans and the impairment at Buzwagi and satisfied ourselves that the 
reduction in deferred tax asset in relation to losses at the operation  
was calculated appropriately and was consistent with the underlying 
trading assumptions.
We also determined based on payments received to date and the 
existence of a memorandum of settlement with the Tanzanian Revenue 
Authority for the long-term element of the receivable, that the indirect tax 
receivables are recoverable, and appropriately classified as non-current 
based on the expected future tax payable from 2017. 
We examined the Annual Report disclosures to ensure the risk 
associated with recovery was appropriately highlighted.
96 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ACACIA MINING PLC CONTINUED We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them 
misstatements identified during our audit above US$1 million  
(2014: US$1 million) as well as misstatements below that amount  
that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ 
statement, set out on page 41, in relation to going concern. We have 
nothing to report having performed our review.
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are also required to report to you if we  
have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to  
the Directors’ statement about whether they considered it appropriate  
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. 
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to.
As noted in the Directors’ statement, the Directors have concluded  
that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements. The going concern basis presumes that the Group 
has adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the Directors 
intend it to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial 
statements were signed. As part of our audit we have concluded that  
the Directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate. However, 
because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these 
statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue  
as a going concern.
OTHER REQUIRED REPORTING

the information necessary for members to assess 
the Group’s position and performance, business 
model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with 
our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course 
of performing our audit.
We have no 
exceptions

Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ 
statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group and the Directors’ statement in relation 
to the longer-term viability of the Group, set out on page 23. Our  
review was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted 
of making inquiries and considering the Directors’ process supporting  
their statements; checking that the statements are in alignment  
with the relevant provisions of the Code; and considering whether  
the statements are consistent with the knowledge acquired by us  
in the course of performing our audit. We have nothing to report

STRATEGIC REPORT PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
AND THE AUDIT
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement  
set out on page 89, the Directors are responsible for the preparation  
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the 
Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16  
of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving 
these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose  
or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands  
it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that 
the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made  
by the Directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ 
judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements,  
and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing 
techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable 
basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through 
testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or  
a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in  
the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit.  
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
OTHER MATTERS
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements 
of Acacia Mining plc for the year ended 31 December 2015 and on the 
information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as 
having been audited.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2. Significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these 
consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies  
have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless 
otherwise stated.
a) Basis of preparation
The Group’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared  
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union (‘IFRS’), IFRS Interpretations Committee 
(‘IFRS IC’) interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements 
are prepared on a going concern basis.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under  
the historical cost convention basis, as modified by the revaluation of 
financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) 
at fair value through profit or loss.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in United States 
dollars (‘US$’) and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand  
US dollars except when otherwise indicated.
Where a change in the presentational format between the prior year  
and current year financial statements has been made during the period, 
comparative figures have been restated accordingly. No presentational 
changes were made in the current year.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS  
requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires 
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the 
Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of 
judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates  
are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed  
in Note 2d.
b) New and amended standards adopted by the Group
The following new standards and amendments to standards are 
applicable and were adopted by the Group for the first time for the 
financial year beginning 1 January 2015.
• Amendment to IFRS 2, ‘Share-based payment’. The amendment 
clarifies the definition of a ‘vesting condition’ and separately defines 
‘performance condition’ and ‘service condition’. The amendment  
did not have a significant effect on the Group financial statements.
• Amendment to IFRS 3, ‘Business combinations’. The standard is 
amended to clarify that an obligation to pay contingent consideration 
which meets the definition of a financial instrument is classified  
as a financial liability or as equity, on the basis of the definitions in 
IAS 32, ‘Financial instruments: Presentation’. The standard is further 
amended to clarify that all non-equity contingent consideration,  
both financial and non-financial, is measured at fair value at each 
reporting date, with changes in fair value recognised in profit and 
loss. The amendment did not have a significant effect on the Group 
financial statements.
• Amendment to IFRS 8, ‘Operating segments’. The standard  
is amended to require disclosure of the judgements made by 
management in aggregating operating segments. The standard is 
further amended to require a reconciliation of segment assets to the 
entity’s assets when segment assets are reported. The amendment 
did not have a significant effect on the Group financial statements.
• Amendment to IFRS 13, ‘Fair value measurement’. The IASB has 
amended the basis for conclusions of IFRS 13 to clarify that it did  
not intend to remove the ability to measure short-term receivables 
and payables at invoice amounts in such cases. The amendment  
did not have a significant effect on the Group financial statements.
• IAS 16, ‘Property, plant and equipment’, and ‘IAS 38’, ‘Intangible 
assets’. Both standards are amended to clarify how the gross 
carrying amount and the accumulated depreciation are treated where 
an entity uses the revaluation model. The carrying amount of the 
asset is restated to the revalued amount. The amendment did not 
have a significant effect on the Group financial statements.
• IAS 24, ‘Related party disclosures’. The standard is amended to 
include, as a related party, an entity that provides key management 
personnel services to the reporting entity or to the parent of the 
reporting entity (‘the management entity’). The amendment did not 
have a significant effect on the Group financial statements.
• IFRS 13, ‘Fair value measurement’. The amendment clarifies that  
the portfolio exception in IFRS 13, which allows an entity to measure 
the fair value of a group of financial assets and financial liabilities on 
a net basis, applies to all contracts (including non-financial contracts) 
within the scope of IAS 39 or IFRS 9. The amendment did not have  
a significant effect on the Group financial statements.
• IFRS 3, ‘Business combinations’. The standard is amended to clarify 
that IFRS 3 does not apply to the accounting for the formation of any 
joint arrangement under IFRS 11. The amendment also clarifies that 
the scope exemption only applies in the financial statements of the 
joint arrangement itself. The amendment did not have a significant 
effect on the Group financial statements.
c) New and amended standards and interpretations  
not yet adopted 
The following standards and amendments to existing standards have 
been published and are mandatory for the Group’s accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2016:
• Amendments to IFRS 10, ‘Consolidated financial statements’  
and IAS 28, ‘Investments in associates and joint ventures’ on sale  
or contribution of assets. The IASB has issued this amendment  
to eliminate the inconsistency between IFRS 10 and IAS 28. The 
amendment is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group.
• Amendments to IFRS 10, ‘Consolidated financial statements’ and  
IAS 28, ‘Investments in associates and joint ventures’ on applying  
the consolidation exemption. The amendments clarify the application 
of the consolidation exemption for investment entities and their 
subsidiaries. The amendment is not expected to have a significant 
impact on the Group.
• Amendment to IFRS 11, ‘Joint arrangements’ on acquisition of an 
interest in a joint operation. This amendment adds new guidance on 
how to account for the acquisition of an interest in a joint operation 
that constitutes a business. The standard is not expected to have  
a significant impact on the Group.
• Amendments to IAS 1, ‘Presentation of financial statements’ 
disclosure initiative. In December 2014 the IASB issued amendments 
to clarify guidance in IAS 1 on materiality and aggregation, the 
presentation of subtotals, the structure of financial statements and 
the disclosure of accounting policies. The amendment is not expected 
to have a significant impact on the Group.
• Amendment to IAS 16, ‘Property, plant and equipment’ and IAS 38, 
‘Intangible assets’, on depreciation and amortisation. In this 
amendment the IASB has clarified that the use of revenue based 
methods to calculate the depreciation of an asset is not appropriate 
because revenue generated by an activity that includes the use of  
an asset generally reflects factors other than the consumption of the 
economic benefits embodied in the asset. The IASB has also clarified 
that revenue is generally presumed to be an inappropriate basis  
for measuring the consumption of the economic benefits embodied  
in an intangible asset. The amendment is not expected to have  
a significant impact on the Group.
• Amendments to IAS 27, ‘Separate financial statements’ on equity 
accounting. In this amendment the IASB has restored the option  
to use the equity method to account for investments in subsidiaries, 
joint ventures and associates in an entity’s separate financial 
statements. The amendment is not expected to have a significant 
impact on the Group.
ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 105
STRATEGIC REPORT PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 2. Significant accounting policies continued
• IFRS 15 – ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’. This standard  
is a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts 
with customers to achieve greater consistency in the recognition  
and presentation of revenue. Revenue is recognised based on the 
satisfaction of performance obligations, which occurs when control of 
good or service transfers to a customer. The standard is not expected 
to have a significant impact on the Group.
• IFRS 9 – ‘Financial Instruments’ (2009 & 2010). The IASB has 
updated IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’ to include guidance on 
financial liabilities and de-recognition of financial instruments.  
The accounting and presentation for financial liabilities and for 
de-recognising financial instruments has been relocated from IAS 39, 
‘Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement’, without 
change, except for financial liabilities that are designated at fair  
value through profit or loss. The standard is not expected to have  
a significant impact on the Group.
• Amendment to IFRS 9 – ‘Financial instruments’, on general hedge 
accounting. The IASB has amended IFRS 9 to align hedge accounting 
more closely with an entity’s risk management. The revised standard 
also establishes a more principles-based approach to hedge 
accounting and addresses inconsistencies and weaknesses in the 
current model in IAS 39. The transitional provisions described above 
are likely to change once the IASB completes all phases of IFRS 9. 
The amendment is not expected to have a significant impact on  
the Group.
• IFRS 16 – ‘Leases’. IFRS 16 supersedes IAS 17, ‘Leases’, IFRIC 4, 
‘Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease’, SIC 15, 
‘Operating Leases – Incentives’ and SIC 27, ‘Evaluating the Substance 
of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease’. The standard  
is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group.
• IFRS 5 – ‘Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued 
Operations’. This is an amendment to the changes in methods of 
disposal – Assets (or disposal groups) are generally disposed of 
either through sale or through distribution to owners. The amendment 
to IFRS 5 clarifies that changing from one of these disposal methods 
to the other should not be considered to be a new plan of disposal, 
rather it is a continuation of the original plan. There is therefore  
no interruption of the application of the requirements in IFRS 5.  
The amendment also clarifies that changing the disposal method 
does not change the date of classification. The amendment is not 
expected to have a significant impact on the Group.
• IFRS 7 – ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’. Applicability of the 
offsetting disclosures to condensed interim financial statements.  
The amendment removes the phrase, and interim periods within  
those annual periods’ from paragraph 44R, clarifying that these  
IFRS 7 disclosures are not required in the condensed interim  
financial report. However, the Board noted that IAS 34 requires  
an entity to disclose an explanation of events and transactions  
that are significant to an understanding of the changes in financial 
position and performance of the entity since the end of the last 
annual reporting period. Therefore, if the IFRS 7 disclosures provide  
a significant update to the information reported in the most recent 
annual report, the Board would expect the disclosures to be included 
in the entity’s condensed interim financial report. The amendment  
is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group.
• IFRS 7 – ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’. Servicing contracts – 
The amendment clarifies that a servicing contract that includes  
a fee can constitute continuing involvement in a financial asset.  
An entity must assess the nature of the fee and arrangement against 
the guidance for continuing involvement in paragraphs IFRS 7.B30 and 
IFRS 7.42C in order to assess whether the disclosures are required. 
The amendment is not expected to have a significant impact on  
the Group.
• IAS 19 – ‘Employee Benefits’. Discount rate: regional market issue 
– The amendment to IAS 19 clarifies that market depth of high  
quality corporate bonds is assessed based on the currency in which 
the obligation is denominated, rather than the country where the 
obligation is located. When there is no deep market for high quality 
corporate bonds in that currency, government bond rates must be 
used. The amendment is not expected to have a significant impact  
on the Group.
d) Significant judgements in applying accounting policies 
and key sources of estimation uncertainty
Many of the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements 
require management to make judgements and/or estimates. These 
judgements and estimates are continuously evaluated and are based  
on management’s experience and best knowledge of the relevant facts 
and circumstances, but actual results may differ from the amounts 
included in the consolidated financial statements. The life of mine  
plans are central to a number of key estimates. Information about  
such judgements and estimations is included in the accounting policies

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED e) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements set out the Group’s financial 
position as at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014, and 
operating results and cash flows for the years then ended. The 
consolidated financial statements of the Group incorporate the financial 
statements of the Company and companies controlled by the Company 
(its subsidiaries). Subsidiaries are entities to which the Company is 
exposed or has the rights to variable returns from its involvement and 
has the ability to affect those returns through its power. Control exists 
when the Company has existing rights that give the ability to direct 
relevant activities, exposure or rights to variable returns from its 
involvement and the ability to use its power to affect the amount of 
returns. The consolidated financial statements include all of the assets, 
liabilities, revenues, expenses and cash flows of the Company and its 
subsidiaries after eliminating intercompany transactions as noted above.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary 
to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements  
from the date on which control passed to the Group, and have  
been excluded from the date on which control transferred out of  
the Group. For partly-owned subsidiaries, the net assets and net 
earnings attributable to non-controlling interests are presented as 
“Equity attributable to non-controlling interests” in the consolidated 
balance sheet and “Net profit attributable to non-controlling interests”  
in the consolidated income statement, respectively.
f) Business combinations
On acquiring a business, the acquisition method of accounting is used, 
whereby the purchase consideration is allocated to the identifiable net 
assets on the basis of fair value at the date of acquisition. Provisional 
fair values allocated at a reporting date are finalised within 12 months  
of the acquisition date. Acquisition costs are expensed.
When purchase consideration is contingent on future events, the initial 
cost of the acquisition recorded includes an estimate of the fair value  
of the contingent amounts expected to be payable in the future.  
The cost of the acquisition is adjusted when revised estimates are made, 
with corresponding adjustments made to the income statement.
When the cost of acquisition exceeds the fair values of the identifiable 
net assets, the difference is treated as purchased goodwill, which  
is reviewed for impairment annually or when there is an indication  
of impairment. If the fair value attributable to the Group’s share of the 
identifiable net assets exceeds the cost of acquisition, the difference  
is recognised in the income statement.
g) Foreign currency translation
The Group’s transactions are denominated in a number of different 
currencies (primarily US dollars, Tanzanian shillings (‘shillings’), South 
African rands (‘rands’), UK pounds sterling (‘pounds’) and Australian 
dollars. The Group has liabilities that are primarily denominated in  
US dollars. The US dollar is the Company’s (and its main subsidiaries’) 
functional currency, as well as the Group’s presentation currency.
Transactions in currencies other than the US dollar are translated  
at the exchange rates as at the date of transaction. Monetary assets  
and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the US dollar are 
translated to US dollars at year-end exchange rates. All differences  
that arise are recorded in the income statement. Non-monetary assets 
measured at historical cost in a currency other than US dollars are 
translated using the exchange rates at the date of the initial transactions.
Where non-monetary assets are measured at fair value in a currency 
other than US dollars they are translated into US dollars using the 
exchange rates on the date when the fair value was determined.
The following exchange rates to the US dollar have been applied:
As at  
31 December 
2015

UK pound (US$:GBP) 0.64 0.61
h) Determination of ore reserves
The Group estimates its ore reserves and mineral resources based  
on information compiled by Qualified Persons as defined in accordance  
with the Canadian Securities Administrators’ National Instrument  
43-101 “Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects” requirements. 
Reports to support these estimates are prepared each year. Proven and 
probable (‘2P’) reserves, and for certain mines other mineral resources, 
determined in this way are used in the calculation of depreciation, 
amortisation and impairment charges, the assessment of life of mine 
stripping ratios and for forecasting the timing of the payments related  
to the environmental rehabilitation provision.
In assessing the life of a mine for accounting purposes, mineral 
resources are only taken into account where there is a high degree  
of confidence of economic extraction.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating ore reserves, 
and assumptions that are valid at the time of estimation may change 
significantly when new information becomes available. Changes in the 
forecast prices of commodities, exchange rates, production costs or 
recovery rates may change the economic status of reserves and may, 
ultimately, result in the reserves being revised.
i) Stripping costs
In open pit mining operations, it is necessary to remove overburden  
and other waste materials to access ore from which minerals can be 
extracted economically. The process of mining overburden and waste 
materials is referred to as stripping. Stripping costs incurred in order  
to provide initial access to the ore body (referred to as pre-production 
stripping) are capitalised as mine development costs.
Stripping costs incurred during the production stage of a pit are 
accounted for as the costs of the inventory produced during the period 
that the stripping costs were incurred, unless these costs provide a 
future economic benefit to an identifiable component of the ore body. 
Production phase stripping costs generate a future economic benefit 
when the related stripping activity: (i) improves access to a component  
of the ore body to be mined in the future, (ii) increases the fair value  
of the mine (or pit) as access to future mineral reserves becomes less 
costly; (iii) increases the productive capacity or extends the productive 
life of the mine (or pit). For production phase stripping costs that 
generate a future economic benefit, the current period stripping costs 
are capitalised as open pit mine development costs.
ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 107
STRATEGIC REPORT PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 2. Significant accounting policies continued
Capitalised open pit mine development costs are depreciated on a units  
of production basis whereby the denominator is the estimated ounces  
of recoverable gold in proven and probable reserves and the portion  
of resources considered probable of economic extraction based on the 
current life of mine plan in the components of the ore body that have 
been made more accessible through the stripping activity. Capitalised 
open pit mine development costs are depreciated once the open pit has 
entered production and the future economic benefit is being derived.
j) Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised when persuasive evidence exists that all of the 
following criteria are met:
• the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the product have 
been transferred to the buyer;
• neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually 
associated with ownership, nor effective control over the goods sold 
has been retained;
• the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
• it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the sale  
will flow to the Group; and
• the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the sale can be 
measured reliably.
Gold doré sales
Gold doré is unrefined gold bullion bars usually consisting of 90%  
gold that is refined to pure gold bullion prior to sale to our customers. 
Revenue from gold doré sales is recognised at the time of sale  
to a third party. The sales price is based on the gold spot price  
at the time of sale.
Concentrate sales
Concentrate is a processing product containing the valuable ore mineral 
gold, copper and silver from which most of the waste mineral has been 
eliminated, that undergoes a smelting process to convert it into gold 
bullion, copper and silver concentrate. Under the terms of concentrate 
sales contracts with independent smelting companies, gold, copper and 
silver in concentrate is sold at trailing monthly average spot prices based 
on contract quotational periods.
Revenue is recorded at the shipped on board date, which is also when 
risks and rewards pass to the smelting companies, using market prices 
on the expected date that final sales prices will be fixed. Variations 
between the price recorded at the shipment date and the actual final 
price set under the smelting contracts are caused by changes in market 
prices, and result in an embedded derivative in accounts receivable.  
The embedded derivative is recorded at fair value each period until final 
settlement occurs, with changes in fair value classified as provisional 
price adjustments and included as a component of revenue. 
Co-products
Revenue from the sale of co-products, such as copper and silver, 
contained in doré or concentrates are recognised in revenue.
k) Cost of sales
Cost of sales consists of direct mining costs (which include personnel 
costs, general and administrative costs, energy costs (principally diesel 
fuel and electricity), maintenance and repair costs, operating supplies, 
external services, third-party smelting, refining and transport fees),  
and depreciation related to sales as well as production taxes and royalty 
expenses for the period. Cost of sales is based on average costing for 
contained or recoverable ounces sold as well as production taxes and 
royalty expense for the period. All costs are net of any impairment to 
reduce inventory to its net realisable value.
l) Exploration and evaluation
Exploration expenditures
Exploration expenditures relate to the initial search for mineral  
deposits with economic potential as well as expenditures incurred  
for the purposes of obtaining more information about existing mineral 
deposits. Exploration expenditures typically comprise costs that are 
directly attributable to:
• researching and analysing existing exploration data;
• conducting geological studies;
• exploratory drilling and sampling for the purposes of obtaining core 
samples and the related metallurgical assay of these cores; and
• drilling to determine the volume and grade of deposits in an area 
known to contain mineral resources or for the purposes of converting 
mineral resources into proven and probable reserves.
Exploration expenditures incurred at greenfield sites (sites where  
the Group does not have any mineral deposits that are already being 
mined or developed) are typically expensed as incurred, unless it can  
be demonstrated that the related evaluation expenditures will generate  
a future economic benefit. Exploration expenditures incurred at 
brownfield sites (sites that are adjacent to a mineral deposit that is 
classified within proven and probable reserves and are already being 
mined or developed) are capitalised if the following criteria are met:
• the drilling is being done in an inferred or measured and indicated 
resource; and
• there is an existing proven and probable reserve that is contiguous  
or adjacent to where the drilling is being done; and
• it is probable that the resource will be converted to a proven and 
probable reserve.
The assessment of probability is based on the following factors:  
results from previous drill programmes; results from a geological study; 
results from a mine scoping study confirming economic viability of the 
resource; and preliminary estimates of the volume and grade of the 
deposit, and the net cash flows expected to be generated from its 
development. Costs incurred at brownfield sites that meet the above 
criteria are capitalised as a component of property, plant and equipment  
(‘mine development costs’) pursuant to IAS 16, ‘Property, Plant and 
Equipment’. All other drilling and related exploration costs incurred  
at these sites are expensed as mine site exploration. Exploration 
expenditures incurred for the purposes of determining additional 
information on a mineral deposit that is classified within proven and 
probable reserves or for the purposes of extending an existing mineral 
deposit that is classified within proven and probable reserves and is 
already being mined or developed are also capitalised as mine 
development costs.
Evaluation expenditures
Evaluation expenditures arise from a detailed assessment of deposits  
or other projects that have been identified as having economic potential 
in order to determine their technical feasibility and commercial viability. 
They typically include costs directly attributable to:
• detailed engineering studies;
• examination and testing of extraction methods and metallurgical/
treatment processes;
• surveying transportation and infrastructure requirements;
• permitting activities; and
• detailed economic evaluations to determine whether development  
of the reserves is commercially justified, including the preparation  
of scoping, pre-feasibility and final feasibility studies.
108 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Evaluation expenditures incurred at greenfield and brownfield sites are 
expensed as incurred, unless it can be demonstrated that the related 
evaluation expenditures will generate a future economic benefit.
Evaluation expenditures incurred at operating mines/development 
projects are capitalised as a component of property, plant and 
equipment, “Mining properties and development costs”, respectively.
Acquired exploration and evaluation properties
Exploration and evaluation stage properties acquired either as an 
acquisition of individual assets or as part of a business combination are 
capitalised as an intangible asset, “Acquired exploration and evaluation 
properties”. Exploration and evaluation stage properties represent 
interests in properties that do not have mineralised material classified 
within proven and probable reserves. The value of such properties  
is primarily driven by the nature and amount of mineralised material 
contained in such properties, including value attributable to the rights  
to explore or develop: i) a property containing mineralised material 
classified as a measured, indicated or inferred resource; or ii) a 
prospective greenfield property with significant exploration potential. 
Exploration and evaluation expenditures incurred on such properties 
subsequent to their acquisition are expensed as incurred until the 
technical and commercial viability of developing the property has been 
demonstrated under the same criteria described above for exploration 
and evaluation expenditures.
m) Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net profit for the period 
attributable to the owners of the Company by the weighted average 
number of Ordinary Shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings 
per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if additional 
Ordinary Shares are assumed to be issued under securities that entitle 
their holders to obtain Ordinary Shares in the future. For share options, 
the number of additional shares for inclusion in diluted earnings per 
share calculations is determined using the treasury share method.  
Under this method, share options, whose exercise price is less than  
the average market price of our Ordinary Shares, are assumed to be 
exercised and the proceeds are used to repurchase Ordinary Shares  
at the average market price for the period. The incremental number  
of Ordinary Shares issued under share options and repurchased from 
proceeds is included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share.
n) Inventories
Material extracted from the Group’s mines is classified as either  
ore or waste. Ore represents material that, at the time of extraction,  
is expected to be processed into a saleable form and sold at a profit. 
Waste represents material that is required to be removed to access  
ore bodies. Ore stockpiles are classified within inventory as material  
is extracted from the open pit or underground mine. Ore is accumulated  
in stockpiles that are subsequently processed into gold in a saleable 
form under a mine plan that takes into consideration optimal scheduling 
of production of our reserves, present plant capacity, and the market 
price of gold and copper. Work in process inventory represents gold, 
copper and silver in the processing circuit that has not completed the 
production process, and is not yet in a saleable form. Finished goods 
inventory represents gold in saleable form that has not yet been shipped. 
Mine operating supplies represent commodities and other raw materials 
consumed in the production process, as well as spare parts and other 
maintenance supplies that are not classified as capital items. Inventories 
are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, with cost  
being determined on a weighted average cost basis. Average costs  
are calculated by reference to the cost of inventory at the beginning  
of the period together with the cost of inventory produced in a period.
Gold, copper and silver ore contained in stockpiles is measured by 
estimating the number of tonnes added and removed from the stockpile, 
and the associated estimate of gold contained therein (based on assay 
data) and applying estimated metallurgical recovery rates (based on  
the expected processing method). Stockpile ore tonnages are verified  
by periodic surveys. Costs are allocated to ore stockpiles based on 
quantities of material stockpiled using current mining costs incurred  
up to the point of stockpiling the ore and include: direct labour costs; 
materials and contractor expenses which are directly attributable to the 
extraction of ore, including an allocation of stripping costs attributable  
to current period production; an allocation of mine site overhead costs; 
and depreciation of mining properties and property, plant and equipment 
used in the extraction of ore, reduced by an allocation of capitalised 
stripping costs. As ore is processed, costs are removed based on 
recoverable quantities of gold and the stockpile’s average cost per unit. 
Ore that is not expected to be processed in the 12 months following  
the balance sheet date is classified as non-current.
Costs capitalised in process and finished goods inventory include:  
the cost of stockpiles processed; the cost of commodities and raw 
materials consumed in the production process; direct labour; repair  
and maintenance costs; energy costs; depreciation of property, plant  
and equipment used in the production process; and an allocation  
of mine site overhead costs. Costs are removed from finished goods 
inventory and recorded in cost of sales based on the average cost  
per ounce of gold, copper and silver sold in the period.
Cost of mine operating supplies is the purchase cost, including allocated 
freight costs where applicable.
Provisions are recorded to reduce ore stockpiles, work in process and 
finished goods inventory to net realisable value where the net realisable 
value of the inventory is lower than its cost at each balance sheet date. 
Net realisable value is determined with reference to relevant market 
prices less applicable variable selling expenses. Provisions recorded 
also reflect an estimate of the remaining costs of completion to bring the 
inventory into its saleable form. Provisions are recorded to reduce mine 
operating supplies to net realisable value, which is generally calculated 
by reference to its salvage or scrap value, when it is determined that the 
supplies are slow moving and/or obsolete. Provisions are reversed to 
reflect subsequent recoveries in net realisable value where the inventory 
is still on hand at the balance sheet date.
o) Property, plant and equipment
Mineral properties and mine development costs
Mineral properties and mine development costs are stated at cost,  
less accumulated depreciation and applicable accumulated impairment 
losses. The acquisition cost of a mineral property is the estimated  
fair value of proven and probable reserves and measured, indicated  
and inferred resources acquired as a result of a business combination  
or asset acquisition. Where the asset is acquired separately, the  
cost is given the fair value of the consideration given. Capitalised mine 
development costs include: pre-production stripping costs; production 
stripping costs that result in a future economic benefit (refer to Note 2i) 
for capitalisation criteria for stripping costs); costs incurred to access 
reserves at underground mining operations; and exploration and 
evaluation expenditures that result in a probable future economic benefit 
(refer to Note 2l) for capitalisation criteria for exploration and evaluation 
expenditures).
Development costs incurred at underground mines to build new shafts, 
drifts and ramps that provide physical access to the underground ore  
are capitalised as incurred. These costs can be incurred throughout  
the life of the underground mine.
ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 109
STRATEGIC REPORT PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 2. Significant accounting policies continued
Plant and equipment
Plant and equipment is recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation 
and applicable impairment losses. Cost includes all expenditures 
incurred to prepare an asset for its intended use including: the purchase 
price; brokers’ commissions; and installation costs including architectural, 
design and engineering fees, legal fees, survey costs, site preparation 
costs, freight charges, transportation insurance costs, duties and 
borrowing cost.
Costs that extend the productive capacity or useful economic life of an 
asset are capitalised. Costs incurred that do not extend the productive 
capacity or useful economic life of an asset are considered repairs and 
maintenance and expensed as incurred.
The Group enters into leasing arrangements and arrangements that  
are in substance leasing arrangements. The determination of whether  
an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance  
of the arrangement at inception date, including whether the fulfilment  
of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or  
assets or whether the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset.  
A reassessment after inception is only made in specific circumstances. 
Leasing arrangements that transfer substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership of the asset to the Group are classified as 
finance leases.
Finance leases are recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability  
at an amount equal to the lower of the fair value of the leased property 
and the present value at the beginning of the lease term of the minimum 
lease payments over the term of the lease. Each lease payment is 
allocated between the liability and finance costs using the effective 
interest method, whereby a constant rate of interest expense is 
recognised on the balance of the liability outstanding. The interest 
element of the lease is charged to the income statement as a finance 
expense. The property, plant and equipment assets acquired under 
finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the 
asset and the lease term. All other leases are classified as operating 
leases. Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in  
the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Assets under construction
Assets in the course of construction at both our development projects 
and operating mines are capitalised in the “assets under construction” 
account. The cost of assets under construction comprises its purchase 
price and any costs directly attributable to bringing it into working 
condition for its intended use, at which point it is transferred to property, 
plant and equipment and depreciation commences. Development 
projects are recorded at cost, less applicable accumulated impairment 
losses. Development projects represent interests in properties that 
contain proven and probable reserves and where development activities 
are ongoing. The cost of development projects is composed of: the 
estimated fair value of development stage assets acquired as a result  
of a business combination or an asset acquisition; and costs associated 
with the construction of tangible assets, such as processing plants, 
permanent housing facilities and other tangible infrastructure associated 
with the project. Assets under construction also contain deposits  
on long lead items. The capitalised cost of closure and rehabilitation 
activities is initially included in assets under construction and 
subsequently transferred to Mineral Properties. Assets under 
construction are not depreciated. 
Depreciation 
Property, plant and equipment is depreciated, net of residual value,  
over its useful life, or over the remaining life of the mine if shorter on a 
straight-line basis. For mineral properties and mine development costs, 
the economic benefits of the assets are consumed in a pattern which  
is linked to the production level. Such assets are depreciated on a unit  
of production basis. Depreciation commences when assets are available 
for their intended use. In applying the units of production method, 
depreciation is normally calculated using the quantity of gold, copper  
and silver extracted from the mine (or pit) in the period as a percentage 
of the total quantity of material expected to be extracted in current  
and future periods based on estimates of recoverable proven and 
probable reserves and, for some mines, mineral resources. Such 
non-reserve material may be included in the depreciation calculations 
where there is a high degree of confidence in its economic extraction  
and the production of the non-reserve material is reflected in the life  
of mine plan.
Development costs that relate to a discrete section of an ore body and 
which only provide benefit over the life of those reserves are depreciated 
over the recoverable proven and probable reserves of that discrete 
section. Discrete sections include capitalised underground development 
costs or production stripping costs incurred for the purposes of providing 
access to specific ore blocks or areas of the mine and which only provide 
an economic benefit over the period of mining that ore block or area. 
Development costs incurred which benefit the entire ore body are 
depreciated over the recoverable proven and probable reserves of the 
entire ore body.
The expected depreciation rates of the major categories of assets are 
as follows:
Mineral properties and development costs UOP
1
Plant and equipment 4% – 25%
Underground mobile equipment 14.3% – 20%
Light vehicles and other mobile equipment 33.3% – 50%
Furniture, computer and office equipment 33.3% – 50%
1  UOP indicates assets which are depreciated on the basis of units of production 
(‘UOP’), in this case ounces of gold, copper and silver produced in a period divided  
by the total recoverable reserves and resources of gold, copper and silver expected  
to be mined based on the current life of mine plans.
Each asset’s estimated residual value and useful life is reviewed,  
and adjusted if appropriate, on an annual basis. The estimate of  
residual value and useful life is based on the physical condition and  
life limitations of buildings, plant and equipment and the present 
assessment of economically recoverable reserves of the mine for the 
mining property and development cost asset. Changes to the estimated 
residual values or useful lives are accounted for prospectively.
p) Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair 
value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
acquired at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is initially determined based 
on provisional fair values. Fair values are finalised within 12 months of 
the acquisition date. For non-wholly-owned subsidiaries, non-controlling 
interests are initially recorded based on the minorities’ proportion of the 
fair values for the assets and liabilities recognised at acquisition.
Goodwill that is acquired through business combinations is allocated  
to cash generating units (‘CGUs’), or groups of CGUs, that are expected 
to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. Each of the 
Group’s CGUs that has an allocation of goodwill is also an operating 
segment as defined by IFRS 8. Consequently, goodwill is tested for 
impairment at the individual CGU level.
Goodwill is not amortised; rather it is tested annually for impairment  
in accordance with accounting policy (Note 2r). Goodwill impairments  
are not reversible.
q) Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired by way of an asset acquisition or business 
combination are recognised if the asset is separable or arises from 
contractual or legal rights and the fair value can be measured reliably on 
initial recognition. On acquisition of a mineral property in the exploration 
stage, we prepare an estimate of the fair value attributable to the 
110 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED exploration potential, including mineral resources, if any, of that property. 
The fair value of the exploration potential is recorded as an intangible 
asset (acquired exploration potential) as at the date of acquisition.  
When an exploration stage property moves into development, any 
acquired exploration intangible asset balance attributable to that 
property is transferred to non-depreciable mining interests within 
property, plant and equipment.
Impairment testing and the reversal of impairments are conducted  
in accordance with accounting policy (Note 2r).
r) Impairment of non-current assets
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or at any time during the 
year if an indicator of impairment is considered to exist. We review and 
test the carrying amounts of intangible assets when events or changes 
in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be 
recoverable.
Property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment if there is  
any indication that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss shall be recognised for a CGU if, and only if, the 
recoverable amount of the unit is less than the carrying amount of the 
unit. The impairment loss shall first be allocated to goodwill and then to 
the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount 
of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised in prior years for non-financial assets 
other than goodwill shall be reversed if, and only if, there has been 
change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable 
amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. This reversal  
is recognised in the consolidated statement of income and is limited  
to the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of any 
depreciation, had no impairment been recognised in prior years. After 
such a reversal, any depreciation charge is adjusted prospectively.
The recoverable amount of an asset is assessed by reference to the 
higher of value in use (‘VIU’) being the net present value (‘NPV’)  
of future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, and fair 
value less costs to dispose (‘FVLCD’). Impairment assessments are 
conducted at the level of CGUs, which is the lowest level for which 
identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other 
assets. Each operating mine and development project represents a CGU 
for impairment testing purposes. An impairment loss is recognised for 
any excess of carrying amount of a CGU over its recoverable amount.
The FVLCD of a CGU is based on an estimate of the amount that  
the Group may obtain in a sale transaction on an arm’s length basis.  
There is no active market for the Group’s CGUs. Consequently, FVLCD  
is derived using discounted cash flow techniques (NPV of expected future 
cash flows of a CGU), which incorporate market participant assumptions. 
Cost to sell is based on management’s best estimates of future selling 
costs at the time of calculating FVLCD. Costs attributable to the sale  
of a CGU are not considered significant.
The expected future cash flows utilised in the NPV model are derived 
from estimates of projected future revenues, future cash costs of 
production and capital expenditures contained in the life of mine (‘LOM’) 
plan for each CGU, which are updated on an annual basis. The Group’s 
LOM plans reflect proven and probable reserves and convertible 
resources and are based on detailed research, analysis and modelling  
to optimise the internal rate of return for each CGU. As such, these plans 
consider the optimal level of investment, overall production levels and 
sequence of extraction taking into account all relevant characteristics  
of the ore body, including waste-to-ore tonnes ratios, ore grades,  
haul distances, chemical and metallurgical properties impacting process 
recoveries and capacities of available extraction, haulage and processing 
equipment. Projected future revenues reflect the forecasted future 
production levels at each CGU as detailed in the LOM plans. Included  
in these forecasts is the production of some mineral resources that  
do not currently qualify for inclusion in proven and probable ore reserves 
where there is a high degree of confidence in their economic extraction. 
This is consistent with the approach that a market participant would 
utilise in preparing a forecast of expected production levels. Projected 
future revenues also reflect the Group’s estimate of long-term gold 
prices, which is determined based on current prices, an analysis of the 
expected total production costs of producers and forward pricing curves 
and forecasts of expected long-term prices prepared by research 
analysts. These estimates often differ from current price levels, but this 
methodology is consistent with how a market participant would assess 
long-term gold prices.
The estimates of future cash costs of production and capital 
expenditures are derived from the LOM plans for each CGU. Costs 
incurred in currencies other than the US dollar are translated to US 
dollars using expected long-term exchange rates based on the relevant 
forward pricing curve for that currency. Oil prices are a significant 
component, both directly and indirectly, of the expected cash costs  
of production. Estimates for long-term oil prices used in the LOM plans 
are based on the spot price at the time, the forward pricing curve and 
long-term oil price forecasts prepared by analysts.
The discount rate applied to present value is based upon the real 
weighted average cost of capital applicable to the CGU. The discount  
rate reflects equity risk premiums over the risk-free rate, the impact  
of the remaining economic life of the CGU and the risks associated  
with the relevant cash flows based on the country in which the CGU  
is located. These risk adjustments are based on observed equity risk 
premiums, historical country risk premiums and average credit default 
swap spreads for the period.
In determining FVLCD, a market multiple is applied to the NPV of each 
CGU. Gold companies typically trade at a market capitalisation that  
is based on a multiple of their underlying NPV. Consequently, a market 
participant would generally apply an NPV multiple when estimating  
the fair value of a gold property. The NPV multiple utilised in the 
determination of the FVLCD of a CGU considers the NPV multiples 
observed on comparable companies. These observed multiples  
are primarily derived from research analyst reports and take into 
consideration the following: i) estimate of underlying NPV prepared by  
the analyst; ii) estimate of target market capitalisation prepared by the 
analyst; iii) market capitalisation on the date of the analyst report; and 
iv) market capitalisation on the date of the impairment test. The NPV 
multiple applied also takes into consideration the remaining economic 
life of the CGU. For CGUs with a remaining economic life of five years or 
less, an NPV multiple on the lower end of the observed multiple range is 
utilised. For other CGUs, the median observed NPV multiple is utilised.
The VIU of a CGU is generally lower than its FVLCD, due primarily to  
the inclusion of future, as yet unapproved, capital expenditure when 
determining its FVLCD. Consequently, the recoverable amount of a CGU 
for impairment testing purposes is determined based on its FVLCD.
s) Other reserves
The Company did not exist until 12 January 2010, and did not become  
the parent company for the Group until 22 February 2010 when  
the transfer of the members of the Group pursuant to the Pre-IPO 
Reorganisation was completed. As part of the IPO re-organisation in 
2010 a distributable reserve was created following a capital reduction.
t) Share capital
Ordinary Shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly 
attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity  
as a deduction from the proceeds.

STRATEGIC REPORT PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 2. Significant accounting policies continued
u) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation  
(legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that  
an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and  
a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the 
effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined 
by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, 
where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting  
is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is 
recognised as a finance cost.
Rehabilitation costs
The mining, extraction and processing activities of the Group  
normally give rise to obligations for environmental rehabilitation. 
Rehabilitation works can include facility decommissioning and 
dismantling; removal or treatment of waste materials and site and land 
rehabilitation. The extent of work required and the associated costs  
are dependent on the requirements of relevant authorities and the 
Group’s environmental policies.
Provisions for the cost of each rehabilitation programme are recognised 
at the time that environmental disturbance occurs. When the extent  
of disturbance increases over the life of an operation, the provision  
is increased accordingly. The major parts of the carrying amount of 
provisions relate to tailings pond closure/rehabilitation; demolition  
of buildings/mine facilities; ongoing water treatment; and ongoing care  
and maintenance of closed mines. Costs included in the provision 
encompass all closure and rehabilitation activity expected to occur 
progressively over the life of the operation and at the time of closure  
in connection with disturbances at the reporting date. Estimated costs 
included in the determination of the provision reflect the risks and 
probabilities of alternative estimates of cash flows required to settle  
the obligation at each particular operation. Routine operating costs that 
may impact the ultimate closure and rehabilitation activities, such as 
waste material handling conducted as an integral part of a mining or 
production process, are not included in the provision. Costs arising  
from unforeseen circumstances, such as the contamination caused by 
unplanned discharges, are recognised as an expense and liability when 
the event occurs that gives rise to an obligation and reliable estimates  
of the required rehabilitation costs can be made.
The timing of the actual rehabilitation expenditure is dependent upon a 
number of factors such as the life and nature of the asset, the operating 
licence conditions and the environment in which the mine operates. 
Expenditure may occur before and after closure and can continue for  
an extended period of time depending on rehabilitation requirements. 
The majority of the expenditure is expected to be paid over periods  
of up to 30 years with some payments into perpetuity. Rehabilitation 
provisions are measured at the expected value of future cash flows, 
discounted to their present value using a current, market-based estimate 
of the real risk-free pre-tax discount rates. The unwinding of the discount 
is included in finance expense and results in an increase in the amount 
of the provision. Provisions are updated each reporting period for the 
effect of a change in the discount rate and the change in estimate is 
added or deducted from the related asset and depreciated prospectively 
over the asset’s useful life.
Significant judgements and estimates are involved in forming 
expectations of future activities and the amount and timing of the 
associated cash flows. Those expectations are formed based on existing 
environmental and regulatory requirements or, if more stringent, Group 
environmental policies which give rise to a constructive obligation.
When provisions for closure and rehabilitation are initially recognised,  
the corresponding cost is capitalised as an asset, representing part  
of the cost of acquiring the future economic benefits of the operation. 
The capitalised cost of closure and rehabilitation activities is recognised 
in property, plant and equipment and depreciated accordingly.
It is possible that management’s estimates of provisions could change 
as a result of changes in regulations, the extent of rehabilitation 
required, and the means of reclamation or cost estimates. Rehabilitation 
provisions are adjusted as a result of changes in estimates. Those 
adjustments are accounted for as a change in the corresponding value  
of the related asset, except where a reduction in the provision is greater 
than the remaining net book value of the related assets, in which case 
the value is reduced to nil and the remaining adjustment is recognised in 
the income statement. In the case of closed sites, changes to estimated 
costs are recognised immediately in the income statement. Changes  
to the capitalised cost result in an adjustment to future depreciation  
and finance expense. On an annual basis, the Group reviews for changes 
in cost estimates, discount rates or life of operations.
v) Employee benefits
The Group operates an equity-settled, share-based compensation  
plan (the ‘Share Option Plan’), a long-term incentive plan (the ‘LTIP’),  
a legacy restricted share unit plan (the ‘Legacy RSU Plan’) and  
a deferred share unit plan (the ‘DSU’ Plan).
Share-based payments
Share options
Share options can be granted under either the Company LTIP or the 
Share Option Plan. The Company receives services from employees  
as consideration for equity instruments (options) of the Group. The fair 
value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the 
options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed  
is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted:
• including any market performance conditions;
• excluding the impact of any service and non-market performance 
vesting conditions (for example, profitability, sales growth targets and 
remaining an employee of the entity over a specified time period); and
• excluding the impact of any non-vesting conditions.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about  
the number of options that are expected to vest. The total expense is 
recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of 
the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At the end of each 
reporting period, the Company revises its estimates of the number of 
options that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting 
conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates,  
if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
When the options are exercised, the Company may issue new shares  
or procure the transfer of existing shares to satisfy the exercise. Where 
shares are issued, the proceeds received net of any directly attributable 
transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share 
premium when the options are exercised. The grant by the Company  
of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary 
undertakings in the Group is treated as a capital contribution. The fair 
value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant 
date fair value, is recognised over the vesting period as an increase  
to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit 
to equity.
Long-term incentive plans
The Company has a cash-settled, Restricted Share Unit (‘RSU’) plan for 
select employees. Under the terms of the RSU plan, selected employees 
are granted RSUs where each RSU has a value equal to one Ordinary 
Share of the Company. RSUs granted to Executive Directors and the 
other members of the Executive Leadership Team vest based on the 
Company’s Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) performance against the 
market cap-weighted TSR of a comparator group of companies over  
the vesting period (referred to as Performance RSUs). RSUs vest over  
a two-and-a-half or three-year period and are settled in cash. Additional 
RSUs are credited to reflect dividends paid on Ordinary Shares of the 
Company during the vesting period with a corresponding charge to the 
compensation expense. A liability for RSUs is measured at fair value on 
112 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED the grant date and is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period, with a corresponding charge to the compensation expense.  
At the grant date the fair value of the awards is determined from the 
market value of the shares at the date of award and adjusted for any 
market based vesting conditions attached to the award e.g. relative  
TSR performance. Changes in the fair value of the RSU liability, due to 
changes in the price of Ordinary Shares of the Company, are recorded 
each period, with a corresponding charge to the compensation expense.
Compensation expenses recognised for RSUs incorporate an estimate 
for expected forfeiture rates. The expected forfeiture is estimated based 
on historical forfeiture rates of the Group and expectations of future 
forfeiture rates. Adjustments to compensation expense are recognised  
in periods where the actual forfeiture rate differs from the expected rate.
Legacy RSU plan
Historically, the Barrick Group has maintained a Restricted Share Unit 
(‘RSU’) plan for selected employees who now work for the Group. This 
plan operates in an incidental manner to the Company RSU plan. These 
existing legacy restricted share units will continue to be administered 
and accounted for based on the movement of the fair value of the Barrick 
Ordinary Share for recording of liabilities and compensation expense.
LTIP deferred share units
Under the Deferred Share Unit (‘DSU’) plan, the Non-Executive Directors 
can elect to receive all or part of their annual director fees in DSUs. Each 
DSU has the same value as one Acacia Ordinary Share. DSUs must be 
retained until the Director leaves the Board, at which time the cash value 
of the DSU is paid out. Additional DSUs are credited to reflect dividends 
paid on Acacia Ordinary Shares. A liability for DSUs is measured at  
fair value on the grant date and is recognised on a straight-line basis 
over the vesting period, with a corresponding charge to the Directors’ 
compensation expense. At the grant date the fair value of the awards  
is determined from the market value of the shares at the date of award. 
Changes in the fair value of the DSU liability, due to changes in the price 
of Ordinary Shares of the Company, are recorded each period, with  
a corresponding charge to the Directors’ compensation expense.
Defined contribution plan
The Group’s Tanzanian employees are members of either the National 
Social Security Fund (‘NSSF’) or the Parastatal Pension Fund (‘PPF’), 
which are defined contribution plans. A defined contribution plan is  
a plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate 
entity. The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further 
contribution if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all 
employees the benefits relating to the employee service in the current 
and prior periods. The Group and employees both contribute 10% of  
the employees’ gross salaries to the schemes. The contributions are 
charged to the income statement when they are due.
Termination benefits
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by  
the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee 
accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group 
recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed  
to either: terminating the employment of current employees according  
to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal; or providing 
termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary 
redundancy. Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the balance 
sheet date are discounted to their present value.
Bonus plans
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses where it is 
contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created  
a constructive obligation.
Other entitlements
The estimated monetary liability for employees’ accrued annual  
leave entitlement at the balance sheet date is recognised as an 
expense accrual.
w) Financial instruments
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the balance sheet at fair  
value. For the purposes of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents 
include cash, and money market funds. For the purposes of the cash 
flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash 
equivalents as defined above.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not 
qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair 
value through profit and loss or available for sale. These are initially 
recognised at fair value, and are subsequently stated at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method. They are included in current assets, 
except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet 
date. These are classified as non-current assets, where the receivables 
are discounted and held at their net present value.
Loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables, other 
assets and cash and cash equivalents at the balance sheet date.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when  
there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all 
amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. The amount 
of the provision is the difference between the carrying amount and  
the expected cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate. The 
carrying amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance 
account. The amount of the provision is recognised in the 
income statement.
Derivatives
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative 
contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair 
value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on 
whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, 
the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain 
derivatives as either:
a)   hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm 
commitment (fair value hedge); or
b)  hedges of the income/cost of a highly probable forecast transaction  
or commitment (cash flow hedge); or
c)  hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net 
investment hedge).
The Group documents at inception of the transaction the relationship 
between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk 
management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging 
transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge 
inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are 
used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes  
in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
The fair values of various derivative instruments used for hedging 
purposes are disclosed in Note 31. Movements in the hedging reserve 
are shown in other comprehensive income. The full fair value of a 
hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when 
the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months,  
and as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the 
hedged item is less than 12 months. Trading derivatives are classified  
as a current asset or liability.
ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 113
STRATEGIC REPORT PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 2. Significant accounting policies continued
(a) Fair value hedge
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify 
as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together  
with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are 
attributable to the hedged risk. The gain or loss relating to the effective 
portion is recognised in the income statement within “finance costs”. 
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised in the 
income statement within other charges. Changes in the fair value of  
the hedge attributable to interest rate risk are recognised in the income 
statement within “finance costs”.
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the 
adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the 
effective interest method is used is amortised to profit or loss over  
the period to maturity.
(b) Cash flow hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that  
are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other 
comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective 
portion is recognised immediately in the income statement within  
“other charges”.
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the 
periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss (for example, when 
the forecast sale that is hedged takes place). The gain or loss relating  
to the effective portion is recognised in the income statement. However, 
when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition  
of a non-financial asset (for example, inventory or fixed assets), the gains 
and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and 
included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset. The deferred 
amounts are ultimately recognised in cost of goods sold in the case of 
inventory or in depreciation in the case of property, plant and equipment.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no  
longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain  
or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised 
when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the 
income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the 
cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately 
transferred to the income statement within “other charges”.
(c) Net investment hedge
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for 
similarly to cash flow hedges.
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective 
portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income.  
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised in the 
income statement.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income 
statement when the foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold.
Embedded derivatives
Contracts are assessed for the existence of embedded derivatives  
at the date that the Group first becomes party to the contract, with 
reassessment only if there is a change to the contract that significantly 
modifies the cash flows. Embedded derivatives which are not clearly  
and closely related to the underlying asset, liability or transaction are 
separated and accounted for as stand-alone derivatives.
Financial liabilities
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs 
incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost; any 
difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the 
redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period 
of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Fees paid on the 
establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs  
of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility 
will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down 
occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some 
or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a 
prepayment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the 
facility to which it relates. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities 
unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of  
the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value and 
subsequently held at amortised cost using the effective interest  
rate method.
x) Finance income and finance expense
Interest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the 
effective interest method. When a receivable is impaired, the Group 
reduces the carrying amount to its recoverable amount, being the 
estimated future cash flow discounted at the original effective interest 
rate of the instrument, and continues unwinding the discount as 
interest income.
Interest is recognised as a borrowing cost on a time proportion basis 
using the effective interest method. Borrowing costs that relate directly 
to the construction of property, plant and equipment during the time that 
it is required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use are 
capitalised as part of the cost of the asset.
y) Taxes
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax.  
Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that  
it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly  
in equity. In this case the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity, respectively.
Current income tax
Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods 
are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid  
to the taxation authorities. Management periodically evaluates positions 
taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax 
regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where 
appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax 
authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount  
are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date.
Deferred income tax
Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary 
differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of  
assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting 
purposes. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates enacted  
or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to 
apply when the related deferred income tax liability is settled. Deferred 
income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable 
that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences, except:
• where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial 
recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction  
that is not a business combination and, at the time of transaction, 
affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit/loss; and
• in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with 
investments in subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the 
temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
114 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary 
differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, 
to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available 
against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward 
of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except:
• where the deferred income tax asset relating to deductible temporary 
differences arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability  
in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time  
of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable 
profit or loss; and
• in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with 
investments in subsidiaries deferred income tax assets are 
recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary 
differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will 
be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at  
each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all  
or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each 
balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become 
probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to 
be recovered.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates 
that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the 
liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Uncertainties regarding availability of tax losses, in respect of enquiries 
raised and additional tax assessments issued, have been measured 
using the single best estimate of likely outcome approach.
Deferred income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is 
recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset, 
if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current income tax assets 
against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes 
relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
Indirect tax
Indirect tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are 
measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to  
the taxation authorities. Management periodically evaluates positions 
taken in indirect tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable 
tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions or 
receivables where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be 
paid to or received from the tax authorities. The tax rates and tax laws 
used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date. If the receivable is expected  
to be received in more than 12 months from year end, the receivable  
is discounted and held at its present value. Amounts expected to  
be payable or receivable in more than 12 months are classified as 
non-current assets or liabilities in the balance sheet, as appropriate.
z) Royalties
Royalty arrangements based on mineral production are in place at  
each operating mine. The primary type of royalty is a net smelter return 
(‘NSR’) royalty. Under this type of royalty the Group pays the holder an 
amount calculated as the royalty percentage multiplied by the value of 
gold production at market gold prices less third-party smelting, refining 
and transportation costs.
The North Mara mine is also subject to a land royalty (land tenements 
(‘LT’)) based on the net revenue derived from the open pit mines.
Royalty expense is recorded when revenue from the sale of gold, copper 
and silver production is recognised.
The following percentages apply:
Bulyanhulu 4% NSR
1
North Mara – Nyabirama and Nyabigena pits 4% NSR
1
, 1% LT
North Mara – Gokona pit and underground 4% NSR
1
, 1.1% LT
Buzwagi 4% NSR
1
, 30% NPI
2
1 The Group agreed to a voluntary 1% increase in the NSR royalty rate in 2012.
2  The NPI is calculated as a percentage of profits realised from the Buzwagi mine after 
all capital, exploration and development costs and interest incurred in relation to the 
Buzwagi mine have been recouped and all operating costs relating to the Buzwagi 
mine have been paid. No amount is currently payable.
aa) Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of 
ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. 
Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received 
from the lessor) are charged to the income statement on a straight-line 
basis over the period of the lease.
The Group leases certain property, plant and equipment. Leases of 
property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all the 
risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance 
leases are capitalised at the lease’s commencement at the lower of the 
fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum 
lease payments.
Each finance lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance 
charges. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, 
are included in other liabilities. The interest element of the finance  
cost is charged to the income statement over the lease period so as to 
produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance  
of the liability for each period. The property, plant and equipment 
acquired under finance leases is depreciated over the shorter of the 
useful life of the asset and the lease term.
bb) Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as  
a liability in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which 
the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.

On 4 February 2014, Acacia announced the completion of the sale. STAMICO has taken ownership and management of the rehabilitation fund 
established as part of the closure plan for the mine, in return for the assumption of all remaining past and future closure and rehabilitation liabilities 
for Tulawaka, and has indemnified the other parties to the agreement in relation to these liabilities. The transfer was completed with a net cash 
payment of US$11.6 million by Acacia to STAMICO for the balance of the rehabilitation fund, less the transaction consideration. This resulted in  
a gain of US$4.1 million. After non operational costs incurred in the year to 31 December 2014 and other closing adjustments, it resulted in a total 
cash outflow of US$5.3 million for 2014.
2014 results relating to Tulawaka have been aggregated in one line called “Net profit from discontinued operations” following the sale of Tulawaka  
in February 2014.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 4. Segment reporting
The Group has only one primary product produced in a single geographic location, being gold produced in Tanzania. In addition the Group produces 
copper and silver as a co-product. Reportable operating segments are based on the internal reports provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker 
(‘CODM’) to evaluate segment performance, decide how to allocate resources and make other operating decisions. After applying the aggregation 
criteria and quantitative thresholds contained in IFRS 8, the Group’s reportable operating segments were determined to be: North Mara gold mine; 
Bulyanhulu gold mine; Buzwagi gold mine; and a separate Corporate and Exploration segment, which primarily consists of costs related to other 
charges and corporate social responsibility expenses as well as discontinued operations (Tulawaka gold mine). Segment results and carrying values 
include items directly attributable to the segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Segment carrying values are 
disclosed and calculated as shareholders’ equity after adding back debt and inter-company liabilities, and subtracting cash and inter-company 
assets. Segment liabilities are not reported since they are not considered by the CODM as material to segment performance. Capital expenditures 
comprise additions to property, plant and equipment. The Group has also included segment cash costs per ounce sold and all-in sustaining cost per 
ounce sold (non-IFRS financial performance measures). Segment information for the reportable operating segments of the Group for the years ended 
31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014 is set out below.

STRATEGIC REPORT PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 7. Impairment charges
In accordance with IAS 36 “Impairment of assets” and IAS 38 “Intangible Assets” a review for impairment of goodwill is undertaken annually, or at 
any time an indicator of impairment is considered to exist, and in accordance with IAS 16 “Property, plant and equipment” a review for impairment  
of long-lived assets is undertaken at any time an indicator of impairment is considered to exist. During 2015, we have seen continued pressure  
on the price of gold driven by a number of market factors. Volatility of the gold price continued to be prevalent, and gold traded in a range from 
US$1,182 per ounce on 31 December 2014 to US$1,061 per ounce on 31 December 2015. 
The shift in the gold price has required us to reassess our price assumptions for life of mine planning to realign to the current market conditions.  
For life of mine planning purposes, the gold price assumption for 2016 was lowered to US$1,100 per ounce, US$1,150 for 2017, and a longer-term 
view from 2017 onwards of US$1,200 per ounce for Bulyanhulu and North Mara. For Buzwagi, in light of its short life of mine, the current spot price 
has a heavier weighting on a likely achieved price, and for this reason we have used a flat spot price of US$1,100 per ounce for the remaining life  
of mine. This reduction in the gold price assumption, in combination with the resultant impact on reserve and resource estimations, represents  
an impairment trigger in our view, and as a result, we have performed impairment testing on all three operating sites in order to ensure that the 
recoverable value calculated exceeds the carrying values as presented.
The review compared the recoverable amount of assets for the cash generating units (‘CGU’) to the carrying value of the CGUs including goodwill.  
The recoverable amount of an asset is assessed by reference to the higher of value in use (‘VIU’), being the net present value (‘NPV’) of future  
cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, and fair value less costs to dispose (‘FVLCD’). The FVLCD of a CGU is based on an estimate of  
the amount that the Group may obtain in a sale transaction on an arm’s length basis. There is no active market for the Group’s CGUs. Consequently, 
FVLCD is derived using discounted cash flow techniques (NPV of expected future cash flows of a CGU), which incorporate market participant 
assumptions. Cost to dispose is based on management’s best estimates of future selling costs at the time of calculating FVLCD. Costs attributable 
to the disposal of a CGU are not considered significant. The expected future cash flows utilised in the NPV model are derived from estimates of 
projected future revenues, future cash costs of production and capital expenditures contained in the life of mine (‘LOM’) plan for each CGU. The 
Group’s LOM plans reflect proven and probable reserves, assume limited resource conversion, and are based on detailed research, analysis and 
modelling to optimise the internal rate of return for each CGU. 
The discount rate applied to calculate the present value is based upon the real weighted average cost of capital applicable to the CGU. The discount 
rate reflects equity risk premiums over the risk-free rate, the impact of the remaining economic life of the CGU and the risks associated with the 
relevant cash flows based on the country in which the CGU is located. These risk adjustments are based on observed equity risk premiums, historical 
country risk premiums and average credit default swap spreads for the period. 
The key economic assumptions used in the reviews during 2015 and 2014 were:

At Bulyanhulu and North Mara, the impairment review did not indicate a need for impairment because the recoverable amount was calculated as 
higher than the carrying values.
At Buzwagi, the recoverable amount calculated was US$188.7 million lower than the carrying value. In conjunction with the recoverable value review, 
we have also reviewed anticipated future use of supplies in light of the short life of mine and a review of classification of critical spares, resulting  
in a portion of the impairment allocated to supplies. As there is no goodwill relating to Buzwagi, the impairment loss was allocated as below:

120 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For purposes of testing for impairment of long-lived assets, we have assessed whether a reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions 
used to estimate the recoverable value for CGUs would result in an additional impairment charge. 
Management’s view is that the recoverable values are most sensitive to changes in the assumptions around gold prices and discount rates, and also 
sensitive to changes in the copper price. As a result, sensitivity calculations were performed for these for each of the CGUs. The sensitivity analysis 
is based on a decrease in the long-term gold price of US$100 per ounce, i.e. US$1,100 per ounce for North Mara and Bulyanhulu, and US$1,000  
per ounce for Buzwagi, an increase in the discount rate of 1%, in isolation, and a decrease in copper prices to US$2.00 per pound, in isolation.
Buzwagi
Any decrease in gold price will result in additional impairment at Buzwagi. A decrease in the Buzwagi gold price of US$100 would result in an 
additional impairment expense of US$46 million. An increase of 1% in the discount rate in isolation will have an immaterial impact on the recoverable 
value due to the short remaining life of the operation. 
A decrease in long-term copper price to US$2.00 per pound in isolation will not have a material impact on the recoverable amount.
North Mara and Bulyanhulu
In isolation, none of the reasonably possible changes set out above would result in an impairment.

1  The 2015 reconciliation includes an amount of US$12.7 million relating to an increase in the amount of unrecognised tax benefits carried forward. The adjustment reflects 
uncertainty regarding recoverability of certain tax losses, and gives rise to an increased deferred tax charge.
2 Included is the tax impact of US$42.5 million of deferred tax assets de-recognised at Buzwagi following the impairment review.
Tax periods remain open to review by the Tanzanian Revenue Authority (‘TRA’) in respect of income taxes for five years following the date of the  
filing of the corporate tax return, during which time the authorities have the right to raise additional tax assessments including penalties and interest. 
Under certain circumstances the reviews may cover longer periods. Because a number of tax periods remain open to review by tax authorities, there 
is a risk that transactions that have not been challenged in the past by the authorities may be challenged by them in the future, and this may result  
in the raising of additional tax assessments plus penalties and interest.
14. (Loss)/earnings per share
Basic earnings per share (‘EPS’) is calculated by dividing the net (loss)/profit for the year attributable to owners of the Company by the weighted 
average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the year.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding to assume conversion of all 
dilutive potential Ordinary Shares. The Company has dilutive potential Ordinary Shares in the form of share options. The weighted average number  
of shares is adjusted for the number of shares granted assuming the exercise of share options.
At 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014, earnings per share have been calculated as follows:

1  An additional discounting agreement was concluded in June 2015 with a financial institution which gives the Group the option to factor certain concentrate receivables in order  
to further reduce the Group’s exposure to price risk, credit risk and to reduce the Group’s investment in trade receivables. Under this agreement, concentrate receivables are 
advanced by the financial institution in exchange for a discount fee of 200 basis points per annum for the discount period. The financial institution has no recourse against the 
Group for changes in pricing from the time it was advanced. As at 31 December 2015, receivables to the approximate value of US$37 million (2014: Nil) were advanced under  
this agreement.
2 Other receivables relates to employee and supplier backcharge-related receivables and refundable deposits.
Trade receivables other than concentrate receivables are non-interest bearing and are generally on 30-90-day terms. Concentrate receivables are 
generally on 60-120-day terms depending on the terms per contract. Trade receivables are amounts due from customers in the ordinary course  
of business. If collection is expected in one year or less, they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets.  
The carrying value of trade receivables recorded in the financial statements represents the maximum exposure to credit risk. The Group does not 
hold any collateral as security. 
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any 
provisions for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be 
able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.

STRATEGIC REPORT PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 22. Deferred tax assets and liabilities continued
Uncertainties regarding availability of tax losses, in respect of enquiries raised and additional tax assessments issued by the TRA, have been 
measured using the single best estimate of likely outcome approach resulting in the recognition of substantially all the related deferred tax assets 
and liabilities. Alternative acceptable measurement policies (e.g. on a weighted average expected outcome basis) could result in a change to deferred 
tax assets and liabilities being recognised, and the deferred tax charge in the income statement.
No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the Group is in a 
position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable 
future. The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with such investments in subsidiaries is represented by the contribution of those 
investments to the Group’s retained earnings and amounted to US$391 million (2014: US$325 million).

Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Trade payables 
are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
Terms and conditions of the above payables liabilities:
• Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are normally settled on 30-day of statement terms
• Accruals and other payables are non-interest bearing and have an average term of 30–60 days
27. Borrowings
During 2013, a US$142 million facility (the ‘Facility’) was put in place to fund the bulk of the costs of the construction of one of Acacia’s key growth 
projects, the Bulyanhulu CIL Expansion project (the ‘Project’). The Facility is collateralised by the Project, has a term of seven years with a spread over 
LIBOR of 250 basis points. The interest rate has been fixed at 3.6% through the use of an interest rate swap. The seven-year Facility is repayable in 
equal instalments over the term of the Facility, after a two-year repayment holiday period. The full facility of US$142 million was drawn at the end of 
2013. The first principal payment of US$14.2 million was paid in H2, 2015 and at the end of 2015 the balance owing was US$127.8 million. Interest 
accrued to the value of US$0.7 million was included in accounts payable at year end. Interest incurred on the borrowings as well as hedging losses  
on the interest rate swap for the year ended 31 December 2015 was US$5.1 million.

1   Rehabilitation provisions relate to the decommissioning costs expected to be incurred for the operating mines. This expenditure arises at different times over the life  
of mine for the different mine sites and is expected to be utilised in terms of cash outflows between years 2016 and 2054 and beyond, varying from mine site to mine site.
2  Other provisions relate to provisions for legal and tax-related liabilities where the outcome is not yet certain but it is expected that it will lead to a probable outflow of economic 
benefits in future.
3  Towards the end of 2015 reclamation guarantees for the mine sites were discussed with the Ministry of Energy and Minerals including the required rehabilitation activity. These 
discussions, in conjunction with the annual review of closure estimates and closure planning, have resulted in a re-estimation of the basis and assumptions for cost estimates and 
periods of closure needed. The change in estimate recorded in 2015 mainly relates to a reduction in cost estimated around post-closure activities, combined with changes in the 
mine plans, mining approach and scheduling which had a positive impact on rehabilitation in future.
132 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Rehabilitation obligations arise from the acquisition, development, construction and normal operation of mining property, plant and equipment, 
due to Government controls and regulations that protect the environment on the closure and reclamation of mining properties. The major parts of  
the carrying amount of the obligation relate to tailings and waste rock dump closure/rehabilitation; surface contouring; demolition of buildings/mine 
facilities; ongoing water treatment; and ongoing care and maintenance of closed mines. The fair values of rehabilitation provisions are measured  
by discounting the expected cash flows using a discount factor that reflects the credit-adjusted risk-free rate of interest. Acacia prepares estimates  
of the timing and amount of expected cash flows when an obligation is incurred and updates expected cash flows to reflect changes in facts and 
circumstances. The principal factors that can cause expected cash flows to change are: the construction of new processing facilities; changes  
in the quantities of material in reserves and a corresponding change in the life of mine plan; changing ore characteristics that impact required 
environmental protection measures and related costs; changes in water quality that impact the extent of water treatment required; and changes  
in laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment.
Each year Acacia assesses cost estimates and other assumptions used in the valuation of the rehabilitation provision at each mineral property  
to reflect events, changes in circumstances and new information available. Changes in these cost estimates and assumptions are recorded as 
an adjustment to the carrying amount of the corresponding asset. Rehabilitation provisions are adjusted to reflect the passage of time (accretion) 
calculated by applying the discount factor implicit in the initial fair-value measurement to the beginning-of-period carrying amount of the provision. 
Settlement gains/losses will be recorded in other (income) expense.
Other environmental remediation costs that are not rehabilitation provisions are expensed as incurred.

Revolving credit facility
The Group has a revolving credit facility in place for a maximum aggregate amount of US$150 million, which was negotiated on 24 November 2010 
with a syndicate of commercial banks, led by Citibank. The facility has been provided to service the general corporate needs of the Group and to  
fund potential acquisitions. All provisions contained in the credit facility documentation have been negotiated on normal commercial and customary 
terms for such finance arrangements and when drawn the spread over LIBOR will be 350 basis points. During 2015, the term of the facility was 
successfully extended to 2018 at a maximum aggregate amount of US$150 million. At 31 December 2015, none of the funds were drawn under  
the facility. The shares of all significant subsidiaries have been pledged as security for the loan. Costs associated with the revolving credit facility 
have been included in finance expenses.

The Group has exposure to the following risks through its commercial and financial operations:
a) market risk, including commodity price, foreign currency and interest rate risks;
b) credit risk; and
c) liquidity risk.
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks and the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for 
assessing and managing risk. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout the financial statements.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework.
The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, 
and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions 
and the Group’s activities. The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to maintain a disciplined and 
constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The Board of Directors has responsibility for overseeing how management monitors compliance with the Group’s risk management policies and 
procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. The Audit Committee is assisted 
in its oversight role by internal audit which undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of 
which are reported to the Audit Committee.
a) Market risk, including commodity price, foreign currency and interest rate risks
Market risk is the risk that changes in market factors, such as commodity prices, foreign exchange rates or interest rates, will affect the Group’s 
income or the value of its financial instruments.
Gold price
The market price of gold is one of the most significant factors in determining the profitability of the Group’s operations. The price of gold is subject 
 to volatile price movements over short periods of time, especially in the current market environment, and is affected by numerous industry and 
macro-economic factors that are beyond the Group’s control. In 2015 the price ranged from US$1,049 to US$1,296 per ounce, with an average 
market price of US$1,160 per ounce (2014: US$1,266 per ounce). The Group’s policy is to sell gold at prevailing market prices.
The table below summarises the impact of changes in the market price on gold. The impact is expressed in terms of the resulting change in the Group’s 
loss after tax for the year or, where applicable, the change in equity. The sensitivities are based on the assumption that the market price changes by 
10% with all other variables held constant. The impact of a similar change in copper and silver is not material to the Group’s loss after tax.

In 2015, the silver price ranged from US$14 to US$18 per ounce, with an average market price of US$16 per ounce (2014: US$19 per ounce).
The Group had copper collar contracts for 3.6 million pounds containing purchased put and call options with an average strike price of US$3.08  
per pound and US$3.35 per pound respectively maturing in 2015. These transactions are economic hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting 
treatment. Changes in the fair value of these options are recorded as a component of other income/expense in the income statement.
At 31 December 2015, the Group had no silver collar contracts outstanding (2014: No silver collar contracts outstanding).
136 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Oil price
Diesel fuel is refined from crude oil and is therefore subject to the same price volatility affecting crude oil prices. The Group enters into Brent oil 
option contracts to manage the impact of oil price fluctuations. In 2015, oil prices traded between US$36 and US$68 per barrel with an average 
market price of US$54 (2014: US$100 per barrel).
The table below summarises the impact of changes in the market prices of crude oil. The impact is expressed in terms of the resulting change  
in the Group’s profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2015. The sensitivities are based on the assumption that the market price changes  
by US$10 per barrel with all other variables held constant. The effect on profit after tax (before hedging) is calculated based on actual consumption 
for the year and does not address the indirect impact of a change in the oil price on other costs.

Oil 3,183 3,476
During the year, the Group did not add any further Brent oil collar contracts for calendar year 2015. At 31 December 2015, the Group had a total 
466,000 barrels of Brent crude oil net purchase options outstanding. These contracts mature in 2016 and 2017 consisting of sold put options with 
average strike prices of US$72 per barrel and US$50 per barrel respectively and bought call options with average strike prices of US$94 per barrel 
and US$81 per barrel respectively. During the year, the Group added 294,000 barrels of Brent oil collar contracts for calendar year 2016 and 2017.
These contracts are treated as accounting hedges in accordance with IAS 39. Hedged items are identified as the first stated quantity of forecasted 
consumption purchased in a future month. Hedge effectiveness is assessed using linear regression utilising the concept of the hypothetical 
derivative method. The effective portion of changes in intrinsic value of the commodity contracts is recorded in other comprehensive income until  
the forecasted expenditure impacts earnings. During 2015, these hedges did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment as a result of not meeting 
the hedge effectiveness criteria. Changes in the fair value of these options were therefore recorded as a component of other income/expense in the 
income statement.
Risks relating to the use of derivatives
By using derivatives, in addition to credit risk, we are affected by market risk. Market risk is the risk that the fair value of a derivative might be 
adversely affected by a change in commodity prices, interest rates, or currency exchange rates, and that this in turn affects our financial condition. 
We manage market risk by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken.
Foreign currency risk
The Group’s transactions are denominated in a number of different currencies (primarily US dollars, Tanzanian shillings (‘shillings’), South African 
rands (‘rands’), UK pounds sterling (‘pounds’) and Australian dollars. The Group has liabilities that are primarily denominated in US dollars.  
The US dollar is the Company’s (and its subsidiaries’) functional currency, as well as the Group’s presentation currency. Therefore, transactions  
in currencies other than the US dollar give rise to foreign currency translation risk. The Group’s primary exposure to this risk arises from direct  
mine operating costs and corporate administration costs that are transacted in shillings and rands, respectively. Consequently, fluctuations in  
the US dollar/shilling/rand exchange rates increase the volatility of cost of sales, corporate administration costs and overall net earnings, which  
are reported in US dollars. The vast majority of all direct mining costs and corporate administration costs are denominated and settled in US dollars. 
Consequently, the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations on the Group’s reported direct mining and corporate administration costs is not significant.
The exchange rates at the end of each financial year are detailed in Note 2g).
Historically, the relationship between the gold price and the value of the shilling and rand provide a natural hedge against fluctuations in the exchange 
rate of these currencies against the US dollar. Generally, a strengthening of the shilling/rand, which would cause an increase in reported US dollar 
operating costs, corresponds with an increase in the US dollar gold price, which results in an increase in reported US dollar revenues.
The Group enters into rand/US dollar collar contracts to manage the impact of currency fluctuations on rand denominated operating and capital 
expenditures. In 2015, the rand traded between R11.27 and R15.90 per US dollar, and averaged R12.72 per US dollar (2014: R10.85 per US dollar).

had no rand collar contracts outstanding (2014: US$26 million of rand collar contracts with purchased put and sold call options with average strike 
prices R10.43 and R12.80 respectively and R171 million of rand collar contracts with purchased put and sold call options with average strike prices 
of R10.50 and R12.65 respectively). The contracts that matured in 2015 were booked with rand nominal values and therefore act as a hedge against 
variability in the rand/US dollar exchange range over the period. These contracts are treated as accounting hedges in accordance with IAS 39. 
Hedged items are identified as the first stated quantity of rand spent during the month. Hedge effectiveness will be assessed using linear regression 
utilising the concept of the hypothetical derivative method. The effective portion of changes in intrinsic value of the currency contracts is recorded  
in other comprehensive income until the forecasted expenditure impact occurs. The Group does have significant financial assets denominated in  
a currency other than US dollars. These financial assets are as follow:

Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk refers to the risk that the value of a financial instrument or cash flows associated with the instruments will fluctuate due to changes 
in market interest rates. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose 
the Group to fair value interest rate risk. The Group is also exposed to interest rate risk on its cash and cash equivalents.
At present, available funds are held with financial institutions at variable rates and primarily denominated in US dollars; interest income is not 
materially affected by changes in short-term interest rates. During 2013, the Group entered into an Export Credit Insurance Company (‘ECIC’) backed 
seven-year term loan facility of US$142 million to fund the construction of the CIL Process plant at Bulyanhulu. As at 31 December 2015 the loan  
is fully drawn with the first capital instalment totalling $14.2 million having been repaid during the year. The balance owing as at 31 December 2015 
was US$127.8 million. Interest is payable on the loan at LIBOR plus 250 basis points. The revolving credit facility’s spread over LIBOR will be 350 
basis points. Group debt levels are impacted by the amount of operating cash flow generated by its operating mines, as well as capital expenditure 
requirements related to existing operations and development projects.
In 2013, the Group entered into interest rate swap contracts to hedge the interest on the ECIC backed loan for the Bulyanhulu CIL Process plant. The 
terms of the interest rate swap contracts fix this at 3.59% versus the floating rate of LIBOR plus 2.50%. These contracts are treated as accounting 
hedges in accordance with IAS 39. Hedged items are identified as the first stated quantity of rand spent during the month. Hedge effectiveness  
is assessed using linear regression utilising the concept of the hypothetical derivative method. The effective portion of changes in intrinsic value  
of the currency contracts is recorded in other comprehensive income until the forecasted expenditure occurs. For 2014, these gains or losses were 
capitalised against the Bulyanhulu CIL Process plant asset until the plant was brought into operation. Thereafter the gains or losses have been 
included as part of interest expense in the income statement.
138 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED b) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a third party might fail to fulfil its performance obligations under the terms of a financial instrument. For cash and cash 
equivalents and trade and other receivables, credit risk represents the carrying amount on the balance sheet, net of any overdraft positions.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, and deposits with banks, as well as trade and other receivables. The Group’s financial assets  
are held with counterparties who the Group considers have an appropriate credit rating. Location of credit risk is determined by physical location  
of the bank branch, customer or counterparty. The maximum allowable term to maturity for any individual security is three months. Investment 
counterparties must have a credit rating of at least “Baa1” or better by Moody’s Investor Services or “BBB+” by Standard and Poor’s. No more than 
25% of the aggregate market value of the investment portfolio is maintained in any one country, with the exception of the United States of America  
or the United Kingdom, or in any one industry group. Investments are primarily held in United States dollars. Cash and cash equivalents in other 
foreign currencies are maintained for operational requirements. As at 31 December 2015 the Group has money market and short-term investments 
of US$111.4 million. All of the funds have at least a “BBB+” rating from Standard and Poor’s. The Group also has US$121.9 million of cash on hand 
with banks with credit ratings ranging from “A-1” to “A-2”.
With respect to other receivables, the most significant debtor is the Tanzanian Revenue Authority (‘TRA’). Following the abolishment of Government 
Notices regarding VAT relief and fuel duty exemption for mining companies in 2009, Acacia signed a Memorandum of Settlement during 2011 with  
the TRA to address the treatment of certain outstanding indirect tax refunds in respect of fuel levies and VAT that allows Acacia to offset income  
tax payable against outstanding VAT and fuel levy refunds as it becomes payable. Also, the Minister of Finance reinstated VAT relief and the fuel 
exemption followed by an agreement to allow for an escrow facility in respect of fuel and road levies. Again through the Finance Act, 2012 issued  
on 19 October 2012, VAT Relief was abolished. Throughout the past three years, Acacia has been actively involved in discussions with the Tanzanian 
Government and the TRA to resolve the issue. The amendments conflict with certain provisions contained in the Group’s existing Mine Development 
Agreements (‘MDAs’) which guarantee the fiscal stability of its operations. As part of a short-term solution, the Government during the third quarter  
of 2013, agreed to an escrow arrangement on VAT in relation to imported goods and services, whereby funds are restricted to the repayment of  
VAT refunds. As at 31 December 2015, the discounted amounts due to the Group were approximately US$110.2 million (2014: US$108.1 million).  
We received refunds to the value of US$89.4 million (2014: US$132.8 million) during the year under review.
Group policies are aimed at minimising losses as a result of a counterparty’s failure to honour its obligations. Individual exposures are monitored  
with trade customers subject to credit limits to ensure that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant. The Group’s exposure to credit risk  
is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each of the counterparties. The Group’s financial assets are with counterparties who the 
Group considers have an appropriate credit rating. During the year, receivables to the value of approximately US$116 million (2014: US$32 million) 
were advanced by a financial institution under two factoring agreements for two concentrate counterparties. Three agreements reduce the risk of 
default of receivables.
Maximum exposure to credit risk at each reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets described in Note 30. The Group does 
not hold collateral as security for any trade receivables. The Group does not grade the credit quality of receivables.
c) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk of loss from not having access to sufficient funds to meet both expected and unexpected cash demands. The Group manages 
its exposure to liquidity risk by ensuring that its operating and strategic liquidity levels are well above minimum internal requirements. Prudent liquidity 
risk management includes maintaining sufficient cash balances, and the availability of funding from an adequate amount of committed credit 
facilities. At the end of both 2015 and 2014 the Group was in a positive net cash position, as disclosed in Note 19. Details of the undrawn revolving 
credit facility are given in Note 30.
In the ordinary course of business, the Group receives cash proceeds from its operations and is required to fund working capital and capital 
expenditure requirements. The cash is managed to ensure surplus funds are invested to maximise returns while ensuring that capital is safeguarded 
to the maximum extent possible by investing only with financial institutions with a strong credit rating. Insignificant uncommitted overdraft facilities 
are maintained with several banking counterparties to meet the Group’s normal funding requirements. The Group’s primary source of liquidity is 
operating cash flow, and over the past two years the Group has generated an average of about US$223 million per year. The principal risk factor 
affecting operating cash flow is market gold prices. 
The principal uses of liquidity are sustaining capital expenditures at existing operating mines, construction activities at development projects, and 
interest payments. Sustaining capital expenditures, including capitalised development costs, have averaged about US$185 million per year over the 
past two years. The following table outlines the expected maturity of the Group’s significant financial assets into relevant maturity groupings based  
on the remaining period from the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. As the amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual 
undiscounted cash flows, these balances may not agree with the amounts disclosed in the balance sheet.

Management considers that the Group has adequate current assets and forecast cash flow from operations to manage liquidity risks arising from 
settlement of current liabilities and non-current liabilities.
Capital risk management
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong balance sheet and low gearing ratio to support  
its business and provide financial flexibility in order to maximise shareholder value. In order to ensure a strong balance sheet and low gearing ratio, 
management thoroughly evaluates all material projects and potential acquisitions, which are approved by the Executive Leadership Team before 
submission to the Board for ultimate approval, where applicable.

34. Commitments and contingencies
The Group is subject to various laws and regulations which, if not observed, could give rise to penalties. As at 31 December 2015, the Group has the 
following commitments and/or contingencies:
a) Legal contingencies
As at 31 December 2015, the Group was a defendant in approximately 341 lawsuits. The plaintiffs are claiming damages and interest thereon for the 
loss caused by the Group due to one or more of the following: unlawful eviction, termination of services, wrongful termination of contracts of service, 
non-payment for services, defamation, negligence by act or omission in failing to provide a safe working environment, unpaid overtime and public 
holiday compensation. 
The total amounts claimed from lawsuits in which specific monetary damages are sought amounted to US$280.0 million. The Group’s Legal Counsel 
is defending the Group’s current position, and the outcome of the lawsuits cannot presently be determined. However, in the opinion of the Directors 
and Group’s Legal Counsel, no material liabilities are expected to materialise from these lawsuits that have not already been provided for. 
Included in the total amounts claimed is a claim for US$115 million by Bismark Hotel Limited alleging breach of contract arising from an Optional 
Agreement signed in 1995. The claim relates to an application for a prospecting licence with no attributable reserves, resources or value. We are waiting 
for the adjudicators to fix a hearing date. Management is of the opinion that the claim does not have substance and that it will be successfully defended.
NMGML and Diamond Motors Ltd (‘DML’) have entered into arbitration over the interpretation of drilling contracts entered into by the parties, relating 
to periodic rate review and other provisions of the contracts. The award was delivered on 10 August 2015, with the Tribunal determining an award of 
US$4 million against the final claimed amount of US$25 million. This award was consistent with NMGML’s position in relation to the arbitration and 
the full amount has been provided for. DML on 31 December 2015 filed a Petition at the High Court to challenge the award. 
A claim has been made for US$15 million by the contractor responsible for the engineering, procurement and construction of a carbon in leach circuit 
at Bulyanhulu Gold Mine (‘BGML’). BGML has made claims in relation to delay damages and other breaches of the contract totalling US$22 million. 
These claims were referred to adjudication, with the initial decision finding in favour of the contractor. The claims have now been referred to 
arbitration and management is of the opinion that it will be successful in respect of both claims.
b) Tax-related contingencies
The TRA has issued a number of tax assessments to the Group relating to past taxation years from 2002 onwards. The Group believes that these 
assessments are incorrect and has filed objections to each of them. The Group is attempting to resolve these matters by means of discussions with 
the TRA or through the Tanzanian Appeals process. During 2013, the Board ruled in favour of BGML in relation to seven of ten issues raised by the 
TRA in final assessments for 2000–2006 years under review. The TRA filed a notice of intention to appeal against the ruling of the Board and Acacia 
filed a counter appeal in respect of BGML to the Appeals Tribunal for all three items that were lost. The Tribunal delivered its judgement in 2014 and 
confirmed the Board’s decision on the three items that Acacia lost. Following the Tribunal’s decision, two notices of intention to appeal were filed and 
we are still waiting for the hearing date from the Court of Appeal. The positions that were ruled against BGML were sufficiently provided for in prior 
year results and management is of the opinion that open issues will not result in any material liabilities to the Group.
Also included is an appeal by the TRA intended for a tax assessment of US$21.3 million in respect of the acquisition of Tusker Gold Limited. The 
calculated tax assessment is based on the sales price of the Nyanzaga property of US$71 million multiplied by the tax rate of 30%. Management is  
of the opinion that the assessment is invalid due to the fact that the acquisition was for Tusker Gold Limited, a company incorporated in Australia. The 
shareholding of the Tanzanian related entities did not change and the Tusker Gold Limited group structure remains the same as prior to the acquisition. 
The case was awarded in favour of Acacia however the TRA served a notice of appeal. The appeal was decided in favour of Acacia by the Tax Board and 
the Tax Tribunal, but the TRA has appealed against the Tribunal’s decision in the Court of Appeal. We are waiting for the hearing date to be set.
The TRA raised claims to the value of US$41.3 million for withholding tax on historic offshore dividend payments paid by Acacia Mining plc to its 
shareholders. In addition to the claim, there are six other withholding tax claims which have not been quantified. The TRA have also issued corporate 
tax assessments to Acacia Mining plc to the value of US$500.7 million. These claims are made on the basis that Acacia is resident in Tanzania for 
tax purposes. The corporate tax assessments have been levied on the Group net profits before tax. Management are of the opinion that the claims 
do not have substance and that it will be successfully defended in court in terms of the case already on appeal with the Tax Tribunal.

c) Exploration and development agreements – Mining licences
Pursuant to agreements with the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania, the Group was issued special mining licences for Bulyanhulu, 
Buzwagi and North Mara mines and mining licences for building materials at Bulyanhulu and Buzwagi Mines. The agreement requires the Group to pay 
to the Government of Tanzania annual rents of US$5,000 per annum per square kilometre for as long as the Group holds the special mining licences 
and US$2,000 per annum per square kilometre for so long as the Group holds the mining licences for building materials. The total commitment  
for 2015 for the remaining special mining licences and mining licences for building materials amounts to US$0.66 million (2014: US$0.66 million). 
d) Purchase commitments
At 31 December 2015, the Group had purchase obligations for supplies and consumables of approximately US$43 million (2014: US$64 million).
e) Capital commitments

in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that 
the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent 
company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied  
and adequately disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made  
by the Directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
144 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ACACIA MINING PLC We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ 
judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements,  
and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing 
techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable 
basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through 
testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or  
a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information  
in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the  
audited financial statements and to identify any information that  
is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent  
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the  
audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements  
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
OTHER MATTER
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements  
of Acacia Mining plc for the year ended 31 December 2015.

STRATEGIC REPORT PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
PARENT COMPANY CASH FLOW STATEMENT 1. Corporate information
Acacia Mining plc, formerly African Barrick Gold plc, (the ‘Company’) was 
incorporated on 12 January 2010 and re-registered as a public limited 
company on 12 March 2010 under the Companies Act 2006. It is 
registered in England and Wales with registered number 7123187.
On 24 March 2010 the Company’s shares were admitted to the Official 
List of the United Kingdom Listing Authority (‘UKLA’) and to trading on 
the main market of the London Stock Exchange, hereafter referred to  
as the Initial Public Offering (‘IPO’). The address of its registered office  
is 5th Floor, 1 Cavendish Place, London, W1G 0QF, United Kingdom.
Barrick Gold Corporation (‘BGC’) currently owns approximately 63.9%  
of the shares of the Company and is the ultimate controlling party  
of the Group. The financial statements of BGC can be obtained from  
www.barrick.com
The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 were 
approved for issue by the Board of Directors of the Company on 8 March 
2016. The primary activity of the Company is as holding company for  
the Acacia Mining Group of companies.
2. Significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these 
financial statements are set out below. 
a) Basis of preparation 
The Company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union (‘IFRS’), IFRIC interpretations and those parts of the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared on  
a historical cost basis.
The Company’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably 
possible changes in trading performance, show that the Company should 
be able to operate within the level of its current financing.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation  
that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. The Company therefore adopts  
the going concern basis in preparing its financial statements.
The financial statements are presented in US dollars (US$) and all values 
are rounded to the nearest thousand (US$’000) except when otherwise 
indicated. Where a change in the presentational format between the  
prior year and current year financial statements has been made during 
the period, comparative figures are restated accordingly. No changes 
were made to presentational format in the current year.
The basis of preparation and accounting policies used in preparing the 
financial statements are set out below.
b) New and amended standards adopted by the Company
The following new standards and amendments to standards are 
applicable and were adopted by the Company for the first time for the 
financial year beginning 1 January 2015.
• Amendment to IFRS 2, ‘Share-based payment’. The amendment 
clarifies the definition of a ‘vesting condition’ and separately defines 
‘performance condition’ and ‘service condition’. The amendment did 
not have a significant effect on the Company financial statements.
• Amendment to IFRS 3, ‘Business combinations’. The standard is 
amended to clarify that an obligation to pay contingent consideration 
which meets the definition of a financial instrument is classified as a 
financial liability or as equity, on the basis of the definitions in IAS 32, 
‘Financial instruments: Presentation’. The standard is further amended 
to clarify that all non-equity contingent consideration, both financial  
and non-financial, is measured at fair value at each reporting date, with 
changes in fair value recognised in profit and loss. The amendment  
did not have a significant effect on the Company financial statements.
• Amendment to IFRS 8, ‘Operating segments’. The standard  
is amended to require disclosure of the judgements made by 
management in aggregating operating segments. The standard is 
further amended to require a reconciliation of segment assets to the 
entity’s assets when segment assets are reported. The amendment 
did not have a significant effect on the Company financial statements.
• Amendment to IFRS 13, ‘Fair value measurement’. The IASB has 
amended the basis for conclusions of IFRS 13 to clarify that it did  
not intend to remove the ability to measure short-term receivables 
and payables at invoice amounts in such cases. The amendment did 
not have a significant effect on the Company financial statements.
• IAS 16, ‘Property, plant and equipment’, and ‘IAS 38’, ‘Intangible 
assets’. Both standards are amended to clarify how the gross 
carrying amount and the accumulated depreciation are treated where 
an entity uses the revaluation model. The carrying amount of the 
asset is restated to the revalued amount. The amendment did not 
have a significant effect on the Company financial statements.
• IAS 24, ‘Related party disclosures’. The standard is amended to 
include, as a related party, an entity that provides key management 
personnel services to the reporting entity or to the parent of the 
reporting entity (‘the management entity’). The amendment did not 
have a significant effect on the Company financial statements.
• IFRS 13, ‘Fair value measurement’. The amendment clarifies that  
the portfolio exception in IFRS 13, which allows an entity to measure  
the fair value of a group of financial assets and financial liabilities on 
a net basis, applies to all contracts (including non-financial contracts) 
within the scope of IAS 39 or IFRS 9. The amendment did not have  
a significant effect on the Company financial statements.
• IFRS 3, ‘Business combinations’. The standard is amended to clarify 
that IFRS 3 does not apply to the accounting for the formation of any 
joint arrangement under IFRS 11. The amendment also clarifies that 
the scope exemption only applies in the financial statements of the 
joint arrangement itself. The amendment did not have a significant 
effect on the Company financial statements.
c) New and amended standards, and interpretations  
not yet adopted
The following standards and amendments to existing standards have 
been published and are effective for the Company’s accounting periods 
beginning after 1 January 2016:
• Amendments to IFRS 10, ‘Consolidated financial statements’ and 
IAS 28 ’Investments in associates and joint ventures’ on sale or 
contribution of assets. The IASB has issued this amendment to 
eliminate the inconsistency between IFRS 10 and IAS 28. Effective 
1 January 2016. The amendment is not expected to have a significant 
impact on the Company.
• Amendments to IFRS 10, ‘Consolidated financial statements’ and  
IAS 28 ’Investments in associates and joint ventures’ on applying  
the consolidation exemption. The amendments clarify the application 
of the consolidation exception for investment entities and their 
subsidiaries. Effective 1 January 2016. The amendment is not 
expected to have a significant impact on the Company.
• Amendment to IFRS 11 ‘Joint arrangements’ on acquisition of an 
interest in a joint operation. This amendment adds new guidance on 
how to account for the acquisition of an interest in a joint operation 
that constitutes a business. Effective 1 January 2016. The standard 
is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company.
• Amendments to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of financial statements’ disclosure 
initiative. In December 2014 the IASB issued amendments to clarify 
guidance in IAS 1 on materiality and aggregation, the presentation  
of subtotals, the structure of financial statements and the disclosure  
of accounting policies. Effective 1 January 2016. The amendment is 
not expected to have a significant impact on the Company.
150 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015
NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS • Amendment to IAS 16 ‘Property, plant and equipment’ and IAS 38 
‘Intangible assets’, on depreciation and amortisation. In this 
amendment the IASB has clarified that the use of revenue based 
methods to calculate the depreciation of an asset is not appropriate 
because revenue generated by an activity that includes the use of an 
asset generally reflects factors other than the consumption of the 
economic benefits embodied in the asset. The IASB has also clarified 
that revenue is generally presumed to be an inappropriate basis  
for measuring the consumption of the economic benefits embodied  
in an intangible asset. Effective 1 January 2016. The amendment  
is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company.
• Amendments to IAS 27, ‘Separate financial statements’ on equity 
accounting. In this amendment the IASB has restored the option  
to use the equity method to account for investments in subsidiaries, 
joint ventures and associates in an entity’s separate financial 
statements. Effective 1 January 2016. The amendment is not 
expected to have a significant impact on the Company.
• IFRS 15 – ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’. The FASB and 
IASB issued their long awaited converged standard on revenue 
recognition on 29 May 2014. It is a single, comprehensive revenue 
recognition model for all contracts with customers to achieve greater 
consistency in the recognition and presentation of revenue. Revenue 
is recognised based on the satisfaction of performance obligations, 
which occurs when control of good or service transfers to a customer. 
Effective 1 January 2018. The standard is not expected to have  
a significant impact on the Company.
• IFRS 9 – ‘Financial Instruments’ (2009 & 2010). The IASB has 
updated IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’ to include guidance on 
financial liabilities and de-recognition of financial instruments.  
The accounting and presentation for financial liabilities and for 
de-recognising financial instruments has been relocated from IAS 39, 
‘Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement’, without 
change, except for financial liabilities that are designated at fair  
value through profit or loss. Effective 1 January 2018. The standard  
is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company.
• Amendment to IFRS 9 – ‘Financial instruments’, on general hedge 
accounting. The IASB has amended IFRS 9 to align hedge accounting 
more closely with an entity’s risk management. The revised standard 
also establishes a more principles-based approach to hedge 
accounting and addresses inconsistencies and weaknesses in the 
current model in IAS 39. The transitional provisions described above 
are likely to change once the IASB completes all phases of IFRS 9. 
Effective 1 January 2018. The amendment is not expected to have  
a significant impact on the Company.
• IFRS 16 – ‘Leases’. IFRS 16 supersedes IAS 17, ‘Leases’, IFRIC 4, 
‘Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease’, SIC 15, 
‘Operating Leases – Incentives’ and SIC 27, ‘Evaluating the 
Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease’. 
Effective 1 January 2019. The standard is not expected to have  
a significant impact on the Company.
• IFRS 5 ‘Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations’. 
This is an amendment to the changes in methods of disposal – Assets 
(or disposal groups) are generally disposed of either through sale  
or through distribution to owners. The amendment to IFRS 5 clarifies  
that changing from one of these disposal methods to the other  
should not be considered to be a new plan of disposal, rather it is  
a continuation of the original plan. There is therefore no interruption  
of the application of the requirements in IFRS 5. The amendment also 
clarifies that changing the disposal method does not change the date 
of classification. Effective 1 January 2016. The amendment is not 
expected to have a significant impact on the Company.
• IFRS 7 – ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’. Applicability of the 
offsetting disclosures to condensed interim financial statements. The 
amendment removes the phrase, and interim periods within those 
annual periods’ from paragraph 44R, clarifying that these IFRS 7 
disclosures are not required in the condensed interim financial report. 
However, the Board noted that IAS 34 requires an entity to disclose 
an explanation of events and transactions that are significant to an 
understanding of the changes in financial position and performance 
of the entity since the end of the last annual reporting period. 
Therefore, if the IFRS 7 disclosures provide a significant update to  
the information reported in the most recent annual report, the Board 
would expect the disclosures to be included in the entity’s condensed 
interim financial report. Effective 1 January 2016. The amendment  
is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company.
• IFRS 7 – ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’. Servicing contracts – 
The amendment clarifies that a servicing contract that includes a fee 
can constitute continuing involvement in a financial asset. An entity 
must assess the nature of the fee and arrangement against the 
guidance for continuing involvement in paragraphs IFRS 7.B30 and 
IFRS 7.42C in order to assess whether the disclosures are required. 
Effective 1 January 2016. The amendment is not expected to have  
a significant impact on the Company.
• IAS 19 – ‘Employee Benefits’. Discount rate: regional market issue – 
The amendment to IAS 19 clarifies that market depth of high quality 
corporate bonds is assessed based on the currency in which the 
obligation is denominated, rather than the country where the 
obligation is located. When there is no deep market for high quality 
corporate bonds in that currency, government bond rates must be 
used. Effective 1 January 2016. The amendment is not expected  
to have a significant impact on the Company.
d) Significant judgements in applying accounting policies 
and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
Many of the amounts included in the parent company financial 
statements require management to make judgements and/or estimates. 
These judgements and estimates are continuously evaluated and are 
based on management’s experience and best knowledge of the relevant 
facts and circumstances, but actual results may differ from the amounts 
included in the parent company financial statements. Information about 
such judgements and estimation is included in the accounting policies 
and/or notes to the financial statements, and the key areas are 
summarised below.
Areas of judgement and key sources of estimation uncertainty that have 
the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the parent 
company financial statements include: 
• Whether to recognise a provision for accounts receivable – Notes 2h) 
and 9;
• Recognition of deferred income tax assets, amounts recorded for 
uncertain tax positions, the measurement of income tax expense and 
indirect taxes – Notes 2j) and 5; and
• Review of property, plant and equipment and investments in 
subsidiaries, the determination of whether these assets are impaired 
and the measurement of impairment charges or reversals – Notes 2f), 
7 and 8.

STRATEGIC REPORT PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 2. Significant accounting policies continued
e) Foreign currency translation
The Company’s transactions are denominated in a number of different 
currencies (primarily US dollars and UK pounds sterling). The Company 
has liabilities that are primarily denominated in US dollars. The US  
dollar is the Company’s functional currency, as well as the Company’s 
presentation currency. Transactions in currencies other than the US 
dollar are translated at the exchange rates as at the date of transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than  
the US dollar are translated to US dollars at year-end exchange rates.  
All differences that arise are recorded in the income statement. 
Non-monetary assets measured at historical cost in a currency other 
than US dollars are translated using the exchange rates at the date  
of the initial transactions. Where non-monetary assets are measured  
at fair value in a currency other than US dollars they are translated into 
US dollars using the exchange rates on the date when the fair value  
was determined. 
The following exchange rates to the US dollar have been applied:

f) Investment in subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities to which the Company is exposed, or has the 
rights to variable returns from its involvement and has the ability to 
affect those returns through its power. Control exists when the Company 
has existing rights and the ability to direct relevant activities, exposure  
or rights to variable returns from its involvement and the ability to use  
its power to affect the amount of returns.
At each reporting date, an assessment is made to determine whether 
there are any indicators of impairment. Where an indicator of impairment 
exists, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount of the investment  
in a subsidiary is made, which is considered to be the higher of the fair 
value less costs to dispose and the value in use. Fair value is determined 
as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the investment in 
an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties. 
If the carrying amount of an investment exceeds the recoverable amount, 
a provision is recorded in the income statement to reflect the investment 
at the recoverable amount. Where an impairment charge has previously 
been recognised, an assessment is made at the end of each reporting 
period whether there is any indication that the impairment loss may  
no longer exist or may have decreased. If any such indication exists,  
an estimate of the recoverable amount is made. An impairment loss  
is reversed to the income statement to the extent that the increased 
carrying value of the investment in subsidiary does not exceed the 
original carrying value.
g) Share capital
Ordinary Shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly 
attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity  
as a deduction from the proceeds.
h) Financial instruments
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the balance sheet at fair value. 
For the purposes of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents 
include cash, and money market funds. For the purposes of the cash 
flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash 
equivalents as defined above.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not 
qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair 
value through profit and loss or available for sale. These are initially 
recognised at fair value, and are subsequently stated at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method. They are included in current assets, 
except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet 
date, which are classified as non-current assets.
Loans and receivables comprise other receivables and cash and cash 
equivalents at the balance sheet date.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there 
is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all 
amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. The carrying 
amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account. 
The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement.
Financial liabilities
Other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
i) Finance income and finance expense 
Interest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the 
effective interest method. When a receivable is impaired, the Company 
reduces the carrying amount to its recoverable amount, being the 
estimated future cash flow discounted at the original effective interest 
rate of the instrument, and continues unwinding the discount as interest 
income.
j) Taxes
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax.  
Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that  
it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly  
in equity. In this case the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity, respectively.
Current income tax
Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current period are 
measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the 
taxation authorities. Management periodically evaluates positions taken 
in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation 
is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate 
on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities. The 
tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax
Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance 
sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable 
that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. 
Indirect tax 
Indirect tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods  
are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to  
the taxation authorities. Management periodically evaluates positions 
taken in indirect tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable 
tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions  
or receivables where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected  
to be paid to or received from the tax authorities. The tax rates and  
tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted  
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. If the receivable  
is expected to be received in more than 12 months from year-end, the 
receivable is discounted and held at its present value. Amounts expected 
to be payable or receivable in more than 12 months are classified as 
non-current assets or liabilities in the balance sheet, as appropriate.
k) Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as  
a liability in the Company’s financial statements in the period in which 
the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.

Revolving credit facility
The Group has a revolving credit facility in place for a maximum aggregate amount of US$150 million, which was negotiated on 24 November 2010 
with a syndicate of commercial banks, led by Citibank. The facility has been provided to service the general corporate needs of the Group and to fund 
potential acquisitions. All provisions contained in the credit facility documentation have been negotiated on normal commercial and customary terms 
for such finance arrangements and when drawn the spread over LIBOR will be 350 basis points. During 2015, the term of the facility was successfully 
extended to 2018 at a maximum aggregate amount of US$150 million whereby existing lenders opted to take up US$25 million from lenders who 
opted not to extend. At 31 December 2015, none of the funds were drawn under the facility. The shares of all significant subsidiaries have been 
pledged as security for the loan.
16. Financial risk management
The Company has exposure to the following risks through its commercial and financial operations:
a) credit risk; and
b) liquidity risk.
This note presents information about the Company’s exposure to each of the above risks and the Company’s objectives, policies and processes  
for assessing and managing risk. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout the financial statements. 
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company’s risk management framework. 
The Company’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits  
and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in  
market conditions and the Company’s activities. The Company, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to maintain  
a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
a) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a third party might fail to fulfil its performance obligations under the terms of a financial instrument. For cash and cash 
equivalents and other receivables, credit risk represents the carrying amount on the balance sheet.
ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 157
STRATEGIC REPORT PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 16. Financial risk management continued
Credit risk arises from loans to two subsidiaries, receivables, cash and cash equivalents, and deposits with banks. The Company’s financial assets 
are with counterparties whom the Company considers to have an appropriate credit rating. Location of credit risk is determined by physical location  
of the bank branch, customer or counterparty. The maximum allowable term of maturity for any individual security is 12 months. Investment 
counterparties must have a credit rating of at least Baa2 or better by Moody’s Investor Services or BBB by Standard and Poor’s. No more than  
25% of the aggregate market value of the investment portfolio is maintained in any one country, with the exception of the United States of America, 
United Kingdom and Barbados, or in any one industry group. Investments are held mainly in United States dollars and cash and cash equivalents  
in other foreign currencies are maintained for operational requirements.
Company policies are aimed at minimising losses as a result of a counterparty’s failure to honour its obligations. The Company’s exposure to  
credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each counterparty. The Company’s financial assets are with counterparties whom 
the Company considers to have an appropriate credit rating. Maximum exposure to credit risk at each reporting date is the carrying value of each 
class of financial assets in Note 15. The Company does not hold collateral as security for any receivables. The Company does not grade the credit 
quality of receivables.
b) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Company monitors its risk of  
a shortage of funds using projected cash flows and by monitoring the maturity of both its financial assets and liabilities.
The following table outlines the expected maturity of the Company’s significant financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on  
the remaining period from the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. As the amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual 
undiscounted cash flows, these balances may not agree with the amounts disclosed in the balance sheet.

Management considers that the Company has adequate current assets and forecast cash flow from operations to manage liquidity risks arising from 
settlement of current liabilities and non-current liabilities.
Capital risk management
The primary objective of the Company’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong balance sheet and low gearing ratio to support  
its business and provide financial flexibility in order to maximise shareholder value. In order to ensure a strong balance sheet and low gearing ratio, 
management thoroughly evaluates all material projects and potential acquisitions and approves them at its Executive committee before submission 
to the Board for ultimate approval, where applicable.

STRATEGIC REPORT PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION Non-IFRS measures
Acacia has identified certain measures in this report that are not 
measures defined under IFRS. Non-IFRS financial measures disclosed  
by management are provided as additional information to investors in 
order to provide them with an alternative method for assessing Acacia’s 
financial condition and operating results. These measures are not in 
accordance with, or a substitute for, IFRS, and may be different from or 
inconsistent with non-IFRS financial measures used by other companies. 
These measures are explained further below.
Average realised gold price per ounce sold 
A non-IFRS financial measure which excludes from gold revenue:
• Unrealised gains and losses on non-hedge derivative contracts; and
• Export duties.
Cash cost per ounce sold
A non-IFRS financial measure. Cash costs include all costs absorbed into 
inventory, as well as royalties, by-product credits and production taxes, 
and exclude capitalised production stripping costs, inventory purchase 
accounting adjustments, unrealised gains/losses from non-hedge 
currency and commodity contracts, depreciation and amortisation and 
corporate social responsibility charges. Cash cost is calculated net of 
co-product revenue.
The presentation of these statistics in this manner allows Acacia to 
monitor and manage those factors that impact production costs on a 
monthly basis. Acacia calculates cash costs based on its equity interest 
in production from its mines. Cash costs per ounce sold are calculated 
by dividing the aggregate of these costs by gold ounces sold. Cash costs 
and cash cost per ounce sold are calculated on a consistent basis for 
the periods presented.
The table below provides a reconciliation between cost of sales and total 
cash cost to calculate the cash cost per ounce sold.
Year ended 31 December
(US$’000) 2015 2014
Total cost of sales 734,167 688,278
Deduct: depreciation and amortisation (141,697) (128,124)
Deduct: co-product revenue (35,669) (45,253)
Total cash cost 556,801 514,901
Total ounces sold 721,203 703,680
Cash cost per ounce (US$/oz) 772 732
All-in sustaining cost (‘AISC’)
A non-IFRS financial measure. The measure is in accordance with the 
World Gold Council’s guidance issued in June 2013. It is calculated  
by taking the aggregate of cash costs, corporate administration costs, 
reclamation and remediation costs for operating mines, corporate social 
responsibility expenses, mine exploration and study costs, capitalised 
stripping and underground development costs and sustaining capital 
expenditure. This is then divided by the total ounces sold. A reconciliation 
between cash cost per ounce sold and AISC is presented below:

GLOSSARY OF TERMS CONTINUED EBITDA
A non-IFRS financial measure. Acacia calculates EBITDA as net profit  
or loss for the period excluding:
• Income tax expense;
• Finance expense;
• Finance income;
• Depreciation and amortisation; and
• Impairment charges of goodwill and other long-lived assets.
EBITDA is intended to provide additional information to investors and 
analysts. It does not have any standardised meaning prescribed by  
IFRS and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for 
measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. EBITDA 
excludes the impact of cash costs of financing activities and taxes,  
and the effects of changes in operating working capital balances, and 
therefore is not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow 
from operations as determined under IFRS. Other companies may 
calculate EBITDA differently.
A reconciliation between net (loss)/profit for the year and EBITDA is 
presented below:
Year ended 31 December
(US$’000) 2015 2014
Net(loss)/profit for the year (197,148) 89,935
Plus income tax expense 72,988 25,977

Less finance income (1,384) (1,401)
EBITDA 174,971 252,716
1  Depreciation and amortisation includes the depreciation component of the cost of 
inventory sold.
Adjusted EBITDA
A non-IFRS financial measure. It is calculated by excluding one-off costs 
or credits relating to non-routine transactions from EBITDA. It excludes 
other credits and charges that, individually or in aggregate, if of a similar 
type, are of a nature or size that requires explanation in order to provide 
additional insight into the underlying business performance. EBITDA is 
adjusted for items (a) to (e) as contained in the reconciliation to adjusted 
net earnings below.
EBIT
A non-IFRS financial measure and it reflects EBITDA adjusted for 
depreciation and amortisation and goodwill impairment charges.
Adjusted net earnings
A non-IFRS financial measure. It is calculated by excluding certain costs 
or credits relating to non-routine transactions from net profit attributed  
to owners of the parent. It includes other credit and charges that, 
individually or in aggregate, if of a similar type, are of a nature or size 
that requires explanation in order to provide additional insight into the 
underlying business performance.
Adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share have been 
calculated by excluding the following:
Year ended 31 December

Adjusted net earnings per share
A non-IFRS financial measure and is calculated by dividing adjusted net 
earnings by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue. 
Cash cost per tonne milled
A non-IFRS financial measure. Cash costs include all costs absorbed into 
inventory, as well as royalties, by-product credits and production taxes, 
and exclude capitalised production stripping costs, inventory purchase 
accounting adjustments, unrealised gains/losses from non-hedge 
currency and commodity contracts, depreciation and amortisation  
and corporate social responsibility charges. Cash cost is calculated  
net of co-product revenue. Cash costs per tonne milled are calculated  
by dividing the aggregate of these costs by total tonnes milled. 
Operating cash flow per share
A non-IFRS financial measure, calculated by dividing net cash generated 
by operating activities by the weighted average number of Ordinary 
Shares in issue.
Free cash flow
A non-IFRS measure that represents the change in cash and cash 
equivalents in a given period.
Net cash 
A non-IFRS measure that is calculated by deducting total borrowings  
from cash and cash equivalents.
Cash from sustaining operations
The cash flow generated post the spend required to sustain the  
Group and its operations. It is calculated as free cash flow adjusted for 
expansionary capital expenditure, exploration, the cash flow associated 
with one-off type items and other charges, and dividends.

STRATEGIC REPORT PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION Mining statistical information
The following describes certain line items used in the Acacia Group’s 
discussion of key performance indicators:
• Open pit material mined – measures in tonnes the total amount  
of open pit ore and waste mined.
• Underground ore tonnes hoisted or trammed – measures in tonnes 
the total amount of underground ore mined and hoisted or trammed.
• Total tonnes mined includes open pit material plus underground  
ore tonnes hoisted or trammed.
• Strip ratio – measures the ratio of waste to ore for open pit 
material mined.
• Ore milled – measures in tonnes the amount of ore material 
processed through the mill.
• Head grade – measures the metal content of mined ore going into  
a mill for processing.
• Milled recovery – measures the proportion of valuable metal 
physically recovered in the processing of ore. It is generally stated 
as a percentage of the metal recovered compared to the total metal 
originally present.
Basis of preparation for the reporting of tax data 
This basis of preparation supports the reporting of tax data contained  
on page 43 of this Annual Report. Generally, the references to “Tax”  
in this context mean any amount of money required to be paid to,  
or repaid by, a Government. 
In overview, the key information presented as regards Tax is as follows:
Taxes borne
These are taxes that the Acacia Group is obliged to pay to a Government 
on its own behalf, or taxes that it is obliged to pay to a third party and 
that can/cannot be recovered from a Government. The main taxes that 
we have included in this category are:
Government royalties
These comprise payments made to Governments in the form of royalties. 
Typically these tend to become payable, and are paid, in the year to 
which they relate. These taxes form part of our operating costs.
Corporate income tax
This comprises any tax on the business calculated on the basis  
of its profits, income or capital gains. Typically, these taxes would  
be reflected in corporate income tax returns made to Governments.
Customs duties
These comprise all customs/excise/import and export duties.  
Typically, these taxes tend to become payable and are paid to 
Governments at the point where goods are imported and exported  
from territories. These taxes form part of our operating and capital 
incurred costs.
Employer payroll taxes
These comprise payroll and employer taxes payable as a result of  
a company’s capacity as an employer. Typically, these taxes would be 
reflected in payroll tax returns made to Governments and tend to be 
payable, and are paid, on a regular basis (often monthly) throughout  
the year shortly after the submission of the return. These taxes form  
part of our operating costs.
Environmental taxes
These comprise levies or other payments to Governments relating to 
environmental policy. Typically, these taxes tend to be payable on an 
annual basis. These taxes are also included in our operating costs.
Indirect taxes
These comprise VAT and other fuel levies that arise on the purchase  
of goods and services and are paid to third parties, to be refunded  
by Governments. Typically, these taxes would form part of a sales tax  
return made to Governments. Refunds received are included in the  
taxes refunded category.
Stamp duty 
This comprises taxes that arise on transfers of assets or capital. 
Typically, these taxes would be reflected in stamp duty returns made to 
Governments and tend to become payable, and are paid, to Governments 
shortly after capital or assets are transferred.
Taxes collected
These are taxes that a company is obliged to collect from others and pay 
to Government. The main taxes that we have included in this category are:
Employee payroll taxes
These comprise payroll and employee taxes withheld from employee 
remuneration and paid to Governments, i.e. taxes collected by Acacia 
and remitted to Governments on behalf of employees under arrangements 
such as PAYE schemes. Typically, these taxes would be reflected in 
payroll tax returns made to Governments and tend to be payable, and are 
paid, on a regular basis (often monthly) throughout the year, shortly after 
submission of the return.
Withholding taxes collected from suppliers
These comprise taxes that are required to be withheld in advance on 
payments made to suppliers. Typically, these taxes would be reflected  
in income tax returns made to Governments and tend to be payable, and 
are paid, on a regular basis (often monthly) throughout the year shortly 
after the submission of the return.
Taxes refunded 
These are taxes that are refunded by Governments to Acacia, and mostly 
comprise the following:
Indirect taxes (mainly VAT and fuel levies)
Typically, indirect taxes would tend to become repayable and are repaid 
by Governments regularly (often quarterly) throughout the year, shortly 
after the submission of relevant sales tax returns. Also included are 
other refunds received.

STRATEGIC REPORT PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
SHAREHOLDER ENQUIRIES This report includes “forward-looking statements” that express  
or imply expectations of future events or results. Forward-looking

statements include, without limitation, financial projections and 
estimates and their underlying assumptions, statements regarding

by the words “plans”, “expects”, “anticipates”, “believes”, “intends”, 
“estimates” and other similar expressions. 
All forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties 
and other factors, many of which are beyond the control of Acacia,  
which could cause actual results and developments to differ materially 
from those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements 
contained in this report. Factors that could cause or contribute to 
differences between the actual results, performance and achievements 
of Acacia include, but are not limited to, changes or developments in 
political, economic or business conditions or national or local legislation 
or regulation in countries in which Acacia conducts – or may in the future 
conduct – business, industry trends, competition, fluctuations in the  
spot and forward price of gold or certain other commodity prices (such  
as copper and diesel), currency fluctuations (including the US dollar, 
South African rand, Kenyan shilling and Tanzanian shilling exchange 
rates), Acacia’s ability to successfully integrate acquisitions, Acacia’s 
ability to recover its reserves or develop new reserves, including its 
ability to convert its resources into reserves and its mineral potential  
into resources or reserves, and to process its mineral reserves 
successfully and in a timely manner, Acacia‘s ability to complete land 
acquisitions required to support its mining activities, operational or 
technical difficulties which may occur in the context of mining activities, 
delays and technical challenges associated with the completion of 
projects, risk of trespass, theft and vandalism, changes in Acacia‘s 
business strategy, including the ongoing implementation of operational 
reviews, as well as risks and hazards associated with the business of 
mineral exploration, development, mining and production and risks and 
factors affecting the gold mining industry in general. Although Acacia‘s 
management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-
looking statements are reasonable, Acacia cannot give assurances that 
such statements will prove to be correct. Accordingly, investors should 
not place reliance on forward-looking statements contained in this report.

statement made should be interpreted to mean that Acacia‘s profits or 
earnings per share for any future period will necessarily match or exceed 
the historical published profits or earnings per share of Acacia.

Notes:
1. Ongoing operations include the Group’s ongoing divisions: Motor, Home, Rescue and other personal lines, Commercial and International.  
It excludes the Run-off segment, restructuring and other one-off costs and gain on disposal of subsidiary.
2. Operating expenses and claims handling expenses from ongoing operations. It excludes the Run-off segment and restructuring and other one-off costs.
3. Return on tangible equity (“RoTE”) is adjusted profit after tax from ongoing operations divided by the Group’s average tangible shareholders’ equity.  
Profit after tax is adjusted to exclude the Run-off segment, restructuring and other one-off costs and gain on disposal of subsidiary and is stated after  
charging tax (using the UK standard tax rate of 23.25%; 2012: 24.5%).
4. Pro forma RoTE is based on the return on tangible equity, but assumes that the capital actions taken by the Group prior to the initial public offering  
(£1 billion dividend payment and £500 million long-term subordinated debt issue) occurred on 1 January 2012.

Pricing and 
underwriting
We use a multi-brand, multi-
product and multi-distribution 
channel business model,  
aiming for each of our brands 
to offer a specific proposition  
to a distinct customer segment.  
We believe that this approach, 
when combined effectively  
with our significant scale, 
should help us achieve high 
performance in distribution, 
pricing, claims and cost.  
In turn, this enables us to aim  
to generate value for customers 
and sustainable returns for  
our shareholders.
Our customers
Our business model starts with our customers, whom we aim to keep at the core of 
what we do. We aspire to give them the products that best suit their needs and 
encourage them to expect a high quality of service throughout their relationship with 
us. We also strive to be a business that can adapt to their changing needs. We treat 
each phase of the customer journey as an opportunity to provide an excellent service 
and outcome from the moment customers select our products, through to the time they 
make a claim or need to resolve an unexpected event.
Our people
Everyone – from front-line staff, who interact directly with our customers, to our people 
in support and central functions, who run the processes that support our products and 
services – plays a part in ensuring we are meeting customers’ needs. Without our 
people, we could not generate value for our customers and sustainable returns for  
our shareholders.
Our shareholders
Our shareholders form a crucial part of our business model by investing in us, in the 
expectation of achieving a return. We aim to deliver value for our shareholders by 
sustaining the generation of business profit, which is reinvested in the business or 
distributed to shareholders in the form of dividends.
Generating value for our customers through our people
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 6 For information on key performance 
indicators that measure the effectiveness  
of our business model see p.20
For information on our risk management 
see p.22
Our focused processes Our disciplined approach
Product distribution
We aim to make our products easy to access and 
to give our customers what they are looking for,  
to ensure they are appropriately covered when 
unexpected events happen.
We apply a multi-brand, multi-product and  
multi-distribution channel business model to sell  
to retail customers and businesses. Products can  
be purchased online, including via PCWs, by 
phone and indirectly through partners and in our 
Commercial business, via brokers. Each brand 
provides products targeted at one or more insurance 
segment: motor, home, rescue, pet, travel and 
commercial. By tailoring the mix of distribution 
channel for each product, we can offer our customers 
a combination of brands, products and services that 
best suits their needs.
Pricing and underwriting
The scale of our business, which has been 
operating for almost 30 years, gives us deep insight 
into the risks we underwrite, which enables us to 
improve pricing accuracy. It also allows us to invest 
more heavily in data and achieve efficiencies, which 
means we can more accurately set the appropriate 
price for the risks we underwrite.
Settling claims
If the time comes to make a claim, it is at that point 
that customers see the value of their policy. Through 
active engagement with our customers, we aim to 
settle their claim as quickly and as easily as possible. 
Doing this the right way helps us to demonstrate the 
value of the products and services we provide and 
manage our claims costs.
Managing finances
We seek to ensure that our business is well 
governed and controlled. We aim to manage our 
finances carefully by spending money on items that 
add the most value to our customers, balancing this 
with the need to generate a suitable and 
sustainable return to our shareholders. 
We hold assets in excess of our expected liabilities 
in the form of capital, which is designed to absorb 
unexpected losses that might occur, as well as to 
meet regulatory capital requirements.
We have a conservative approach to reserving  
and this may result in significant prior-year  
reserve releases.
Managing risk
We ensure that our products meet regulatory 
standards and that customers understand what  
they are purchasing from us. We also aim to make 
sure we price our policies prudently and we invest 
our assets appropriately to minimise any potential 
losses. We mitigate risks by adopting policies  
and minimum standards that are regularly reviewed  
and updated to ensure that we are in line with  
the risk appetite set by the Board. Regular reviews 
by external experts supplement this internal  
control framework.

Strategic report New
 offerings
Business model continued
Pricing and underwriting
Our new customer offerings, such  
as our telematics black box and 
smartphone apps, are helping  
us to improve our pricing models. 
In June 2013, we moved from a test and learn 
phase to launching our telematics propositions on 
our own motor brands, Direct Line, Churchill and 
Privilege. This included our black box solution for 
young drivers aged 17 to 25, and our downloadable 
app available to all ages. We are now selling 
approximately 400 telematics policies a week  
and have sold 12,000 to date. This represents a 
growing proportion of our new motor business and 
we believe telematics has an increasingly important 
role to play in motor insurance, not just with young 
drivers but across the market.
 1 2 , 000
live telematics devices to date
Benefits to young drivers
Young drivers as a high-risk, high-premium group are expected  
to gain the greatest benefit from telematics. 
We are seeing that around one-in-five 
Direct Line new policies taken out by 
under 25s over the phone have selected 
telematics. This also allows feedback 
to customers on their driving, which is 
anticipated to reduce the likelihood of 
accidents and improve safety on our 
roads. This is a really positive step and 
will help with our ongoing campaign 
to the UK Government to contribute to 
an improvement in young driver safety. 
Our extensive data and large customer 
base mean we, alongside specialist 
partners, are well positioned to 
capitalise on this growing market.  
To date, we have gathered 22 million 
miles of customer data, giving  
us a more accurate picture of our 
customers, how they use their cars, 
and what cover is suitable for them. 
Once we have analysed this data  
over a period of time, we will have  
the ability to price and underwrite  
more accurately.

Settling claims – Motor
Our claims transformation programme 
is improving the way we deal with 
customers, making it smoother and faster.
Our ongoing roll-out of ClaimCenter has passed the 
milestone of registering 1 million customer claims, 
as well as bringing Commercial and Italian motor 
claims onto the platform. All new customer motor 
and home claims for our Direct Line, Churchill and 
Privilege brands, as well as some of our partnership 
brands, are now handled through the system.
Over
 1 , 000 , 000
claims on the new system
Improving our customers’ experience
We identified that providing timely updates during  
car repairs is a key challenge in our claims business  
and important to our customers.
Therefore, to resolve this in our Motor 
business, our customers are now able 
to receive regular updates on when 
their car will be ready. 
This transparency should give them 
peace of mind and, once active across 
our entire accident repair centre 
network, is expected to reduce call 
volumes and avoidable frustrations.

Settling claims – Home
Over the last year the UK experienced 
some of the worst wind and rain storms 
in a quarter of a century, leaving many 
homes damaged and without power. 
Before each storm hit, we put our severe weather 
plans into action, making sure there were extra  
staff on the phones and on the ground to help  
our customers. On the day of greatest impact,  
we received more than double our normal customer 
call volumes. We also deployed our emergency 
response vehicle, CHARLIE, to the worst affected 
areas to help customers on the ground get on with 
the claims process.
Supporting our customers  
on the ground
We have been looking at how we can best use our people  
on the ground to support our customers when they make  
a home claim. 
To make access to us more  
convenient, we are introducing  
the use of smartphone technology to 
capture and send claim details while 
connected to a customer services 
adviser. The cost of the repairs  
can then be priced using our home 
estimation tool, thereby getting the 
claim moving much faster.

 “Over the longer term, the Board believes that  
a continued focus on our strategic priorities 
should generate sustainable value.”
2013 represented another significant year for Direct Line 
Group. In the first full year of being listed on the London Stock 
Exchange, the Group achieved the 2013 combined operating 
ratio
1
 (“COR”) and cost targets set at the time of the initial 
public offering (“IPO”) in October 2012. This resulted in a 
16.0% RoTE from ongoing operations
2
, ahead of its long-term 
target. This has been achieved despite competitive market 
conditions and demonstrates the improved levels of performance 
the Group’s transformation plan is delivering.
Our shareholders have also seen a 15.3% increase in  
the share price to 249.6 pence per share in the year to  
31 December 2013. In addition, we paid shareholders 
dividends totalling 16.2 pence per share during 2013.  
As at the date of this report (25 February 2014) the share 
price is 261.0 pence.
Strategy update
During 2013, the Group has continued to focus on delivering 
the strategic plan established in 2010 to transform Direct Line 
Group into ‘Britain’s best retail general insurer’. We have 
made good progress in 2013 across each of our strategic 
priorities and have plans for further transformation in the future.
Looking to 2014, we will continue to focus on delivering for  
our customers, in particular by using technology to enhance 
customer experience. More details of this and other strategic 
priorities can be found in the Chief Executive Officer’s review.
We continue to target a RoTE from ongoing operations
2
  
of 15%. In addition, we have set specific targets for 2014, 
being a total cost base
3
 of approximately £1,000 million  
and a COR in Commercial of less than 100%. Overall,  
we currently expect a COR for the Group of between 95% 
and 97% in 2014. These assume a normal level of claims  
from weather events and large losses.
Dividend and capital management
Through our progressive dividend policy, we aim to increase 
the dividend annually in real terms. The Board is recommending 
a final dividend of 8.4 pence per share to shareholders.  
If approved, the full year regular dividend of 12.6 pence  
per share would represent a 5.0% growth on the pro forma  
full year dividend
4
 of 2012 (12.0 pence per share) and  
is in line with this policy.
Good progress
  t o w ar d s t a r g e t s
Mike Biggs, Chairman
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 14 In addition, we paid a special interim dividend of 4.0 pence 
per share in December and we are now declaring a second 
special interim dividend of 4.0 pence per share. Both these 
special interim dividends relate to items in 2013 that were not 
expected at the start of the year. First, the sale of our closed  
life insurance operation, Direct Line Life Insurance Company 
Limited (the “Life business”), and secondly, better than expected 
profit from the Run-off segment and the sale of Tracker. Due to 
the one-off nature of these items, the Board believes it is 
appropriate in this instance to return this capital to shareholders.
The Board considers that the Group is currently strongly 
capitalised with a risk-based capital coverage ratio at the 
upper end of its risk-based capital coverage target range and 
an ‘A’ rating with stable outlook from its credit rating agencies.
In determining this position, the Board has considered a 
number of factors that may positively and negatively affect  
the Group’s capital position over the next 12 months. The 
Board will continue to review this position as clarity improves 
on these factors and the Group makes further progress with its 
transformation plan. More details can be found on page 42.
Relationship with RBS Group
Our ongoing relationship with RBS Group is principally set  
out in two key agreements, the Relationship and Transitional 
Services Agreements. The Relationship Agreement sets out that 
Direct Line Group is to carry on its business independently of 
RBS Group and entitles RBS Group to nominate a Director for 
appointment to the Board. The agreement will terminate once 
RBS Group holds less than 20% of Direct Line Insurance Group 
plc (the “Company”) shares. Under the Transitional Services 
Agreement, RBS Group will continue to provide IT and certain 
other services to Direct Line Group for a transitional period of 
up to 36 months following the IPO in October 2012. 
Subsequent to the IPO, RBS Group undertook two further 
placings in 2013 of 551.6 million Ordinary Shares in the 
Company. These represented 36.8% of the total share capital 
and generated additional gross proceeds of £1,135.8 million 
for RBS Group. Following the placings, RBS Group’s shareholding 
in the Company was 28.5%.
Board changes and effectiveness
Following RBS Group’s reduction in its shareholding in the 
Company to below 50%, and in accordance with the terms of 
the Relationship Agreement, Mark Catton stepped down from 
the Board on 26 April 2013. On 1 October 2013, Bruce Van 
Saun stepped down from the Board to focus on other projects 
for RBS Group and Mark Catton was reappointed. May I take 
this opportunity to thank Bruce for the insights and value he 
brought to the Board during his time as a Director. I would  
also like to extend this gratitude more generally to all of our 
Non-Executive Directors for their dedication to the Group.
The Board and its Committees undertook formal evaluations  
of their performance in 2013. The Company engaged the 
services of an external facilitator, who met with me as 
Chairman to agree the structure, scope and content of the 
evaluations. The individual Directors were subject to a review 
of their effectiveness and I have met with each Director to 
provide feedback on a one-to-one basis. Committee Chairs 
also received feedback on the performance of the Committees.
Summary
I have been very impressed by the commitment of our 
employees whenever our customers need their support. In a 
challenging year, they have remained determined to help our 
customers get back on their feet after an accident or an event 
in their lives. The Group is only as good as its people and 
everyone has contributed to this success, and I would like to 
thank employees and senior management for everything that 
has been achieved in 2013.

  our future
Chief Executive Officer’s review
 “Our strategic progress and successful delivery 
of our targets is a direct result of the hard work 
demonstrated throughout the business. This has 
enabled us to deliver benefits to our customers 
and returns to our shareholders.”
Overview of financial performance
I am pleased that in 2013 we continued to make good 
progress with our strategic priorities and financial targets,  
while maintaining our disciplined approach to underwriting  
in a highly competitive and deflationary marketplace in the  
UK. We delivered an operating profit from ongoing operations 
of £526.5 million, an increase of 14.2% compared to  
2012 (£461.2 million); and total Group profit before  
tax of £423.9 million (2012: £249.1 million).
With a COR of 96.1% we achieved our COR target of 98% 
for 2013. This contributed to a RoTE of 16.0%, ahead of  
our long-term target of 15.0%. While our results were helped 
by higher reserve releases than expected, the momentum of 
our transformation and ‘self-help’ agenda continued to create 
benefits and opportunities. We took positive steps towards 
reducing costs across the business and improving our operating 
efficiency. Within other areas of our strategy, such as pricing 
and claims, we continued to deliver sustainable benefits for  
our customers and shareholders.
Delivering value for our customers
Our focus on improving our pricing capability and claims 
infrastructure has particularly helped us to reduce prices for  
UK motor customers. In addition, we have been exploring  
new ways in which we can innovate to achieve better 
outcomes for customers. Direct Line’s heritage is rooted in  
the revolution it unleashed by using the telephone to bypass  
the traditional high street insurance broker model and provide 
customers with more competitive products. That innovation 
gave way to the advent of PCWs, which emerged in response 
to the growing purchase of insurance via the internet.
We are on the cusp of a new era, when growing customer use 
of new technologies prompts them to seek a different experience 
from their insurer, and where nimble providers can harness 
technology to offer both competitive products and more 
personalised solutions. The strength of our data and brands, 
together with the operational and financial transformation of 
our platform, leaves us well placed to help draw the road map 
for this new age. For instance, we are piloting real-time online 
progress updates on car repairs, and we are offering telematics 
technology to give customers instant feedback on the quality  
of their driving, which can ultimately, if they drive well, improve 
road safety and save them money.
We have also been working hard to reduce customer complaints 
across the Group and for the second half of 2013 our 
complaint volumes decreased by 19% compared to the same 
period in 2012. This is a key area of focus for us. To ensure 
we are tracking how well we are responding to our customers’ 
needs, we have introduced a new key performance indicator 
to measure the volume of customer complaints across the Group.
We recognise that, while we have made improvements in  
how we interact with our customers, we have not met all of our 
aspirations to develop and differentiate our customer propositions 
and brands. We have much to do to meet the evolving needs 
of our customers, but we are rising to the challenge with 
determination and energy.
Delivering for our people
Our people continue to be the main driver behind delivering 
better outcomes for our customers. Although we have had to 
remove 3,200 roles since the start of our cost savings initiatives, 
to ensure our organisation can operate in the most cost-efficient 
manner, our consistent aim has been to treat colleagues with 
the utmost fairness and respect throughout redeployment or 
redundancy processes. As we continue to drive an agenda  
of operational and cultural change through the organisation, 
we remain committed to investing in our people, which in  
turn will help us to deliver the products and services that our 
customers value.
Paul Geddes, Chief Executive Officer
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 16 Developing stand-alone systems
Ever since beginning our separation from RBS Group, we have 
made significant investments to design and started to build a 
stand-alone IT infrastructure capable of supporting a multi-brand, 
multi-product and multi-distribution channel business with  
18 million in-force policies. Notwithstanding the complex 
operational risk associated with this task, we aim for the 
migration to have made substantial progress by the end of 
2014. Alongside the construction of a stand-alone IT platform, 
we are continuing to develop our technological capabilities 
by investing in other systems designed to improve customer 
operations and business processes. The opening of our own, 
state-of-the-art data centres was a significant step forward  
in advancing our technology initiatives in 2013.
Regulatory environment
We have continued to operate within a highly dynamic  
and evolving regulatory landscape, particularly in the UK 
motor insurance market where over the past two years a 
number of reviews and initiatives have been announced  
by the UK Government, the Ministry of Justice (“MoJ”), the 
Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), and the Competition 
Commission (“CC”).
The Group continues to engage proactively in new or 
emerging regulatory priorities. Good conduct is integral to the 
success of our business, which is why we decided to switch 
the sale of our motor legal protection product to opt in prior  
to the publication of regulatory guidance, and why we chose 
to lay the foundations for DLG Legal Services as an alternative 
business structure, which should help shield our existing 
customers from potentially excessive third-party solicitor fees.
In December, the CC published the provisional findings of  
its ongoing investigation into the UK private motor insurance 
market. We continue to work with the CC, and have always 
said we welcome the investigation, if it results in a level 
playing field and the removal of market dysfunction, to the 
benefit of our customers and consumers more broadly.
Strategic priorities for 2014
During 2014 we aim to progress further towards delivering the 
remainder of the strategic financial targets we have set ourselves. 
In particular, we aim to deliver our target of a total cost base
1
 
of approximately £1 billion, as well as our Commercial 
business achieving a COR
2
 of less than 100%.
We will also continue to enhance our products and update  
our infrastructure to ensure we sharpen our customer experience, 
delivering what the customer has grown to expect, and doing 
so sustainably for all of our stakeholders, be they our 
customers, our people or our shareholders.
Outlook
The UK motor and home markets remain highly competitive.  
In this trading environment, we will continue to prioritise 
targeting appropriate margins, even if this is at the expense of 
premium or policy volumes. We continue to progress initiatives 
supporting our strategic priorities in order to seek to improve 
our competitive position and performance in the longer term.
For 2014, we aim to achieve a COR in the range of 95% to 
97% for ongoing operations, assuming a normal level of claims 
from weather events. Assuming underlying claims trends continue, 
a significant contribution from prior-year reserve releases is 
currently expected, albeit at a lower level than in 2013.
I would like to thank our people for the continuous hard work 
and dedication that they have demonstrated throughout the 
year. This has enabled us to continue to deliver benefits to  
our customers, shareholders, and wider stakeholders.

efficiency and effectiveness through  
a focus on digital capability and 
customer value.
We seek to understand customers’  
needs and provide them with products 
that meet their needs, offer good value 
and are straightforward to purchase. 
We employ a multi-distribution channel 
model and look to optimise the mix of

Claims
We aim to maintain top quartile 
performance by achieving efficient  
and effective claims management.
We have fundamentally redesigned  
our claims operating model with simpler 
processes in fewer sites, giving our 
people more control and our customers  
a better experience. By managing  
claims through our own professional loss 
adjusters and repairing cars through our 
own accident repair centres, we aim to 
give customers the benefit of our scale 
and strength.
We continue to invest in our capabilities 
to provide customers with a service that 
is reliable and straightforward, with 
improved transparency at each step  
of a claim.

network to offer improved customer 
propositions, for example car 
replacement service
• Laid the foundations for DLG  
Legal Services
Priorities for 2014:
• Continue to improve customers’ 
experience by rolling out further  
claims initiatives, for example  
using smartphone technology
• Further enhance claims leakage  
and fraud identification
• Generate further efficiency
Commercial  
and International
We focus our Commercial business on 
targeting the growing SME and micro 
segments, and are well positioned to 
benefit as these customers move towards 
direct and e-trading distribution channels.
We have 10 years of experience in Italy 
and Germany, two of Europe’s biggest 
motor insurance markets, and are now 
reaching scale.
As the characteristics of our personal 
and commercial lines businesses 
increasingly come together, we aim  
to leverage our skills across the Group 
particularly in the areas of technical 
pricing, claims management, telematics 
and flood mapping.

Definition
A measure of financial year 
underwriting profitability 
calculated by the sum of 
claims, commissions and 
expenses divided by net 
earned premium for ongoing 
operations. This excludes 
instalment and other 
operating income and 
investment return. A COR  
of less than 100% indicates 
profitable underwriting.
Aim
We aim to make an 
underwriting profit, and  
in 2013 set and achieved  
a target of a 98% COR.  
For 2014, we are providing 
guidance of a COR in the 
range of 95% to 97% for  
the Group. This assumes a 
normal level of claims from 
weather events.
Definition
The cost of doing business, 
including paying our people, 
marketing, infrastructure and 
IT. This includes the costs we 
incur in handling claims, but 
excludes any commissions  
we pay to brokers or partners 
and restructuring and other 
one-off costs.
Aim
We aim to operate an efficient 
and effective organisation  
and are targeting our total  
cost base
2
 for 2014 to be 
approximately £1,000 million.
Definition
The return generated by 
investing the assets we hold. 
These investments are held  
to pay out future claims and 
to support our capital base.  
It is calculated by dividing 
investment income (excluding 
net realised gains) by 
average investment assets 
under management (“AUM”).
Aim
We aim to maximise 
investment income subject  
to the risk appetite set by  
the Board. The investment 
portfolio assets are currently 
invested in credit and 
sovereign debt securities, 
cash and property.
Definition
We adjust earnings to 
exclude restructuring and 
other one-off costs, the result 
of our Run-off segment and 
other one-off items. These 
adjusted earnings, which 
reflect the ongoing operations, 
are divided by the average 
number of shares in issue 
adjusted for dilutive potential 
Ordinary Shares.
Aim
We have not set a target for 
adjusted earnings per share 
given the cyclical nature  
of the insurance industry. 
Growing earnings per share 
is considered one indicator  
of a healthy business.

management and ultimately the Board.
Our strategic planning process aims to ensure that we have 
developed a clear set of objectives and targets and have 
identified the action plans necessary to deliver them. These 
must be consistent with our overall objective of a 15% RoTE 
and be delivered in line with our risk appetite. For information 
on our strategy see page 18.
Delivering a strategic plan will, by its very nature, result in 
taking risk. Management of this risk is therefore a key aspect  
of the strategic planning process and it is important that the link 
between strategy and its impact on capital is clear. We place 
Enterprise-wide Risk Management (“ERM”) at the very heart  
of our approach.
We recognise that our long-term sustainability depends on 
having sufficient funds to meet our liabilities as they fall due. 
This protects our reputation and the integrity of our relationship 
with customers and other stakeholders. For information on our 
allocation of capital by risk type see page 42.
Risk strategy and appetite
The risk appetite statements are expressions of the level of risk 
we are prepared to accept to achieve our business objectives. 
In order to monitor whether we are within risk appetite, we 
have aligned the statements to key business metrics, such as 
volumes of business or levels of exposure. These metrics form 
key risk indicators, which are both qualitative and quantitative 
and forward and backward looking, and our risk profile is 
monitored regularly using these indicators to ensure we remain 
within appetite.
We have an appetite for general insurance risk, with a focus 
on personal lines and commercial SME insurance in the UK 
and direct motor insurance in selected overseas countries.  
To support our primary activity of insurance, we have an 
appetite for appropriate non-insurance risks.
Risk appetite should not be static and we are committed  
to performing, as a minimum, an annual review of the risk 
appetite to ensure it remains suitable to support the Group. 
Such a review was undertaken in the second quarter of 2013 
and resulted in Board approval of the risk appetite statements 
outlined in the table. We would also review risk appetite if the 
Group’s strategy changed, ensuring risk management remains 
aligned to the Group strategy.
The risk appetite statements are aligned with the Board’s 
strategic risk objectives.
Over the last 12 months, to help achieve these strategic  
risk objectives, we have:
• Strengthened financial risk oversight by developing the  
risk management function through tailored recruitment
• Enhanced the ERM framework to reflect our operation  
as a stand-alone Group
• Realigned risk management and oversight responsibilities  
as part of the ‘three lines of defence’ model
• Increased our focus on customer conduct risks in line with our 
Group objectives as well as with the objectives of the FCA.
Our ERM framework
Strategic risk objective Risk appetite statement
Maintain capital 
adequacy
Maintain sufficient economic capital 
consistent with the aim of achieving  
a stand-alone credit rating in the  
‘A’ range.
Stable and efficient 
access to funding  
and liquidity
Meet all cash outflow requirements, 
including those that arise following  
a 1 in 200 year insurance, market  
or credit risk event.
Maintain stakeholder 
confidence
No appetite for material risks leading 
to reputational damage, regulatory  
or legal censure, fines or prosecutions 
and other types of operational risk 
losses associated with the firm’s 
conduct and activities.
ERM is the process of organising and controlling the activities 
of the whole Group so as to ensure the Group remains within 
risk appetite. To enable ERM we have developed a framework 
comprising a number of components which are fundamental to 
good risk management. These are set out in the graphic overleaf.
A central component of the ERM framework is our policy 
framework, consisting of policies and minimum standards. 
These inform the business how it needs to conduct its activities 
so as to remain within risk appetite. 
The policies cover the key risks to which we are exposed. 
Policies are supported by minimum standards which set out  
the minimum level of risk management and other corporate  
and personal behaviours that must be complied with. Where 
appropriate, these minimum standards are in turn supported  
by detailed guidance documents.
We also employ a number of risk tools to manage and monitor 
our risks, the output of which is tested and reported upon both 
internally and externally.
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 23
Strategic report Risk management continued
Our ERM framework has been made stronger during 2013  
as a result of:
• The linking of risk strategy and governance to our risk 
appetite and policy frameworks, documented in our High 
Level Controls and System of Governance document
• Improvements to our internal control environment self-
certification process
• The development of our Own Risk and Solvency  
Assessment (“ORSA”) which supports the achievement  
of our strategic objectives
• The introduction of a risk culture which helps our 
understanding and measurement of how well risk  
is embedded within the Group
The ERM framework: enhanced by an effective 
risk and control culture
Risk culture is about how the principles, processes and tools  
of the risk framework are applied in day-to-day behaviour.  
A good risk culture is one where risk management is a 
significant part of the way we work. Our Group values  
align to the risk culture and seek to promote proactive  
risk management.
Our risk culture focuses on the key areas of strategy, 
employees, promoting good governance, communication, 
systems and reporting. We believe that the ERM framework  
is made stronger by the promotion of a good risk culture  
across the Group.
Solvency II
Making use of Pillar I models, the PRA has developed the 
Individual Capital Adequacy Standards Plus (“ICAS+”) process 
to enable UK insurers to make use of capital models developed 
under Solvency II programmes.
The ICAS+ process will also enable firms to obtain feedback 
on their progress towards Solvency II. U K Insurance Limited 
has engaged with this ICAS+ process and has used the  
new internal model for this purpose. This ICAS+ submission 
included Pillar II elements which are currently in development. 
The Group’s internal model produces Solvency II, Individual 
Capital Adequacy and economic capital requirements for  
the UK general insurance business.
The Group’s risk management system, including the automated 
risk management tool, is being embedded and the Solvency II 
data warehouse implementation is continuing to progress. The 
Group expects Solvency II to be in force on 1 January 2016 
with the Internal Model Approval Process taking place in 
2015. As a result, the risk management team is developing a 
revised timeline for progress towards internal model approval 
and engaging with the PRA about the Group’s self-assessment 
of its progress towards Solvency II.
In addition, the requirement under Pillar III will result in 
additional reporting requirements both to the PRA and to 
external stakeholders. The Group continues to make progress 
to ensure all requirements will be met in line with developing 
best practice.

Key elements of the risk management process
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 24 Principal risks and uncertainties
Risks are always present in our business. The key role of the Risk function is to ensure that these risks have been identified and 
measured and are monitored and reported throughout the business on an ongoing basis. The Risk function also monitors changes 
in these risks over time. We believe that these risks are broadly unchanged over the last 12 months.
Principal risks Management and mitigation examples
Strategic risk
The external environment could put at risk our ability to  
meet our strategic objectives through the five key strategic 
priorities of distribution, pricing, claims, costs and  
Commercial and International.
• We have agreed strategic targets which are monitored  
and managed
• Risk assessment of projects designed to enhance pricing and 
claims capability
• Our multi-channel approach provides diversification, which 
mitigates this risk
• Monitoring of cost savings to ensure they remain on track
• The Chief Executive Officer owns and manages this risk
Insurance risk: underwriting and pricing 
We are subject to the risk that inappropriate business could 
be written (or not specifically excluded) and inappropriate 
prices charged.
Underwriting risk includes catastrophe risk arising from 
losses due to unpredictable natural and man-made events 
affecting multiple covered risks, particularly given the 
concentration of our Home business in the UK.
• We have set underwriting guidelines for all business transacted, 
restricting the types and classes of business that may be accepted
• Pricing is refined through analysis of comprehensive data
• Catastrophe reinsurance is purchased, limiting our exposure  
to large losses. We also purchase excess of loss cover on our 
Motor portfolio, as well as other selected reinsurance covers
• We invest in enhanced external data to mitigate exposures,  
for example flood and individual underwriting risk  
through Geospatial
• The Managing Directors of each division own and manage  
this risk
Insurance risk: reserving 
Due to the uncertain nature and timing of the risks to which 
we are exposed, we cannot precisely determine the amounts 
that we will ultimately pay to meet the liabilities covered by 
the insurance policies written.
Reserving risk is our biggest risk, generated by our large 
Motor portfolio. Reserving risk is heightened in the case of 
periodic payment orders (“PPOs”) because of their long-term 
nature and is discussed further in the finance review on page 
39 and in notes 2.1 and 3 to the consolidated financial 
statements on pages 120 and 123 respectively.
Reserving generates both upside and downside risk, with  
the potential for outcomes to be in our favour, generating  
reserve releases.
• We estimate the technical reserves using a range of actuarial 
and statistical techniques. Projections of ultimate claims cost 
involve assumptions across a range of variables, including 
estimates of trends in claims frequency and average claim 
amounts. These are based on facts and circumstances at  
a given point in time
• We ensure that management’s best estimate of reserves  
is not less than the actuarial best estimate
• The Chief Financial Officer owns and manages this risk
Counterparty risk
We partner with many suppliers and the failure of any  
of these to perform their financial obligations in a timely 
manner could result in a financial loss.
Our principal area of counterparty risk is our use of  
reinsurance against underwriting risk, sometimes called 
reinsurance risk or reinsurer default risk.
• We set credit limits for each counterparty
• Our reinsurance is purchased only from reinsurers that hold  
a minimum credit rating of ‘A-’ at the time cover is purchased
• The business actively monitors broker credit exposures
• The Chief Financial Officer owns and manages this risk
Market risk
We are subject to the risk that, as a result of market 
movements, we may be exposed to fluctuations in the  
value of our assets or the income from our assets.
For the Group this includes: interest rate risk, spread risk, 
currency risk and property risk.
• We manage and control our investment portfolio through:
 – Investment strategy and guidelines proposed to the  
Board by the Investment Committee and monitored  
by the Asset and Liability Committee
 – Diversity in the types of assets held, including by  
geography, sector and credit rating
• We use risk reduction techniques such as hedging foreign 
currency exposures with forwards and hedging foreign  
interest rates with swaps
• The Chief Financial Officer owns and manages this risk
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 25
Strategic report Risk management continued
Principal risks Management and mitigation examples
Operational risk
We potentially face the risks of direct or indirect losses  
resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  
or fraudulent claims; from systems and people; or from  
external events.
In particular we have IT systems risk, including that we are 
highly dependent on the use of RBS Group’s information 
technology, software, data and service providers.
Migrating IT systems away from RBS Group introduces 
different operational risks; there is increased likelihood  
of system failure at the point that functions are moved  
onto new infrastructure. Further, if the migration fails  
to stay on schedule, we will incur charges for remaining  
on RBS Group IT infrastructure.
IT migration also introduces people risk, as management  
may be distracted away from day-to-day activities.
Operational risk includes cyber risk, the risks relating to  
the use of computers, other IT and the storage of data.
Within this category, we also consider the risk of the  
Group not recruiting and retaining suitable talent. This risk  
is particularly important during the Group’s current period  
of change.
• We have strong operational processes and systems,  
including fraudulent claims detection systems. Our risk,  
business and capital strategies are integrated 
• We maintain a robust internal control environment
• We have developed a bespoke risk capture, management  
and reporting system (IRISS)
• Ongoing migration of IT away from RBS Group on to  
a new enhanced platform is continually monitored and 
managed by experienced personnel
• We have strong recruitment processes to help our aim  
of ensuring that the right people are recruited and placed  
into the right roles
• In addition to mandatory training, employees are encouraged 
to use the large number of training tools available to enhance 
their abilities
• Specific members of the Executive own and manage  
the different aspects of operational risks
Regulatory risk
Regulatory risk arises if changes in law and regulations  
are not identified or understood, or are inappropriately  
and incorrectly interpreted or adopted.
In particular, Solvency II regulations are currently being 
introduced. Solvency II requirements are still uncertain  
and subject to the outcome of discussion between UK  
and European regulators. The outcome and impact of  
the ICAS+ process is also uncertain. These uncertainties 
increase our level of risk.
Regulatory risk also includes the risk that business practices  
are not efficiently modified following a regulatory change. 
Further, there is a risk that current legal or regulatory 
requirements are not complied with.
• We have a constructive and open relationship with  
our regulators
• In addition, we use specific risk management tools and 
resources, such as our upstream risk team, to help manage  
our exposure to regulatory risk
• We exercise risk-based monitoring to ensure our resources  
are used to greatest impact
• The Chief Risk Officer owns and manages this risk
Conduct risk
We are subject to the risk of failing to deliver the 
appropriate treatment for our customers throughout all 
stages of the customer journey and the risk that our people 
fail to behave with integrity.
This includes the risk that our organisational culture is not 
appropriate, with a failure to communicate the correct tone 
from the top.
• Our organisational culture prioritises a consistent approach 
towards customers and the interests of customers are at the  
heart of how we operate
• We have developed a robust customer conduct risk 
management framework, to minimise our exposure  
to conduct risk
• The Chief Executive Officer owns and manages this risk
Brand and reputational risk
We are dependent on the strength of our brands, our 
reputation with customers and distributors in the sale of 
products and services. We have entered into various 
strategic partnerships that are important to the marketing, 
sale and distribution of our products.
• Our brand and reputational risk is regularly reviewed through 
our governance framework
• We undertake substantial marketing activities to protect and 
build our brands, and regularly measure their effectiveness
• Specific members of the Executive own and manage this risk
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 26 Evolving risks
Risks can emerge and evolve over time, often as a result of changes in the environment in which we operate. As part of our risk 
management framework, we aim to identify these risks as they first emerge, working efficiently to mitigate their potential impact 
on the business. Set out below are examples of current significant evolving risks and the way in which we monitor and mitigate 
these risks.
Evolving risk details Our actions
Insurance risk: claims costs
Bodily injury claims costs are a key source of uncertainty with several 
regulatory, legal and market pressures facing the Group, including:
• Underlying trends in bodily injury claims frequency and average cost  
per claim inflation
• The results of the MoJ consultation into the discount rate used to value 
certain types of bodily injury claim awards
• The propensity for large injury claims to settle as PPOs, and the inflation 
and longevity assumptions used to value PPOs
• The impact on claims costs of the MoJ consultation and Transport 
Committee investigation into whiplash injuries.
• Monitoring claims costs to identify trends  
in the settlement of bodily injury claims
• Investigating proposed changes in 
regulation and legislation and using risk  
fora to discuss these changes and develop  
a business response
• Investigating asset-liability matching 
opportunities that would mitigate this risk
Regulatory risk: regulatory environment
The UK insurance market is subject to several regulatory reviews and potential 
areas of focus which are sources of uncertainty, including:
• The CC investigation into aspects of the private motor insurance market
• The FCA’s market study of general insurance add-on products
• The FCA’s thematic review of complaints and claims handling
• The impacts of Flood Re and the proposed levy on home insurance premiums
There is also uncertainty around the way in which the FCA may apply the 
principles underpinning behavioural economics to the insurance industry  
and the impact that this has on our business.
The EU is currently developing new EU Data Protection Regulations which  
will replace the UK Data Protection Act. This may impact our ability to use 
and benefit from our stored data. Specifically, restrictions or bans on profiling 
may impact our ability to identify the most appropriate products or solutions 
for our customers.
The Italian regulatory landscape is changing which could lead to greater 
regulatory intervention.
• Investigating proposed changes in 
regulation and legislation and using risk  
fora to discuss these changes and develop  
a business response
• Regular contact with the regulator to ensure 
the business is kept abreast of changes  
in expectations
• Where appropriate, participation in 
lobbying
Strategic risk: business transformation and project delivery
The Group is carrying out initiatives to improve its operational efficiency  
as part of the implementation of its business transformation plan.
There is a strategic risk of the potential failure to execute the plan, or that  
the expected benefits of the plan may not be achieved on time or to the 
extent targeted.
There is also a large potential for upside risk should initiatives provide benefits 
that are greater than those planned, or if the expected benefits are felt by the 
business sooner than planned.
Uncertainties include the potential changes in the market around use of 
PCWs, changes in customer behaviour and the increasing use of telematics.
• Having a detailed transformation plan
• Monitoring of the project milestones ensures 
we remain on track and enables us to make 
adjustments where appropriate
• Ensuring that the projects are managed by 
the right people with the ideal skills
• Using ‘lessons learnt’ exercises to ensure 
later projects are improved by our experiences
Risks can emerge over the very long term as a result of significant changes in the environment including technology, weather 
patterns and socio-economic behaviours. Examples of these risks would include driverless cars, new types of competitor entering 
the market and climate change.
A specific example of an emerging risk we have considered during 2013 is the failure of a competitor. A competitor failing  
may lead to an industry levy which we would be subject to. This risk could also impact our relationships with both investors and 
regulators, depending on the cause of the competitor’s failure. There is also potential upside should the failure of a competitor 
enable us to increase the number of policies we issue.

Market
In the UK, an economic recovery appears to have been taking 
hold, and it is expected to gather pace
2
. Consistent with this, 
car registrations recorded their highest monthly total for many 
years in September
3
, while higher petrol prices are anticipated 
from oil price inflation.
The motor insurance market in the UK was again highly 
competitive, with another year of insurance premium deflation. 
PCW sales continue to rise and their media advertising 
remains high. Customers are shopping around more and  
there is a greater market focus towards retention and cross- 
selling products. There has also been a relatively benign  
claims experience during 2012 and 2013, alongside the 
positive effects of a series of government interventions to 
reduce the costs of bodily injury claims. In particular, a 
package of reforms, including the Legal Aid, Sentencing  
and Punishment of Offenders (“LASPO”) Act measures and the 
banning of legal referral fees, were introduced during 2013.
These reforms are intended to reduce the average cost  
of bodily injury claims, largely due to lower legal costs. 
However, it is too early to say whether they will also have  
a material benefit in terms of the frequency of bodily injury 
claims. Furthermore, improved fraud detection capabilities  
are expected to help reduce false declarations of driving 
experience and convictions. Also, the FCA continues to review 
all aspects of conduct risk through a series of thematic reviews, 
including motor legal expenses insurance, which we, and our 
distribution partners, continue to engage with proactively. 
Following the implementation of the EU Gender Directive,  
some young drivers, particularly males, have seen reductions  
in premiums. The growth of telematics has supported this, as 
drivers of all ages and genders are able to receive discounts. 
This follows installation of a device to their car or the download 
of a smartphone app, and the display of safer driving behaviour.
Performance
Given the highly competitive market, we continued to make 
choices to optimise value and prioritise underwriting margin 
over volume growth. Furthermore, the results reflected previous 
actions taken to reduce risk and manage claims costs, which 
together contributed to significant prior-year reserve releases. 
We have enhanced our pricing engines, delivered claims 
efficiencies and improved our customer propositions, including 
the roll-out of telematics propositions. These have helped to 
successfully manage the business through a period of 
regulatory change.
Gross written premium of £1,421.1 million fell 12.5% 
compared with 2012, as we maintained pricing discipline. 
Average premium per policy was down over the year by 
approximately 7% due to market competitiveness, the channel 
shift to PCWs and a reduction in risk mix, but also our focus  
on value and retaining customers. We seek to pass on lower 
premiums to customers based on our observed claims experience 
and during 2013 reduced motor prices by 3%. In-force 
policies were also slightly lower.
There was an improvement in underwriting result driven by the 
attritional loss ratio and reserve releases, as a result of actions 
taken on pricing and claims. These reserve releases, which 
were higher than expected, were driven by both small and 
large bodily injury claims. The expense ratio rose by 0.6 
percentage points following reduced net earned premium, which 
more than offset the lower cost base. However, the significant 
improvement in the operating profit was partially offset by 
reduced other income, from the cessation of solicitors’ referral 
fee income, and a lower investment return. In February 2014, 
the Group sold its stolen vehicle recovery business, Tracker. 
Operating loss from this business was £1.4 million in 2013.
Outlook
The UK motor market remained highly competitive in the first 
quarter of 2014 and gross written premium is expected to be 
approximately 10% lower than the same period in 2013. We 
continue to focus on protecting underwriting margins, rather 
than prioritise policy volumes. During 2014, we aim to develop 
initiatives to support our strategic priorities further including the 
rolling out of new customer websites, enhancing our trading 
capability, evolving our telematics-based propositions and 
continuing to evolve technical pricing sophistication.

Market
The UK housing market remained flat for the majority of 2013, 
and ongoing limited mortgage availability has caused an 
increase in the number of people renting. Lower disposable 
incomes have also driven price sensitivity. However, there  
have been indications of a UK economic recovery.
Britain’s home insurance market size has been stable, but 
become more competitive, with new business premiums 
reducing in the year
2
. PCWs’ shares of sales are growing, 
albeit from a lower base than Motor, and have facilitated the 
growth of lesser known brands, as well as increasing price 
competitiveness. Retail banking distribution arms continue to 
review branch sales processes. Meanwhile, there is growth  
in the adoption of new technology by customers, including  
the use of mobile technology and online servicing. Providers 
are maximising customer value, increasing cross-selling activity 
and retention capabilities. A lack of mortgage demand has 
contributed to providers finding other routes to source new 
customers. In the flat housing market, the increase in the renter 
population is causing a decline in the demand for combined 
building and contents covers.
The Association of British Insurers (“ABI”) and the UK 
Government arrived at the Flood Re solution, which is intended 
to ensure the availability of affordable home insurance in the 
highest flood risk affected parts of Britain. As with the motor 
market, the FCA continues to review all aspects of conduct risk 
through a series of thematic reviews, which we continue to 
engage with proactively.
Performance
The Home business experienced another strong result in  
2013, which benefited from lower weather claims than 2012, 
despite the significant flooding and storm claims in December. 
Customer retention improved on last year as we optimised 
technical-pricing models. The product range was also 
rationalised from 30 products to three across the brand portfolio 
to simplify the customer proposition. The number of policies 
sold through the PCW channel increased by 8.0% on last 
year. Promising initial results have been experienced from  
the launch of the Home estimation tool, which allows more 
accurate assessment of claims to facilitate speedier claims 
adjustment and payment.
Gross written premium of £943.1 million declined by 4.6%, 
reflecting competitive market conditions. In-force policies fell  
by 12.3% since the start of the year, mainly as a result of the 
removal of Home Response
3
 policies (around 420,000) from 
certain packaged bank accounts no longer sold through 
partners. Excluding this effect, the underlying in-force policies 
were broadly similar year-on-year.
The loss ratio improved, reflecting fewer claims from major 
weather events and continued reserve releases. On an 
underlying current-year attritional basis, it was in line with last 
year at 51.3%. The commission ratio rose due to profit-share 
payments reflecting higher profitability of partnership business, 
mainly as a result of the lower loss ratio. Underwriting profit 
improved on last year mainly due to the fewer claims from 
major weather events. The expense ratio improved by 1.7 
percentage points due to cost improvements across the Group. 
Overall, operating profit improved by 13.8%, reflecting fewer 
major weather events across 2013 in the UK.
Outlook
In a competitive UK home market, we continue to focus on 
maintaining our underwriting performance through further 
pricing and claims initiatives. Adverse weather conditions 
experienced in the fourth quarter of 2013 have continued in 
the first quarter of 2014 resulting in further storm damage and 
severe flooding. While it is too early to assess with accuracy, 
the Group’s preliminary estimate for the cost of Home claims 
from this event up to 22 February 2014 is in the range of £70 
to £90 million. This compares to an expectation in an average 
year of £80 million of claims from major weather events.

Market
The economic trends are the same as in the Motor and Home 
operating reviews.
The roadside assistance market is similarly showing signs of 
recovery, with the overall market size increasing. Three major 
providers, including Green Flag, account for the majority of the 
market and competition is increasing, with service and price 
being important aspects for customers. Products are bought 
direct from providers, as part of linked motor sales, as part  
of packaged bank accounts, and via PCWs.
The pet population and market penetration rates remain stable; 
however, average premiums have been rising. The premiums 
increase in recent years is due to higher claims severity,  
driven by treatment and drug advances, while price 
competition continues to increase. Insurance providers are 
focused on recommendations by, and distribution through,  
vets as an important channel to customers; however, PCW  
visits are gradually increasing. The travel insurance market  
has been stable, and characterised by high volumes and 
penetration rates, the latter being the uptake of insurance by 
travellers. Medical claims represent the largest component of 
claims severity and continue to grow, followed by cancellation 
claims. Distribution is moving away from travel agents and 
brokers, with travel insurance being offered through packaged 
bank accounts and PCWs.
Performance
We focused on new Rescue customer propositions and  
a refreshed marketing campaign, with Green Flag’s one hour 
response commitment, which aimed to differentiate the brand. 
A positive contribution continued to be received from the pet 
insurance line, while the travel business experienced a loss due 
to increased claims frequencies from packaged bank accounts.  
In November, we completed the sale of the closed Life 
business for £62 million, and returned the proceeds of sale to 
shareholders by way of a special interim dividend in December.
Gross written premium of £383.4 million was broadly stable 
to last year. This reflected increased direct sales of Green  
Flag products offset by reduced linked sales. Pet gross  
written premium increased by 3.7% from rate increases  
and travel gross written premium decreased by 0.8% driven  
by volume decreases.
Underwriting profit reduced to £27.9 million from last year 
while the loss ratio increased 9.2 percentage points as 2012 
benefited from positive one-offs relating to legacy creditor 
business. The expense ratio improved by 1.0 percentage  
point due to cost improvements across the Group, partially 
offset by increased Green Flag marketing costs. Overall, 
operating profit decreased to £46.5 million following the 
non-repeat of certain one-offs, primarily in the legacy creditor 
business, which benefited 2012. Of the total operating profit, 
£38.1 million was delivered by Rescue and £6.4 million by 
the closed Life business. The Rescue contribution was £9 million 
lower than in 2012, due to the increased marketing spend 
and the non-repeat of certain one-off items.
Outlook
Rescue and other personal lines continues to represent an 
opportunity to create value for the Group, and meet customers’ 
broader insurance needs. Investment in distribution and 
propositions will support further contribution, offset by the 
disposal of the Life business, and lower Creditor premiums  
as the business runs off.

Market
UK economic growth has continued to strengthen in 2013  
and optimism is increasing about the general business situation. 
Interest rates remain at low levels, reducing investment returns. 
There has been some evidence of insurers exiting historically 
unprofitable business.
Insurers are also seeking to reduce costs and there have been 
instances of insurers reviewing their regional structures and 
branch networks. Furthermore, there is a desire for brokers and 
insurers to adopt e-trading solutions for SME and micro-sized 
businesses, in order to reduce costs and speed up the 
underwriting process.
Performance
We continued to grow in-force policies, particularly in Direct 
Line for Business. NIG’s full cycle broker e-trading platform  
‘The Hub’ continued to be rolled out across the year to new 
products. Where business has been migrated to the new 
platform, broker take up has been encouraging. We have 
established two online newspaper partnerships aimed towards 
small businesses and social media channels have been 
introduced to interact directly with customers. Proposition 
development continues to be a strength for Direct Line for 
Business, with a number of new initiatives launched. Furthermore, 
to streamline our operating model, we separated our trading 
and operational functions, and restructured the regional 
functions to enhance new business focus and improve efficiency.
Gross written premium increased by 8.9% compared to 2012 
due to the transfer of the van business from the Motor division 
and growth in Direct Line for Business. In 2013, some 
components of the portfolio were de-risked.
The COR improved by 1.4% to 106.8%; however, when 
normalised for weather this would have been 103.7%, 
showing good progress towards the 2014 target. The loss 
ratio improved modestly by 0.8 percentage points to 62.3% 
despite higher than normal claims relating to weather events, 
the majority of which were in the fourth quarter, and a high 
level of large losses. We continued to experience reserve 
releases, similar to the level of 2012, but remain prudently 
reserved. An improvement in current-year loss ratio was led  
by an improvement in the underwriting profit of £3.5 million.  
A marginal improvement in the expense ratio of 0.3 
percentage points reflected cost improvements across the 
Group. The regional restructure undertaken in Commercial  
was implemented in the second half of the year and is 
expected to deliver cost savings in 2014. Overall, operating 
profit increased by £7.3 million to £9.5 million for the year.
Outlook
Normalising the 2013 performance for claims from weather 
events, the division made progress towards its 2014 COR 
target of sub-100%. Actions taken during 2013 on pricing,  
risk selection and the cost base are expected to continue  
to flow through in 2014 and the division’s target for this  
year is unchanged. This assumes a normal level of claims  
from weather-related events and large losses. Up to  
22 February 2014, approximately £20 million of such  
claims have been received.

Market
Italy’s economy continued to decline in 2013. In 2014, it is 
expected gradually to return to growth
1
. Household consumption 
is stagnant
1
 and the number of new car registrations is declining
2
. 
The number of road accidents, injuries and deaths has 
contributed to a reduction of claims frequency, which  
has led to a decrease in average price of around 5%
3
.
Recent insurance sector reforms, especially the ending of a 
requirement for policyholders to advise their insurer if they do 
not wish to renew their motor policies, together with the increase 
in PCWs, has increased the level of switching. This increases 
the potential market for Direct Line, while also increasing  
the number of our customers who shop around at renewal. 
Going forward, we expect growth in the number of customers 
accessing insurance products via smartphone and tablet devices.
The economic conditions in Germany are different, with the 
recovery continuing
4
 and growth expected to rise slightly 
faster
4
. Household consumption continues to strengthen
4
 and 
the number of registered vehicles is rising, while petrol costs 
decline
4
. Motor average premiums, which have risen over  
the previous two years, are expected to remain stable, taking 
account of claims inflation
5
. The severe hailstorms in June and 
July 2013 may result in increased average premiums.
In Italy, the use of telematics to collect information at the claims 
stage is already fairly extensive. As a consumer proposition  
it is continuing to develop. We have a number of pilots to 
understand how best to operate in this area. In Germany,  
the first introduction has recently occurred.
Performance
We continue to focus on extracting value from the Italian and 
German businesses. Growth arose from Germany where we 
benefited from positive market conditions allowing our efficient 
platform to enable us to grow our share of year-end business 
without significant additional cost. We remain cautious in Italy 
given the uncertain economic environment and competitive 
conditions. We implemented ClaimCenter in Italy and continue 
to evolve technology to deliver an efficient digital platform. 
Italy, Germany and the UK continued to share and leverage 
best practice, for example on claims processes and telematics.
In-force policies grew by 10.1% and gross written premium 
increased by 4.9% in local currency terms. These were  
driven by Germany where we expanded our share of business 
renewing on 1 January 2013. PCWs, while still small in both 
markets, continued to grow their share of new business. Direct 
Line is present on PCWs in both countries.
The COR remained broadly stable at 103.9%, with higher 
than normal hailstorm claims in Germany which resulted in  
a COR of 109.8%, offset by lower claims frequency in Italy 
with a COR of 101.6%. The loss ratio in Germany similarly 
reflects the £8 million of claims relating to the severe 
hailstorms. A higher commission ratio was attributable to a 
change in mix towards PCWs and partners. Total operating 
profit of £16.6 million was split £14.1 million from Italy and 
£2.5 million from Germany. Operating profit, in local currency, 
was €20.4 million a decrease of 16.7% on the previous year 
(2012: €24.5 million).
Outlook
In Italy, more competitive market conditions and increased 
customer switching during 2013 have lowered premium 
growth expectations for 2014. With this more cautious stance, 
we will continue to focus on creating value through improving 
operating and pricing efficiency. Germany has once again 
experienced a good start to the year, which has increased 
in-force policies to approximately 628,000 at the end of 
January 2014. Following average premium rate increases over 
the last two years, an increase in competition is now expected 
to place pressure on average premiums.

 of  
£526.5 million represented a 14.2% increase on 2012 
(2012: £461.2 million). There was a significant improvement 
in the underwriting result, driven by higher than expected reserve 
releases of £435.1 million (2012: £322.0 million), in part 
due to management actions to improve the risk profile of  
the book and initiatives relating to claims, and despite poor 
weather in the last quarter, fewer claims from major weather 
events in Home in 2013. This more than offset a lower 
investment return, lower instalment and other operating income

 decreased by  
6.0% during 2013 to 18.5 million. The fall related primarily  
to Rescue and other personal lines and Home. The Rescue and 
other personal lines reduction arose mainly from travel policies 
from packaged bank accounts. Home in-force policies fell 
mainly as a result of the removal of Home Response
7
 policies 
(around 420,000) from certain packaged bank accounts no 
longer sold through partners. Excluding this effect, which had 
little impact on gross written premium, Home in-force policies 
have decreased by 2.6% during 2013.
The fall in Motor in-force policies of 7.1% reflects the Group’s 
focus on maintaining its underwriting discipline in a competitive 
marketplace, particularly for new business. The reclassification 
of van business to Commercial (around 70,000 in-force 
policies) from 1 January 2013 represented 1.7 percentage 
points of the reduction.
International growth arose from Germany where the Group  
has benefited from improved market conditions. Commercial 
continued to grow in-force policies, particularly in Direct Line 
for Business and also benefited from the reclassification of  
van business from Motor.

This reflects the impact of a competitive market, particularly  
in UK motor, together with the Group’s continued focus on 
maintaining its underwriting discipline.
Gross written premium for Commercial of £474.5 million 
increased by 8.9% (2012: £435.6 million) due to the transfer 
of van business and growth in Direct Line for Business.
International gross written premium of £604.5 million was 
9.4% higher than the previous year (2012: £552.7 million)

Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 35
Strategic report The commission ratio increased by 2.1 percentage points  
to 11.2% (2012: 9.1%), partly due to profit-share payments, 
reflecting the higher profitability of partnership business in the 
Home division. This is mainly attributable to fewer claims from 
major weather events.
The expense ratio improved 0.7 percentage points to  
22.3% (2012: 23.0%), reflecting the benefits of cost reduction 
initiatives and reduced parallel running costs, but these benefits 
were partially offset by the effect of lower net earned premium.

On a segmental basis, the COR improved in Motor, Home 
and Commercial compared with 2012. Rescue and other 
personal lines COR increased in 2013 as positive one-off 
benefits in 2012 mainly from the creditor business were not 
repeated. The International COR remained broadly stable.

In Motor, the 8.4 percentage points improvement in COR 
reflects management actions to improve the risk profile of the 
book as well as higher releases of reserves from prior years. 
Reserve releases of £291.9 million in 2013 were driven 
primarily by favourable bodily injury experience for recent 
accident years, partly attributable to better risk selection  
and benefits arising from the Group’s claims transformation 
programme. Assuming underlying claims trends continue,  
a significant contribution from prior-year reserve releases  
is currently expected in 2014, albeit at a lower level than  
in 2013. The current-year attritional loss ratio was in line  
with 2012.
Finance review continued
The improvement was primarily the result of a 4.5 percentage 
points reduction in the loss ratio. This arose from two main 
factors: significant reserve releases partly due to management 
actions to improve the risk profile of the book and initiatives 
relating to claims; and despite poor weather in the last quarter, 
fewer claims from major weather events in Home across the 
year. In 2013, the Home division incurred approximately  
£69 million of claims from major weather events (2012: 
approximately £105 million). This was partially offset by  
higher than normal weather-related claims in International 
(German hailstorms in June and July 2013) and in Commercial

The Group views the trend in the current-year attritional loss

excludes prior-year reserve movements and claims from major 
weather events in the Home division.
Overall, the current-year attritional loss ratio remained 
unchanged at 73.0% in 2013, despite competitive market 
conditions and higher than expected weather-related claims  
in International and Commercial.

Overall prior-year reserve releases from ongoing operations 
increased to £435.1 million (2012: £322.0 million), 
equivalent to 12.4% of net earned premium (2012: 8.7% of 
net earned premium). Although the Group expects to continue 
to see significant reserve releases, the overall level experienced 
in 2013 is higher than would normally be expected. Assuming 
claims trends continue, a significant contribution from prior-year 
reserve releases is currently expected in 2014, albeit at a 
lower level than in 2013.

Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 36 The Home COR improved to 93.8% in 2013 from 96.6%  
in 2012. The improvement was almost entirely driven by 
reduction in claims from major weather events. In 2013, 
claims from major weather events totalled approximately  
£69 million compared with approximately £105 million  
in 2012. The current-year attritional loss ratio was in line  
with the prior period, reflecting stable underwriting margins, 
albeit in a more competitive operating environment. Reserve 
releases were broadly in line with 2012. 
The COR for Rescue and other personal lines increased  
to 92.4% (2012: 82.7%). The 2012 result benefited from 
positive one-offs (relating primarily to the run-off of the legacy 
creditor business) that were not repeated in 2013. The 
performance was also affected by higher claims frequency on 
the travel book and increased Green Flag marketing costs. The 
Life business, which contributed £6.4 million to operating profit 
in 2013 (2012: £8.1 million), was sold in November 2013.
The Commercial division improved its COR to 106.8% from 
108.2% principally as a result of better underlying underwriting 
performance and a lower expense ratio. The current-year 
attritional loss ratio improved despite higher weather-related 
claims demonstrating the positive effect of recent management 
actions. The division continues to experience significant reserve 
releases. Excluding the impact of weather-related claims above 
normal levels, the COR would have been approximately 104%.
International COR in 2013 increased to 103.9% from 
103.3% in 2012. The increase was due to claims relating to 
hailstorms in Germany in June and July. For 2013 as a whole, 
weather-related net claims were approximately £8 million more 
than expected. Reserve releases increased to £39.3 million 
(2012: £30.2 million) although are not expected to continue 
at these levels.

The expense ratio improved by 0.7 percentage points to 22.3% 
due to a reduction in operating expenses compared with 2012, 
partially offset by the impact of lower net earned premium.
Ongoing operating expenses of £786.4 million were reduced 
by 8.0% from the prior year (2012: £854.8 million). The 
reduction was principally due to the benefits from the Group’s 
cost savings plan announced in 2012, tight cost control and 
the non-repeat of certain expenses under the historic RBS 
Group recharge.
From 1 July 2012, the Group no longer paid a management 
fee to RBS Group and this was replaced by directly paying 
third-party suppliers for the majority of services that RBS Group 
had previously provided. Consequently, expenses previously 
reported under management fees are now reflected within their 
relevant line items. The Group continues to pay RBS Group for 
transitional IT infrastructure, the costs of which are included 
within other operating expenses.
The Group is targeting a total cost base

of approximately 
£1,000 million in 2014 and the total cost base

 in 2013 of 
£1,031.9 million showed good progress towards this target.

Instalment and other operating income from ongoing 
operations reduced by 9.1% from 2012. This was primarily  
as a result of the cessation of solicitors’ referral fee income  
from 1 April 2013 and lower instalment income.
Instalment income, representing interest charged on insurance 
premiums paid by instalments, of £117.8 million reduced by 
£7.6 million compared with the prior year (2012: £125.4 million) 
as a result of lower in-force policies in Motor and Home and 
changes to business mix.
In February 2014, the Group sold its stolen vehicle  
recovery business, Tracker. In 2013, Tracker’s revenue was 
£18.4 million (2012: £18.2 million) which was included  
in the above. Operating losses from the business were  
£1.4 million (2012: £3.9 million).

The total investment return reduced to £221.1 million compared 
with 2012, due to a decrease in realised gains and lower 
investment income resulting from lower AUM.
During 2013, the investment asset base decreased by 8.5%  
to £8.6 billion. Key reasons for the reduction include the 
repayment of the £258.5 million Tesco loan note and investment 
outflows resulting from a net reduction in insurance liabilities.
Investment income was £188.6 million, a 5.4% decrease on 
2012, as a result of a lower average investment asset base, which 
was partially offset by an increase in investment income yields.
Net realised and unrealised gains recognised in 2013  
were £32.5 million compared with £82.5 million in 2012. 
Realised gains in 2012 reflected significant portfolio restructuring 
actions. Total realised gains at 31 December 2013 were 
£58.8 million net of deferred tax (2012: £158.8 million).
The investment income yield on the total portfolio for 2013 
was 2.1% (see page 41), an improvement on 2012 driven 
primarily by management actions to increase the credit and 
property weighting within the target investment mix.

Run-off
The Run-off segment made a profit of £63.6 million in 2013 
compared with a profit of £6.1 million in 2012. Similar to the 
ongoing operations, the Run-off segment also benefited from 
higher prior-year reserve releases from the recognition of 
improved claims experience, in particular relating to large 
bodily injury claims. Going forward, it is currently expected 
that the Run-off segment will contribute positively to operating 
profit, albeit at a lower level than in 2013.
Restructuring and other one-off costs
Restructuring and other one-off costs for 2013 fell to  
£140.5 million (2012: £189.5 million) as a result of the 
non-repeat of costs associated with separation and divestment 
from RBS Group. This includes £60.2 million relating to IT 
migration and £80.3 million relating to the Group’s cost saving 
initiatives. The Group currently expects that restructuring and 
other one-off costs in 2014 will be approximately £80 million.
Finance costs
Finance costs increased to £37.7 million (2012: £28.7 million), 
primarily reflecting a full year of interest on the £500 million of 
long-term subordinated debt issued in April 2012.
Gain on disposal of subsidiary
On 8 October 2013, the Group announced an agreement 
with Chesnara plc for the sale of the Life business. Total  
sale proceeds of £62.3 million, which include a pre-closing 
dividend of £23.0 million, represent 85% of the embedded 
value of the business at 30 June 2013. The sale completed  
on 28 November 2013 and the profit on disposal was  
£12.0 million.
Taxation
The Group has an important responsibility to its stakeholders to 
manage its tax position effectively to ensure that the Group is 
fully compliant with all laws and regulations; and to meet all its 
obligations as both a contributor of taxes and a collector of 
taxes on behalf of the tax authorities.
The effective tax rate for 2013 was 26.2% (2012: 26.0%) 
compared with the standard UK corporation tax rate of 
23.25% (2012: 24.5%). This is driven primarily by earnings 
from the International operations which are subject to higher 
corporation tax rates, re-measurement of deferred tax asset, 
disallowable expenses, non-taxable disposal of subsidiary,  
and adjustments to provisions in respect of prior-year tax.
Profit for the year and return on tangible equity
Profit for the year amounted to £312.8 million  
(2012: £184.3 million), an increase of 69.7% on 2012.
RoTE from ongoing operations increased to 16.0% (2012: 11.5% 
and pro forma 13.4%) as a result of both the improved operating 
result and the capital actions taken to improve the efficiency of the 
Group’s capital position.
Notes:

Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 38 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share of 20.9 pence increased 69.9% 
(2012: 12.3 pence), reflecting the improved operating profit 
from ongoing operations and the Run-off segment, and a 
decrease in Restructuring and other one-off costs. Diluted 
earnings per share were 20.8 pence (2012: 12.3 pence).
Adjusted basic earnings per share, which excludes the Run-off 
segment, Restructuring and other one-off costs and gain on 
disposal of subsidiary, increased by 15.1% to 25.1 pence 
(2012: 21.8 pence). Diluted adjusted earnings per share 
were 25.0 pence (2012: 21.8 pence).
Dividends
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 8.4 pence per 
share making a total regular dividend for 2013 of 12.6 pence 
per share. This represents 5.0% growth over the pro forma
1
 
2012 regular dividend and is in line with the Group’s aim  
to grow dividends annually in real terms.
In addition, the Board is also declaring a further special interim 
dividend of 4.0 pence per share, in addition to the 4.0 pence 
per share paid in December 2013. This second special interim 
dividend reflects the better than planned performance in the 
Run-off segment and the proceeds from the recently announced 
sale of Tracker. Both these items are considered to be one-off  
in nature and as a result the Board believes it is appropriate  
in this instance to return this capital to shareholders.
Cash flow
Net cash used by operating activities before investment of 
insurance assets reduced to £307.0 million (2012: £966.0 
million). This reflected a reduction of cash used by operations 
of £226.7 million (2012: £731.4 million) and reduction of 
taxes paid of £80.2 million (2012: £232.4 million). The 
reduction of cash used by operations resulted from an increase 
in trade and other payables and in payments of current and 
prior-year claims, partially offset by a decrease in insurance 
and other receivables.
Cash generated from investment of insurance assets reduced to 
£433.0 million in 2013 (2012: £2,004.8 million). Proceeds 
on the disposal and maturity of available-for-sale financial 
assets reduced to £3,147.8 million (2012: £4,021.6 million) 
and investment balances held with credit institutions decreased 
by £209.3 million (2012: £844.6 million). For 2012, 
amounts primarily reflected the funding of dividend payments 
to RBS Group of £1,000.0 million prior to the IPO, and 
investment portfolio restructuring.
Overall, net cash generated from operating activities totalled 
£126.0 million (2012: £1,038.8 million).
Net cash used by investing activities of £145.3 million  
(2012: £154.2 million), primarily comprised £115.5 million 
purchase of intangibles relating to ongoing software investment 
(2012: £96.6 million).
Dividends paid amounted to £242.7 million  
(2012: £1,000.0 million) with the 2012 balance representing 
payment of dividends to RBS Group prior to the IPO.  
The Group repaid borrowings during the year representing  
the Tesco loan note of £258.5 million with the 2012 
repayment (£246.4 million) representing loans with RBS Group. 
Following these, net cash used by financing activities totalled 
£544.7 million (2012: £774.5 million).
Overall, cash and cash equivalents decreased by £564.0 million 
(2012: £110.1 million increase) across the year to £853.2 
million (31 December 2012: £1,417.5 million) representing 
the rebalancing of the investment portfolio including the 
reduction of cash holdings.

The net asset value at 31 December 2013 was £2,790.0 million 
(31 December 2012: £2,831.6 million) with tangible net asset 
value of £2,289.9 million (31 December 2012: £2,410.1 million). 
This equates to 186.6 pence and 153.2 pence per share 
respectively as at 31 December 2013 (31 December 2012: 
189.1 pence and 161.0 pence, respectively).
The reduction in net asset value and tangible net asset value 
principally reflects the payment of the final 2012, interim and 
first special interim 2013 dividends, a reduction in the level of 
unrealised gains in the debt securities portfolio, and increased 
investment in intangible assets offset by profit for the period.
Significant accounting policies
Except as disclosed in note 1 to the consolidated financial 
statements, the same accounting policies and basis of 
recognition and measurement have been followed in the 
consolidated financial statements as applied in the Group’s 
previous annual audited financial statements for the year  
ended 31 December 2012.
Where new or revised standards have been adopted in the 
year, these have not had a material impact on the Group’s 
financial statements.
Financial management
The Group’s long-term sustainability depends on having sufficient 
funds to meet its liabilities as they fall due. This protects the 
reputation of its brands and the integrity of the Group’s relationship 
with customers and other stakeholders. The principal financial 
risks that are present in the Group are reserving, market risk 
connected to the investment portfolio and counterparty risk.
Reserving
Estimation of claims reserves is a central aspect of financial 
management. Insurance is inherently uncertain, requiring the 
use of judgement in estimating the ultimate claims liability.  
The factors that must be considered when assessing the level  
of outstanding liabilities include class of business, timeliness of 
notification of claims, validity of claims made against a policy 
and validity of the amount of the claim. At any time there is a 
range of possible outcomes at which the claims reserves could 
ultimately settle and, as time passes, the uncertainty surrounding 
likely claims settlement reduces. The uncertainty is greater for 
bodily injury claims due to the time it takes for these claims to 
settle. This is particularly true for PPOs awarded to settle some 
bodily injury claims, in which annually indexed payments 
could be awarded over the lifetime of the injured party.
Note:
1. See note 5 on page 3
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 39
Strategic report Finance review continued
Given this uncertainty, the Group adopts a conservative 
approach to the assessment of liabilities. This conservative 
approach is supported by historical claims reserve releases. 
These can be observed in the gross and net ultimate claims 
cost development triangles shown on pages 153 and 154. 
The triangles demonstrate that, for all accident years, the 
estimated ultimate claims cost has reduced over time from  
the year of first validation. Reductions in ultimate claims cost 
have fluctuated over the period, with the accident years from 
2003 to 2006 and 2010 showing the largest decreases.  
The 2009 accident year has shown the lowest reduction;  
this followed a significant increase in claims relating to motor 
over the 2009 and 2010 financial years, in response to the 
market-wide adverse development in bodily injury claims.  
This resulted in part from the rise of claims management 
companies, an increase in no-win no-fee litigation, and  
an increase in the number of PPOs.
Actuarial reviews are carried out quarterly, with over 95% of all 
claims reserves being reviewed at least annually. Actuarial best 
estimates are produced internally, and are subject to independent 
external review at least annually. Reserves are based on 
management’s best estimate set by the Group, which will be at 
least equal to the actuarial best estimate at a legal entity level. 
The Group will set reserves informed by a range of actuarial 
outputs including percentiles and scenarios. It will consider the 
level of historical variability inherent in the claims data and 
other short- and long-term risks not reflected in the actuarial data.

Investment portfolio
The Group’s investment portfolio comprises primarily of investments 
in sovereign debt securities, investment grade fixed income 
securities and cash. The strategy ensures adequate liquidity is 
always available to meet customers’ claims, particularly in periods 
of stress (for example, natural disasters). It is also designed to 
ensure that asset and liability durations match closely where possible; 
and that risk is diversified and return maximised relative to the 
Group’s risk appetite and capital allocated to investment risk.
During 2013, key achievements included:
• Undertaking a major asset and liability management study 
on U K Insurance Limited, which reconfirmed liquidity 
requirements and proposed some changes to the current 
asset mix to deliver a better overall risk adjusted return
• Transferring the management of ‘AAA’ fixed-income credit 
in-house to improve the overall cost effectiveness of the 
operating model
• Increasing the benchmark allocation to investment grade 
credit and the sub-allocation to ‘BBB’ rated assets
• Investing into externally managed securitised credit, with the 
focus on investment into the highest-quality debt tranches and 
having a well-diversified range of collateral types and pools 
backing such investments
• The continuing selective purchase of assets for the UK 
commercial property portfolio. The asset brings portfolio 
return diversification and long-term returns to support 
inflation-linked liabilities

Derivatives are permitted for risk management purposes within

to manage currency risk.
T otal debt securities are £7,045.3 million (2012: £7,164.3 million), 
of which 12.9% are rated as ‘AAA’ and a further 70.5% are 
rated as ‘AA’ or ‘A’. Corporate, local government and 
supranational debt securities account for 63.2% of the portfolio.
The total value of the investment portfolio as at 31 December 2013 
was £8,557.6 million, 8.5% lower than as at 31 December 
2012. AUM provide adequate access to liquidity, with 15.1% 
of the funds held in cash and cash equivalents at the year end.
The duration as at 31 December 2013 of total investment 
assets was 2.0 years, with the breakdown being: UK 1.9 years; 
Italy 3.3 years; and Germany 2.4 years (2012: 1.8 years; 
UK 1.7 years; Italy 2.8 years; and Germany 2.5 years).
The internally managed gilt and ‘AAA’ credit portfolios have 
intentionally been held at a shorter duration than benchmark 
given the expectation of improvements in the interest rate 
environment. In addition, to minimise further interest rate risk  
the Group has increased its investment allocation to floating 
rate instruments, for example securitised credit. The US credit 
portfolios have been swapped to a floating basis since 
inception in 2012.
Investment property holdings shown as at 31 December 2013 
comprised 20 properties. The primary sector exposures are 
industrial warehouses (26.5%) and supermarkets (19.7%).

Asset studies for the UK portfolio resulted in the introduction of securitised credit as a new asset class in 2013. The benchmark 
holding for fixed income credit was increased during the year from 60% to 63%. Further investment properties were acquired 
during the year to bring the holding closer to the allocated level. Following an asset liability management review, the Group 
plans to start investing into infrastructure debt in 2014.

Capital management
Capital management policy
The Group seeks to manage its capital efficiently, maintaining 
an appropriate level of capitalisation and solvency, while 
aiming to grow its dividend annually in real terms.
In determining the appropriate level of capitalisation and 
solvency the Group considers capital on a number of metrics, 
including risk-based capital, regulatory capital and rating 
agency capital. The Group targets holding capital in the range 
of 125% to 150% of risk-based capital and holding capital 
sufficient to maintain a credit rating in the ‘A’ range.
Where the Board believes the Group has capital which is 
surplus to requirements, for example if it had an expectation 
that the risk-based capital coverage would be significantly 
above the 125% to 150% target range for a prolonged 
period, it would look to return capital to shareholders.
Risk-based capital
For its principal UK general insurance underwriter, U K 
Insurance Limited (“UKI”), the Group uses its own risk-based 
capital model to determine the level of capital required to 
operate within its risk appetite. The internal model is calibrated 
to a 99.5% confidence interval and considers both earned 
business and future business written over a one-year period. 
Furthermore, the model allows for uncertainty on this business 
until ultimate settlement. This approach is consistent with the 
ICA methodology set by the PRA.
For UKI, the major part of its required capital is held against 
reserve risk (approximately 46%) followed by underwriting  
risk (approximately 27%) and operational risk (approximately 
13%). The high level of reserve risk reflects the size of the 
claims reserves still held against business written when the 
Group’s premium base was larger, including the Run-off 
segment, and the Group’s exposure to PPOs which carry  
a high capital requirement.
Capital allocated by risk type – 
U K Insurance Limited (%) 
 Reserving risk 46.2%
l Underwriting risk 26.7%
 Operational risk 12.9%
l Market risk 6.2%
l Counterparty risk 8.0%
The Group’s International entities, in Italy and Germany, hold 
capital in excess of that required by their local regulators.
Current capital position and outlook
The Board considers the Group is currently strongly capitalised 
with a risk-based capital coverage ratio at the upper end of its 
risk-based capital coverage target range and an ‘A’ rating with 
stable outlook from its credit rating agencies.
In determining this position, the Board has considered a 
number of factors that may positively and negatively affect the 
Group’s capital position over the next 12 months. In particular, 
the Group’s UK regulated general insurance underwriters are 
currently going through the new ICAS+ process with the PRA  
to assess the Group’s future individual capital guidance.  
The ICAS+ process will also enable firms to obtain feedback 
on their progress towards Solvency II. This process is more 
involved than previous years and includes a detailed 
assessment of the Group’s internal risk-based capital model.  
In addition, the introduction of Solvency II from 2016 and 
changes to capital requirements and reporting are still being 
confirmed, especially in the area of long-term guarantees.
During 2013, the Group updated its investment target asset 
mix and in 2014 is developing further its asset and liability 
management solutions for longer tail insurance liabilities.  
This includes investing in infrastructure debt. As these changes 
take affect, it is expected that there will be an increase in the 
capital allocated to market risk. Furthermore with current bond 
yields remaining low, the Group expects to continue to see its 
level of unrealised bond gains reduce as bonds mature and 
are reinvested.
The Group continues to invest in its operations and is likely to 
see an increase in intangible assets that may not qualify fully 
towards the Group’s capital base.
Taken together the Board believes that it is appropriate to 
maintain capital at the upper end of its risk-based capital 
coverage range. The Board will continue to review this position 
as clarity improves on the factors mentioned above and the 
Group makes further progress on its transformation plan.
Dividends
In relation to 2013, the Group has paid, or is recommending, 
dividends amounting to £308.7 million and 20.6 pence per 
share. This consists of a regular dividend of 12.6 pence per 
share, representing 5.0% growth on the pro forma 2012 full 
year dividend, and two special interim dividends totalling 8.0 
pence per share. The regular dividend is consistent with the 
Group’s policy to aim to raise dividends annually in real terms.
The two special interim dividends relate to specific items in 
2013 that the Board considers to be one-off in nature – the 
disposal of its closed Life business and the higher than planned 
profit in the Run-off segment. Total dividends are equivalent to 
98.6% of post-tax profit. The regular dividend represents 
50.4% of post-tax profit from ongoing operations.

Strategic report Embedded in
 our values
Corporate social responsibility
 “During 2013, the Corporate Social 
Responsibility Committee has overseen the 
development of the Group’s approach to CSR, 
taking care to embed it in Direct Line Group’s 
core purpose and values. This ensures CSR is 
relevant to every employee, creating a clear 
value chain – doing the right thing builds trust, 
trust builds reputation, and reputation builds 
value – and weaving it into business processes.
 ”This approach reflects the way the Group and  
I believe our customers want us to do business, 
and ensures our strategy mirrors the themes  
of empowerment and trust which the Board 
actively leads in the Group’s relationships  
with its stakeholders.
 “Against the backdrop of a challenging operating 
environment, I am pleased to report that good 
progress has been made in establishing solid 
foundations to enable us to live up to our broad 
responsibilities as Britain’s leading personal 
lines motor and home insurer.”
Our approach and priorities drive a clear 
value chain; doing the right thing builds  
trust, trust builds reputation, and reputation 
builds value.
Approach and priorities
Working in partnership with the business-led charity Business  
in the Community (“BitC”), we were able to make exciting 
headway in rolling out our corporate social responsibility 
(“CSR”) initiatives. Blending input from employees at all levels, 
representing a wide range of stakeholder interests, together 
with BitC’s expertise in the issues material to our business,  
we advanced our CSR programme through four key strands  
– sustainable business practices, employee experience, 
community, and energy and environment. These strands 
continue to provide the framework for our CSR activity,  
against which our key performance targets and sustainability 
metrics are tested and monitored. An absolute priority for the 
Group is to sustain a high rate of employee engagement,  
and we were pleased that in spite of the significant amount  
of continuing change in the business, 71% of our employees 
reported themselves as favourably engaged in our Employee 
Opinion Survey conducted in October.
Governance
To ensure the delivery of our CSR programme, we have 
established a robust governance structure, with clear roles  
and responsibilities. This comprises the CSR Committee,  
see page 70, which has complete oversight of our strategy, 
policy and programme, and a CSR Advisory Group, formed  
of senior managers and chaired by a member of the Executive 
Committee, which leads CSR within the business. The Group 
Communications team has functional responsibility for 
executing the strategy and managing the CSR programme on 
a day-to-day basis. In addition, a clear policy framework has 
been developed and, in keeping with best practice, our 
policies are published on our website.
Sustainable business practices
Our products, services, business processes and supply chain 
have a tangible impact on each of our many stakeholders.  
By aiming to embed CSR in all our enterprise’s activity, we 
hope to deliver better outcomes for our customers and our 
wider stakeholders across society.

Responsibility Committee
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 44 Working with Government
The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has 
cited flooding as one of the key risks facing Britain. As one  
of Britain’s largest home insurers, we want to help address  
this risk. In June 2013, the UK Government and the ABI 
published a Memorandum of Understanding on flood insurance, 
which Direct Line Group played a key role in negotiating, as 
well as preparing for the creation of Flood Re. This is a vital 
step in seeking to make insurance affordable and accessible  
to high risk customers. We are pleased the UK Government 
has made significant commitments to help prevent and mitigate 
the effects of flooding, most notably not to reduce spending  
on flood defences.
The industry has compromised to reach agreement and, 
although there remain a number of issues that need to be 
overcome, it is committed to continuing to work closely with  
the UK Government with the objective of ensuring these can  
be resolved. In the meantime, we will meet our flood-related 
commitments to our customers under the existing Statement  
of Principles.
In June 2013, we hosted a debate in Westminster to discuss 
the topical issue of insurance for young drivers. Young drivers 
aged between 17 and 24 represent 12% of licence holders, 
but account for 25% of all UK motor accidents where someone 
is killed or seriously injured. As a result, this demographic 
group of motorists face higher insurance premiums. The debate 
brought together Members of Parliament, national and trade 
press, road safety practitioners, academics and trade bodies 
to discuss how to improve road safety among young drivers. 
Ideas included a graduated driver’s licence, a minimum 
learning period, a lower tolerance limit to alcohol, and 
restrictions on passenger numbers and night-time driving.  
We encourage the Government to release its Young Driver 
consultation paper.
A number of our Executives are actively involved in various 
industry bodies, including the ABI, FCA Practitioner Panel  
and Financial Ombudsman Service (“FOS”) Insurance Industry 
Steering Group; and Tom Woolgrove was elected President  
of the Chartered Insurance Institute. This involvement informs 
our policy insights.
We recognise that there is a general concern that lobbying 
can have an inappropriate influence on government policy  
and therefore we engage only in public policy debates that 
have an impact on our business or our stakeholders. We do 
not support party political interests or make political donations.
600,000
new car parts saved through our ‘repair not 
replace’ initiative
Innovation
We believe that ultimately customers determine our future.  
That is why we are investing in technology to help give our 
customers the products and services they want and need.
We have developed an Optimum Repair Process (“ORP”). 
ORP is a new, environmentally sustainable approach to 
modern vehicle crash repair, which cuts waste and emissions 
by encouraging the practice of ‘repair, not replace’. This 
dramatically reduces the volume of new parts used. ORP  
has been supported by our research partner, Thatcham,  
which provides technical training courses for vehicle 
damage assessors.
On average, it used to take 10 days and 16 hours’ labour 
to complete a repair. In working time, a vehicle could be in  
a body shop for 64 hours awaiting repair, preventing other 
cars from being serviced. Much of that time was wasted 
waiting for parts. The repair industry had become accustomed 
to replacement rather than repair, creating an over-reliance on 
expensive new parts and the accompanying deskilling of many 
technicians. This, in turn, increased both repair times and 
costs, which affected customer satisfaction.
As a result of ORP, we are using around 200,000 fewer new 
car parts per annum.
Telematics
In response to improving technology and customer interest, 
during the year Direct Line launched various telematics 
propositions. This technology allows us to gather information 
about customers’ driving, recording speed patterns and distance 
travelled, which can be connected to the types of roads used 
and at what time. It also monitors braking and cornering to 
build up a picture of a customer’s driving style so that we can 
better assess each person’s individual risk. This should lead to 
greater pricing granularity for drivers opting for telematics.
For higher risk motorists, such as young drivers between  
the ages of 17 and 24, who tend to pay higher premiums, 
telematics provide a way for these customer groups to pay  
only for how they drive, rather than also pay for how other 
drivers behave on the roads.
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 45
Strategic report Corporate social responsibility continued
Above all else, we believe the use of telematics technology 
encourages safer and more considerate driving, which will 
ultimately lead to safer roads for all. It is an excellent way  
of encouraging drivers to manage their speed – one of the 
biggest causes of collisions on European roads.
Other initiatives
Other initiatives to make things better and easier for our 
customers include piloting the capability to use smartphones  
to send us live footage of their home claims so we can settle 
their claim far quicker. Smartphones can also be used to give 
claimants a live view of progress on their car repair as it  
moves through the accident repair centre process.
Supply chain
Last year, we began a significant piece of work to ensure  
we were properly managing the risks and improving the 
sustainability of our supply chain. We reviewed and 
republished our Ethical Code for Suppliers and reworked  
the selection criteria and contract terms for new suppliers.  
Our focus in 2014 is on developing our supplier management 
programme. We were also proud to sign up to the Prompt 
Payment Code advocated by the Department for Business, 
Innovation and Skills, which is aimed specifically at alleviating 
the pressure of delayed customer payments on smaller 
businesses that tend to be more vulnerable to experiencing 
cash flow problems. Signatories to the code commit to pay 
suppliers on time (the default period being within 30 days), 
give clear guidelines on payment procedures, and encourage 
lead suppliers to adopt the code in their own supply chains.
Living Wage
While not accredited to the Living Wage Foundation, we 
ensured that all our employees were paid at or above the 
Living Wage. We are also factoring the Living Wage into 
contract renewal discussions with external suppliers.
Responsible investment
During the year, we set out our approach to responsible 
investment. The asset classes in which we invest are cash, 
government and corporate debt securities, and commercial 
property. We do not hold equities or have direct equity 
investments and are therefore unable to use share ownership  
to influence other companies. Although we do not set ethical 
parameters for our asset managers regarding the issuers in 
which they can or cannot invest, we have, however, committed 
to mandating only those external asset managers who 
demonstrate a strong commitment to using their market 
leverage to support social, environmental and ethical (“SEE”) 
objectives. We favour those managers with an active, ongoing 
demonstrable engagement in local or global SEE initiatives 
and expect, at a minimum, our managers to be signatories
1
  
to the UN Principles of Responsible Investment. We will meet 
with each of our asset managers annually to review in detail 
the initiatives they have taken and successes accomplished.
Employee experience
Our focus continues to be on our people strategy, to build the 
future capability required to achieve our strategic objectives 
and fulfil our people. We are committed to strong employee 
engagement, which we believe underpins the quality of service 
we offer our customers.
Engagement
We continue to transform our business. Since the start of our 
cost saving initiatives there has been a reduction of 3,200 
roles. While necessary in order to sustain our business in a 
highly competitive market, such initiatives inevitably impact  
on the engagement of our employees. In line with our values, 
we have worked hard to ensure that as much information as 
possible was communicated, confirmed that our redundancy 
terms would remain unchanged during this initiative, and fully 
consulted our employee representatives.
Anyone at risk of redundancy had access to our redeployment 
support and where redundancy resulted, individuals had 
access to both redeployment and outplacement support.
Clearly this was a very difficult time for those leaving the 
business, but also unsettling for those remaining. Not 
surprisingly, it had an impact on morale, as evidenced in this 
year’s Employee Opinion Survey, although it was pleasing that 
overall engagement remained high at 71% relative to historical 
results. This survey also showed that there is a high degree of 
Note:

our approach is to encourage them to move towards becoming signatories 
in due course.
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 46 employee understanding of the strategic direction in which  
the business is travelling and how individual roles relate to  
that journey. At the same time, despite the significant amount  
of business change, our employees have maintained a strong 
customer focus and still want to make a positive difference  
to the experience we give our customers.
Recognition
Recognition is an important element of engagement. The 
Group has established a number of initiatives to recognise  
the efforts and contribution of our employees. These range  
from formal reward arrangements to informal recognition 
programmes. Examples of the latter include our Service  
Awards, which were relaunched in 2013, to recognise  
loyalty; and our Excellence Awards, which recognise employees 
for outstanding service, innovation, relationship building or 
leading by example. We also run a Chief Executive Awards 
programme. These awards recognise those individuals who 
clearly demonstrate behaviours in line with our corporate 
values, which are at the very heart of our culture and 
demonstrate the great things our people do for each other,  
our customers, and our business every day. Last year, there 
were a record 6,000 nominations. Those shortlisted attended 
an awards event where the entertainment was provided by  
our own people, in the form of ‘Direct Line Group’s Got Talent’.
Development
Our Leadership Framework sets the expectation for leaders at 
all levels. We believe everyone can show leadership in their 
role. With the help of our employees, we have created a 
framework which outlines the behaviours, personal qualities, 
skills and knowledge needed for individuals to be successful  
in their role. The Leadership Framework is specific to Direct  
Line Group and helps drive the performance of our people.
For our people managers, there was significant focus this  
year on creating an environment where continuous and  
flexible development opportunities were made available.  
This challenged the traditional learning methodologies, 
reducing the dependency on face-to-face delivery, and has 
been built around a self-directed learning model where the 
emphasis is on the job development.
Over 1,000 people in our Claims business have been 
supported in embracing new ways of working to provide  
them with the skills and knowledge to handle claims in  
a more pro-active and efficient way.
Diversity
As a Group, we actively celebrate the diversity of our 
employees. Our Diversity Network Alliance aims to represent 
the full range of populations within our business and seeks  
to ensure we have a workforce reflective of society and our 
customer base. The network is still in its infancy, but we remain 
hopeful of encouraging 10% of our workforce to become 
members by the end of 2014.
Last year, the network had a particular focus on gender and 
working families. The ratio of female to male employees  
as at 31 December 2013 is shown in the charts along with  
a year on year comparison by headcount.
Gender diversity of all employees

shall look at ways in which we might achieve this in 2014.

Human rights
Our diversity and inclusion practices are in line with the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and we continue to 
work towards an environment that is based on meritocracy and 
inclusion, where all employees can develop their full potential, 
irrespective of their age, belief, disability, ethnic or national 
origin, gender, gender identity, marital or civil partnership 
status, political opinion, race, religion or sexual orientation.
Our Employee Opinion Survey indicated that 89%  
(2012: 92%) of respondents felt that we provide a working 
environment that is inclusive and accepting of differences  
in cultural backgrounds and lifestyles.
Through our Ethical Code for Suppliers we adhere to the  
core International Labour Organization standards.
Recruitment
We are actively supporting a range of initiatives to help 
alleviate youth unemployment, a continuing legacy of the 
financial crisis. During 2013, we joined the UK Government’s 
Wage Incentive scheme and will recycle any funds received 
into schemes to help young people into work. We have also 
provided partner funding to an online resource and careers 
platform for 11 to 24 year olds, entitled Plotr, which helps  
the young get into employment through supporting internships 
and mentoring. Additionally, we are working with Generation 
Talent, a joint initiative between the UK Government and BitC, 
to tackle the issues surrounding youth unemployment and to 
support young people into work.
Community
Our aim is to build Britain’s best retail general insurer.  
We recognise that achieving this aim requires us to play  
an active role in our local communities.
26%

Volunteering
Aligned to our core business, our focus is on Making Communities 
Safer through improving road safety and reducing crime and 
anti-social behaviour. In 2013, we worked with four charities 
focused on these themes: Brake, RoadSafe, Catch22, and The 
Prince’s Trust. Activities undertaken included: Community Space 
Challenges, which brought together our employee volunteers 
with young people to improve neglected community spaces; 
Speedwatch programmes, where we worked with local police 
and councils; and ‘Walking Buses’, which encourage children 
to walk to their school in an organised and safe environment. 
We also sponsor Brake’s Giant Walking Bus initiative, which 
this year saw 70,000 children from 350 schools march for 
safer streets while they walk to school.
Best CSR Initiative
Our initiative, ‘Get into Car Repairs’, won ‘Best CSR Initiative’ 
at the British Insurance Awards 2013. Record levels of youth 
unemployment mean the young miss out on vital work 
experience, which may hold them back throughout their 
careers. It also creates the risk of a rise in anti-social behaviour 
and crime, which has a direct impact on our business and 
wider society. ‘Get into Car Repairs’ had a positive impact on 
the lives of a group of disaffected unemployed young people 
in Wakefield, Yorkshire, where one in three 16 to 24 year  
olds are unemployed. It gave 15 young people first-hand 
experience of repairing cars in a body shop at our local 
accident repair centre. They also received training on CV 
writing and interview techniques, as well as soft skills such  
as communication and team building.
675
employees took pledges for Comic Relief

For Comic Relief and Children in Need, 675 employees were 
proud to offer their time to take calls from the public wanting to 
pledge donations. At a local level, our Community and Social 
Committees also arranged and coordinated a significant 
amount of charity activity.
According to our Employee Opinion Survey, last year,  
26% of our staff volunteered or fundraised in company time.

employees in two ways. We match employee donations  
up to £50 per month through our Give As You Earn scheme 
(“GAYE”); and we provide individual grants of £250 to 
organisations for which our employees regularly volunteer  
or raise funds in their own time. In 2013, we donated 
£115,000 through GAYE and a further £48,500 in grants. 
Our employees also undertake their own fundraising at work, 
typically for local causes, but also for major fundraising events.
Strategic partnerships
Now that our volunteering programme is established, our  
focus is on supporting our network of Community and Social 
Committees to develop their relationships with local charities 
and authorities. Centrally, we will focus on two strategic 
partnerships. The first is a continuation of our well-established 
partnership with Brake, with whom we plan a series of 
campaigns on road safety issues, for example on the 
introduction of 20 mph speed limits in certain urban environments. 
The second is with Groundwork, who deliver local community 
projects, improving community spaces and getting people 
back into work. We will look to work with them on programmes 
to help 16 to 24 year olds, not in employment, education or 
training, onto schemes which give skills and work experience, 
principally through social enterprises.
Energy and environment
We aim to manage our operations in a sustainable way.  
We seek to reduce waste and make efficient use of resources; 
and we aim to cut emissions, as part of the transition to a low 
carbon economy.
Emissions
We have established historical data records on energy use 
which has helped us better understand trends in our associated 
greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. Group-wide GHG 
emissions in 2013 were 30,624 tonnes of carbon dioxide 
equivalent (“CO
2
e”), of which 95.1% related to our UK 
operations. Emissions are calculated in accordance with the 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol and include Scope 1 and Scope  
2 emissions. More details on our emissions are given in the 
Directors’ report on page 100.
Our emission data has been externally verified by Ecometrica. 
The verification statements can be found on the Group’s 
website (www.directlinegroup.com ).
During 2013, 94.9% of the Group’s purchased electricity  
was from renewable sources on green tariffs purchased from 
GDF Energy and SSE in the UK, and LichtBlick and Naturstrom 
in Germany.
British Independent Utilities (“BIU”) was appointed as our 
Energy Partner to advise us on procuring the energy supply for 
our offices and accident repair centres from 2014. Part of the 
agreement is for BIU to work with us to reduce our power and 
gas consumption over the next three years, through environmental 
surveys and improvement plans for our buildings. We have set 
a target of a 10% reduction in our gas and electricity usage by 
the end of 2016, against our 2013 annual consumption figures.
In 2014, we are targeting a reduction of 3% of our UK GHG 
emissions measured by tonnes of CO
2
e.
Waste
We retendered our waste management services contract, 
excluding paper, for our main office sites and appointed  
SITA as provider in October. SITA has already significantly 
increased the percentage of our general office waste we 
recycle. Our longer-term aim is to increase recycling year on 
year and eliminate waste to landfill by 2016. Iron Mountain 
collects and recycles 100% of our waste paper. In 2013,  
we generated 1,355 tonnes of waste from our main office 
sites of which we recycled 55%. SWR collects waste from  
our accident repair centres. In 2013, these centres generated 
1,085 tonnes of waste of which 86% was recycled or reused.
500,000
litres of water per annum saved at our  
head office in Bromley
Resource use
Through our desktop and printing transformation programme 
we are replacing our old hardware. This is expected to bring 
a significant reduction in both energy and paper use. Last year, 
we consumed some 416 tonnes of copier paper. Our default 
office paper has a 100% recycled content.
We are currently establishing an accurate measure for our 
water usage for the Group. 
We have a number of local initiatives to improve our 
environmental performance, supported by a network of 
environmental champions. For example, we have made changes 
to the way in which we consume water in our restrooms in 
Bromley, resulting in a significant saving of half a million litres 
of water annually. 
Charlton House was appointed as our new catering  
supplier in 2013. Significant in their selection was their 
sustainability credentials, including a commitment to healthy 
eating, a focus on sourcing local and seasonal produce,  
and membership of the Red Tractor Scheme (an industry 
recognised Kitemark covering animal welfare, food safety  
and environmental protection).
Business travel
We continue to seek ways to reduce business travel,  
including better use of technology for video and conference 
calls, as well as enabling colleagues to work more smartly. 
We appointed a new travel management company, Capita 
Travel and Events, in October 2013 and will work with them 
to establish a baseline for reporting future travel-related emissions.
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 49
Strategic report Chairman’s introduction
Dear shareholders and other stakeholders
At Direct Line Group, we are committed to meeting the high 
standards of corporate governance rightly expected of a 
Group such as ours. Having complied with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code in relation to the key Board structure and 
processes by the time of the IPO in 2012, we undertook a 
governance review in 2013. This was designed to further test 
whether we have the most appropriate governance framework 
fit for a stand-alone listed company, with clarity as to 
accountabilities and responsibilities.
Our objective of good corporate governance influences 
everything that we do at Direct Line Group and is the 
responsibility not only of the Board and the executive 
management but of every member of staff.
Our Code of Business Conduct governs our interactions with 
our various stakeholders and ultimately helps with our goal  
of becoming Britain’s best retail general insurer. This is set  
out alongside.
Our Code of Business Conduct
The Board requires that all employees adhere to the 
highest possible standards of professional and ethical 
conduct – and this applies equally to the Board itself. 
Each function within the Group operates with policies  
and minimum standards and the following principles:
• Business practices 
We shall engage in honest, professional and ethical 
conduct and maintain effective procedures to prevent 
confidential information being misused
• Dealing with customers 
We shall treat customers fairly, openly and honestly  
and operate an effective complaints process to address 
any perceived departure from these standards
• Dealing with shareholders and other stakeholders 
We shall seek to maximise shareholder value over  
time, recognising that wealth generated also benefits  
customers and employees as well as the communities 
where we operate
• Dealing with employees 
We shall maintain a working environment that attracts, 
motivates and retains employees and shall be intolerant 
of any type of discrimination, harassment or victimisation
• Dealing with suppliers of goods and services and 
business partnerships 
We shall maintain the highest possible standards of 
integrity in business relationships with suppliers and 
partners by treating them honestly and with respect and 
avoiding compromising offers of gifts and hospitality
1
• Dealing with communities and the environment 
We shall contribute to the social and economic 
well-being of those communities where we are an 
employer and encourage employees to participate in 
projects and initiatives to strengthen those communities
• Dealing with competitors 
We shall compete with competitors honestly and in 
accordance with competition law
• Dealing with regulators 
We shall maintain a constructive and open relationship 
with our regulators to foster mutual trust, respect and 
understanding and shall not offer anything to officials  
in return for favourable treatment

Our values 
Do the right thing
For our people, our customers, our 
shareholders and our wider stakeholders; 
make decisions based on what is right, 
not what is easy; demonstrate personal 
and professional integrity; do what’s  
right for the long-term sustainability  
of our business.
Aim higher
Strive to be the best in every area of the 
business; be ambitious, courageous and 
innovative; relentlessly challenge and 
improve; seek and embrace change; 
learn from our mistakes; persevere, always 
deliver our promises and don’t settle for 
second best.
Work together
Collaborate across all levels and across  
all functions; leverage the skills, knowledge 
and experience, irrespective of hierarchy, 
to deliver the best possible results; develop 
relationships based upon trusting each 
other, partnerships and win-wins; recognise 
and celebrate success.
Take ownership
Treat it like it’s OUR business; take the 
initiative, if you can see a better way,  
go make a difference; take decisions, 
be accountable for your actions in 
whatever role you carry out; take 
responsibility for your own personal 
development and performance.
Say it like it is
Be real, authentic and true to self; have 
adult to adult conversations with all 
audiences; listen, seek to understand 
and respect diversity of views; be open, 
call out issues we see; share information 
and keep things as simple as possible.
Bring all of yourself to work
Be the best you can be, the real and 
whole you; celebrate our diversity of skills, 
experiences and personalities; be a role 
model to others, demonstrate ‘can do’ 
spirit, have fun and make this a great 
place to be; be excited about our 
Company and our future; believe in 
yourself, feel confident and empowered.
 “Direct Line Group believes that the combination 
of a good governance structure, a strong 
values-based culture and the highest standards 
of corporate behaviour stimulates value creation.”
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 50 We also place great emphasis on the values set out below that 
underpin these business principles. As we reported to you last 
year, the executive management engaged with employees to 
shape these, with the intention that they become central to our 
approach and behaviours. In line with those values, we seek 
to maintain an environment where everybody feels responsible 
for the future success of the business and is empowered to do 
the right thing.
Board composition
The Board comprises myself as Chairman (independent upon 
appointment to the Board), five independent Non-Executive 
Directors, one Non-Executive Director nominated by RBS Group 
and therefore not independent, and two Executive Directors.
The changes in directorate during 2013 were in respect of  
the Directors nominated by RBS Group. Mark Catton stepped 
down from the Board when RBS Group ceded control of the 
Company in March 2013 (whereupon RBS Group became 
entitled to nominate only one and not two Directors to the 
Board). In October 2013 he was reappointed when Bruce 
Van Saun resigned in order take up an appointment as RBS 
Group’s Chief Executive Officer, Citizens and Head of 
Americas in the United States. Mark Catton will step down  
as a Director when RBS Group’s holding in the Company falls 
below 20%.
Governance review
To help meet our goals of efficiency and strong governance, 
the Board undertook a planned post-IPO review of the Group’s 
governance arrangements.
Its aims were to clarify and simplify the governance framework, 
so as to help improve our day-to-day business operations while 
maintaining appropriate controls.
As a result of the review, we have re-engineered the High Level 
Controls and System of Governance Document, Enterprise-wide 
Risk Management Framework, Group Policies and Minimum 
Standards to remove unnecessary content, close gaps, reduce 
duplication and give greater focus and accountability to each 
element. Further details are provided in this report on page 60.
Consequently, individual components of the governance 
framework are now more clearly articulated and aligned to  
the expectations of the Board. The framework as a whole is 
considered fit for purpose to support our strategic priorities  
as a dynamic retail general insurance business, rather than  
as a division within a large bank.
I believe that this exercise will increase ownership and 
oversight and that our governance arrangements have become 
more transparent and effective.
Diversity
We are strongly committed to the merits of diversity at Board 
level and throughout the Group. 33% of the Board are women 
and we are keen to maintain this representation at around the 
current level. During the year, the proportion of women on the 
Executive Committee increased from 10% to 20% – that is, two 
women on a Committee of 10, namely Sara Gomez, Group 
Human Resources Director, and Angela Morrison, Chief 
Information Officer.
Board effectiveness review
Our intended practice is to conduct a thorough review of the 
effectiveness of the performance of the Directors, the Board as 
a whole and its committees on an annual basis, with the input 
of an external facilitator at least once every three years.
Given that the Board was largely new to the Company 
last year in the run up to the IPO, I felt it was appropriate to  
assess its performance at the same time as reviewing the main 
elements of the Company’s governance architecture. Accordingly, 
the Company appointed Edis-Bates Associates to assist us as 
independent external facilitators. A description of the process 
and the findings of the evaluation are set out on page 63.

Governance Corporate governance report
The UK Corporate Governance Code
The following report details how the Board has applied  
the principles and provisions in the FRC’s UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2012 (the “Code”) as required by the  
UK Listing Rules. See also the statement on page 100 of the 
Directors’ report.
Throughout the year, Direct Line Insurance Group plc  
(the “Company”) has complied with the principles and 
provisions of the Code. A copy of the Code is available  
from www.frc.org.uk .
Leadership
The role of the Board
The role of the Board is to organise and direct the affairs  
of the Group in a manner that is most likely to promote its 
long-term success for the benefit of its shareholders as a  
whole. It has oversight of the Group’s operations, ensuring  
it is effectively managed and that there are appropriate 
controls in place to assess and manage the Group’s risks.
The Board has set the Group’s strategy of continuing on the 
transformation path required to bring us closer to our ambition 
to be Britain’s best retail general insurer. Set out on page 58 
are the Board’s objectives for 2013, the actions the Board has 
undertaken during the year and our objectives for 2014.
The specific duties of the Board are clearly set out in the 
Schedule of Matters Reserved to the Board (the “Schedule”)
within the Board’s terms of reference. The Schedule lists those 
items that are specifically reserved for consideration and 
decision by the Board. These include:
• the establishment of the Group’s strategy and oversight  
of the business and affairs of the Group;
• the raising and allocation of capital;
• setting the Group’s risk appetite;
• ensuring the maintenance of a sound system of internal 
control and risk management;
• approval and oversight over execution and delivery of major 
capital projects, contracts which are material strategically 
and major investments;
• communication and meetings with shareholders;
• changes to the structure, size and composition of the Board 
and Board Committees, following recommendations from the 
Nomination Committee;
• determining the remuneration policy for Directors and Senior 
Executives and the introduction of new share incentive plans 
or major changes to existing plans;
• delegation of authority;
• corporate governance matters; and
• approval of formal Group policies.
The Board is the main decision-making forum for the Group.
Division of responsibilities
The roles and responsibilities of the Chairman and the  
Chief Executive Officer are clearly differentiated. The division 
of responsibilities at the top of a company is required by the 
Code to ensure that no one person may exert absolute control. 
The role statements of both the Chairman and the Chief 
Executive Officer were approved by the Board on  
21 September 2012. 
The Chairman’s responsibility is to provide leadership of the 
Board and ensure its effectiveness, whilst the Chief Executive 
Officer develops and delivers the Group’s strategy within the 
policies and values established by the Board.
The Non-Executive Directors provide constructive challenge 
and help to develop proposals on strategy.
In addition, the Senior Independent Director’s role is to  
provide a sounding board for the Chairman and to serve  
as an intermediary for the other Directors when necessary.  
His responsibilities include the evaluation of the performance  
of the Chairman and he is also available as an additional 
point of contact for shareholders.
The Board of Directors
The Board currently comprises the Chairman, who was 
independent on his appointment to the Board, two Executive 
Directors, five independent Non-Executive Directors and one 
non-independent Non-Executive Director, Mark Catton. Mark 
Catton is not an independent Non-Executive Director under  
the Code by virtue of being nominated by The Royal Bank  
of Scotland Group plc. However, he demonstrates a level  
of independent challenge at Board meetings, which has led 
the Nomination Committee to determine that he is independent 
in character and judgement.
The names of the Directors who served as at the end of  
the year, together with their biographical details and other 
information, are shown on pages 52 to 53.
There were no new appointments during the year; however, 
Mark Catton resigned from the Board in April 2013 and 
re-joined the Board in October 2013 when Bruce Van Saun 
resigned. The respective dates are shown in the notes to the 
table opposite.
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 56 Meetings of the Board
The Board met regularly during 2013; no further ad hoc meetings were required in addition to the 11 scheduled meetings.  
The Directors received Board papers and had the opportunity to comment on them in advance. Details of attendance at Board 
and Board Committee meetings by Directors during the year are set out below and on pages 65 to 74.

Authority delegated to the Chief Executive Officer
Although the Board is ultimately responsible for the success  
of the Company, Paul Geddes, the Chief Executive Officer,  
has received delegated authority from the Board to manage 
the Group’s day-to-day operations.
In turn, the senior executives who report to him take 
responsibility for managing the businesses and functions within 
the Group, and each member of the Executive Committee has 
the financial and other authorities needed to manage their 
respective areas.
Paul Geddes and these senior executives are supported by  
the functional departments of the Group.
Executive Committee
The Executive Committee is the principal management committee 
that assists the Chief Executive Officer in the day-to-day 
management of the Group as a whole. It supports him in setting 
performance targets and in implementing the Group’s strategy 
and direction as determined by the Board. The Committee 
assists him to monitor key objectives and commercial plans  
to meet the Group’s targets. It also helps him to evaluate  
new business initiatives and opportunities, and receives and 
considers reports on operational matters, where these are 
material to the Group or have cross-company implications.

Governance review
During 2013, the Board oversaw a review of the governance 
framework within which the Group operates, taking into 
account that the Company had listed on the London Stock 
Exchange and the shareholdings in the Company by RBS 
Group had decreased significantly.
Whilst this review confirmed that the Group’s governance 
framework dealt with such areas as would be expected and 
necessary, nonetheless the opportunity was taken to improve 
the control environment whilst making its administration and 
operation more transparent and cost effective. 
The review covered the entire Group and was primarily  
led by the Company Secretariat, Legal and Risk functions.  
The overall objective of the project was to clarify and  
simplify the Group’s governance framework in order to  
help and improve its day-to-day operation whilst maintaining 
appropriate controls.
The review resulted in a significant revision to the High Level 
Controls and System of Governance Document, the creation  
of an Enterprise-wide Risk Management framework and an 
Executive Governance framework. In addition Policies and 
Minimum Standards were revised and clarified and various 
business and project approval processes and procedures  
were also reviewed in conjunction with the Delegated  
Authority framework.
The diagram below summarises the split of responsibilities  
for the different aspects of the governance framework.

Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 60 Board effectiveness
Structure of the Board
As part of the process of helping to ensure a Code-compliant 
Board, the Company focused on obtaining the elements 
considered necessary to maximise the Board’s effectiveness. 
Consequently, the Board and its Committees have been 
constructed with a view to ensuring that an appropriate 
balance of skills, experience, independence, knowledge  
of the sector and diversity exists to enable the Directors  
to discharge their duties and responsibilities effectively. 
In assessing the independence of each Director, we  
considered whether each was independent in character and 
judgement and particularly whether there were relationships or 
circumstances which were likely to affect his or her judgement.
The individuals’ attributes were established as part of the 
selection procedure. Please see the section “Appointment of 
Directors” for the desired attributes of our Directors and a 
description of the selection process.
In addition, the Company employs a process of reviewing 
independence from management and invites the declaration  
of any conflict of interest that could interfere with each Director’s 
ability to act in the best interests of the Group. UK company 
law allows the Board to authorise a situation in which there  
is, or may be, a conflict between the interests of the Group 
and the direct or indirect interests of a Director or between  
the Director’s duties to the Group and to another person.  
The Board has adopted procedures for ensuring that its  
powers to authorise conflicts operate effectively. For this 
purpose a register of conflicts, and of any authorisation of  
a conflict granted by the Board, is maintained by the General 
Counsel and Company Secretary and regularly reviewed by 
the Board. Mark Catton is a non-independent Non-Executive 
Director by virtue of being nominated for appointment to the 
Board by RBS Group, the Company’s largest shareholder.  
RBS Group has committed to the European Commission to  
sell Direct Line Group as a condition of its receipt of state aid 
in 2009. To comply with this requirement, RBS Group has 
reduced its shareholding in the Group to 28.5% and must 
divest its entire interest by the end of 2014.

Appointment of Directors
The Company did not appoint any new members to the Board 
in 2013 as all Non-Executive Directors were appointed very 
recently. Mark Catton, who had been a Non-Executive Director 
until April, re-joined the Board as the nominated Director of RBS 
Group upon the resignation of RBS Group’s nominated Director 
Bruce Van Saun. The Group’s key competencies for Board 
members are as follows:
Experience
• Significant Board experience in major listed businesses 
(perceived as advantageous)
• Extensive knowledge and operational experience in insurance 
at a senior level (perceived as advantageous)
• Experience and appreciation of businesses with customer 
service at their core (perceived as advantageous)
• Likely to have had executive experience
Attributes
• Widely recognised as an individual of high repute and 
integrity who can rapidly gain Executive and Non-Executive 
colleagues’ respect and trust
• An independent thinker who is able to engage constructively 
and add real value to Board discussions
• Well organised and committed, an individual who takes  
his or her Non-Executive role seriously
• Robust, straight talking, open and approachable with  
a non-emotional and calm demeanour
• Supportive of the executive team while being able to 
challenge constructively
• A team player and a good listener with the style and ability  
to be a highly constructive member of the Board
• A sound understanding of the requirements of good public 
reporting and the ability to identify whether what is being 
presented in meetings stands up against reporting standards
• Strong communication and presentation skills, with the ability 
to get under the skin of the business and a strong desire to 
gain a deep understanding of what is going on in and around 
the Group
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 61
Governance Our Directors have had a considerable workload during 2013 
and showed great commitment to meeting the requirements of 
the business in a year of transformation. In all, 11 Board 
meetings were held during the year, all of which were 
scheduled meetings.
Board induction
On appointment, each Director takes part in a tailored 
induction programme, which is designed to give him or her  
an understanding of the Company’s business, governance and 
shareholders. Mark Catton resigned as Non-Executive Director 
in April 2013 and was subsequently re-appointed in October 
2013. As there was only a short time between his resignation 
and re-appointment, it was not considered necessary for Mark 
Catton to undergo an additional induction programme on his 
re-appointment.
Resources and training provided to the Board
The Chairman, with the aid of the Company Secretary,  
ensures that the Board is kept abreast of any changes in  
the legal and regulatory environment in which the business 
operates. The Company believes it is crucial to provide 
Directors with adequate resources and training, and devoted 
considerable time during the year to ensure that all Directors 
received training and education to help them understand their 
duties, responsibilities and develop knowledge of the business 
as quickly as possible. These sessions were developed  
to supplement the comprehensive technical acclimatisation 
programme conducted in 2012 and specifically to meet the 
needs of the Directors, with individual Directors provided  
with bespoke training, as indicated in the following diagram.
Corporate governance report continued
The selection procedure included a number of interviews  
and meetings with existing Board members. The Company 
also obtained a range of references for each candidate.
The Nomination Committee will adopt an approach modelled 
on this selection procedure for future appointments.
Duration of appointment
The Directors may appoint additional members to the Board 
during the year. Subsequently, in accordance with a provision 
of the Code and the Company’s Articles of Association,  
the Group submits Directors for re-election on an annual  
basis, subject to the Group’s independence criteria where 
appropriate, ongoing commitment to Group activities and 
satisfactory performance.
In line with these arrangements, all Directors will be subject  
to re-election by shareholders at our Annual General Meeting 
(“AGM”) on 15 May 2014.
Non-Executive Directors are normally expected to serve two 
fixed terms of three years, but may be invited to serve a third 
term of three years.
Commitment from Board members
All our Directors, including the Chairman, have indicated  
that they are able to allocate sufficient time to the work of the 
Group to enable them to discharge their respective duties and 
responsibilities effectively. Directors’ appointment letters contain 
a provision to this effect.
Our 2013 training and education programme included
Internal sessions focusing on 
the following topics
Site visits External training sessions
• Strategy and change 
• Risk appetite, compliance risk  
and capital management
• Capital modelling, ICAS+ and

Group’s divisions and functions, were held. In addition, the Non-Executive Directors had a number  
of meetings with members of the Executive committee throughout the year.
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 62 Board effectiveness review
Review of the effectiveness of the Board and its Committees
We conducted our first Board effectiveness review in 2013  
to evaluate the effectiveness of the Board, its six committees 
and individual Directors. The evaluation process was initiated 
by the Chairman and facilitated by Edis-Bates Associates 
Limited, an independent corporate governance consultancy, 
with no other connection with the Company. 
Each of the Company’s Executive and Non-Executive Directors, 
together with the General Counsel and Company Secretary, 
participated in the effectiveness review process, which 
involved questionnaires, one-to-one interviews and a review  
of Board processes.
The process took place between September and December 
2013. The review of the Board included:
• the role of the Board (including Directors’ input into group 
strategy and risk management);
• information provided to Directors (including induction, 
continuing professional development and familiarity with 
group businesses); 
• people issues (including Directors’ skills, Board and 
committee composition, diversity, succession planning  
and time commitment); and
• Board environment and processes (including working 
relationships, Board papers and Board support).
Similar themes were raised in relation to the Board’s 
committees, as well as committee-specific questions.
Following the conclusion of the evaluation process, the 
responses and comments were analysed and summarised  
in a report. The report was discussed initially with the 
Chairman and then circulated to the full Board. The report 
concluded that the Board is operating effectively.
The Chairman held one-to-one meetings with each of the  
other Directors, providing them with feedback on their 
performance and contributions. Feedback on his own 
performance and contribution was provided by the Senior 
Independent Director, who had previously held discussions  
with the remaining Non-Executive Directors.
Based on the Board effectiveness review report, the Directors 
are satisfied that the Board has operated effectively during 
2013. The Board considered the review in the December 
Board meeting and matters arising from the report will be 
further considered and where appropriate actions will be 
implemented in 2014.
Direct Line Group’s approach to diversity
The Board carefully considered the diversity of its members 
from a variety of perspectives and sought to ensure that 
Directors had the relevant range of knowledge, skills, experience 
and, where necessary, independence to help the Group deliver 
its strategy.
As the composition of the Board shows, with three of its  
nine members being women, the Company is committed  
to the merits of diversity. However, whilst the Board will take 
care to consider gender diversity of its members when selecting  
new members, it is committed to appointing the most 
appropriate candidate and therefore no targets have been  
set against which to report.
To improve the governance of our gender-diversity programme, 
the Company has included an appropriate remit in the terms  
of reference of the Nomination Committee. In this, diversity, 
including gender diversity, features as one of the criteria for  
the selection of Directors to the Board. Further information 
regarding this diversity policy may be found in the Nomination 
Committee report on page 72.
Also, the Corporate Social Responsibility Committee

Governance Accountability
Financial and business reporting
The Board is responsible for providing shareholders with a fair, 
balanced and understandable assessment of the Company’s 
position and prospects.
An explanation from the Directors of their responsibility for 
preparing the financial statements is set out in the statement  
of Directors’ responsibilities on page 103. The statement by  
our auditors explaining their responsibilities is on page 107.
We meet specific responsibilities placed on the Board under 
the provisions of the Code as follows:
• an explanation of how the Company generates value over 
the long term is included within the business model on page 
6 and the strategy for delivering Company objectives on 
page 18;
• how the Board has concluded that the business remains  
a going concern is discussed on page 102;
• the arrangements established by the Board for the 
application of risk management and internal control 
principles are detailed below; and
• the Board has delegated to the Audit Committee oversight  
of the management of the relationship with the Company’s 
auditors. The Audit Committee report on page 65 provides 
details of its role, activities and relationship with the internal 
and external auditors.
Risk management and internal control system
The Board acknowledges that it has overall responsibility  
for the Group’s risk management and internal control system, 
and has complied with the Code by establishing a continuous 
process for identifying, evaluating and managing the 
significant risks the Group faces. This process includes  
risks arising from social, environmental and ethical matters.
The Group’s risk assessment process includes output from  
a system for reporting on all the significant risks that stand  
in the way of achieving Group objectives. The system also 
reports on the nature and effectiveness of the controls and  
other management processes that manage these risks. The 
system also sets risk appetites for key categories of quantifiable 
risk. It additionally encompasses self-assessment of controls  
by risk owners throughout the Group, whose assertions are 
independently challenged by the 2nd line of defence and  
3rd line of defence.
The Board Risk Committee regularly reviews significant risks, 
their potential impact on the Group’s financial position, 
variations from agreed risk appetites and the actions taken  
to manage those risks.
Internal systems of control 
The Board has put in place a management structure  
with defined lines of responsibility and clear delegation of 
authority. This control framework cascades down through the 
divisions and central functions, showing clear responsibilities 
for ensuring that appropriate controls are in place at an 
operational level, including those that relate to the financial 
reporting process.
The Group Audit function supports the Board by providing  
an independent and objective assurance of the adequacy  
and effectiveness of the Group’s operations. It brings a 
systematic and disciplined approach to evaluating and 
improving the effectiveness of its risk management, control  
and governance frameworks and processes.
The Directors are aware that any system of internal control  
is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of  
failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide 
reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or financial loss.
The Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, regularly  
reviews the effectiveness of the Group internal control systems. 
Its monitoring covers all material controls, based principally on 
reviewing reports from management, the Group Audit function 
and external auditors, so that it may consider how to manage 
or mitigate risk in line with the Group’s risk strategy. The 
Committee did not identify or report any serious failings  
or weaknesses to the Board in 2013.
Remuneration
The Board has delegated responsibility to the Remuneration 
Committee for the remuneration arrangements of the Executive 
Directors and senior executives of the Group. Please refer to 
the Directors’ remuneration report on page 76.

and in our reporting

• Considering the potential rotation of the auditor
Frequency of meetings
During 2013, the Committee met on seven occasions,  
six of which were scheduled meetings, and one was an ad 
hoc meeting. The members’ attendance record is set out on  
the previous page.
Committee expertise
Committee members bring considerable financial and 
accounting experience to the Committee’s work. All members 
have past employment experience in either finance or 
accounting roles, or comparable experience in corporate 
activities, and are members of the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants in England and Wales.
The Board is satisfied that each of these members has recent 
and relevant financial experience, as recommended by  
the Code.
Reports to the Board
The Chair of the Committee submits a report to the subsequent 
scheduled meeting of the Board on the Committee’s work.
Financial reporting control framework
RBS Group’s shareholding in the Company fell to below 50% 
in March 2013. Prior to this, the Group had been operating  
a formal financial control framework including identification, 
cataloguing and testing of controls in line with requirements  
set out by SOX legislation. Following divestment, this no  
longer applied to the Group. However, as good governance 
practice, the Group has continued to adopt the embedded 
features of the existing SOX framework, albeit tailored to 
respond to the changes in the business control environment.
In formulating the approach for the new framework, the 
principles from the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations  
of the Treadway Commission framework have been followed. 
The approach aligns with our existing operational risk 
framework with assurance work undertaken across the business 
focusing on our key financial reporting controls. Reports are 
presented to the Committee every six months highlighting any 
deficiencies and mitigating action required.
Internal control
Group Audit carries out independent internal audit work.
The Group Head of Audit reports to the Chair of the  
Audit Committee and has functional reporting to the  
Chief Financial Officer.
Group Audit provides the Committee with independent  
and objective reports on the appropriateness, effectiveness 
and sustainability of the Group’s risk management, systems  
of internal control, governance frameworks and processes.  
The Group’s statement of internal controls can be found  
on page 64.
The key control issues that Group Audit reports to management 
and to the Committee are monitored on a quarterly basis with 
the aim of ensuring the related risk exposures have been 
properly mitigated.
Reserves
The Committee approves annual plans for reviews of reserves, 
informed by internal and external emerging issues. It also 
considers an appropriate balance between internal and 
external actuarial review. Consultants appointed to provide 
validation of actuarial reviews are subject to approval by  
the Committee. During the year, an open tender process was 
conducted and the Committee approved the appointment  
of a professional services company to carry out the external 
actuarial review for the year ended 31 December 2013.
At least half-yearly, the Committee reviews and challenges  
the key assumptions and judgements, the emerging trends, 
movements and analysis of uncertainties underlying the 
assessment of the actuarial best estimate reviews.
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 66 Simultaneously with this review, the Committee also considers 
and challenges the appropriateness of proposals made by  
the Chief Financial Officer for management best estimate 
reserves for booking, informed both by actuarial analysis, 
wider commercial and risk management insights and principles 
of consistency from period to period. 
Following their review of actuarial best estimate and 
management best estimate reserves, the Committee proposes 
the respective reserves to the Board.
Financial reporting
The review process undertaken by the Committee prior to  
the publication of the Group’s financial statements focuses  
on the Group’s critical accounting policies and practices,  
and on any changes and decisions that require a major 
element of judgement, unusual transactions, clarity of 
disclosures and significant audit adjustments. In addition,  
the Committee reviews the going concern assumption, 
compliance with accounting standards and obligations  
under applicable laws, regulations and governance codes  
and makes appropriate recommendations to the Board.
In addition to the focus on matters relating to reserving, issues 
considered by the Committee in 2013 and the judgements that 
were made included:
• the overall presentation of the financial statements to ensure 
fairness and balance and, in particular, the presentation of 
adjusted performance, including the appropriateness of 
restructuring and other one-off costs;
• reports on the assumptions underlying the provisions made 
for redundancy and onerous leases;
• the assessments made for goodwill impairment and 
confirmed the carrying value remained supportable;
• the judgements made in respect of tax, in particular the 
carrying value of any deferred tax assets and liabilities 
recognised; and
• the carrying value of the investments held by the Group  
and the need for any impairment provisions.
External audit
The Committee plays a key role in managing the relationship 
with the Group’s external auditor, Deloitte LLP. The external 
auditor provides some non-audit services, primarily in the 
provision of audit-related assurance services. The Group’s  
Audit / Non-Audit Services Minimum Standard ensures that  
the independence and objectivity of the external auditor are 
not impaired.
Both audit and non-audit services provided by the Group’s 
external auditor are closely monitored:
• the Committee formally approves a list of audit and non-audit 
services in advance of each financial year in line with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standard 5;
• all permitted services must be approved before any work 
commences and applications for approval must be submitted 
on a prescribed form, signed by the relevant member of the 
Executive Committee;
• the Chair of the Committee approves non-audit services 
costing less than £100,000, while the Committee approves 
services costing £100,000 or more; and
• the Committee receives an annual report on all services 
provided during the year and their related costs.
The Committee will review annually and where appropriate 
recommend updates to the Minimum Standard to ensure 
alignment with the latest standards and practice in establishing, 
maintaining and monitoring the independence and objectivity 
of auditors.
The key issues and areas of focus during 2013 
The external auditor provided updates to the Committee on the 
following key issues during 2013:
• reserve valuation;
• investment valuation;
• reinsurance asset valuation;
• revenue recognition; 
• transformation projects; and
• planned migration of the Group’s IT systems to the 
Capgemini platform.
Fees payable to the auditor
During the year ended 31 December 2013, Deloitte LLP’s  
fees for audit services and other services supplied were  
£2.2 million.
In accordance with the Group’s Audit / Non-Audit Services 
Minimum Standard, all services were approved prior to work 
commencing and each of the non-audit services was confirmed 
to be permissible for the external auditor to undertake. The 
Committee approved fees of £0.1 million payable to Deloitte 
LLP for services not related to audit work, which accounted for 
4.5% of total fees paid to the external auditor in the year.
A breakdown of fees paid to the auditor for the year ended 
31 December 2013 is set out below:
Total fees for audit and other services £2.2 million
Audit fees £2.1 million 95.5%
Non-audit fees £0.1 million 4.5%
The non-audit fees of £0.1 million related to audit-related 
assurance services.
The Committee and Board remain satisfied that the provision  
of non-audit services by Deloitte LLP has not compromised 
Deloitte’s independence as the Company’s external auditor.
Auditor performance and independence
The performance of the external auditor is assessed every  
year, including its independence and objectivity and the 
effectiveness of the external audit process. The effectiveness 
review includes regular questioning of the external auditor 
during Committee meetings.
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 67
Governance Committee reports continued
The Committee reviews the external audit plan and receives 
reports from Deloitte LLP on its own policies and procedures 
regarding independence and quality control, including an 
annual confirmation of independence in line with industry 
standards. The Committee concluded that the performance  
of the external auditor and the effectiveness of the audit 
process were satisfactory.
Re-appointment of auditor
The Committee intends to undertake a formal review  
on a regular basis to assess whether the external audit  
should be re-tendered. Deloitte LLP, the external auditor,  
has been the Group’s auditor since 2000. Prior to listing in 
2012, the Group was audited as a division of RBS Group.
The Committee is recommending to the Board that Deloitte  
LLP be re-appointed as auditor of the Company. A resolution 
for the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as auditor of the 
Company will be put to a shareholder vote at the AGM  
on 15 May 2014.
The new UK Corporate Governance Code requires FTSE  
350 companies to put the audit services contract out to  
tender at least once every 10 years, to enable the Committee 
to compare the quality and effectiveness of the services 
provided by the incumbent auditor with those of other audit 
firms. Transitional arrangements provided by the Financial 
Reporting Council (“FRC”) indicate the Company should  
tender the audit, at the latest, at the time of the next audit 
partner rotation. The latter is currently scheduled following  
the 2015 year end.
We may, however, put the audit out to tender at any  
time before this date. There are no contractual obligations  
restricting our choice of external auditor and no auditor  
liability agreement has been entered into. Equally, any 
recommendation to re-appoint Deloitte LLP as auditor of the 
Company is dependent on continued satisfactory performance.
Evaluation of the Committee
The annual evaluation of the Committee’s effectiveness  
was initiated by the Chairman of the Board and undertaken  
by Edis-Bates Associates, as external facilitators. The evaluation 
concluded that the Committee continued to operate effectively, 
and the Committee will consider the results and recommended 
actions resulting from the evaluation in 2014. Further details  
of the effectiveness review can be found on page 63.
This report was reviewed and approved by the Board on 
25 February 2014.

What will we be focusing on in 2014?
In addition to its regular monitoring, challenge and oversight 
responsibilities, the focus for the Committee in 2014 is 
expected to include the following: 
• Finalising the appropriate combination of assets and  
the use of derivatives, if deemed appropriate, to back  
the Group’s long-term liabilities (PPOs) with the benefit of  
the November 2013 European agreement on Omnibus II 
(Solvency II)
• Within the Board’s risk appetite, seeking to reduce further  
the excess liquidity above stressed requirements within  
the U K Insurance Limited portfolio and reinvesting this in  
assets offering an illiquidity premium and / or better risk 
adjusted returns
• Monitoring the pace of economic recovery and the  
tapering of quantitative easing and the resulting impact  
on interest rates, credit spreads and asset values and then 
reviewing the implications for the positioning of the Group’s 
investment portfolio
• Receiving an asset and liability management study covering 
the investment portfolios of the International division
Evaluation of the Committee
The annual evaluation of the Committee’s effectiveness  
was initiated by the Chairman of the Board and undertaken  
by Edis-Bates Associates, as external facilitators. The evaluation 
concluded that the Committee continued to operate effectively 
and the Committee will consider the results and recommended 
actions resulting from the evaluation in 2014. Further details  
of the effectiveness review can be found on page 63.
This report was reviewed and approved by the Board on

Frequency of meetings
The Committee meets at least once a year to consider the

and to consider the suitability of all Directors standing for 
re-election at the AGM. The Committee will also meet as 
required to consider candidates for appointment to the Board.
Changes to the Board
Mark Catton resigned from the Board on 25 April 2013 when 
RBS Group reduced its shareholding in Direct Line Group below 
50%, whereupon RBS Group’s entitlement to nominate Directors 
under the Relationship Agreement with the Company reduced 
from two to one. Mr Catton rejoined the Board on 1 October 
2013 when Bruce Van Saun resigned in order take up an 
appointment with RBS Group in America. As RBS Group are 
entitled to nominate a Director to the Board under the terms of 
their Relationship Agreement with the Company, it was not 
appropriate to engage an external search agency nor to use 
Note:
1. Attendance is expressed as the number of meetings attended out of the

Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 72 open advertising to fill the vacancy on Mr Van Saun’s  
resignation. Mr Catton will step down as a Director when  
RBS Group’s holding in the Company falls below 20%.
Board Appointment and Reappointment Process
No new Directors were appointed during 2013. The Committee 
does, however, have a pre-established Board appointment 
process. It includes the use of independent external search 
consultants, an evaluation of the balance of skills, diversity, 
independence and knowledge on the Board and establishment 
of target criteria for the appointment of new Directors. Details of 
the latter are shown on page 61 of this Report.
In advance of the proposed re-election of Directors at the  
2013 AGM, the Committee reviewed the independent status  
of Non-Executive Directors. It was concluded that Ms Hanson,  
Mr Jones, Mr Palmer, Ms Thompson and Ms Vacassin were 
independent within the meaning of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. Mr Biggs was independent on his appointment as 
Chairman. Mr Van Saun and Mr Catton, being RBS Group 
nominated Directors, did not meet the independence criteria  
of the Code though both had demonstrated a sufficient level  
of Board challenge to be considered independent in character 
and by judgement. Accordingly, it was recommended to the 
Board and Shareholders that all serving Directors be re-
appointed at the 2013 AGM.
Diversity
The Group seeks to hire the best candidates for all positions at 
all levels throughout the business, irrespective of gender, including 
candidates at Board level. With three female independent 
Non-Executive Directors, 33% of the current Board is female, 
which is a greater percentage than that recommended by the 
Davies’ Report on Boardroom Diversity. However, both the 
Nomination Committee and Board recognise the benefits of 
gender diversity and will ensure that this is taken into account 
when considering any particular appointment. Accordingly, this 
is embedded in the Nomination Committee’s terms of reference. 
Work on encouraging the promotion of women to senior and 
executive management roles within the business will continue.
Please refer to page 63 for the Group’s approach to diversity, 
including gender diversity.
Terms of reference
As part of the annual review, the Committee recommended  
to the Board revisions to its terms of reference.
Evaluation of the Committee
The annual evaluation of the Committee’s effectiveness was 
initiated by me as Chairman, and undertaken by Edis-Bates 
Associates as external facilitators. The evaluation concluded that 
the Committee has not since the IPO had to deal with the usual 
workload of such a committee, given the short period since the 
IPO. In addition, the only changes to the Board in 2013 were 
changes to the RBS Group-nominated Directors, which RBS 
Group was entitled to do pursuant to the Relationship Agreement 
between RBS Group and the Company. One of the actions 
arising from the Nomination Committee performance evaluation 
was the need for greater focus on succession planning, which has 
been incorporated in the Committee’s forward agenda for 2014.
This report was reviewed and approved by the Board on  
25 February 2014.

Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 74 What are we focusing on in 2014?
We will continue to provide detailed disclosures on the  
Group’s financial performance and strategic plans and host  
a number of events to foster engagement. The Group 
recognises the importance of maintaining an active dialogue 
with our shareholders, target investors and other important 
insurance sector investors. Planned activities for 2014 include:
Note:
1. The conferences where the Chief Executive Officer gave a brief presentation 
to all delegates
Relations with shareholders
We consider that actively engaging with our shareholders is 
fundamental to our business. We believe that ensuring an active 
dialogue and ongoing engagement is vital to keeping in touch 
with opinions, providing us with the opportunity to address any 
questions and concerns in a proactive way.
The Executive Directors frequently meet with investors. The 
Chairman, Senior Independent Director and Non-Executive 
Directors are available to attend meetings with major shareholders 
at the shareholders’ request so that they have the opportunity to 
discuss governance and strategy with shareholders and ensure 
that any particular shareholder views are communicated to the 
Board. The Board is also kept aware of shareholder views by 
the Company’s corporate brokers who regularly attend Board 
meetings for this purpose.
The Board is also given the opportunity to understand the views of 
major shareholders through analysts’ reports and broker briefings.

What arrangements are we making for the  
Annual General Meeting?
The Notice of the AGM will be sent to shareholders well  
in advance of the meeting. We will propose all items requiring 
shareholder approval under separate resolutions.
We will provide proxy appointment forms for each resolution,  
with the option for shareholders to vote for, or against, or  
to withhold their vote. We have instructed our registrars, 
Computershare Investor Services plc, to ensure that all valid  
proxy appointments are properly recorded and counted.
We will announce the result of the poll as soon as practical  
after the meeting and also post the result on our website after  
that date. The proxy form and announcement of the results 
explicitly state that a vote withheld is not a vote in law and  
will therefore not be counted in the calculation when deciding 
whether the resolution has been passed.
We anticipate that all Directors will attend the AGM and  
that the Chairs of the Audit, Board Risk, Corporate Social 
Responsibility, Investment, Nomination and Remuneration 
Committees will be available to answer questions.
What is the procedure at the AGM?
Following presentations by members of the Board, voting  
on the resolutions at the AGM will be conducted on a poll. 
Shareholders’ proxy votes can be submitted electronically 
through the Company Registrar’s website. Further details  
can be found in the Notice of AGM.

Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 75
Governance Directors’ remuneration report
Priscilla Vacassin, Chair of the Remuneration Committee
Dear shareholder
I welcome you to our second remuneration report. In an 
important year for Direct Line Insurance Group plc, our first  
full year as a listed company, the Remuneration Committee 
(“Committee”) has sought to ensure that we continue to provide 
a reward proposition that supports the Group’s business 
strategy and is fair to our employees and our shareholders 
alike in the context of our overall performance.
As a Group, we continue to make good progress against  
both our strategic priorities and financial targets and have 
delivered on our COR target in 2013, which has resulted in  
a RoTE in excess of our long-term target, and have delivered  
a Total Shareholder Return of 24% over the financial year.  
At the same time, we are conscious of the need to exercise 
restraint in executive pay given the current economic 
environment and our cost savings initiatives. These factors  
have been reflected in our remuneration decisions as set out  
in full in this remuneration report and highlighted below.
Linking remuneration to overall business objectives  
– looking back to what we did in 2013
We remain committed to ensuring that Executive Directors  
are appropriately incentivised to deliver superior long-term 
business performance and that they will receive their full 
remuneration opportunity only when material value has  
been created for shareholders.
To that extent, we have carefully considered the 2013  
bonus outcome under the Annual Incentive Plan (“AIP”) to 
ensure that payouts are appropriate and reflect a rounded 
assessment of performance. The initial AIP outcome is based 
on a balanced scorecard in line with our approach last year. 
In addition, recognising both the complexity of the business 
and that assessment of success, particularly in an insurance 
group, requires the application of broader judgement than  
a simple application of the audited results, the Committee 
considers it appropriate to look at the wider factors of Group 
performance and exercise its judgement to better reflect the 
overall position. For 2013, it exercised such judgement by 
applying a quality of earnings assessment of the financial 
elements and a gateway assessment for all AIP elements,  
as described in more detail in the annual remuneration section  
of this report. In addition, overriding judgement based on each 
executive’s performance was taken into account. The Committee 
will continue to use such judgement in future years. In respect 
of 2013, this resulted in a lower payout than would have been 
the case under a more formulaic approach.
The resulting bonus award of 63% of the maximum  
bonus potential to Paul Geddes and 60% of the maximum 
bonus potential to John Reizenstein are therefore broadly  
at the on-target level of performance. We believe that this  
level of payout is appropriate and that it demonstrates  
that our remuneration policy effectively aligns pay with 
underlying performance.
The first awards under our 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan 
(“LTIP”) were made only following the IPO in October 2012 
and are not due to vest until 2015. Awards vesting under 
legacy RBS plans are described in the annual remuneration 
section of the report.
Looking forward to 2014 – what we have decided
In the context of the new requirements for executive pay 
reporting in the UK, the Committee took the opportunity  
to review our approach to remuneration and the associated 
policies put in place at the time of the IPO to ensure that,  
after their first full year of operation, they continue to support 
our strategic objectives.
As part of this review, we have not proposed any major 
changes to the policy for 2014; however, we have reached 
specific decisions as to how this policy will apply in the  
future in order to enhance its effectiveness, fairness between 
executives and other stakeholders and transparency for our 
shareholders. The section of this remuneration report describing 
how we intend to implement our remuneration policy following 
approval at the 2014 AGM explains this further.
I would like to highlight the following areas:
• as in 2013, and in line with our commitment to exercise 
restraint in executive pay, there will be no increase to 
Executive Directors’ salaries in 2014
• the approach to measuring performance under the AIP  
in 2014 will be similar to that followed in 2013 and the 
Committee will continue to apply judgement in assessing 
payouts. Additional financial and non-financial indicators 
will be considered which will include forward-looking  
metrics as opposed to purely historical ones
• we are not proposing any changes to the performance 
measures for 2014 awards under the 2012 LTIP and we 
will continue the practice of making LTIP awards twice a 
year at the same levels as during 2013, subject to stretching 
performance targets over each award’s performance period
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 76 Our shareholder register has changed significantly in the  
year since IPO, following a further disposal of shares by  
RBS Group. As a consequence I, as the Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee, jointly with the Chairman of the 
Board contacted our major institutional shareholders, as well  
as the ABI and Institutional Shareholder Services, and we 
made ourselves available to discuss our remuneration policy.
Structure of remuneration report
We have made some changes to the order in which this  
year’s remuneration report is presented, in line with the  
new regime for the reporting of executive pay in the UK.
Accordingly, over the following pages we have set out:
• our forward-looking Directors’ remuneration policy which  
is subject to a binding shareholder vote at our 2014  
AGM; and
• our annual remuneration report setting out the details of the 
implementation of our reward policy in 2013 and how the 
proposed remuneration policy will be implemented in 2014. 
This section of the report is subject to an advisory vote at our 
2014 AGM.
In preparing the disclosures on our forward-looking policy,  
we have sought to balance the need to give our shareholders 
sufficient information to be able to evaluate it with the need  
to maintain sufficient operational flexibility over pay to allow  
us to respond to changing circumstances. 
I hope that you will find this report informative and accessible 
and I welcome any feedback you may have.
Priscilla Vacassin, Chair of the Remuneration Committee
Questions and answers on our executive 
remuneration policy in the first full financial 
year of listing since the IPO
1
Q Why do Executive Directors (and other senior executives) 
need to be paid bonuses on top of their salary and  
other benefits?
When we listed in October 2012, we set out our commitment 
to offer remuneration at the right cost, while ensuring that we 
provide Executive Directors with market-competitive rewards 
compared with relevant peer companies. Variable pay in  
the form of short and long-term incentives forms a significant 
proportion of total remuneration in the market in which we 
compete for executive talent and including this as part of  
our remuneration offering gives us the ability to attract the  
right calibre of executives without the need to increase  
fixed remuneration. 
At the same time, in line with our value to ‘aim higher’ and 
strive to be the best in everything we do, we actively want  
to motivate Executive Directors and other senior executives, 
incentivise the delivery of strong performance and recognise 
and reward success at the individual and Group level. Our  
AIP is just one of many tools used throughout the business (and 
not just at senior executive level) to achieve these objectives.
Finally, having a high proportion of our total remuneration 
dependent on the achievement of stretching performance 
targets (through both the AIP and the LTIP) enables us to 
manage our costs appropriately by ensuring that the total 
expenditure on executive pay appropriately reflects 
performance at both the individual and Group level.  
The context of the external market environment is also taken 
into account. This would not be possible if our executive 
remuneration package comprised only fixed elements of pay.
Q How were 2013 bonuses determined for the  
Executive Directors?
We started by setting a range of measures and targets 
reflecting the Committee’s assessment of what success  
would look like against the business plans set by the Board. 
Following the year-end, the Committee undertook a quantitative 
assessment of performance against the financial measures 
included within the AIP, and an assessment of performance 
against all other measures including each individual’s personal 
objectives. This assessment simply determined the initial 
outcomes under the AIP; however, no payments were approved 
until after the Remuneration Committee carried out a quality of 
earnings assessment of the financial elements and a ‘gateway 
assessment’ for all AIP outcomes.
The gateway criteria used by the Committee included factors 
such as affordability, the Group’s overall performance against 
the agreed risk profile, performance relative to peers, the 
occurrence of any regulatory breaches or reputational damage, 
whether the payment of any bonus may give rise to reputational 
damage and the wider economic environment. The Committee 
also considered whether there were any exceptional events or 
other factors that should be taken into account in assessing  
the bonus outcome.
Note:
1. This section and the Group remuneration policy on page 79 are not subject 
to the binding vote on remuneration policy. 
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 77
Governance Directors’ remuneration report continued
The quality of earnings and gateway assessments resulted  
in the reduction of the initial bonus outcome for Executive 
Directors as explained on pages 94.
For both Executive Directors, 40% of the bonus awarded will  
be deferred in Company shares for a period of three years. 
This is in line with the approach followed for all our strategic 
leaders (around 60 of our most senior executives, including 
Executive Committee members, who are responsible for 
developing and executing Group strategy).
Q How can you justify paying bonuses to Executive Directors 
when at the same time you are going through cost reduction 
initiatives and making redundancies?
Making redundancies is a tough decision; however, we 
sometimes need to take steps like this, to make the business 
sustainable in the long run and remain competitive. Where 
possible, we are managing redundancy decisions through 
redeployment and support. Our aim is to treat respectfully  
and fairly all those affected.
In this context, the Committee aims to ensure that employees, 
including Executive Directors, are continuously engaged to 
deliver against our plan and are provided with fair pay for the 
job, which takes into account the context of pay in the wider 
market as well as their individual performance. It is also vital to 
ensure that we continue to pay competitively, at all levels.
As discussed elsewhere, the Committee has exercised its 
judgement in determining the final bonus levels to reduce  
the amount of AIP awards to the Executive Directors for  
2013, to reflect its qualitative assessment of performance 
during the year.
Q Why are you paying bonuses to Executive Directors  
when gross written premium has reduced in 2013?
As explained elsewhere in the annual report, the reduction  
in gross written premiums reflects the impact of a competitive 
market, particularly in UK motor, and our decision to maintain 
a cautious underwriting approach by emphasising underwriting 
margins over volume.
Gross written premium is just one of the set of metrics that  
we consider when assessing our business performance. 
Overall, we believe that good progress has been made  
across a range of financial and non-financial metrics and  
these determined the final bonus for Executive Directors.
Q Why are the Executive Directors still receiving shares  
under RBS Group Long-Term Incentive Plans?
In line with other Group employees previously granted  
awards under RBS Employee Share Plans, Paul Geddes and 
John Reizenstein continue to hold awards granted under the 
RBS Group Long-Term Incentive Plans (“RBS Group LTIP”) and 
the RBS Group Deferral Plan granted prior to the IPO.
It has been agreed with RBS that awards granted under the 
RBS Group LTIP in 2011 and 2012 will now be delivered in 
the form of Direct Line Insurance Group plc shares transferred 
by RBS Group, to the extent that the original performance 
conditions have been met. This ensures maximum alignment 
with the performance of Direct Line Group. Awards granted 
under the RBS Group Deferral Plan will continue to be 
delivered in RBS Group shares.
These awards were granted to the Executive Directors in 
respect of their work as executives of RBS Insurance, as the 
Group was previously known when it was wholly owned by 
RBS Group. The extent to which awards under the RBS Group 
LTIP vest is determined by the Remuneration Committee of RBS 
Group based on an assessment against the performance 
conditions shown on page 99 of this remuneration report.  
RBS Group deferred awards are not subject to any 
performance conditions, as they represent the deferral  
element of annual bonuses that have already been earned.
Q Do you comply with the provisions of the  
FCA’s Remuneration Code?
As an insurance business, we are not subject to the provisions 
of the FCA’s Remuneration Code. However, we seek to comply 
with the core requirements of the Code that we should 
establish, implement and maintain remuneration policies, 
procedures and practices that are consistent with and promote 
sound and effective risk management. Accordingly, for all of 
our strategic leaders including Executive Directors, significant 
elements of incentive-related pay are subject to deferral and 
potential malus and clawback as explained further within the 
remuneration report. In addition, the independence of our 
control functions is maintained by assessing their annual 
bonuses independently of the Group financial results.
Although not impacting Directors’ pay, separately, following  
the publication of the FCA’s guidance on risks to customers 
from financial incentives, we have reviewed our remuneration 
systems for customer-facing employees to ensure that they are 
fit-for-purpose and that the risk of mis-selling and other risks 
identified by the FCA are appropriately managed. The 
Remuneration Committee and the Board Risk Committee 
contributed to (and reviewed the outcome of) this assessment. 
This forms the basis of an ongoing joint review. Our initial 
assessment concluded that our existing plans were broadly 
compliant and that evolutionary changes, where necessary, 
will take effect from 2014.
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 78 Introduction
The remuneration report has been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and  
The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013  
(the “Regulations”). The Company also complies with the  
UK Corporate Governance Code in relation to remuneration.
Directors’ remuneration policy
The following section contains the material required to be set 
out as the Directors’ remuneration policy for the purposes of 
Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended). 
This policy will be put forward for shareholder approval at the 
2014 AGM in accordance with section 439A of the 
Companies Act 2006 and, on approval, will take effect 
immediately following the 2014 AGM.
Context of policy
The Group’s remuneration policy is to provide, in the  
context of the Group’s business strategy, a compelling reward 
proposition at the right cost to attract, retain, motivate and 
reward high-calibre employees so that they are engaged  
to deliver superior long-term business performance within 
acceptable risk parameters.
The remuneration policy guides the design and  
implementation of reward programmes in the Group  
that are market competitive and aligned to business  
objectives, both financial and non-financial.
Within this overall policy, the individual elements of remuneration for Executive Directors are shown below:
All employee share plans
Base salary, pension & benefits
Annual Incentive Plan
Cash
Financial, customer and other strategic and  
personal objectives
RoTE and relative Total Shareholder Return

to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity Performance measures
Base salary • This is the core element  
of pay that reflects the 
individual’s role and position 
within the Group and is 
payable for doing the 
expected day-to-day job
• Ensuring we are competitive 
in the market allows us to 
attract, retain and motivate 
high calibre executives  
with the skill sets to achieve 
our key aims while 
managing costs
• Base salaries are reviewed annually and set in April of each year, although the Committee 
may undertake an out-of-cycle review if it determines that this is appropriate
• Salaries are typically reviewed against:
 – level of skill, experience and scope of responsibilities, individual and business 
performance, economic climate and market conditions;
 – the median market pay in the context of insurance peers and companies of a similar size, 
particularly FTSE 31-100 companies being companies which are considered to be 
reflective of the size and complexity of the Group; and
 – general base salary movement across the Group.
• The Committee does not strictly follow data but uses it as a reference point in considering,  
in its judgement, the appropriate level having regard to other relevant factors including 
corporate and individual performance and any changes in an individual’s role  
and responsibilities
• The principles for setting base salary are similar to those applied to other employees in the 
Group, although the specific benchmarking groups used to review external market relativities 
may differ across employee groups
• Base salary is paid monthly
• The Committee has determined that  
its policy will be to only set base salaries  
by reference to the factors set out in  
the previous column for the duration  
of this policy. In any event no increase  
will be made if it would take an Executive 
Director’s salary above the median  
level of salaries for relevant roles in the  
FTSE 100 as determined using data 
available to the Committee at or shortly  
prior to when any increase is considered
• Where salary increases are awarded,  
the Committee will have regard to the 
increase being awarded to employees  
within the Group more generally, as well  
as the other factors outlined in this table 
under ‘Operation’
• Not applicable
Annual 
Incentive Plan 
(the “AIP”)
• To motivate executives  
and incentivise delivery  
of performance over  
a one-year operating cycle, 
focusing on the short to 
medium-term elements of  
our strategic aims
• For Executive Directors, at least 40% of the award is deferred into shares under the Deferred 
Annual Incentive Plan (the “DAIP”) typically vesting three years after grant (with deferred 
awards also capable of being settled in cash). The remainder of the award is paid in cash 
following year-end
• The percentage deferred and the terms of deferral will be kept under review by the 
Committee to ensure that levels are in line with regulatory requirements and best practice 
and may be changed in future years but will not, in the view of the Committee, be changed 
to be less onerous overall
• Malus and clawback provisions apply to both the cash and deferred elements and are 
explained in more detail in the notes to the policy table
• Maximum and target bonus levels for 
Executive Directors are set by reference  
to practice at other insurance and  
general market comparators
• The maximum bonus level potential  
under the AIP is 175% of base salary  
per annum. The current maximum bonus  
level applying for each individual Executive 
Director is shown in the statement of 
implementation of policy in 2014 section  
of the annual remuneration report
• Performance over the financial year is assessed against performance measures which the 
Committee considers to be appropriate
• These may be financial, non-financial (Group, divisional or business line) and individual.  
Each year, at least 50% of the bonus is based on financial measures. The remainder of the 
bonus will be based on a combination of non-financial and individual performance measures
• Targets are set at the beginning of each financial year by the Committee
• No more than 10% of the bonus is paid for threshold performance (30% for the individual 
performance element). No more than 60% of the maximum opportunity pays out for target 
performance. However, the Committee retains flexibility to amend the level of payout at 
different levels of performance for future bonus cycles based on its assessment of the  
level of stretch inherent in the targets that have been set and will disclose any such 
determinations appropriately
• Before any payment can be made, the Committee will perform an additional gateway 
assessment to determine whether the amount of any bonus is appropriate in view of such facts 
or circumstances as the Committee considers relevant. This assessment may result in moderation 
(either positive or negative) of each AIP performance measure but subject to the individual 
maximum bonus levels
• The AIP remains a discretionary arrangement and the Committee reserves discretion to adjust 
the out-turn (from zero to the cap) should it consider that to be appropriate. In particular, the 
Committee will operate this discretion as a gateway in respect of any risk concerns
2012 
Long-Term 
Incentive Plan 
(the “LTIP”)
• To motivate and incentivise 
delivery of sustained 
business performance over 
the long term, aligning 
executives’ interests with 
those of shareholders
• To aid long-term retention  
of key executive talent
• Awards will typically be made in the form of nil-cost options or conditional share awards 
which vest to the extent performance conditions are satisfied over a period of at least three 
years. Under the Plan rules, awards may also be settled in cash
• Vested options will remain exercisable for a period of seven years
• Malus and clawback provisions apply to the LTIP and are explained in more detail in the 
notes to the policy table
• Awards under the LTIP may be made at various times during the financial year. While the 
Committee reserves the right to do otherwise, practice has been to make awards  
twice in each financial year following the announcement of the Group’s annual and 
half-year results 
• The Plan allows for awards over shares  
with an absolute maximum value of 200%  
of base salary per financial year (although 
awards of up to 300% of base salary  
are permitted in exceptional circumstances  
in relation to the recruitment or retention  
of an employee, as determined by the 
Remuneration Committee)
• The Committee will determine the performance condition for each award made under the  
LTIP, with performance measured over a single period of at least three years with no provision 
to retest
• Performance is measured against targets set at the beginning of the performance period which 
may be set by reference to the time of grant or financial year
• Awards vest based on performance against financial and / or share return measures,  
as set by the Committee, to be aligned with the long-term strategic objectives of the Group
• For awards to be granted in 2014, vesting is determined based on two measures: RoTE  
and relative Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) performance against the FTSE 350 (excluding 
investment trusts). The Committee may apply different performance measures and targets  
in future years
• Awards will be subject to a payment gateway such that the Committee must be satisfied that 
there are no material risk failings, reputational concerns or regulatory issues
• In addition, there is an underpin relating to the Committee’s view of the underlying financial 
performance of the Group
• Fuller details of the performance conditions and targets for 2014 awards are set out in the 
statement of implementation of policy in 2014 section of the annual remuneration report
• For both the TSR and RoTE elements, 20% of the award vests for threshold performance with 
100% vesting for maximum performance. The Committee reserves the discretion to make 
changes to these levels which it considers non-material
• The Committee reserves the right to lengthen (but not reduce) any performance period and  
/ or to introduce a separate holding period

Notes to the policy table
Stating maximum amounts for each element of remuneration
Where the table refers to the maximum amounts that may be 
paid in respect of any element of the policy (as required under 
the Regulations) these will operate simply as caps and not be 
indicative of any aspiration.
Malus and clawback
Malus (being the forfeiture of unvested awards) and clawback 
(being the ability of the Company to claim repayment of paid 
amounts as a debt) provisions apply to the AIP (cash and 
deferred element) and LTIP if, in the opinion of the Committee, 
any of the following has occurred: 
• There has been a material misstatement of the Company’s 
financial results which has led to an overpayment
• The assessment of performance targets is based on an error 
or inaccurate or misleading information or assumptions
• Circumstances warranting summary dismissal in the  
relevant period
• A material failure of risk management or any other act  
or omission that has had a sufficiently significant impact  
on the reputation of the Company to justify such action
Amounts in respect of awards under both plans may be subject 
to clawback for up to three years post payment or vesting  
as appropriate. 
Exercise of discretion
In line with market practice, the Committee retains discretion  
in relation to the operation and administration of the AIP,  
DAIP and LTIP. This discretion includes, but is not limited to:
• The timing of awards and payments
• The size of awards, within the overall limits disclosed in the 
policy table
• The determination of vesting
• The treatment of awards in the case of change of control  
or restructuring
• The treatment of leavers within the rules of the plan and the 
termination policy summary shown on page 86
•  Adjustments needed in certain circumstances, (for example, a 
rights issue, corporate restructuring or special interim dividend)
The Committee also retains the discretion to amend the 
performance measures, weightings and targets after they have 
been set if events make it appropriate to do so. Any changes 
will be explained in future annual remuneration reports and, if 
appropriate, be the subject of consultation with the Company’s 
major shareholders.
Adjustment to number of shares under deferred bonus and LTIP
The number of shares subject to deferred bonus and LTIP 
awards may be increased to reflect the value of dividends that 
would have been paid in respect of any dates falling between 
the grant of awards and the date of vesting of awards (the 
date of transfer of shares for awards made prior to 2014).

Remuneration payments agreed prior to appointment  
to the Board
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration 
payments and payments for loss of office (including, where 
relevant, exercising any discretions available to it in connection 
with such payments) notwithstanding that they are not in line 
with the policy set out above where the terms of the payment 
were agreed (i) before the policy came into effect or (ii) at  
a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the 
Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment 
was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director 
of the Company. For these purposes ‘payments’ include 
pension arrangements, the Committee satisfying awards  
of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over 
shares, the terms of the payment are ‘agreed’ at the time the 
award is granted.
RBS legacy arrangements
Both Executive Directors continue to hold unvested awards 
previously granted to them under the RBS Group LTIP 2011 
and 2012 which are subject to performance conditions to be 
assessed by the RBS Group Remuneration Committee. These 
awards were granted to Paul Geddes and John Reizenstein  
at a time when they were divisional directors of RBS Group 
and will now be satisfied by the transfer of Company shares 
from RBS Group on vesting. The performance conditions for 
these awards relate to financial and operational performance 
against the strategic plan for Direct Line Group and effective 
risk management with, in the case of Paul Geddes only,  
25% of vesting also dependent upon RBS Group performance.  
The 2012 awards also applied measures based on employee 
and customer satisfaction.
In addition, both Executive Directors continue to hold awards 
originally awarded under the RBS Group Deferral Plan and 
these will continue to be delivered in RBS Group shares.  
These awards are not subject to any performance conditions 
on vesting.
Selection of performance measures

The AIP performance measures have been selected by  
the Committee to incentivise Executive Directors to achieve 
financial targets for the year as well as specific strategic and 
personal objectives. These measures are aligned with the key 
performance indicators that we use as a business to monitor 
performance against our strategic priorities, as shown on 
pages 20 and 21 of the Annual Report & Accounts.
The relevant targets are set at or following the start of each 
year to ensure that Executive Directors are appropriately 
focused on the key objectives for the next 12 months.
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 83
Governance Directors’ remuneration report continued
Long-Term Incentive Plan
The ultimate goal of our strategy is to provide long-term 
sustainable returns for our shareholders.
For 2014, awards under the LTIP will therefore continue to  
be subject to performance against both RoTE and relative  
TSR targets, which are important KPIs for the business. The 
Committee believes that this combination provides a balanced 
approach to the measurement of Group performance over the 
longer term by using both a stated financial KPI that incentivises 
individuals to keep growing the business in an efficient way 
and a measure based on relative shareholder return. This 
combination of measures achieves an appropriate balance  
of absolute and relative returns.
Differences in remuneration policy from broader  
employee population
When determining Executive Directors’ remuneration, the 
Committee takes into account pay throughout the Group to 
ensure that the arrangements in place remain appropriate. 
The Group has one consistent reward policy for all levels  
of employees, as outlined on page 79. Therefore, the same 
reward principles guide reward decisions for all Group 
employees, including Executive Directors, although remuneration 
packages differ to take into account appropriate factors  
in different areas of the business:
• AIP – approximately 5,000 employees participate in  
the AIP and the corporate performance measures for all 
employees are consistent with those used for Executive 
Directors although the weighting attributable to those factors 
may differ. The Group’s strategic leaders also receive part  
of their bonus in Company shares deferred for a period  
of three years
• LTIP – our strategic leaders participate in the LTIP currently 
based on the same performance conditions as those for 
Executive Directors, although the Committee reserves the 
discretion to vary the performance conditions for awards 
made to employees below the Board for future awards 
• All employee share plans – the Committee considers it  
is important for all employees to have the opportunity to 
become shareholders in the Company. The HMRC-approved 
Buy-As-You-Earn plan in the UK and an International plan 
mirroring the UK plan for Italy were both launched during 
2013. The International plan is being further rolled out to 
employees in Germany and the Committee expects this 
process to be completed in 2014. At year end, 
approximately 1,900 employees throughout the Group  
had signed up to these schemes
Remuneration policy for Non-Executive Directors
Element Chairman and Non-Executive Directors’ fees
Purpose and link  
to strategy
To enable the Company to recruit and retain Non-Executive Directors of the highest calibre,  
at the appropriate cost
Approach to 
setting fees  
and cap
• Non-Executive Directors are paid a basic annual fee plus reasonable travel expenses. Additional fees  
may be paid to Non-Executive Directors who chair a Board Committee, sit on a Board Committee and  
for the Senior Independent Director. The level of fees for 2014 is shown in the annual remuneration section
• Fee levels for Non-Executive Directors are reviewed and may be increased at appropriate intervals  
by the Board, with affected individual Directors absenting themselves from deliberations
• In setting the level of fees, the Company takes into account the expected time commitment of the role  
and fees at other companies of a similar size, sector and / or complexity to the Group
• The fees paid to the Chairman are inclusive of all Board and Committee membership fees and are 
determined by the Remuneration Committee
• Subject to a Non-Executive Director aggregate fee cap in the Articles of Association (currently £2,000,000 
per annum), the Company reserves the right to change how the elements and weightings within the overall 
fees are paid and to pay a proportion of the fees in shares within this limit
Other items • The Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to receive any compensation for loss of office, other than  
fees for their notice period. They do not participate in the Group’s bonus, employee share plan or pension 
arrangements and do not receive any benefits
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 84 Recruitment remuneration policy
The recruitment remuneration policy aims to give the Committee sufficient flexibility to secure the appointment and promotion  
of high-calibre executives to strengthen the management team and secure the skill sets to deliver the Group’s strategic aims.
Principles for 
recruitment 
remuneration
• In terms of the principles for setting a package for a new Executive Director, the starting point for the 
Committee will be to look to the policy for Executive Directors as set out in the policy table and structure  
a package in accordance with that policy. Consistent with the Regulations, the caps contained within  
the policy table for fixed pay do not apply to new recruits, although the Committee would not envisage 
exceeding these caps in practice
• For an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may either 
continue on its original terms or be adjusted to reflect the new appointment, as appropriate
• For external and internal appointments (including a major change in role), the Committee may agree that the 
Company will meet certain relocation expenses, legal and other fees involved in negotiating any recruitment 
or pay expatriate benefits in line with the Group’s international assignment policy, as appropriate
Buy-out awards • Where it is necessary to make a recruitment-related pay award to an external candidate, the Company will 
not pay more than is necessary, in the view of the Committee, and will in all cases seek, in the first instance, 
to deliver any such awards under the terms of the existing incentive pay structure
• All such awards for external appointments, whether under the AIP, LTIP or otherwise, to compensate for 
awards forfeited on leaving their previous employer will be capped at the commercial value of the amount 
forfeited and will take account of the nature, time-horizons and performance requirements of those awards.  
In particular, the Committee’s starting point will be to ensure that any awards being forfeited which remain 
subject to outstanding performance requirements (other than where substantially complete) are bought-out 
with replacement requirements and any awards with service requirements are bought out with similar terms. 
However, exceptionally the Committee may relax those obligations where it considers it to be in the interests 
of shareholders and those factors are, in the view of the Committee, equally reflected in some other way,  
for example through a significant discount to the face value of the awards forfeited. It will only include 
guaranteed or non pro-rated amounts under the AIP where the Committee considers that it is necessary  
to secure the recruitment
The elements of any package for a new recruit, including the maximum level of variable pay, but excluding buy-outs, and  
the approach taken by the Committee in relation to setting each element of the package will be consistent with the Executive 
Directors’ remuneration policy described in this report, as modified by the above statement of principles where appropriate.  
The Committee reserves the right to avail itself of the current Listing Rule 9.4.2 if needed in order to facilitate, in exceptional 
circumstances, the recruitment of an Executive Director. Awards granted under this provision will only be used for buy-out awards.
Any commitments made before promotion to the Board (except when made in connection with the appointment to the Board)  
can continue to be honoured under the policy even if they are not consistent with the policy prevailing when the commitment  
is fulfilled.
In exceptional circumstances, the initial notice period may be longer than the Company’s 12-month policy up to a maximum  
of 24 months. However, this will reduce by one month for every month served, until it has reduced to 12 months in line with  
the Company’s policy position.
The remuneration policy for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors as set out earlier in this report will apply in relation  
to any recruitments to those positions.
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 85
Governance Directors’ remuneration report continued
Service contracts
Subject to the discretion noted above for new recruits, it is the Company’s policy to set notice periods for Executive Directors of 
no more than 12 months (both by the Director or Company). The Executive Directors’ service agreements summary is as follows:
Director Effective date of contract
Notice period  
(by Director or Company) Exit payment policy
Paul Geddes 1 September 2012 12 months Base salary only for unexpired portion of notice period and 
to be paid in a lump sum or monthly instalments, in which 
case instalments are subject to mitigation if an alternative 
role is found.
John Reizenstein 1 September 2012 12 months Base salary only for unexpired portion of notice period and 
to be paid in a lump sum or monthly instalments, in which 
case instalments are subject to mitigation if an alternative 
role is found. 
There are no further obligations which could give rise to a remuneration or loss of office payment other than those set in the 
remuneration policy table and termination policy summary.
Termination policy summary
It is appropriate for the Committee to retain discretion to consider the termination terms of any Executive Director, having regard  
to all the relevant facts and circumstances available to them at the time. A Director is deemed a “good leaver” if the following 
circumstances are met:
• Annual Incentive Plan and Long-Term Incentive Plan – death, injury, ill-health, redundancy, retirement, the sale of the individual’s 
employing company or business out of the Group, or in such other circumstances as the Committee determines
• Deferred Annual Incentive Plan – for any reason other than summary dismissal or resignation unless, in the case of resignation 
only, the Committee determines otherwise 
The table below sets out the general position although it should be noted that the Committee, consistent with most other companies, 
has reserved a broad discretion to determine whether an Executive Director should be categorised as a ‘good leaver’ and that 
discretion forms part of the approved policy. Similarly, while the policy is generally to reduce AIP and LTIP awards on a pro-rata 
basis, the Committee has reserved discretion to disapply such reduction if, in the circumstances, it considers that to be 
appropriate taking into account the performance of the departing executive and the circumstances of leaving.
Incentives
If a leaver is a ‘bad  
leaver’, for example  
leaving through resignation  
or summary dismissal If a leaver is deemed to be a ‘good leaver’
Other events, for example, change in control  
or winding up of Company
Annual  
Incentive Plan
No awards made Bonus paid at the normal time and  
on a time pro-rata basis, unless the 
Committee determines otherwise.
Bonus determined on such basis as the 
Committee considers appropriate and

the Committee determines otherwise.
Deferred Annual 
Incentive Plan
All awards will lapse Deferred shares typically vest on  
the normal vesting date, although 
the Committee reserves discretion  
to accelerate vesting. In the case  
of the participant’s death or other 
exceptional circumstances, awards  
may vest immediately.
Awards will vest in full. 
In the event of a demerger or similar 
event, the Committee may determine  
that awards vest on the same basis.
Long-Term 
Incentive Plan
All awards will lapse Awards will vest on the normal vesting 
date subject to performance and, unless 
the Committee determines otherwise, 
time pro rating. In exceptional 
circumstances, as determind by the 
Committee, for example in the case  
of the participant’s death, awards  
may vest on cessation.
Awards will vest subject to the 
application of the performance 
conditions and, unless the Committee 
determines otherwise, time pro rating.
In the event of a demerger or similar 
event, the Committee may determine  
that awards vest on the same basis. 
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 86 Following RBS Group’s shareholding in the Company reducing to less than 50% of the Ordinary Shares in the Company, the 
Company can in its discretion terminate each Executive Director’s service agreement with immediate effect by making a payment 
in lieu of notice. Service agreements for Executive Directors provide that Paul Geddes and John Reizenstein are not eligible to 
receive any enhanced redundancy terms which may be offered by the Group from time to time. Their rights to a statutory 
redundancy payment are not affected.
Depending on the circumstances of departure, an Executive Director may have additional claims under relevant employment 
protection laws and the Company may contribute to any legal fees involved in agreeing a termination. It may also agree to incur 
certain other expenses such as the provision of outplacement services. Any such fees would be disclosed as part of the detail  
of any termination arrangements.
Non-Executive Director letters of appointment
Non-Executive Directors are appointed for a three-year term which may be renewed by mutual agreement. In common with  
the Executive Directors, all Non-Executives are subject to annual re-election by shareholders. Mark Catton, being the Director 
nominated by the RBS Group, will step down as Director when RBS Group owns less than 20% of Direct Line Group.
The Directors may appoint additional members to join the Board during the year. Directors appointed in this way will be subject 
to election by shareholders at the first AGM after their appointment. In subsequent years the Directors are required to submit 
themselves for re-election at each AGM.
Terms and conditions of appointment of all of the Directors are available for inspection by any person at the Company’s 
registered office and at the AGM.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors have notice periods of three months from either party, which do not apply in the case 
of a Director not being re-elected by shareholders or retiring from office under the articles of association. Other than fees for this 
notice period, the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to any compensation on exit.
External directorships
The Company encourages Executive Directors to accept, subject to the approval of the Chairman, an invitation to join the board 
of another company outside the Group in a non-executive capacity, recognising the value of such wider experience. In these 
circumstances, they are permitted to retain any remuneration from the non-executive appointment. Executive Directors are 
generally limited to accepting one external directorship.
Currently, the Executive Directors do not hold any external directorships.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
As explained elsewhere in the Directors’ remuneration report, the Committee reviews the overall pay and bonus decisions  
in aggregate for the wider Group and therefore takes account of pay and conditions in the wider Group in determining the 
Directors’ remuneration policy and the remuneration payable to Directors. Through the Chief Executive Officer, Paul Geddes, and 
other senior management the Committee may receive input provided by employee groups within the Group, such as the 
Employee Representative Body (“ERB”), as required.
In accordance with prevailing commercial practice, the Committee did not consult with employees in preparing the Directors’ 
remuneration policy.
Consideration of shareholders’ views
The Committee takes into account the approval levels of remuneration related matters at the AGM in determining that the current 
Directors’ remuneration policy remains appropriate.
The Committee, consistent with its approach of operating within the highest standards of corporate governance, takes significant 
account of guidelines issued by the ABI and shareholder bodies (such as the National Association of Pension Funds) when setting 
the remuneration policy for the Company.
The Committee will also seek to build an active and productive dialogue with investors on developments in the remuneration 
aspects of corporate governance generally and any changes to the Company’s executive pay arrangements in particular. During 
the year, the Chair of the Committee and the Chairman of the Board jointly wrote to major shareholders and made themselves 
available to discuss remuneration policy.
The Committee is satisfied that no element of the Directors’ remuneration policy conflicts with the Group’s approach to 
environmental, social or corporate governance matters.

Performance scenarios
The Directors’ remuneration policy has been designed to ensure that a significant proportion of total remuneration is delivered  
in the form of variable pay and is therefore dependent on performance against our strategic objectives.
The Committee has considered the level of remuneration that may be paid under different performance scenarios to ensure that  
it would be appropriate in each situation in the context of the performance delivered and the value created for shareholders.
The following charts show the potential remuneration that may be earned by Executive Directors under three assumed 
performance scenarios as follows:

• Base salary is the salary to be paid in 2014
• Benefits measured as benefits paid in 2013 as set out in the single figure table on page 93
• Pension measured as the defined contribution or cash allowance in lieu of Company contributions,  
as a percentage of salary (25% of 2014 salary for both Executive Directors)
On-target Based on what the Director would receive if performance was on-target (excluding share price appreciation 
and dividends):
• Fixed remuneration as above
• AIP – consists of the on-target bonus of 60% of maximum bonus opportunity
• LTIP – consists of the threshold level of vesting (20% vesting)
Maximum Based on the maximum remuneration receivable (excluding share price appreciation and dividends):
• Fixed remuneration as above
• AIP – consists of the maximum bonus (175% of base salary for Paul Geddes, 150% for John Reizenstein)
• LTIP – consists of the face value of awards (200% of salary)

Advisers to the Committee
The Committee regularly consults with the Chief Executive 
Officer and the Human Resources Director on matters relating 
to the appropriateness of all elements of remuneration for 
Executive Directors and other strategic leaders. The Chief 
Executive Officer and the Human Resources Director are not 
present when their own remuneration is discussed. The Director 
of Performance and Reward provides advice on compensation 
and benefits to the Committee, and the General Counsel and 
Company Secretary advises the Committee on corporate 
governance guidelines and provides secretarial assistance to 
the Committee. The Committee works closely with the Chairs  
of the Board Risk Committee and the Audit Committee.
In addition, the Committee has appointed FIT Remuneration 
Consultants LLP (“FIT”), signatories to the Remuneration 
Consultants Group’s Code of Conduct, as its independent 
adviser. This appointment was made by the Committee in 
preparation for the IPO and following consideration of the 
firm’s experience in this sector. FIT was reappointed by the 
Committee during the year following a review of its performance. 
FIT provided advice during the year on market practice, 
corporate governance, incentive plan design and other matters 
under consideration by the Committee. FIT does not provide 
any other services to the Company, and accordingly the 
Committee is satisfied that the advice provided by FIT is 
objective and independent. 
FIT’s total fees for the provision of remuneration-related advice 
in 2013 were £197,793 exclusive of VAT. FIT’s fees were 
charged on the basis of the firm’s standard terms of business 
for advice provided.
Allen & Overy LLP, one of the Group’s legal advisers, has  
also provided legal advice in relation to the Group’s executive 
remuneration arrangements, and has provided the Group with 
other legal services.

purchased by the Employee Benefits Trust to satisfy the awards of shares under 
the Company’s share plans. Consistent with expected practice elsewhere, the 
overall expenditure on pay has been taken from note 10 to the income statement 
and has not, therefore, been calculated in a manner consistent with the single

The table below shows the percentage change in the total annual remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer against all UK 
employees. The remuneration elements included in the calculation are salary, taxable benefits, and annual bonus outcomes.  
The Committee considers that it is appropriate to compare against all UK employees but to exclude those based outside the UK  
to ensure that the comparison against the Chief Executive Officer’s total annual remuneration can be made on a consistent basis.

1. The reduction in the value of benefits between 2012 and 2013 reflects the change in benefit arrangements with the corresponding increase in base pay  
to ensure total fixed pay was comparable both before and after separation from RBS Group.
Paul Geddes’ salary and benefits for 2012 reflect a period as an employee of RBS Group, prior to his appointment as a Director 
of the Company on 1 September 2012, when his salary and benefits were set at current levels in advance of the Company’s IPO. 
Paul Geddes’ salary and benefits package remain unchanged since then and will not be increased in 2014.

Executive Directors’ salaries in 2014
The current base salaries paid to the Executive Directors were set prior to the IPO. The Committee has considered the current level 
of salaries in the context of the need to apply restraint in executive pay whilst recognising the need to retain key executive talent 
in the context of a highly competitive market. It concluded that there will be no increase to Executive Directors’ salaries in 2014.

During 2013, the Committee considered the relative importance of the performance measures and whether the Board’s strategic 
priorities going forward were fully reflected in the AIP. This assessment resulted in the introduction of lead strategic indicators for 
2014, which will include both financial and non-financial measures which indicate the overall strategic progress of the business. 
Furthermore, to further emphasise the gateway factors, the Committee concluded that while it would set a target for each measure 
(which is commercially confidential at the outset but which may be disclosed on a retrospective basis), it would not set threshold 
and stretch targets, leaving such assessment to judgement.
Through 2013, the Committee worked alongside the Board Risk Committee to ensure that risk management is central to all pay 
decisions and, for 2014, will more explicitly use risk as a gateway to moderate all aspects of the AIP. The Committee therefore 
decided to remove the specific risk measure, as it felt that attributing 10% to such aspect devalued the criticality of this metric. It 
also took the opportunity to improve the alignment to strategic objectives and removed the COR element which was felt to be 
largely duplicative with profit.

Given the competitive nature of the insurance sector, while the performance measures for annual bonus are disclosed, the 
detailed targets are considered commercially sensitive and likely to remain so and are accordingly not disclosed. The level  
of achievement against each measure in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2013 is shown in the audited  
section of the annual remuneration report. The Committee will aim to provide a consistent level of disclosure in future years.
All AIP outcomes will be determined following the Committee’s determination of a payment gateway, which requires the 
Committee to be satisfied that it is appropriate to permit the award of a bonus, at all or at a given level. The gateway necessarily 
involves an element of subjective judgement of performance and may result in moderation, either positive or negative, of each 
AIP performance measure. The gateway criteria for AIP for 2014 are set out overleaf. 
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 91
Governance Gateway criteria for 2014 AIP outcomes
• Affordability
• Risk management within risk appetite
• The relative performance of the Group to that of its peers
• The wider economic environment
• Exceptional events, such as abnormal weather
• The occurrence of any regulatory breaches and / or reputational damage to the Group
• Committee satisfaction that payment of the bonus does not give rise to major reputational concerns
• Such other factors as the Committee may consider to be relevant
In addition to the gateway criteria, the Committee may use its discretion to take into account additional factors such as customer 
conduct and experience, the quality of financial results, the view of the “direction of travel” in all metrics and a wider 
consideration of reputation, risk and audit. 
Performance conditions for LTIP awards to be made in 2014
LTIP awards to be granted in 2014 will continue to be subject to the achievement of the following performance conditions:
• 60% to be based on RoTE over a three-year performance period (2014, 2015 and 2016); and
• 40% to be based on relative TSR performance against the constituents of the FTSE 350 (excluding investment trusts) over  
a three-year performance period starting on the date of grant. The starting TSR and closing TSR will both be averaged over  
a three-month period.
For these purposes, the Group’s standard definition for RoTE is used (see definition on page 178) subject to such other 
adjustments as the Committee considers appropriate.
The performance targets are as follows:
Performance measure Threshold vesting Maximum vesting
RoTE 20% of portion of award vests for average 
annual RoTE performance of 14%
Full vesting for average annual RoTE  
performance of 17%
Relative TSR 20% of portion of award vests for  
median performance
Full vesting for upper quintile performance
For both the TSR and RoTE elements, 20% of the award vests for threshold performance with 100% vesting for maximum 
performance. There is a straight-line interpolation between these points for the TSR measure (on a ranked basis). For the RoTE 
element, 40% vests for 15% RoTE, otherwise, similar to TSR, a straight-line interpolation occurs from threshold to target and then 
from target to maximum performance.
In addition, the LTIP awards will vest only to the extent that the Committee is satisfied that the outcome of the TSR and RoTE 
performance conditions reflects the underlying financial performance of the Group over the period from the date of grant until 
vesting. In making these considerations, the Committee will take into account whether there have been any material risk failings.
Pension and benefits
A pension contribution of 25% of base salary will continue to be paid to both Executive Directors in 2014 as shown in the  
table below:
Director Position Pension contribution (% base salary)
Paul Geddes Chief Executive Officer 25%
John Reizenstein Chief Financial Officer 25%
Benefits will continue to comprise the provision of a company car or car allowance, private medical insurance, life assurance, 
income protection and health screening. The Executive Directors are also eligible to receive certain Group products at a discount, 
in line with the approach for all employees.

Notes:
1. Base salary, benefits, pension contributions and cash allowance in lieu of pension during the financial year ending 31 December 2012 include part of the  
year as an employee of RBS Group and part of the year as an employee of Direct Line Group.
2. Includes amounts earned for performance during the year but deferred under the Deferred Annual Incentive Plan as shown on page 94.
3. Long-term incentives in 2012 and 2013 for Paul Geddes and in 2013 for John Reizenstein represent the vesting of the RBS Group Long-Term Incentive Plan 
awards granted in 2010 and 2011 respectively, with vesting amounts assessed by the RBS Group Remuneration Committee. For 2011 RBS Group LTIP awards 
vesting by reference to 2013 performance, the vesting outcome is calculated at 54.75% for Paul Geddes giving 274,514 Company shares and at 58%  
for John Reizenstein, giving 59,713 Company shares. These expected vesting outcomes are then accordingly multiplied by the average Company share price 
from 1 October 2013 to 31 December 2013 of £2.2658.
4. Details of the performance measures and targets applicable to the vesting of RBS legacy LTIP awards are shown on pages 98 to 99.
5. Benefits include a company car or allowance, private medical and income protection insurance. In 2012 the Executive Directors were participants in benefits 
provided by RBS Group prior to being appointed Directors of the Company on 1 September 2012. The benefits figure reported for 2012 has been updated 
from the figure presented for the 2012 accounts to reflect changes in the reporting rules.
6. Includes the value of matching shares under the Share Incentive Plan. For 2012, this also includes the free share awards made to each Director  
(valued at £289 for each Director). All figures in the table are rounded to the nearest thousand.
7. Paul Geddes was a participant in an RBS Group defined benefits scheme until 1 September 2012, when he became a member of Direct Line Group’s defined 
contribution scheme. He has kept his accrued pension in the RBS Group defined benefits scheme but received no benefit in the year as he is a deferred member 
only and no additional accruals were made to the scheme in respect of his participation.
Confirmation has been received by each Executive Director that they have not received any other items in the nature of 
remuneration, other than those already disclosed in the single figure table.

Where the icons above represent performance broadly as follows:
 = below threshold,  = threshold to 90% of on-target, = 90% to 110% of on-target,  = above 110% of on-target,  = maximum
In considering outcomes against the specific measures, the Committee applied judgement in relation to the quality of earnings 
assessment of the financial elements, gateway considerations as described elsewhere in this report and its overriding judgement 
in assessing the actual payment for each Executive Director and, where appropriate, outcomes were moderated accordingly.  
The Committee intends to operate a similar approach in future years and will explain the use of its judgement accordingly.
Overall, the Committee felt that a broadly on-target level of performance was warranted for the financial elements, with the 
exception of the cost reduction target where all of the stretch objectives were met. In respect of the customer experience metric, 
despite a strong performance on customer conduct, with improvements in many measures, the Committee considered that the 
Group had not met its own stretching objectives to develop and differentiate customer propositions, and this remains a priority  
in 2014. The Committee therefore reduced this element to below threshold to recognise this.
Consequently, the annual incentive awards payable to the Executive Directors in respect of the financial year ended  
31 December 2013 are shown in the table below:

financial year. These awards are not subject to any conditions other than continuous employment. 
Unlike the bonus in respect of 2012, when Paul Geddes’s bonus was deferred on terms comparable to those applying to all 
members of the RBS Group Executive Committee, due to his having been a member of the RBS Group Executive Committee  
for part of 2012, the deferral terms for the bonus outcome in respect of 2013 will be the same for both Executive Directors.

Notes:
1. Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Group’s bonus or share incentive schemes or join any Group pension scheme. 
2. Mark Catton, a Director nominated by the RBS Group, resigned as a Director of the Company on 26 April 2013, following the reduction in the shareholding  
of RBS Group to less than 50% on 13 March 2013, and was reappointed as a Director on 1 October 2013 following the resignation of Bruce Van Saun.  
RBS Group is entitled, under its Relationship Agreement with the Company, to nominate one Non-Executive Director to the Board while its shareholding in the 
Company remains 20% or more. During their appointment as Non-Executive Directors, Bruce Van Saun and Mark Catton were RBS Group employees with  
any fees they may receive payable to RBS Group.
Shareholdings
The Executive Directors are subject to share ownership guidelines and are expected to retain all of the Ordinary Shares that they 
obtain from any of the Company’s share incentive plans, after any disposals necessary for the payment of personal taxes on the 
acquisition of such Ordinary Shares, until they have achieved the required level of shareholding. For these purposes, the holding 
of Ordinary Shares will be treated as including all vested but unexercised awards, valued on a basis that is net of applicable 
personal taxes. 
The extent to which Executive Directors have achieved the guideline requirements by 31 December 2013 can be summarised  
as follows:
Position
Share ownership guideline 
(% of salary)
Value of shares held at

respect of 2011 awards granted to Paul Geddes and John Reizenstein respectively are expected to vest in March 2014 following an assessment of performance 
by the RBS Group Remuneration Committee.
2. Includes matching and free shares held under the Share Incentive Plan (as disclosed on page 98) and deferred shares under the DAIP. RBS Group deferred 
awards are not included as these are to be settled in RBS Group shares.
3. 40% of the shares awarded to Paul Geddes under the DAIP in March 2013 vested during the financial year, consistent with the policy applying at RBS Group.
4. As at the date of this report the number of shares beneficially held by Paul Geddes and John Reizenstein had increased to 59,247 and 61,910 respectively.
5. Includes holdings of connected persons, as defined in sections 252-255 of the Companies Act.

2. The terms on which Paul Geddes’ 2012 bonus outcome was deferred meant that 60% of the outcome was deferred, with deferral split broadly evenly between 
deferral into deferred cash and deferred shares, with phased vestings of the deferred amounts over the three year deferral period. As shown on page 96, 
75,409 of the awards granted on 28 March 2013 vested during the year.

Notes:
1. The Company’s share price on 31 December 2013 was £2.496 and the range of prices in the year was £1.982 to £2.496.
2. These awards take the form of nil cost options over the Company’s shares and are subject to performance conditions to be assessed by the Committee,  
which are the same as those for awards to be made in 2014 as described on page 92. Awards accrue dividend entitlements until the date  
of transfer of shares.
3. These figures do not include those RBS Group LTIP awards held by the Executive Directors which are included in the table on page 98.
The Company’s policy is to make awards twice a year following the announcement of the Group’s full and half-year results.  
The value of each grant of awards is set at 50% of the normal annual policy level, so that the total face value of awards to  
each Executive Director during the year equates to 200% of base salary, measured using an average share price prior to the 
date of grant.
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 97

Direct Line Group 2012 Share Incentive Plan
From 18 February 2013, all employees including Executive Directors can invest from £10 up to £125 per month from their 
pre-tax pay into the BAYE Share Incentive Plan (the “SIP”) and receive one matching share for every two shares purchased.  
The limit of £125 per month may be reviewed as legislation evolves to take account of any changes, where appropriate.
The table below details the number of shares held by John Reizenstein under the SIP. Paul Geddes does not participate  
in the plan.

contributions being deducted from salary.
In addition, at the time of the IPO, and under the same terms as other employees, Executive Directors were offered the 
opportunity to subscribe for 143 free Company shares which will vest in November 2015, three years from grant. Both  
Executive Directors subscribed for this offer and the value of £289 for each Director is included in the single figure table.
Dilution
The Company complies with both of the dilution levels recommended by the ABI guidelines (of 10% in 10 years for all share 
plans and 5% in 10 years for discretionary plans) consistent with the rules of the Company’s share plans. Legacy RBS Group 
awards to be satisfied in Company shares will be satisfied by RBS Group rather than the Company and RBS Group has placed 
shares in trust to facilitate this.
Legacy RBS Group awards 
The Executive Directors continue to hold unvested awards previously granted to them under the RBS Group Employee Share Plans 
as employees of the RBS Group. These awards have been included as they were granted to the Executive Directors in respect  
of their work as directors of RBS Insurance, as the Group was previously known.
RBS Group Long-Term Incentive awards
Awards originally granted under the RBS Group Long-Term Incentive Plans (“RBS Group LTIP”) in 2011 and 2012 will be 
delivered in Company shares transferred by RBS Group to the extent that the originally set performance conditions for these 
awards are considered achieved by the RBS Group Remuneration Committee.
The table below details the awards made to Paul Geddes and John Reizenstein under RBS Group plans which will vest in 
Company shares. No awards were granted, vested or lapsed during the year although the potential value of the 2011 LTIP  
has been included in the single figure of remuneration as described on page 93.

Notes:
1. The Direct Line Group share price at 31 December 2013 was £2.496 and the range of prices in the year was £1.982 to £2.496. 
2. It was agreed with RBS Group that participants now employed by Direct Line Group holding awards granted in 2011 and 2012 under the RBS Group LTIP 
would be given the opportunity to have those awards satisfied by the transfer of Company shares from RBS Group on vesting. The conversion rate applied to 
these awards was the average price of RBS Group shares over the five business day period prior to 11 October 2012 divided by the Direct Line Group share 
offer price (£1.75). This conversion equated to 1.487 Company shares for every RBS Group share under grant. Both Executive Directors took up this offer.
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 98 These awards are subject to performance conditions to be assessed by the RBS Group Remuneration Committee. The conditions 
relate to financial and operational performance against the strategic plan for Direct Line Group and effective risk management 
with, in the case of Paul Geddes only, 25% of vesting also dependent upon RBS Group performance. The 2012 awards also 
applied measures based on employee and customer satisfaction.

Governance Directors’ report
The Directors present their report for the financial year ended 
31 December 2013.
Strategic report
The Company has chosen, in accordance with section 414c(ll)
of the Companies Act 2006, and as noted in this Directors’ 
report, to include certain additional matters in its Strategic 
report that would otherwise be required to be disclosed  
in this Directors’ report.
Disclosure and Transparency Rule 4.1.5(2) requires this  
Annual Report & Accounts to include a management report. 
The information that fulfils this requirement can be found  
in the Strategic report on pages 2 to 49.
The subsidiary and associated undertakings which principally 
affect the profits or net assets of the Group in the year are 
listed in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.
The forward-looking statements disclaimer is set out on  
page 179.
Corporate governance statement
The information that fulfils the requirements of the corporate 
governance statement for the purposes of Disclosure and 
Transparency Rule 7.2 can be found in this Directors’ report 
and in the corporate governance report on pages 56 to 75, 
which is incorporated into this Directors’ report by reference.
Post-balance sheet events and likely future 
developments
Details of events after the statement of financial position date 
are contained in note 40 to the consolidated financial 
statements and form part of this report.
Dividends
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 8.4 pence per 
share to shareholders, which, subject to shareholder approval, 
will be paid on 20 May 2014 to all holders of Ordinary 
Shares on the Register of members at close of business on  
14 March 2014.
In addition, the Company paid a special interim dividend  
of 4.0 pence per share in December and the Board is now 
declaring a second special interim dividend of 4.0 pence  
per share. Both these special interim dividends relate to  
items in 2013 that were not expected at the start of the  
year. The second special interim dividend will be paid  
on 20 May 2014 to all holders of Ordinary Shares on the 
Register of members at close of business on 14 March 2014.
Directors
Details of the Company’s rules on the appointment and term  
of appointment of Directors are given on pages 61 to 62.
Remuneration of Directors
The Remuneration report starting on page 76 forms part of the 
Directors’ report and includes details of the nature and amount 
of each element of the remuneration (including share options) 
of each of the Directors.
Secretary
Details of the Company Secretary of Direct Line Insurance 
Group plc, including his qualifications and experience, 
are set out on page 55.
Directors’ indemnities
The Articles of the Company permit it to indemnify the officers 
of the Company (and the officers of any associated company) 
against liabilities arising from the conduct of Company 
business to the extent permitted by law. Accordingly, the 
Company executed deeds of indemnity for the benefit of  
each Director in respect of liabilities that may attach to them  
in their capacity as Directors of the Company or of associated 
companies. These indemnities are qualifying third-party 
indemnities as defined by section 234 of the Companies Act 
2006. No amount was paid under any of these indemnities 
during the year.
The Company also purchased directors’ and officers’ liability 
insurance during the year, which provides appropriate cover 
for legal actions brought against its Directors.
Authorisation of conflicts of interest
The Company’s Articles of Association permit the authorisation 
of a Director’s potential conflict of interest or duty. Such 
authorisations may be given by the remaining Directors  
who are independent of the potential conflict.
The Board has approved a number of authorisations in this 
manner. Notwithstanding such authorisation, the Board 
continues to ensure that any actual conflict of interest or duty, 
should it arise, is dealt with appropriately, which will usually 
be by arranging that the Director takes no part in the relevant 
Board or Committee discussion or decision.
At no time during the year did any Director hold a material 
interest in any contract of significance with the Company or the 
Group other than the Relationship Agreement with RBS Group, 
the indemnity provision described above and service contracts 
between each Executive Director and the Company.
Share capital and control
The issued and fully paid share capital of the Company  
is 1,500,000,000 Ordinary Shares of 10 pence each.
During the AGM held on 6 June 2013, the Directors were

Relationship Agreement with RBS Group
Under the terms of a Relationship Agreement between  
the Company and RBS Group, RBS Group has the right  
to nominate Directors to the Board of the Company; whilst  
RBS Group held over 50% of the shares of the Company  
RBS Group was entitled to nominate two Directors and such 
Directors were Bruce Van Saun and Mark Catton.
Following the reduction of RBS Group’s shareholding below 
50% on 13 March 2013, RBS Group became entitled to 
nominate one rather than two Directors and Mark Catton 
accordingly resigned on 26 April 2013. On the resignation  
of Bruce Van Saun on 1 October 2013 on account of his  
work for RBS Group moving to the United States, Mark Catton 
re-joined the Board as RBS Group’s nominated Director in 
place of Bruce Van Saun.
Under the terms of the agreement, after ceding control of the 
Company, RBS Group may only nominate one Director until 
such time as its shareholding reduces below 20%.
With the exception of the Relationship Agreement, there is no 
arrangement or understanding with any shareholder, customer, 
supplier, or any other external party, providing the right to 
appoint a Director or a member of the Executive Committee.
Restrictions on the transfer of shares
The Relationship Agreement in place between the Company 
and RBS Group contains certain restrictions on the transfer  
of the Ordinary Shares registered in the name of RBS Group.
In addition, there are restrictions on the transfer of the Ordinary 
Shares under the Company’s employee share incentive plans 
while the shares are subject to the plan rules. Where, under  
an employee share incentive plan operated by the Company, 
participants are the beneficial owners of shares but not the 
registered owners, the voting rights are normally exercised  
at the discretion of the participants.
Other than those specified above, there are no restrictions on 
the voting rights attached to the Company’s Ordinary Shares or 
the transfer of securities in the Company. There are no special 
rights with regard to control of the Company attached to the 
Company’s Ordinary Shares. The Company is not aware of 
any agreements between holders of shares that may result in 
restrictions on the transfer of shares or voting rights.
Significant agreements
A number of agreements may take effect, alter or terminate 
upon a change of control of the Company including following 
a takeover bid, for example commercial contracts and 
distribution agreements. None is considered to be significant  
in terms of its impact on the business of the Group as a whole.
• The Relationship Agreement between the Company and RBS 
Group remains in force until such time as the RBS Group’s 
shareholding reduces below 20% of the issued share capital 
of the Company. There are also provisions which provide  
the RBS Group with the right automatically to terminate the 
Relationship Agreement if the Company ceases to be listed, 
or if it passes a resolution to wind up, or if an administration 
order is made or it makes an arrangement with creditors. 
There are no provisions in the Relationship Agreement which 
allow RBS Group to terminate the agreement in the event  
of a change of control of Direct Line Group
• All of the Company’s employee share incentive plans  
contain provisions relating to a change of control. 
Outstanding awards would typically vest and become 
exercisable on a change of control, subject to the 
satisfaction of any performance conditions, and normally 
with an additional time based pro-rata reduction where 
performance conditions apply

Employee consultation
The Group’s statement on our employees is set out in the 
Strategic report on page 46. In summary, we encourage  
open, honest and transparent communication and dialogue 
with employees.
We have well-established Employee Representative Bodies 
(“ERBs”) that comprise elected representatives of employees 
across our business. ERBs help shape initiatives by helping  
us share and discuss proposals and initiatives which affect  
our future and advise the Executive Committee regarding 
employee matters. 
These bodies are consulted as part of future change 
programmes, and in particular about collective redundancies 
and TUPE transfers. They complement our existing communication 
processes and represent their constituents’ interests.
On 26 June 2013, the Company announced proposals  
to improve its operational efficiency as part of its business 
transformation plan. 
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 101
Governance Directors’ report continued
These proposals resulted in approximately 3,200 roles being 
put at risk. The Group ensured meaningful consultation took 
place with elected representatives regarding ways to avoid, 
reduce or mitigate the impact of proposed reductions in the 
number of roles.
Employees can also raise issues and ideas through “BEST 
Quest” – an intranet based communication tool which 
facilitates on-line information sharing. We will be phasing this 
out and replacing it with Yammer; a business social networking 
tool which will help reinforce some of our core values such as 
‘working together’ ‘say it like it is’ and ‘bring all of yourself to 
work’ and reduce the impact of geographic and organisational 
barriers to communication.
The Group values the diversity of its employees and is 
committed to creating a working environment that is inclusive  
of all. The Group embraces people’s differences in order to 
attract and retain talent and seeks to enable employees to 
reach their potential; these differences include but are not 
limited to age, belief, disability, ethnic or national origin, 
gender, gender identity, marital or civil partnership status, 
political opinion, race, religion and sexual orientation.  
These commitments extend to recruitment and selection, 
training, career development, flexible working arrangements, 
promotion and performance appraisal.
Numerical data relating to the gender diversity of the Board, 
senior executives and the employees may be found on page 47.
Employees with disabilities
As an organisation we are committed to ensuring that diversity 
is promoted across all areas of our business. At recruitment we 
make adjustments to facilitate applications and the selection 
process and provide guidance and where necessary 
additional training for interviewers.
Our Diversity Network Alliance has a ‘strand’ which focuses 
 on matters important to our employees with a disability and  
to identify areas that we can improve upon. To facilitate 
continued employment we make reasonable adjustments to the 
working environment/equipment, the role or role requirements 
and ensure that the same opportunities are available to all. 
Political contributions
The Group made no political donations during the year 
(2012: nil).
Governmental regulation
To comply with European Union (“EU”) state aid requirements, 
RBS Group agreed to cede control of Direct Line Group by  
the end of 2013 and divest its entire interest by the end of 
2014. The initial minority tranche of the divestment of Direct 
Line Group, by way of a public flotation, was effected on  
16 October 2012 and RBS Group ceded control of Direct 
Line Group on 13 March 2013 and reduced its shareholding 
further to 28.5% on 27 September 2013.
Greenhouse gas emissions
The Group has followed the 2013 UK Government 
environmental reporting guidance for greenhouse gas  
(“GHG”) emissions, used the UK Government’s greenhouse  
gas conversion factors and adopted the financial-control 
approach. GHG emissions are classified as either direct or 
indirect, and are divided into Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.
Direct GHG emissions are those from sources that are owned 
or controlled by the Group. Indirect GHG emissions are those 
that are a consequence of the activities of the Group, but that 
occur at sources owned or controlled by another organisation. 
The Group has considered the six main GHGs, reported in 
CO
2
e tonnes equivalent and have set 2013 as the base year. 
The Group has included emissions from all of its overseas 
subsidiaries. It has not included emissions associated with its 
investment portfolio.
• Scope 1 – direct emissions including fuels used in office 
buildings, accident repair centres and owned vehicles
• Scope 2 – indirect emissions resulting from the generation  
of electricity purchased for office buildings and accident 
repair centres
The Group’s total GHG emissions for 2013 were 30,624 
tonnes (see table below). This primarily comprised of emissions 
from purchased electricity and natural gas, diesel fuel and 
refrigerant gas used.
In addition to total emissions, the Group also monitors 
emissions per £ million of net earned premium. In 2013, this 
was 8.7 tonnes per £ million of net earned premium. This is  
a measure of how efficiently insurance products are provided 
and allows comparison between insurance companies.
The GHG emissions data has been externally verified by 
Ecometrica. The verification statements can be found on the 
Group’s website (www.directlinegroup.com ).
Further information on the Group’s approach to energy and the 
environment can be found in the corporate social responsibility 
report on page 44.

Financial instruments
The Group’s companies use financial instruments to manage 
certain types of risk, including those relating to foreign currency 
exchange, cash flow, liquidity and interest rates. Details of the 
objectives and management of these instruments are contained 
in the Risk management and Capital management sections  
on pages 22 to 27 and 42. An indication of the exposure  
of Group companies to such risks is also contained in note  
3 to the consolidated financial statements.
Going concern
The Group has sufficient financial resources to meet its financial 
needs including the management of a mature portfolio of 
insurance risk. The Directors believe that the Group is well 
positioned to manage its business risks successfully in the 
current economic environment.
The finance review on pages 34 to 43 describes the Group’s 
capital management strategy, which covers how it measures  
its regulatory and economic capital needs and how capital  
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 102 is deployed. The financial position of the Group is also 
covered in that section, including a commentary on cash and 
investment levels, reserves, currency management, insurance 
liability management, liquidity and borrowings. In addition, 
note 3.2 to the consolidated financial statements describes 
capital management needs and policies and note 3 covers 
underwriting, market, liquidity and credit risks which may  
affect the Group’s financial position.
After making due enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Accordingly, they have adopted the going 
concern basis in preparing this Annual Report & Accounts.
Statement of disclosure of information to auditors
Each Director at the date of the approval of this Annual Report 
& Accounts confirms that:
• so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which Deloitte LLP, the Company’s external 
auditor, is unaware; and 
• the Director has taken all the steps that he or she ought to 
have taken as a Director to make himself or herself aware  
of any relevant audit information and to establish that 
Deloitte LLP is aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance 
with the provisions of section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Auditor
Deloitte LLP has expressed its willingness to continue in office 
as external auditor. A resolution to reappoint the firm will be 
proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
Directors’ responsibility statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare such financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law, the Directors 
are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRSs”) as adopted by the EU and Article 4 of the International 
Accounting Standard (“IAS”) Regulation and have also chosen 
to prepare the Parent Company financial statements under 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU. Under company law, the Directors 
must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that 
period. In preparing these financial statements, IAS 1 requires 
that Directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and
• make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the Company and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on 
pages 52 to 53 confirm, that to the best of their knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRS, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit or loss of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as  
a whole; and
• the Strategic report (given on pages 2 to 49) includes a fair 
review of the development and performance of the business 
and the position of the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together  
with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties  
that they face.
Statement of the Directors in respect of the 
Annual Report & Accounts
The Directors confirm that they consider that the Annual  
Report & Accounts, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced  
and understandable and provide the information necessary  
for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business 
model and strategy.
In arriving at this conclusion, the Board was supported by a 
number of processes which included:
• the Annual Report & Accounts were drafted by management 
with overall governance and co-ordination provided by a 
steering group comprised of a team of cross-functional senior 
management to ensure consistency across sections;
• a verification process was undertaken to ensure that the 
content was factually accurate;
• drafts of the Annual Report & Accounts were reviewed by 
members of the Executive Committee;
• an advanced draft was reviewed by the Company’s 
Disclosure Committee and legal advisers; and
• the substantially final draft was reviewed by the Audit 
Committee prior to consideration by the Board.
This Directors’ report was reviewed and approved by the 
Board on 25 February 2014.

Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 104 Independent auditor’s report to the members of Direct Line Insurance Group plc
Opinion on the financial statements of Direct Line 
Insurance Group plc
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the  
state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs  
as at 31 December 2013 and of the Group’s profit for  
the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union;
• the Parent Company financial statements have been  
properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted  
by the European Union and as applied in accordance  
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and,  
as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise the consolidated income 
statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income, the consolidated and Parent Company balance sheets, 
the consolidated and Parent Company cash flow statements, 
the consolidated and Parent Company statements of changes 
in equity and the related notes 1 to 40 on the consolidated 
financial statements, and the related notes 1 to 16 on the 
Company financial statements. The financial reporting framework 
that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law 
and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and, as regards 
the Parent Company financial statements, as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued  
by the IASB
As explained in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, 
in addition to complying with its legal obligation to apply  
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, the Group has  
also applied IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (“IASB”).
In our opinion the Group financial statements comply with IFRSs 
as issued by the IASB.
Going concern
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the 
Directors’ statement on page 102 that the Group is a going 
concern. We confirm that:
• we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going 
concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the 
financial statements is appropriate; and
• we have not identified any material uncertainties that may 
cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue  
as a going concern.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below 
are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the 
allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of 
the engagement team.
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
The methodology and assumptions used in setting  
insurance reserves
The determination of the value of the insurance 
reserves requires significant judgment in the 
selection of key assumptions and methodology. 
Management makes significant judgement in 
respect of the trends in bodily injury claims 
frequency and severity, the propensity for large 
claims to settle as PPOs, the Ogden discount rate 
consultation and other regulatory developments.
We have tested the design and implementation and operating 
effectiveness of the key controls over the end to end reserving process 
engaging our internal actuarial specialists where appropriate.
In addition we have:
• tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used;
• considered the suitability of the methodology used in setting 
insurance reserves; and
• challenged management’s key assumptions and judgements against 
industry benchmarks.
Our work included assessing whether the reserving methodology has 
been applied consistently across periods. We have also performed 
work to understand the sensitivity of insurance reserves to changes in 
key assumptions and methodology.
The valuation of investments including complex 
financial instruments and their accounting 
treatment in accordance with IAS 39 and IFRS 13
The valuation of financial investments held at fair 
value utilises a range of inputs. Many of the inputs 
required can be obtained from readily available, 
liquid market prices and rates. Where observable 
market data is not available, for example, when 
determining the valuation of investment property, 
estimates must be developed based on the most 
appropriate source data and are subject to 
significant judgement.
We have performed audit procedures over the valuation and 
accounting of investments held by the Group. We have tested the 
design and implementation and operating effectiveness of the key 
controls over the investment valuation process.
On a sample basis we have tested their valuation at the year end.  
We also performed a review of sources and systems used by the 
Group for valuation and compared valuations to those obtained from 
more than one independent source or recalculated them. We also 
engaged our valuation specialists where appropriate and checked that 
the disclosure requirements of IAS 39 and IFRS 13 were appropriately 
addressed. We have also tested the Group’s compliance with the 
accounting rules for complex financial instruments.
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 105
Financial statements Independent auditor’s report to the members of Direct Line Insurance Group plc 
continued
The Audit Committee’s consideration of these risks is set out  
on page 67.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed 
in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a 
whole, and not to express an opinion on individual accounts 
or disclosures. Our opinion on the financial statements is not 
modified with respect to any of the risks described above,  
and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the 
financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be 
changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning 
the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results  
of our work.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £40 million, 
which is below 10% of normalised pre-tax profit, and below 
1.5% of equity. Pre-tax profit was normalised by taking the 
average pre-tax profit from ongoing operations, which excludes 
the impact of discontinued activities and the transformation 
costs, for current year and the previous two years to exclude 
the effect of year-on-year volatility from our determination.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report  
to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £800,000, 
as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to 
the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified 
when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
The scope of our group audit was determined by obtaining  
an understanding of the Group and its environment, including 
Group-wide controls, and assessing the risks of material 
misstatement at the Group level. Based on that assessment,  
we focused our group audit scope on the audit work at three 
primary operating locations the UK, Italy and Germany.
Four entities at these locations were subject to a full audit,  
a further two were subject to an audit of specified account 
balances where the extent of our testing was based on our 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement and of the 
materiality of the Group’s operations at those locations.  
These six entities represent the principal business units and 
account for 98% of the Group’s net assets, 99% of the  
Group’s revenue and 95% of the Group’s profit before tax. 
They were also selected to provide an appropriate basis  
for undertaking audit work to address the risks of material 
misstatement identified above. Our audit work at the three 
locations was executed at levels of materiality applicable to 
each individual entity which were lower than Group materiality.
At the Parent Company level we also tested the consolidation 
process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm  
our conclusion that there were no significant risks of material 
misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the 
remaining components not subject to audit or audit of specified 
account balances.
The group audit team followed a programme of planned visits 
that has been designed so that the Senior Statutory Auditor 
visits each of the locations where the group audit scope was 
focused at least once a year.
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Transformation projects
There is a risk that the business transformation 
programmes undertaken by the Group could 
negatively impact the internal financial reporting 
control environment, in particular in areas of  
the business where there has been significant 
headcount reduction or new processes and 
procedures. There is a risk that there may  
no longer be an appropriate level of review  
and adequate segregation of duties.
We have tested the design and implementation and operating effectiveness 
of key business processes that have been subject to change. We have 
tested to determine whether appropriate segregation of duties exists 
within the Group’s system of internal controls. For example, the procedures 
included an assessment of the wider implementation of the new  
claims system.
Reinsurance asset valuation
The valuation of the reinsurance asset in respect  
of the ceded part of the insurance reserves requires 
significant judgement to reflect the counterparty risk 
exposure to long-term assets arising from PPOs.
We have tested the design and implementation and operating 
effectiveness of the key controls over the reinsurance asset valuation 
process. We have challenged management’s key assumptions  
over counterparty risk and the calculation methodology, including  
a comparison of the underlying credit ratings for key reinsurance 
counterparties to independent sources. We have also considered  
the consistency of the approach with the prior year.
Revenue recognition
International Standard on Auditing 240 (UK and 
Ireland) state this risk must always be treated as 
significant. We focus on the completeness of the 
revenue recorded in the financial statements and the 
flow of premium information from the underwriting 
systems to the financial reporting ledger.
We have tested the design and implementation and operating 
effectiveness of the key controls over revenue recognition, focusing  
on the flow of information from the underwriting systems to the financial 
reporting ledger. In addition, we performed substantive analytical 
testing procedures on the gross and unearned premium balances.
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 106 Opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors’ 
report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report  
by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report  
to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have  
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the Parent Company financial statements are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required  
to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of Directors’ 
remuneration have not been made or the part of the Directors’ 
remuneration report to be audited is not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns. We have nothing to report 
arising from these matters. 
Corporate governance statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the  
part of the corporate governance statement relating to  
the Company’s compliance with nine provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing to report 
arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), 
we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information 
in the Annual Report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited 
financial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired  
in the course of performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have 
identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge 
acquired during the audit and the Directors’ statement that  
they consider the Annual Report is fair, balanced and 
understandable and whether the Annual Report appropriately 
discloses those matters that we communicated to the Audit 
Committee which we consider should have been disclosed. 
We confirm that we have not identified any such 
inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of Directors  
and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities 
statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give  
a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express 
an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing  
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with 
the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
We also comply with International Standard on Quality  
Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools 
aim to ensure that our quality control procedures are effective, 
understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems 
include our dedicated professional standards review team, 
strategically focused second partner reviews and independent 
partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members,  
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters 
we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for 
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do 
not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our 
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts  
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies 
are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read 
all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual 
Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements and to identify any information that is 
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course 
of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.

Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 112 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013  113
Corporate information 
Direct Line Insurance Group plc is a public limited company 
incorporated in the United Kingdom. The address of the 
registered office is Churchill Court, Westmoreland Road, 
Bromley, BR1 1DP, England. 
1. Accounting policies 
Basis of preparation 
As required by the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of  
the EU IAS Regulation, the consolidated financial statements 
are prepared in accordance with IFRSs issued by the IASB  
as adopted by the EU. The financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with and full compliance with IFRSs  
as issued by the IASB. 
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on  
the historical cost basis except for available-for-sale (“AFS”) 
financial assets, investment property and derivative financial 
instruments, which are measured at fair value. 
The Company’s financial statements and the Group’s 
consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds 
Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company. 
The Group in its current structure was formed on 2 April 2012 
when the Company acquired Direct Line Versicherung AG  
from a former fellow subsidiary of The Royal Bank of Scotland 
Group plc. Therefore the basis of preparation represents a 
reorganisation of entities under common control, which is 
outside the scope of IFRS 3 ‘Busi ness Combinations’. Accordingly, 
as permitted by IAS 8 ‘Accounting Policies, Changes in 
Accounting Estimates and Errors’, it has been accounted for  
as a group reconstruction as described in Financial Reporting 
Standard 6, ‘Acquisitions and Mergers’. The consolidated 
financial statements have been prepared as if the transaction 
that gave rise to the formation of the Group had taken place  
at the beginning of 2011. Under these principles, the 
consolidated financial statements have been prepared  
as if the Company were the holding company of Direct Line 
Versicherung AG from 1 January 2011.  
As part of the divestment from RBS Group, the treatment of 
expenses incurred by RBS Group on behalf of the Group 
changed. Up until 30 June 2012, only some of these expenses 
were recharged to the Group by RBS Group. From 1 July 2012, 
some of the services previously provided by RBS Group have 
been brought in-house and so the related expenses are now 
incurred directly by the Group and reflected in expenses  
in the income statement; other services are still provided by  
RBS Group under transitional services agreements and the 
related expenses are charged to the Group. In order to aid 
comparability, the Group’s accounting policy was changed 
on 1 January 2011 so that all expenses were included within 
the income statement. For the avoidance of doubt, this includes 
external costs incurred by the Group and costs incurred by RBS 
Group, irrespective of whether RBS Group recharged them to 
the Group. In the case of expenses incurred by RBS Group 
and not recharged to the Group, a capital contribution was 
credited to retained earnings in the statement of changes in 
equity to reflect this contribution from a shareholder. In addition 
there was a further contribution of £6.3 million in respect of 
overseas taxation. 
The effect of the above on the Group profit for the year  
ended 31 December 2012 was to decrease profit after tax  
by £30.9 million, with an equal and opposite credit in the 
statement of changes in equity. 
Adoption of new and revised standards 
The following new or revised standards have been adopted  
in the year and have not had a material impact on the Group’s 
financial statements: 
IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ replaced SIC 12 
‘Consolidation – Special Purpose Entities’ and the consolidation 
elements of IAS 27 ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial 
Statements’. The new standard adopts a single definition  
of control: a reporting entity controls another entity when the 
reporting entity has the power to direct the activities of that 
other entity to generate returns for the reporting entity; 
IAS 27 ‘Separate Financial Statements’ was amended to 
delete all other aspects of the previous standard other than 
those dealing with separate financial statements; 
IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities’ covers 
disclosures for entities reporting under IFRS 10 and IFRS 11, 
replacing the requirements in IAS 28 and IAS 27. Entities are 
required to disclose information that helps users of financial 
statements evaluate the nature, risks and financial effects 
associated with an entity’s interests in subsidiaries, associates 
and joint arrangements and unconsolidated structured entities; 
IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ sets out a single IFRS 
framework for defining and measuring fair value and requiring 
disclosures about fair value measurements; 
IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income’ 
requires items that will never be recognised in the income 
statement to be presented in other comprehensive income 
separately from those that are subject to subsequent 
reclassification; 
IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure – Offsetting Financial 
Assets and Financial Liabilities’ was amended to allow users  
to consider the impact of netting arrangements as permitted  
by IAS 32 (paragraph 42) on the financial statements; and 
IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ was revised and requires  
the immediate recognition of all actuarial gains and  
losses eliminating the ‘corridor approach’; interest costs  
to be calculated on the net pension liability or asset at  
the appropriate bond rate; and all past service costs to  
be recognised immediately when a scheme is curtailed  
or amended. 
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 113
Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 
 Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 114 
1. Accounting policies continued 
1.1 Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial 
statements of the Company and the entities that are controlled 
by the Group at 31 December 2013 and 31 December 
2012. Control exists when the Group is exposed, or has 
rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity 
and has the ability to affect those returns through its power  
over the entity. In assessing if the Group controls another entity, 
the existence and effect of the potential voting rights that are 
currently exercisable or convertible are considered. 
Where necessary, adjustments have been made to the 
financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting 
policies used into line with those used by the Group.  
The policies set out below have been applied consistently 
throughout the years ended 31 December 2013 and  
31 December 2012 to items considered material to the 
consolidated financial statements. 
A subsidiary acquired is included in the consolidated financial 
statements from the date it is controlled by the Group until the 
date the Group ceases to control it. On acquisition of a 
subsidiary, its identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities are included in the consolidated financial statements 
at fair value. 
All intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses 
between Group entities are eliminated on consolidation. The 
consolidated financial statements are prepared using consistent 
accounting policies. 
1.2 Foreign currencies 
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented  
in Pounds Sterling which is the presentational currency of the 
Group. Group entities record transactions in the currency  
of the primary economic environment in which they operate 
(their functional currency), translated at the foreign exchange 
rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into 
the relevant functional currency at the foreign exchange rates 
ruling at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange differences 
arising on the settlement of foreign currency transactions  
and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities are 
reported in the income statement except for differences that 
arise on hedges of net investments in foreign operations,  
which were reported in other comprehensive income. 
Non-monetary items denominated in foreign currencies  
that are stated at fair value are translated into the relevant 
functional currency at the foreign exchange rates ruling at the 
dates the values are determined. Translation differences arising  
on non-monetary items measured at fair value are recognised  
in the income statement except for differences arising on AFS 
non-monetary financial assets, which are recognised in other 
comprehensive income. 
Assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill 
and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated 
into Pounds Sterling at the foreign exchange rates ruling at the 
balance sheet date. Income and expenses of foreign 
operations are translated into Pounds Sterling at average 
exchange rates unless these do not approximate the foreign 
exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Foreign 
exchange differences arising on the translation of a foreign 
operation are recognised in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income. The amount accumulated in equity is 
reclassified from equity to the consolidated income statement 
on disposal or partial disposal of a foreign operation. 
1.3 Contract classification 
Insurance contracts are those contracts where the Group  
(the insurer) has accepted significant insurance risk from 
another party (the policyholder) by agreeing to compensate  
the policyholder if a specified uncertain future event  
(the insured event) adversely affects the policyholder. 
Once a contract has been classified as an insurance contract, 
it remains an insurance contract for the remainder of its lifetime, 
even if the insurance risk reduces significantly during this 
period, unless all rights and obligations are extinguished. 
1.4 Revenue recognition 
Premiums earned 
Insurance and reinsurance premiums comprise the total premiums 
receivable for the whole period of cover provided by contracts 
incepted during the financial year, adjusted by an unearned 
premium provision, which represents the proportion of the 
premiums incepted in prior periods and that relate to periods 
of insurance cover after the balance sheet date. Unearned 
premiums are calculated over the period of exposure under  
the policy, on a daily basis, 24ths basis or allowing for the 
estimated incidence of exposure under policies. 
Premiums collected by intermediaries or other parties,  
but not yet received, are assessed based on estimates from 
underwriting or past experience, and are included in insurance 
premiums. Insurance premiums exclude insurance premium  
tax or equivalent local taxes and are shown gross of any 
commission payable to intermediaries or other parties. 
The long-term assurance contracts that the Group wrote 
included whole-life and term assurance contracts that were 
expected to remain in force for an extended period of time. 
The contracts insured events associated with human life  
(for example, death or the occurrence of a critical illness). 
These were recognised as revenue when they became 
payable by the contract holder. Premiums were shown  
before the deduction of commission. 
Investment return 
Interest income on financial assets is determined using the 
effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate  
method is a way of calculating the amortised cost of a 
financial asset (or group of financial assets) and of allocating 
the interest income over the expected life of the asset. In the 
case of financial assets classified as AFS, estimates are based 
on the straight-line method, which is a close approximation  
to the effective interest rate. 
Rental income from investment property is recognised in  
the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period  
of the contract. Any gains or losses arising from a change  
in fair value are recognised in the income statement. 
Instalment income 
Instalment income comprises the interest income earned  
on policyholder receivables, where outstanding premiums  
are settled by a series of instalment payments. Interest is 
earned using an effective interest rate method over the term  
of the policy. 
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 114  
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013  115
Other operating income 
Solicitors’ referral fee income 
Revenue relating to this activity is recognised when the service 
is rendered. The provision of these services is contractual and 
the associated cost is recognised when incurred. 
Vehicle replacement referral income 
Vehicle replacement referral income comprises fees in respect 
of referral income received when a customer or a non-fault 
policyholder (claimant) of another insurer has been provided 
with a hire vehicle from a preferred supplier. 
Income is recognised immediately when the customer or 
claimant is provided with the hire vehicle. 
Revenue from vehicle recovery and repair services 
Fees in respect of services for vehicle recovery are recognised 
as the right to consideration, and accrue through the provision 
of the service to the customer. The arrangements are generally 
contractual and the cost of providing the service is incurred as 
the service is rendered. The price is usually fixed and always 
determinable. 
The Group’s income also comprises vehicle repair services 
provided to other third-party customers. Income in respect  
of repairs to vehicles is recognised upon completion of the 
service. The price is determined using market rates for the 
services and materials used after discounts have been 
deducted where applicable. 
Management systems income represents the sale of tracking 
units, installation services and monitoring services. Revenue  
is recognised immediately, with the exception of the non-
cancellable network subscriptions receivable in advance, 
which are classified as deferred income in the balance sheet 
and recognised on a straight-line basis over the stated term  
of the subscription. 
Other income 
Commission fee income in respect of services is recognised 
when a policy has been placed and incepted. Income is 
stated excluding applicable sales taxes. 
1.5 Insurance claims 
Insurance claims are recognised in the accounting period in 
which the loss occurs. Provision is made for the full cost of 
settling outstanding claims at the balance sheet date, including 
claims incurred but not yet reported at that date, net of salvage 
and subrogation recoveries. Outstanding claims provisions are 
not discounted for the time value of money except for claims  
to be settled by PPOs established under the Courts Act 2003. 
A UK court can award damages for future pecuniary loss in 
respect of personal injury or for other damages in respect of 
personal injury and may order that the damages are wholly  
or partly to take the form of PPOs. These are covered in more 
detail in note 2.1. Costs for both direct and indirect claims 
handling expenses are also included. 
Provisions are determined by management based on 
experience of claims settled and on statistical models  
which require certain assumptions to be made regarding  
the incidence, timing and amount of claims and any specific 
factors such as adverse weather conditions. When calculating 
the total provision required, the historical development of  
claims is analysed using statistical methodology to extrapolate, 
within acceptable probability parameters, the value of 
outstanding claims (gross and net) at the balance sheet date. 
Also included in the estimation of outstanding claims are 
factors such as the potential for judicial or legislative inflation. 
In addition, an allowance is made for reinsurance assets 
deemed not recoverable. 
Provisions for more recent claims make use of techniques  
that incorporate expected loss ratios and average claims  
cost (adjusted for inflation) and frequency methods. As claims 
mature, the provisions are increasingly driven by methods 
based on actual claims experience. The approach adopted 
takes into account the nature, type and significance of the 
business and the type of data available, with large claims 
generally being assessed separately. The data used for 
statistical modelling purposes is generated internally and 
reconciled to the accounting data. 
The calculation is particularly sensitive to the estimation of  
the ultimate cost of claims for the particular classes of business 
at gross and net levels and the estimation of future claims 
handling costs. Actual claims experience may differ from the 
historical pattern on which the actuarial best estimate is based 
and the cost of settling individual claims may exceed that 
assumed. As a result, the Group sets provisions at a margin 
above the actuarial best estimate. This amount is recorded  
as claims provisions. 
A liability adequacy provision is made for unexpired risks 
arising where the expected value of net claims and expenses 
attributable to the unexpired periods of policies in force at the 
balance sheet date exceeds the unearned premium reserve in 
relation to such policies after the deduction of any acquisition 
costs deferred and other prepaid amounts (for example, 
reinsurance). The expected value is determined by reference  
to recent experience and allowing for changes to the premium 
rates. The provision for unexpired risks is calculated separately 
by reference to classes of business that are managed together 
after taking account of relevant investment returns. 
1.6 Reinsurance 
The Group has reinsurance treaties and other reinsurance 
contracts that transfer significant insurance risk. 
The Group cedes insurance risk by reinsurance in the normal 
course of business, with the arrangement and retention limits 
varying by product line. Outward reinsurance premiums are 
generally accounted for in the same accounting period as  
the premiums for the related direct business being reinsured. 
Outward reinsurance recoveries are accounted for in the same 
accounting period as the direct claims to which they relate. 
Reinsurance assets include balances due from reinsurance 
companies for ceded insurance liabilities. Amounts recoverable 
from reinsurers are estimated in a consistent manner with the 
outstanding claims provisions or settled claims associated with 
the reinsured policies and in accordance with the relevant 
reinsurance contract. Recoveries in respect of PPOs are 
discounted for the time value of money. 
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 115
Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 
 Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 116 
1. Accounting policies continued  
A reinsurance bad debt provision is assessed in respect of 
reinsurance debtors, to allow for the risk that the reinsurance 
asset may not be collected or where the reinsurer’s credit  
rating has been downgraded significantly. This also includes 
an assessment in respect of the ceded part of claims provisions 
to reflect the counterparty risk exposure to long-term reinsurance 
assets particularly in relation to periodical payments. This  
is affected by the Group reducing the carrying value of the 
asset accordingly and the impairment loss is recognised  
in the income statement. 
1.7 Deferred acquisition costs 
Acquisition costs relating to new and renewing insurance 
policies are matched with the earning of the premiums to 
which they relate. A proportion of acquisition costs incurred 
during the year is therefore deferred to the subsequent 
accounting period to match the extent to which premiums 
written during the year are unearned at the balance  
sheet date. 
The principal acquisition costs deferred are direct advertising 
expenditure, administration costs, commission paid and costs 
associated with telesales and underwriting staff. 
1.8 Goodwill and other intangible assets 
Acquired goodwill, being the excess of the cost of an 
acquisition over the Group’s interest in the net fair value  
of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities  
of the subsidiary, associate or joint venture acquired, is  
initially recognised at cost and subsequently at cost less  
any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill arising on  
the acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures  
is included in the balance sheet category ‘goodwill and  
other intangible assets’. The gain or loss on the disposal  
of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture includes the  
carrying value of any related goodwill. 
Intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated  
at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. 
Amortisation is charged to the income statement over the 
assets’ economic lives using methods that best reflect the 
pattern of economic benefits and is included in operating 
expenses. The estimated useful economic lives are as follows: 
Software development costs 5 years 
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is 
written off as incurred. Direct costs relating to the development 
of internal-use computer software and associated business 
processes are capitalised once technical feasibility and 
economic viability have been established. These costs include 
payroll costs, the costs of materials and services, and directly 
attributable overheads. Capitalisation of costs ceases when the 
software is capable of operating as intended. During and after 
development, accumulated costs are reviewed for impairment 
against the projected benefits that the software is expected to 
generate. Costs incurred prior to the establishment of technical 
feasibility and economic viability are expensed as incurred,  
as are all training costs and general overheads. The costs of 
licences to use computer software that is expected to generate 
economic benefits beyond one year are also capitalised. 
1.9 Property, plant and equipment 
Items of property, plant and equipment (except investment 
property – see accounting policy 1.11) are stated at cost  
less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Where 
an item of property, plant and equipment comprises major 
components having different useful lives, they are accounted 
for separately. 
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a  
straight-line basis so as to write off the depreciable amount  
of property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful 
lives. The depreciable amount is the cost of an asset less its 
residual value. Land is not depreciated. Estimated useful lives 
are as follows: 
Freehold and long  
leasehold buildings 
50 years or the period of the 
lease if shorter 
Vehicles 3 years 
Computer equipment Up to 5 years 
Other equipment, including 
property adaptation costs 
2 to 15 years 
The gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an item of 
property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference 
between the disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying 
amount of the item. 
1.10 Impairment of intangible assets, goodwill and property, 
plant and equipment 
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is 
any indication that its intangible assets, goodwill or property, 
plant and equipment are impaired. If any such indication 
exists, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the  
asset and the impairment loss, if any. Goodwill is tested for 
impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes  
in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. If an asset 
does not generate cash flows that are independent of those  
of other assets or groups of assets, the recoverable amount is 
determined for the cash-generating unit (“CGU”) to which the 
asset belongs. The recoverable amount of an asset is the 
higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. 
Value in use is the present value of future cash flows from the 
asset or CGU, discounted at a rate that reflects market interest 
rates, adjusted for risks specific to the asset or CGU that have 
not been reflected in the estimation of future cash flows. 
If the recoverable amount of an intangible or a tangible asset 
is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognised 
immediately in the income statement and the carrying value  
of the asset is reduced by the amount of the impairment loss. 
A reversal of an impairment loss on intangible assets or 
property, plant and equipment is recognised as it arises 
provided the increased carrying value does not exceed the 
carrying amount that would have been determined had no 
impairment loss been recognised. Impairment losses on 
goodwill are not reversed. 
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 116  
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013  117
1.11 Investment property 
Investment property comprises freehold and long-leasehold 
properties that are held to earn rentals or for capital 
appreciation or both. Investment property is not depreciated, 
but is stated at fair value based on valuations by independent 
registered valuers. Fair value is based on current prices for 
similar properties adjusted for the specific characteristics of 
each property. Any gain or loss arising from a change in fair 
value is recognised in the income statement. 
Investment property is derecognised either when it has been 
disposed of, or permanently withdrawn from use and no future 
economic benefit is expected from disposal. Any gains or 
losses on the retirement or disposal of investment property are 
recognised in the income statement in the year of retirement  
or disposal. 
1.12 Financial assets 
Financial assets are classified as held-to-maturity, AFS, 
designated at fair value through profit or loss, or loans and 
receivables. The Group only has AFS financial assets and 
loans and receivables.  
AFS 
Financial assets that are not classified as loans and receivables 
are classified as AFS. Financial assets can be designated as 
AFS on initial recognition. AFS financial assets are initially 
recognised at fair value plus directly related transaction costs. 
They are subsequently measured at fair value. Impairment 
losses and exchange differences resulting from retranslating  
the amortised cost of foreign currency monetary AFS financial 
assets are recognised in the income statement, together with 
interest calculated using the effective interest rate method. 
Other changes in the fair value of AFS financial assets are 
reported in a separate component of shareholders’ equity  
until disposal, when the cumulative gain or loss is recognised 
in the income statement. 
Regular way purchases of financial assets classified as loans 
and receivables are recognised on settlement date; all other 
regular way purchases are recognised on trade date. 
A financial asset is regarded as quoted in an active market  
if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an 
exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or 
regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and 
regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length 
basis. The appropriate quoted market price for an asset held  
is usually the current bid price. When current bid prices are 
unavailable, the price of the most recent transaction provides 
evidence of the current fair value as long as there has not been 
a significant change in economic circumstances since the time 
of the transaction. If conditions have changed since the time  
of the transaction (for example, a change in the risk-free interest 
rate following the most recent price quote for a corporate 
bond), the fair value reflects the change in conditions by 
reference to current prices or rates for similar financial 
instruments, as appropriate. 
The valuation methodology described above uses observable 
market data. 
If the market for a financial asset is not active, the Group 
establishes the fair value by using a valuation technique. 
Valuation techniques include using recent arm’s length market 
transactions between knowledgeable and willing parties  
(if available), reference to the current fair value of another 
instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash  
flow analysis and option pricing models. If there is a valuation 
technique commonly used by market participants to price  
the instrument and that technique has been demonstrated to 
provide reliable estimates of prices obtained in actual market 
transactions, the Group uses that technique. 
The fair value of other investments that do not have a quoted 
market price in an active market and derivatives that are linked 
to and must be settled by delivery of such an unquoted equity 
instrument are reliably measurable if: 
(a) the variability in the range of reasonable fair value 
estimates is not significant for that instrument; or 
(b) the probabilities of the various estimates within the range 
can reasonably be assessed and used in estimating 
fair value. 
Loans and receivables 
Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable 
repayments that are not quoted in an active market are 
classified as loans and receivables, except those that are 
classified as AFS. Loans and receivables are initially 
recognised at fair value plus directly related transaction costs 
and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate method less any impairment losses. 
Insurance receivables comprise outstanding insurance 
premiums where the policyholders have elected to pay in 
instalments, or amounts due from third parties where they have 
collected or are due to collect the money from the policyholder. 
Impairment of financial assets 
At each balance sheet date the Group assesses whether there 
is any objective evidence that a financial asset or group of 
financial assets classified as AFS or loans and receivables is 
impaired. A financial asset or portfolio of financial assets is 
impaired and an impairment loss incurred, if there is objective 
evidence that an event or events since initial recognition of the 
asset have adversely affected the amount or timing of future 
cash flows from the asset. 
AFS 
When a decline in the fair value of a financial asset classified as 
AFS has been recognised directly in equity and there is objective 
evidence that the asset is impaired, the cumulative loss is 
removed from equity and recognised in the income statement. 
The loss is measured as the difference between the amortised 
cost of the financial asset and its current fair value. Impairment 
losses on AFS equity instruments are not reversed through profit 
or loss, but those on AFS debt instruments are reversed, if there  
is an increase in fair value that is objectively related to a 
subsequent event. Subsequent increases in the fair value  
of AFS other investment funds were recognised in equity. 
Loans and receivables 
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on a 
financial asset or group of financial assets classified as loans 
and receivables has been incurred, the Group measures the 
amount of the loss as the difference between the carrying 
amount of the asset or group of assets and the present value  
of estimated future cash flows from the asset or group of assets, 
discounted at the effective interest rate of the instrument at 
initial recognition. 
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 117
Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 
 Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 118 
1. Accounting policies continued 
Impairment losses are assessed individually where significant 
or collectively for assets that are not individually significant. 
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement and 
the carrying amount of the financial asset or group of financial 
assets is reduced by establishing an allowance for the 
impairment losses. If in a subsequent period the amount of the 
impairment loss reduces and the reduction can be ascribed to 
an event after the impairment was recognised, the previously 
recognised loss is reversed by adjusting the allowance. 
For amounts due from policyholders, the bad debt provision  
is calculated based upon prior loss experience. For all 
balances outstanding in excess of three months, a bad debt 
provision is made. Where a policy is subsequently cancelled, 
the outstanding debt that is overdue is charged to the income 
statement and the bad debt provision is released back to the 
income statement. 
Derivatives and hedging 
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially, and 
subsequently measured, at fair value. Derivative fair values  
are determined from quoted prices in active markets where 
available. Where there is no active market for an instrument, 
fair value is derived from prices for the derivative’s components 
using appropriate pricing or valuation models. 
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of a 
derivative are recognised as they arise in the income statement 
unless the derivative is the hedging instrument in a qualifying 
hedge. The Group enters into a number of hedge relationships 
for cash flow and fair value hedges. Previously the Group 
entered into hedge relationships for net investments. 
Hedge relationships are formally documented at inception.  
The documentation identifies the hedged item and the hedging 
instrument and details the risk that is being hedged and the 
way in which effectiveness will be assessed at inception and 
during the period of the hedge. If the hedge is not highly 
effective in offsetting changes in cash flows and fair values 
attributable to the hedged risk, consistent with the documented 
risk management strategy, or if the hedging instrument expires 
or is sold, terminated or exercised, hedge accounting is 
discontinued. 
In the hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation,  
the portion of foreign exchange differences arising on the 
hedging instrument determined to be an effective hedge were 
recognised directly in equity, where they remain until disposal 
or partial disposal of the associated subsidiaries. Any 
ineffective portion was recognised in the income statement. 
Non-derivative financial liabilities as well as derivatives may 
have been the hedging instrument in a net investment hedge. 
In a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or 
loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity. 
Any ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement. 
In a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument is recognised in the income statement. The gain  
or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is 
recognised in the income statement and, where the hedged 
item is measured at amortised cost, adjusts the carrying  
amount of the hedged item. 
Derecognition of financial assets 
A financial asset is derecognised when the rights to receive  
the cash flows from that asset have expired or when the Group 
has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset 
and has transferred substantially all the risk and rewards of 
ownership of the asset. 
1.13 Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and 
demand deposits with banks together with short-term highly 
liquid investments that are readily convertible to known 
amounts of cash and subject to insignificant risk of change  
in value. 
Borrowings, comprising bank overdrafts, are measured  
at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. 
1.14 Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value net  
of transaction costs incurred. Other than derivatives which  
are recognised and measured at fair value, all other financial 
liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest rate method. 
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under 
the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. 
1.15 Subordinated liabilities 
Subordinated liabilities comprise subordinated dated loan 
notes and undated loans, which are initially measured  
at the consideration received less related transaction costs. 
Subsequently, subordinated liabilities are measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. 
1.16 Provisions 
The Group recognises a provision for a present legal or 
constructive obligation from a past event when it is more likely 
than not that it will be required to transfer economic benefits to 
settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. 
The Group makes provision for all insurance industry levies, 
such as the Financial Services Compensation Scheme and 
Motor Insurance Bureau. 
When the Group has an onerous contract, it recognises  
the present obligation under the contract as a provision.  
A contract is onerous when the unavoidable costs of  
meeting the contractual obligations exceed the expected  
future economic benefit. In respect of leasehold properties,  
a provision is recognised when the Group has a detailed 
formal plan to vacate the leasehold property, or significantly 
reduce its level of occupancy, the plan has been 
communicated to those affected and the future property  
costs under the lease exceed future economic benefits. 
Restructuring provisions are made, including redundancy costs, 
when the Group has a constructive obligation to restructure.  
An obligation exists when the Group has a detailed formal 
plan and has communicated the plan to those affected. 
1.17 Leases 
Payments made under operating leases are charged to the 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of  
the lease. 
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 118  
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013  119
1.18 Pensions and other post-retirement benefits 
The Group provides post-retirement benefits in the form  
of pensions and healthcare plans to eligible employees. 
Contributions to the Group’s defined contribution pension 
scheme are recognised in the income statement when payable. 
The Group’s defined benefit pension scheme, as described in 
note 32, was closed in 2003. Scheme liabilities are measured 
on an actuarial basis, using the projected unit credit method 
and discounted at a rate that reflects the current rate of return 
on a high-quality corporate bond of equivalent term and 
currency to the scheme liabilities. 
Scheme assets are measured at their fair value. Any surplus  
or deficit of scheme assets over liabilities is recognised in 
the balance sheet as an asset (surplus) or liability (deficit).  
The current service cost and any past service costs together 
with the net interest on net pension liability or asset, is charged 
or credited to operating expenses. Actuarial gains and losses 
are recognised in full in the period in which they occur outside 
the income statement and presented in other comprehensive 
income under ‘Items that will not be reclassified subsequently  
to profit or loss’. 
1.19 Taxation 
The tax charge or credit represents the sum of the tax currently 
payable or receivable and deferred tax. 
The current tax charge is based on the taxable profits for  
the year as determined in accordance with the relevant tax 
legislation, after any adjustments in respect of prior years. 
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income 
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that 
are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes 
items that are never taxable or deductible. 
Provision for taxation is calculated using tax rates that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet 
date, and is allocated over profits before taxation and amounts 
charged or credited to components of other comprehensive 
income and equity, as appropriate. 
Deferred taxation is accounted for in full using the balance 
sheet liability method on all temporary differences between  
the carrying amount of an asset or liability for accounting 
purposes and its carrying amount for tax purposes. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable 
temporary timing differences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable  
profits will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. 
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date 
and reduced to the extent that it is probable that they will not 
be recovered. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the tax rates 
expected to apply when the assets are realised or liabilities are 
settled based on laws and rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax  
is charged or credited in the income statement, except when  
it relates to items charged or credited to other comprehensive 
income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in 
other comprehensive income. 
1.20 Share-based payments 
The Group operates a number of share-based compensation 
plans under which it awards Company shares and share 
options to its employees. Such awards are generally subject  
to vesting conditions that vary the amount of cash or shares  
to which an employee is entitled. 
Vesting conditions include service conditions (requiring  
the employee to complete a specified period of service)  
and performance conditions (requiring the employee to  
meet specified performance targets). 
The fair value of options granted is estimated using valuation 
techniques which incorporate exercise price, term, risk-free 
interest rates, the current share price and its expected volatility. 
The cost of employee services received in exchange for an 
award of shares or share options granted is measured by 
reference to the fair value of the shares or share options on the 
date the award is granted and takes into account non-vesting 
conditions and market performance conditions (conditions 
related to the market price of the Company’s shares). 
The cost is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period (the period during which all the specified vesting 
conditions must be satisfied) with a corresponding increase  
in equity in an equity-settled award, or a corresponding 
liability in a cash-settled award. The cost is adjusted for vesting 
conditions (other than market performance conditions) so as to 
reflect the number of shares or share options that actually vest. 
The cancellation of an award through failure to meet  
non-vesting conditions triggers an immediate expense  
for any unrecognised element of the cost of an award. 
1.21 Capital instruments 
The Group classifies a financial instrument that it issues as a 
financial liability or an equity instrument in accordance with  
the substance of the contractual arrangement. An instrument is 
classified as a liability if it is a contractual obligation to deliver 
cash or another financial asset, or to exchange financial assets 
or financial liabilities on potentially unfavourable terms, or as 
equity if it evidences a residual interest in the assets of the 
Group after the deduction of liabilities. 
The consideration for any Ordinary Share of the Company 
purchased by the Group for the benefit of the employee trusts 
is deducted from equity.  
1.22 Dividends 
Interim dividends on Ordinary Shares are recognised in  
equity in the period in which they are paid. Final dividends  
on Ordinary Shares are recognised when they have been 
approved at the AGM.

1. Accounting policies continued 
1.23 Accounting developments 
In December 2011, the IASB amended IAS 32 ‘Financial 
Instruments: Presentation’ for the section dealing with offsetting 
a financial asset and a financial liability. Effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, to be applied 
retrospectively, this amendment is not expected to have any 
effect on the Group. 
IFRS 9 ’Financial Instruments’ is a new standard that is intended 
to replace IAS 39 ‘Financial instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement’ in its entirety. The replacement project consists 
of three planned phases and will impact the measurement and 
disclosures of financial instruments. 
The first phase will change the basis and treatment of the 
classification and measurement of financial assets and  
financial liabilities. 
The second phase is the impairment methodology and a 
revised exposure draft in March 2013 has proposed a more 
forward-thinking impairment model that reflects expected credit 
losses as opposed to the incurred loss model in IAS 39. 
The final phase will cover hedge accounting for both general 
hedge accounting and macro hedge accounting. 
There is currently no mandatory effective date for IFRS 9. 
2. Critical accounting estimates and judgements 
The reported results of the Group are sensitive to the 
accounting policies, assumptions and estimates that underlie 
the preparation of its financial information. The Group’s 
principal accounting policies are set out on pages 113 to 
120. UK company law and IFRSs require the Directors, in 
preparing the Group’s financial statements, to select suitable 
accounting policies, apply them consistently and make 
judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent.  
In the absence of an applicable standard or interpretation,  
IAS 8 requires management to develop and apply an 
accounting policy that results in relevant and reliable 
information in the light of the requirements and guidance in 
IFRS dealing with similar and related issues and the IASB’s 
Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial 
Statements. The judgements and assumptions involved in the 
Group’s accounting policies that are considered by the Board 
to be the most important to the portrayal of its financial 
condition are discussed below. The use of estimates, 
assumptions or models that differ from those adopted  
by the Group would affect its reported results. 
2.1 General insurance: outstanding claims provisions and 
related reinsurance recoveries 
The Group makes provision for the full cost of outstanding claims 
from its general insurance business at the balance sheet date, 
including claims estimated to have been incurred but not yet 
reported at that date and claims handling provision. Outstanding 
claims provisions net of related reinsurance recoveries and 
liability adequacy provision at 31 December 2013 amounted 
to £4,840.1 million (2012: £5,377.6 million). 
Claims reserves are assessed separately for large and 
attritional claims typically using normal actuarial methods  
of projection. Key judgements in this assessment include  
the selection of specific methods as well as assumptions for 
claims frequency and severity through the review of historical 
claims and emerging trends. The corresponding reinsurance 
recoveries are also calculated on an equivalent basis as 
discussed in note 1.6. 
The most common method of settling bodily injury claims is by 
a lump sum paid to the claimant and, in the cases where this 
includes an element of indemnity for recurring costs such as 
loss of earnings or ongoing medical care, settlement normally 
occurs using a standardised Ogden annuity factor at a 
discount rate of 2.5%. This is normally referred to as the 
Ogden discount rate. Other estimates are also required for 
case management expenses, loss of pension, court protection 
fees, alterations to accommodation and transportation fees. 
In August 2012, the MoJ announced a review of the  
approach to setting the Ogden discount rate within the  
existing legal framework in light of the current economic 
climate. The consultation has now taken place and the 
results are pending. In addition, in February 2013, a further 
consultation was initiated on the legal framework within which 
the rate is set as well as consideration of the usage of PPOs  
as a form of settlement. The latest consultation closed in June 
2013 and the results are pending. 
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 120  
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013  121
The Group holds provisions for a reduction in the Ogden discount rate at 31 December 2013 to 1.5% (2012: 1.5%). Details  
of sensitivity analysis to the assumed Ogden discount rate are shown in 3.3.1. 
PPOs give rise to additional claims costs which are in excess of those calculated based on the Ogden tables and discounting  
is applied to the total cost of the PPO and not just the additional cost. The table below analyses the outstanding PPO claims 
provisions on a discounted and an undiscounted basis at 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012. These represent the 
total cost of PPOs rather than any costs in excess of purely Ogden-based settlement.

The provision for PPOs have been categorised as either claims which have already settled as PPOs (approved PPO claims 
provisions) and those expected to settle as PPOs in the future (anticipated PPOs). Anticipated PPOs consists of both existing  
large loss case reserves including allowances for development as well as claims yet to be reported to the Group. Reinsurance  
is applied at claim level and the net cash flows are discounted for the time value of money. The discount rate is consistent with 
the long duration of the claims payments and the assumed future indexation of the claims payments. 
In the majority of cases, the inflation index agreed in the settlement is the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings inflation published 
by the Office for National Statistics, for which the long-term rate is assumed to be 4.0% (2012: 4.0%). The rate of interest used 
for the calculation of present values is 4.0% (2012: 4.0%), which results in a real discount rate of 0.0% (2012: 0.0%).  
Details of sensitivity analysis to the discount rate applied to PPO claims are shown in note 3.3.1. 
2.2 Impairment provisions – financial assets 
AFS 
The Group determines that AFS financial assets are impaired when there is objective evidence that an event or events since initial 
recognition of the assets have adversely affected the amount or timing of future cash flows from the asset. The determination of 
which events could have adversely affected the amount or timing of future cash flows from the asset requires judgement. In 
making this judgement, the Group evaluates, among other factors, the normal price volatility of the financial asset, the financial 
health of the investee, industry and sector performance, changes in technology and operational and financing cash flow or 
where there has been a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the asset below its cost. Impairment may be 
appropriate when there is evidence of deterioration in these factors. 
On a quarterly basis, the Group reviews whether there is any objective evidence that the direct investments in AFS debt securities 
are impaired based on the following criteria: 
• price performance of a particular AFS debt security, or group of AFS debt securities, demonstrating an adverse trend compared 
to the market as a whole; 
• adverse movements in the credit rating for corporate debt; 
• actual, or imminent, default on coupon interest or nominal; or 
• offer on buyback of perpetual bonds below par value. 
Impairment provision charges on AFS financial assets at 31 December 2013 amounted to £nil (2012: £nil). 
Had all the declines in AFS asset values met the criteria above at 31 December 2013, the Group would suffer a further  
£40.4 million loss (2012: £21.5 million loss), being the transfer of the total AFS reserve for unrealised losses to the income 
statement. These movements represent mark-to-market movements and where there is no objective evidence of any loss events  
that could affect future cash flows, no impairments are recorded for these movements.

2. Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued  
2.3 Fair value 
Financial assets classified as AFS debt securities are recognised in the financial statements at fair value. The fair value of all AFS 
debt securities was determined using observable market input and at 31 December 2013 amounted to £7,005.5 million 
(2012: £7,156.5 million).  
Freehold and long leasehold properties that are classified as investment properties are recognised in the financial statements  
at fair value. The fair value at 31 December 2013 amounted to £223.4 million (2012: £128.9 million) was determined using 
a valuation model that includes inputs that are unobservable. 
Estimation of the fair value of assets and liabilities 
In estimating the fair value of financial assets and investment properties the methods and assumptions used by the Group 
incorporate: 
Financial assets and liabilities 
For fixed maturity securities, fair values are generally based upon quoted market prices. Where market prices are not readily 
available, fair values are estimated using values obtained from quoted market prices of comparable securities. 
Investment property 
Investment property is recorded at fair value, measured by independent valuers who hold a recognised and relevant professional 
qualifications. The valuation model is driven predominantly by unobservable inputs, as although in part the valuations are 
compared with recent market transactions for similar properties, they are adjusted for the specific characteristics of each property. 
For disclosure purposes, fair value measurements are classified as Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the degree to which fair value  
is observable: 
Level 1 financial assets are measured in whole or in part by reference to published quotes in an active market. In an active 
market quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service  
or regulatory agency and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis. 
Level 2 financial assets are measured using a valuation technique based on assumptions that are supported by prices from 
observable current market transactions. These are assets for which pricing is obtained via pricing services, but where prices have 
not been determined in an active market, or financial assets with fair values based on broker quotes, investments in private equity 
funds with fair values obtained via fund managers or assets that are valued using the Group’s own models whereby the majority 
of assumptions are market-observable. 
Level 3 fair value measurements used for investment properties are those derived from a valuation technique that include inputs for 
the asset that are unobservable. 
2.4 Deferred acquisition costs 
The Group defers a proportion of acquisition costs incurred during the year to subsequent accounting periods. Management use 
estimation techniques to determine the level of costs to be deferred, by category of business. Judgement is used to determine the 
types of cost that can be deferred and these are referred to in note 1.7. The total deferred acquisition costs at 31 December 
2013 amounted to £321.5 million (2012: £327.6 million). During 2013, the Group reviewed these costs included in the 
calculation of deferred acquisition costs and considers them to be appropriate, and has determined that they are recoverable. 
2.5 Goodwill 
The Group capitalises goodwill arising on the acquisition of businesses as discussed in note 1.8. The carrying value of goodwill 
at 31 December 2013 was £211.0 million (2012: £211.0 million). 
Goodwill is the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of its net assets. The determination of the fair value 
of assets and liabilities of businesses acquired requires the exercise of management judgement; for example those financial assets 
and liabilities for which there are no quoted prices and those non-financial assets where valuations reflect estimates of market 
conditions, such as property. Different fair values would result in changes to the goodwill arising and to the post-acquisition 
performance. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Group’s CGUs or 
groups of CGUs expected to benefit from the combination. Goodwill impairment testing involves the comparison of the carrying 
value of a CGU or group of CGUs with its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the CGU’s fair value 
and its value in use. Value in use is the present value of expected future cash flows from the CGU or group of CGUs. Fair value 
is the amount obtainable from the sale of the CGU in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties. 
Impairment testing inherently involves a number of judgemental areas: the preparation of the five-year strategic plan and the 
extrapolation of cash flow forecasts beyond the normal requirements of management reporting; the assessment of the discount 
rate appropriate to the business; estimation of the fair value of CGUs; and the valuation of the separable assets of each business  
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 122  
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013  123
whose goodwill is being reviewed. Details of a sensitivity analysis on the recoverable amount in excess of carrying value are 
shown in note 16. 
2.6 Property, plant and equipment 
The Group does not revalue property, plant and equipment. However it takes appropriate steps to consider whether the 
aggregate value of property, plant and equipment exceeds the balance sheet carrying value of such items. 
The Group is satisfied that the aggregate value of property, plant and equipment are not less than their carrying value. 
3. Risk management 
3.1 Enterprise-Wide Risk Management framework 
The ERM framework within the Group is designed to ensure that risk management is a forward-looking discipline, focused on 
facilitating appropriate and fair outcomes on a consistent and reliable basis for all stakeholders. The ERM process provides the 
Group with a consistent and holistic view of risk management. Further information can be found in the Risk management section  
of the Strategic report on page 22. 
3.2 Risk and capital management modelling 
The Board has ultimate responsibility for ensuring that the Group has sufficient funds to meet its liabilities as they fall due. The 
Group carries out detailed modelling of its assets, liabilities and the key risks to which these are exposed. This modelling includes 
the Group’s own assessment of its capital requirements for solvency purposes. The assessment is submitted to the PRA as the ICA 
in respect of its UK regulated entities. The ICA quantifies the insurance, market, counterparty, liquidity, operational and Group risk 
that the UK regulated entities are undertaking. 
The Board is closely involved in the ICA process and reviews and approves its assumptions and results. 
3.3 Principal risks from insurance activities and use of financial instruments 
The Risk management section of the Strategic Report sets out all the risks assessed by the Group as principal risks. Detailed below 
is the Group’s risk exposure arising from its insurance activities and use of financial instruments specifically in respect of insurance 
risk, market risk and counterparty risk. 
3.3.1 Insurance risk 
Insurance risk can arise from: 
• fluctuations in the timing, frequency and severity of insured events and their ultimate settlement, relative to the expectations of 
the Group at the time of underwriting, including those driven by inaccurate pricing, inappropriate underwriting guidelines and 
terms and conditions, and holding inadequate reserves; 
• inadequate reinsurance protection; and 
• concentration of business leading to unexpected claim levels (frequency and severity) from a single source. 
The Group predominantly underwrites personal lines insurance including motor, residential property, roadside assistance, 
creditor, travel and pet business. The Group also underwrites commercial risks primarily for low-to-medium risk trades within  
the SME market. Contracts are typically issued on an annual basis, which means that the Group’s liability usually extends for  
a 12-month period, after which the Group is entitled to decline to renew or can impose renewal terms by amending the  
premium or other policy terms and conditions such as the excess as appropriate. 
Prior to July 2011, the Group underwrote long-term insurance falling within the business classes of life and annuity and permanent 
health. From 6 July 2011 the Group ceased accepting new business. The products provided included mortgage life cover, fixed 
term cover with critical illness, over 50s life cover and the life cover associated with the creditor business underwritten by the 
Group’s general insurance business. Contracts were issued typically on a long-term basis, which means that the Group’s liability 
extended for a period ranging from five years up to 52 years. On 28 November 2013, the Life business was sold and liability 
was transferred away from the Group. 
For creditor insurance, contracts are issued either on a monthly renewable basis (regular premium), which can be amended  
or cancelled by the customer at any point during the contract, or cover period of a loan (single premium). In the former case,  
the Group can cancel or amend the policy following a 90-day written notice period. In the latter case (these policies were 
withdrawn from sale in April 2009), the customer has the option to cancel the contract at any point but generally the Group  
is obligated for the full term up to a maximum of 10 years, but typically three to five years. 
Reserving risk 
Reserving risk relates to both premiums and claims. It is the risk that reserves are assessed incorrectly, such that either insufficient 
funds have been retained to pay or handle claims as the amounts fall due both in relation to those claims which have already 
been incurred (in relation to claims reserves) or will be incurred in future periods of insurance (in relation to premium reserves),  
or a surplus of funds has been retained resulting in opportunity costs. 
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 123
Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 
 Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 124 
3. Risk management continued  
Reserving risk is controlled through a range of processes: 
• regular periodic reviews of the claims, premium and liability adequacy reserves for the main classes of business by the internal 
actuarial team; 
• the use of external actuaries to review periodically the actuarial best estimate reserves produced internally, either through peer 
review or through provision of independent reserve estimates; 
• accompanying all reserve reviews with actuarial assessment of the uncertainties through a variety of techniques including 
bootstrapping and scenario analysis; 
• oversight of the reserving process by relevant senior management and the Board; 
• regular reconciliation of the data used in the actuarial reviews against general ledger data and reconciliation of the claims 
data history against the equivalent data from prior reviews; and 
• assessing the volatility in the reserves to help the Board set management best estimate reserves. 
The Group’s reserves are particularly susceptible to potential retrospective changes in legislation and new court decisions, for 
example, a change in the Ogden discount rate. This is the discount rate set by the relevant government bodies and used by 
courts to calculate lump sum awards in bodily injury cases. The rate is currently 2.5% per annum but is under review by the MoJ. 
From 2010, the Group has calculated its estimated reserve based on an assumed Ogden discount rate of 1.5%, in recognition 
of the uncertainty regarding the future rate. 
As referred to on page 25, uncertainty in claims reserve estimation is larger for claims such as PPOs for which annually indexed 
payments are made periodically over several years or even the lifetime of the injured party. Claims reserves for PPOs are held  
on a discounted basis and the table below indicates the sensitivity of discounted claims reserves to changes in the discount rate. 
The table below provides a sensitivity analysis of the potential impact of a change in a single factor with all other assumptions  
left unchanged. Other potential risks beyond the ones described in the table and above could have an additional financial 
impact on the Group.

Notes:  
1. The sensitivities relating to an increase or decrease in the discount rate used for PPOs illustrate a movement in the time value of money from the assumed level  
of 4.0%. An increase in the discount rate reflects a decrease in the time value of money and therefore the present value of future liabilities which increases the 
total equity which would be reflected in the income statement. 
2. The selection of these sensitivities should not be interpreted as a prediction. 
3. The sensitivities set out above include the impact of reinsurance, but exclude the impact of taxation.  
Claims management risk 
Claims management risk is the risk that claims are paid or handled inappropriately. 
Claims are managed utilising a range of IT system driven controls coupled with manual processes outlined in detailed policies 
and procedures to ensure claims are handled in an appropriate, timely and accurate manner. 
Each member of staff has a specified handling authority, with controls preventing them handling or paying claims outside  
their authority, as well as controls to mitigate the risk of paying invalid claims. In addition, there are various outsourced claims 
handling arrangements, all of which are monitored closely by management, with similar principles applying in terms of the 
controls and procedures. 
Loss adjustors are used in certain circumstances to handle claims to conclusion. This involves liaison with the policyholder, third 
parties, suppliers and the claims function. 
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 124  
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013  125
Specialist bodily injury claims teams in the UK are responsible for handling these types of losses with the nature of handling 
dependent on the level and type of claim. Where applicable, they are referred to the technical and large loss teams who also 
deal with all other claim types above defined limits or within specific criteria. 
A process is in place in the UK business to deal with major weather and other catastrophic events, known as the ‘Surge Demand 
Plan’. A surge is the collective name given to an incident which significantly increases the volume of claims reported to the 
Group’s claims functions. The plan covers surge demand triggers, stages of incident, operational impact, communication and 
management information monitoring of the impact. 
Reinsurance risk 
The Group uses reinsurance to: 
• protect the insurance results against low-frequency, high-severity losses through the transfer of catastrophe claims volatility  
to reinsurers; 
• protect the insurance results against unforeseen volumes of, or adverse trends in, large individual claims in order to reduce 
volatility and to improve stability of earnings; 
• reduce the Group’s capital requirements; and / or 
• transfer risk that is not within the Group’s current risk retention strategy. 
Using reinsurance the Group cedes insurance risk to reinsurers but, in return, assumes back counterparty risk against which  
a reinsurance bad debt provision is assessed. The financial security of the Group’s panel of reinsurers is therefore extremely 
important and both the quality and quantum of the assumed counterparty risk are subject to an approval process whereby 
reinsurance is only purchased from reinsurers that hold a credit rating of at least A- at the time cover is purchased. The Group’s 
leading counterparty exposures represent the accumulated counterparty risk for all Group underwriting entities and are reviewed 
on a monthly basis. The Group aims to contract with a diverse range of reinsurers on its contracts to mitigate the credit and / or 
non-payment risks associated with its reinsurance exposures. 
Certain reinsurance contracts have long durations as a result of PPOs, and insurance reserves therefore include provisions beyond 
the levels created for shorter-term reinsurance bad debt. 
Reinsurance risk arises from: 
• a failure of reinsurance to control exposure to losses, to reduce volatility or to protect capital; 
• an inability to place reinsurance cost effectively or on acceptable terms; and / or 
• reinsurer defaults. 
Insurance concentration risk 
The Group is subject to concentration risk in a variety of forms, including: 
• geographic concentration risk – the Group purchases a UK catastrophe reinsurance programme to protect against a modelled 
1 in 200 year loss. The retained deductible is £150 million at 31 December 2013 (2012: £125 million). There are also 
relevant covers to protect the Group’s international businesses; 
• product concentration risk – the Group’s business is heavily concentrated in the UK general insurance market. However,  
the Group offers a diversified portfolio of products and a variety of brands sold through a range of distribution channels  
to its customers; 
• sector concentration risk – the concentration of the Group to any given industry sector is monitored and analysed in respect  
of commercial customers; and 
• reinsurance concentration risk – reinsurance is purchased from a number of providers to ensure that a diverse range  
of counterparties is contracted with, within the desired credit rating range. 
3.3.2 Financial risk 
The Group is exposed to financial risk through its financial assets and financial liabilities. The Group’s financial risk is 
concentrated within its investment portfolio and reinsurance. 
The strategic asset allocation within the investment portfolio is agreed by the Investment Committee. The Investment Committee 
determines policy and controls, covering such areas as safety, liquidity and performance. The Investment Committee meets  
at least three times a year to evaluate risk exposure, the current strategy, associated policies and investment guidelines and  
to consider investment recommendations submitted to it. Oversight of the implementation of decisions taken by the Investment 
Committee is via various risk fora.

Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 
 Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 126 
3. Risk management continued 
The investment management objectives are: 
• to maintain the safety of the portfolio’s principal both in economic terms and from a capital, accounting and reporting 
perspective; 
• to maintain sufficient liquidity to provide cash requirements for operations, including in the event of a catastrophe; and 
• to maximise the portfolio’s total return within the constraints of the other objectives and the limits defined by the  
investment guidelines and capital allocation. 
3.3.2.1 Market risk 
Market risk is the risk associated with the adverse impact of the market risk factors’ movement on the Group’s balance sheet  
due to changes in the fair value or cash flows of its assets or liabilities. 
The Group is mainly exposed to the following market risk factors: 
• interest rate risk; 
• spread risk; 
• foreign currency risk; and 
• property risk. 
The Group has policies and limits approved by the Board for managing the market risk exposure. These set out the principles that 
the business should adhere to for managing market risk and establishing the maximum limits the Group is willing to accept having 
considered strategy, risk appetite and capital resources. 
The Group monitors its market risk exposure on a monthly basis and has established an aggregate exposure limit consistent  
with its risk objective to maintain capital adequacy. Interdependencies across risk types have also been considered within the 
aggregate exposure limit. The allocation of the Group’s investments across asset classes has been approved at the Investment 
Committee. 
The Group uses its internal capital model to determine its capital requirements and market risk limits, and monitors its market  
risk exposure based on a 99.5% one-year value at risk measure. The Group also applies market risk stressed scenarios testing  
for analysing the economic impact of specific severe market conditions. The results of this analysis are used to enhance the 
understanding of market risk. The market risk policy explicitly prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative or gearing purposes, 
however the Group is able to, and does, use derivatives for hedging its currency risk and interest rate risk exposures. 
Interest rate risk 
The Group’s interest rate risk arises mainly from its debt, floating interest rate investments and assets and liabilities exposed  
to fixed interest rates. 
In 2012, the Group issued £500 million of subordinated debt with a 30-year maturity and fixed rate coupon for the first  
10 years. The cost of the fixed rate coupon has been hedged down to the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate  
(“LIBOR”) floating rate. 
The Group also invests in floating rate notes, whose investment income is influenced by the movement of the short-term interest 
rate. A movement of the short-term interest rate will affect the expected return on the investments. 
The market value of the Group’s investments in fixed coupon securities is affected by the movement of the interest rates. For the 
investments in US Dollar corporate bonds, the Group hedges the exposure of this portfolio to the US Dollar interest rate risk using 
swaps. The derivatives reduce the duration of the portfolio to close to zero, eliminating its sensitivity to the US Dollar interest  
rate fluctuation. 
Spread risk 
Spread risk represents the risk of adverse fluctuation of the value of assets due to changes in the level of spreads. The level of 
spread is the difference between the risk free rate and actual rate paid on the asset, with larger spreads being associated with 
higher risk assets. The Group is exposed to spread risk through its investments in investment grade bonds and securitised credit. 
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 126  
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013  127
Foreign currency risk 
The exposure to currency risk is generated by the Group’s investments in US Dollar corporate bonds, US Dollar securitised credit 
and its investment in subsidiaries. 
At 31 December 2013, the Group maintained exposure to US Dollar securities through its investments in US Dollar corporate 
bonds and US Dollar securitised credits. The foreign currency exposure of these investments is hedged by foreign currency 
forward contracts, maintaining a minimal unhedged (direct) currency exposure on these portfolios, as well as a low basis 
currency risk on the hedging. 
The Group is also exposed to currency risk through its investments in subsidiaries in Italy and Germany (that is, investments in 
equity). In September 2013, the Group changed its currency hedging strategy on these investments to accept the long-term 
foreign exchange fluctuation impact on its investment in subsidiaries. 
Property risk 
Property risk results from adverse price fluctuations on real estate investments. At 31 December 2013, the value of these 
investments in property was £223.4 million (2012: £128.9 million). The property investments are located in the UK and  
are subject to the asset admissibility rules as defined by the PRA. 
The table below provides a sensitivity analysis of the potential impact of a change in a single factor with all other assumptions  
left unchanged. Other potential risks beyond the ones described in the table could have an additional financial impact on  
the Group.

Notes: 
1. The income statement impact on AFS debt securities is limited to floating rate bonds and interest rate derivatives used to hedge a portion of the portfolio.  
The income statement is not impacted in relation to fixed rate bonds, where the coupon return is not impacted by a change in prevailing market rates, as the 
accounting treatment for AFS debt securities means that only the coupon received is processed through the income statement with fair value movements being 
recognised through total equity. 
2. The sensitivities set out above reflect one-off impacts at 31 December with the exception of the income statement interest rate sensitivity on AFS debt securities, 
which projects a movement in a full year’s interest charge as a result of the increase in the interest rate applied to the AFS debt securities and interest rate hedges 
on those positions held at 31 December. 
3. The subordinated debt is excluded from the sensitivity analysis. 
4. The selection of these sensitivities should not be interpreted as a prediction. 
5. The sensitivities set out above have not considered the impact of the general market changes on the value of the Group’s insurance contract liabilities or retirement 
benefit obligations. 
6. The sensitivities set out above exclude the impact of taxation.

The Group has a number of open interest rate and foreign exchange derivative positions. Collateral management arrangements 
are in place for significant counterparty exposures. At 31 December 2013, £4.9 million (2012: £4.6 million) in cash and  
a £20.0 million (2012: £nil) UK Gilt have been pledged by the Group to cover out of the money derivative positions.  
£18.0 million (2012: £0.8 million) in cash and £nil (2012: £1.1 million) US Treasury bonds have been pledged to the  
Group to cover in the money derivative positions. 
The terms and conditions of collateral pledged for both assets and liabilities are market standard. When securities are pledged 
they are required to be readily convertible to cash, and as such there has been no policy established for the disposal of assets 
not readily convertible into cash.  
3.3.2.2 Counterparty risk 
Counterparty risk arises from the potential that losses are incurred from the failure of counterparties to meet their credit obligations,  
due to either their failure and / or their inability to pay or their unwillingness to pay amounts due. 
Counterparty risk is primarily managed through the Credit Risk and Investment Forum. The main responsibility of this forum is to 
ensure that all material aspects of counterparty risk within the Group are identified, monitored and measured. 
The main sources of counterparty risk for the Group are: 
• investment counterparty – this arises from the investment of monies in the range of investment vehicles permitted by the 
investment policy; and 
• reinsurance recoveries – counterparty exposure to reinsurance counterparties arises in respect of reinsurance claims against 
which a reinsurance bad debt provision is assessed. The Courts Act 2003, implemented in April 2005, gave the courts the 
power to award PPOs in place of lump sum awards to cover the future costs element of claims (that is, loss of future earnings 
and / or cost of future care). PPOs have the potential to increase the ultimate value of a claim and, by their very nature, to 
significantly increase the length of time to reach final payment. This has increased reinsurance counterparty risk in terms of  
both quantum and longevity. 
The tables below analyse the carrying value of financial and insurance assets that bear counterparty risk between those assets 
that have not been impaired, by age in relation to due date, and those that have been impaired.

Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the potential that obligations cannot be met as they fall due as a consequence of having a timing mismatch  
and / or an inability to raise sufficient liquid assets or cash without suffering a substantial loss on realisation. 
The measurement and management of liquidity risk within the Group is undertaken within the limits and other policy parameters  
of the Group’s liquidity risk appetite and is detailed within the liquidity risk policy and supporting minimum standards. 
Compliance is monitored in respect of both the internal policy and the regulatory requirements of local regulators. 
In the event that one or more liquidity stresses or scenarios crystallises, or should any other event that may impact liquidity occur, 
the Group ensures a rapid and controlled response to the event. In such an event, a liquidity crisis management team will be 
formed to assess the nature and extent of the threat and to develop an appropriate response.

Concentration risk 
Concentration risk on investments arises through excessive exposure to particular industry sectors, groups of business undertakings 
or similar activities. The Group may suffer significant losses in its investment portfolio as a result of over-exposure to particular 
sectors engaged in similar activities or similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations  
to be similarly affected by changes in economic, political or other conditions.

3.4 Capital adequacy 
The Group defines its capital requirement in accordance with the regulations prescribed by the PRA, other regulatory bodies  
and the credit rating agencies. Capital is managed in accordance with the Group’s capital management minimum standard,  
the objectives of which are to manage capital efficiently and maintain an appropriate level of capitalisation and solvency. 
The Group determines the appropriate level of capital on the basis of a number of criteria, including its risk-based capital 
requirement, the maintenance of a prudent excess capital over its regulatory capital requirements and its rating agency capital. 
The Group also seeks to hold capital coverage in the range of 125% to 150% of its risk-based capital requirement which is 
consistent with an ‘A’ range credit rating. 
The UK regulated insurance entities of the Group carry out an assessment of the adequacy of their overall financial resources in 
accordance with the PRA’s ICA methodology. The Group also monitors its financial resources with reference to the requirements 
of the IGD. The UK capital requirement is calculated based on an internal risk based capital model which is calibrated, as 
required by the PRA, to a 99.5% confidence interval over a one-year time horizon. The risk-based capital model also supports 
decision making in the business. 
The capital for European entities is maintained in accordance with the local regulatory solvency requirements. The Group 
manages its subsidiaries on an ongoing basis to ensure that capital resources exceed regulatory minima in accordance with  
its risk appetite. 
The Group has an IGD surplus at 31 December 2013 of approximately £1.8 billion (2012: £1.8 billion). 
The Group’s capital requirements and solvency position are produced and presented to the Board on a regular basis.

4. Segmental analysis 
The Directors manage the Group primarily by product type and present the segmental analysis on that basis. The segments reflect 
the management structure whereby a member of the Executive Committee is accountable to the Chief Executive Officer for each 
of the following operating segments: 
Motor 
This segment consists of personal car insurance cover together with the associated legal expenses business. The Group sells 
motor insurance through its own brands – Direct Line, Churchill and Privilege – and through partnership brands directly to 
customers or through PCWs. As a result, the Group has a brand and product offering that covers most major retail customer 
segments for motor insurance in the UK. 
Home 
This segment consists of the underwriting of home insurance together with associated legal expenses cover. The Group sells home 
insurance through its own brands – Direct Line, Churchill and Privilege – and through partnerships or PCWs. The Group’s brand 
and product offering covers most of the major retail customer segments for home insurance in the UK. 
Rescue and other personal lines 
This segment consists of the underwriting of rescue and recovery insurance products and other personal lines business, including 
travel, pet, life (conducted by Direct Line Life Insurance Company Limited which was sold on 28 November 2013) and creditor. 
The Group sells rescue and recovery insurance as a stand-alone product through the Green Flag brand or as an insurance  
add-on to all Group own brand and certain partner motor policies, or as part of packaged bank accounts sold through our  
bank partnership channel. Rescue insurance policies range from basic roadside rescue to a full Europe-wide breakdown  
recovery service. 
The Group sells its other personal lines insurance through its own brands – Direct Line, Churchill and Privilege – and  
through partnerships. 
Commercial 
This segment consists of the underwriting of commercial insura nce for micro businesses and SMEs in the UK. The Group sells comm ercial 
products through its own brands – NIG and Direct Line for Bu siness – and through its partnership with RBS and NatWest. 
International 
This segment consists primarily of personal motor car insurance cover sold in Italy and Germany using a multi-channel strategy 
through the Direct Line brand and through partnerships and PCWs. 
Certain income and charges are not allocated to the specific operating segments above as they are considered by management 
to be outside underlying business activities by virtue of their one-off incidence, size or nature. Such income and charges are 
categorised as either run-off, described below, or restructuring and other one-off costs. 
Run-off 
The segment consists of two principal lines, policies previously written through the personal lines broker channel and Tesco 
business. These residual businesses are now in run-off.  
No inter-segment transactions occurred in the year ended 31 December 2013 (2012: £nil). If any transaction were to occur, 
transfer prices between operating segments would be set on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third 
parties. Segment income, expenses and results will include those transfers between business segments which will then be 
eliminated on consolidation. 
For each operating segment, there is no indi vidual policyholder or customer that represents 10% or more of the Group’s total re venue.

Goodwill arose on the acquisition of U K Insurance Limited (£141.0 million) and Churchill Insurance Company Limited  
(£70.0 million), which is allocated across Motor, Home, Rescue and other personal lines and Commercial. 
The Group’s goodwill is reviewed annually at 30 September for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount of each  
CGU to which goodwill has been allocated with its carrying value and updated at each reporting date in the event of indicators 
of impairment.

There have been no impairments in goodwill in the year ended 31 December 2013 (2012:nil). 
The recoverable amount is the higher of the CGU fair value less the costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is the present 
value of expected future cash flows from the CGU. Fair value is the amount obtainable for the sale of the CGU in an arm’s length 
transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties. 
The recoverable amounts of all CGUs at 30 September were based on the value in use test, using the Group’s five-year  
strategic plan. The long-term growth rates have been based on GDP rates adjusted for inflation. The risk discount rates 
incorporate observable market long-term government bond yields and average industry betas adjusted for an appropriate  
risk premium based on independent analysis.

Investment properties were purchased during the year to provide an investment return over the long term in accordance with  
the Group’s investment strategy. These properties are managed, on behalf of the Group, by a property services company.  
The investment properties are measured at fair value which was arrived at on the basis of a valuation carried out at the balance 
sheet date by independent valuers. 
The valuation conforms to international valuation standards. The fair value was determined using a methodology based on recent 
market transactions for similar properties, which have been adjusted for the specific characteristics of each property within the 
portfolio. This approach to valuation is consistent with the methodology used in the year ended 31 December 2012. There has 
been no change to the valuation technique during the year. All investment properties are classified as level 3 under the fair value 
reporting hierarchy as described in note 2.3. Fair value equates to carrying value. 
The lease agreements are drawn up in line with local practice and the Group has no exposure to leases that include  
contingent rents. 
Disposals in the year ended 31 December 2012 comprised freehold property occupied by RBS Group under operating leases.

Group plc from 1.5 billion Ordinary Shares of £1 each to 1.5 billion Ordinary Shares of 10 pence each and 1.5 billion 
deferred shares of 90 pence each. 
The deferred shares were then transferred back to the Company by its then parent, The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc, for no 
value and immediately cancelled by the Company. This cancellation has created a non-distributable capital redemption reserve 
in the Company of £1,350.0 million.

The subordinated dated notes were issued on 27 April 2012 at a fixed rate of 9.25%. On the same date, the Group also 
entered into a 10-year hedge to exchange the fixed rate of interest for a floating rate of three-month LIBOR plus a spread  
of 706 bps. 
During 2013, a credit value adjustment was made to the interest rate hedge to reflect the market value of counterparty credit risk 
resulting from the majority divestment from RBS Group. This has resulted in an increase in the floating rate to three-month LIBOR 
plus a spread of 707 bps with effect from 29 July 2013.

29. Subordinated liabilities continued 
The nominal £500 million bonds have a redemption date of 27 April 2042. The Group has the option to repay the notes on 
specific dates from 27 April 2022. If the notes are not repaid on that date, the rate of interest would be reset at a rate of the  
six-month LIBOR plus 7.91%. 
The notes are unsecured, subordinated obligations of the Group, and rank pari passu without any preference among themselves. 
In the event of a winding-up or of bankruptcy, they are to be repaid only after the claims of all other creditors have been met. 
There have been no defaults on any of the notes during the year. The Group has the option to defer interest payments on the 
notes but to date has not exercised this right. The aggregate fair value of subordinated dated notes as at 31 December 2013  
is £625.4 million (2012: £597.6 million). 
The undated subordinated loans were fully repaid on 8 January 2013.

32. Retirement benefit obligations 
Defined contribution scheme 
The pension charge in respect of the defined contribution scheme for the year ended 31 December 2013 was £25.3 million 
(2012: £26.0 million). 
In addition, certain employees of the Group who were previously members of the RBS Group defined benefit pension scheme 
transferred to the Group’s defined contribution scheme in 2012. As a result of standardising employment terms for all Group 
employees, which included changes to the employment terms of a small number of Group employees who were members of  
the RBS Group defined benefit pension scheme, the Group crystallised a debt under section 75 of the UK Pensions Act 1995. 
Consequently the Group was required to pay into the RBS Group’s defined benefit pension scheme (in which those employees 
ceased to participate) as a result of a deficit in that scheme. The debt was calculated based on the amount needed to  
secure Direct Line Group’s share of the pension liabilities in the pension scheme with an insurance company. An amount  
of £31.3 million was paid to the RBS Group pension scheme on 29 June 2012 in full and final settlement. 
Defined benefit scheme 
The Group’s defined benefit pension scheme was closed in 2003 although the Group remains the sponsoring employer for 
obligations to current and deferred pensioners based on qualifying years service and final salaries. The defined benefit scheme is 
legally separated from the Group with trustees who are required by law to act in the interest of the scheme and of all the relevant 
stakeholders. The trustees of the pension scheme are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the scheme. 
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligations at 31 December 2013 is 20 years (2012: 20 years) using 
accounting assumptions. 
The table below sets out the principal assumptions in respect of the defined benefit scheme.

Notes: 
1. The income / (cost) in the income statement has been included under other operating expenses. 
2. In accordance with IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits revised’ the net interest cost has been calculated by applying the discount rate to the deficit (2012: surplus) in the 
scheme. The change in IAS 19 set out in ‘Adoption of new and revised standards’ in note 1, if applied to the Group’s result for the year ended 31 December 
2012, would have resulted in a decrease in the net interest income to the income statement of £0.6 million. A charge of this amount has been made to net 
interest income in the income statement and a credit in the statement of comprehensive income for year ended 31 December 2013.

Sensitivity analysis 
The table below provides a sensitivity analysis of the potential impact of a change in a single factor with all other assumptions  
left unchanged. Other potential risks beyond the ones described in the table could have an additional financial impact on the 
Group. This sensitivity analysis has been selected to reflect the changes to discounted cash flows as a result of changes to the 
discount rate, inflation rate and mortality assumptions. The methodology adopted involves actuarial techniques.

The most recent funding valuation of the defined benefit scheme took place at 1 October 2011. The Group has agreed to  
make contributions of £2.8 million per annum from 2013 to 2016 to meet the funding deficit, and does not anticipate any 
material change to the level of contributions before the next valuation, which is due on 1 October 2014. 
33. Share-based payments 
The Group operates equity-settled, share-based compensation plans in the form of free shares awards, a Long Term Incentive 
Plan, Direct Line Share Incentive Plans and an Annual Incentive Plan, details of which are set out below together with their  
financial impact: 
Free share awards 
During the year ended 31 December 2012, upon listing on the London Stock Exchange, the Group offered all employees  
a ‘free share’ award granting shares to the value of £250 to each eligible employee free of charge. These awards have  
no performance criteria attached, vest on the third anniversary of the award grant date subject to completion of three years’ 
continuing employment (or on leaving employment in certain circumstances) and will be satisfied using market-purchased  
shares. The number of shares initially granted was 1.9 million with an estimated fair value at grant of £3.9 million. 
Long-Term Incentive Plan 
Senior management are eligible to participate in the LTIP and awards are granted in the form of nil-cost options. Under the  
plan, the shares vest at the end of a three-year period dependent upon the following: continued employment by the Group  
and achieving predefined performance conditions associated with TSR and RoTE. 
Conditional awards were made in the year ended 31 December 2013 over 3.0 million Ordinary Shares with an estimated fair 
value at grant of £4.9 million in March and 2.5 million Ordinary Shares with an estimated fair value at grant of £4.3 million  
in August (2012: 3.2 million Ordinary Shares with an estimated fair value at grant of £5.0 million in November) under the 
Group’s LTIP. 
The estimated fair value of the LTIP share awards with market-based performance conditions was calculated using the Monte-
Carlo simulation model. 
The table below details the inputs into the model. 
 2013 2012
Weighted average assumptions during the year:  
Share price  208p 194p
Exercise price  0p 0p
Volatility of Company share price  26% 27%
Average comparator volatility  32% 32%
Expected life  3 years 3 years
Risk-free rate  0.5% 0.3%
Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 159
Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 
 Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2013 160 
33. Share-based payments continued 
As historic data is not available for the Group, expected volatility was determined by calculating the median historic volatility  
for a group of comparable companies using daily share price data over a period commensurate with the expected life 
assumption. These comparable companies are classified as being in the insurance sector in the FTSE 350.  
Plan participants are entitled to receive additional shares in respect of dividends paid to shareholders over the vesting period. 
Therefore no deduction has been made from the fair value of awards in respect of dividends. 
Expected life was based on the contractual life of the awards and adjusted based on management’s best estimate, for the effects 
of exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. 
RBS Group LTIP awards 
Prior to October 2012, certain employees benefited from share-based awards originally granted by RBS Group. The expense 
incurred in respect of awards granted by RBS Group to Direct Line Group employees is not material and has been included 
within operating expenses. 
RBS Group has indemnified Direct Line Group for all future costs in respect of RBS Group share-based awards made to  
Direct Line Group employees. All costs in respect of these share awards for Direct Line Group employees have since been  
borne by RBS Group. 
The RBS Group Remuneration Committee has agreed that RBS Group will be responsible for the settlement of the following 
outstanding LTIP awards, with no charge to be made to Direct Line Group: 
• LTIP awards in the year ended 31 December 2011 – expected to vest in March 2014 
• LTIP awards in the year ended 31 December 2012 – expected to vest in March 2015 
The 2011 and 2012 LTIP awards will be settled with Company Ordinary Shares currently held by RBS Group. Details  
of the RBS Group legacy share based payments are set out in the Directors’ remuneration report on page 98. 
Direct Line Share Incentive Plans 
The HMRC approved Buy-As-You-Earn Plan in the UK and an International plan, mirroring the UK plan for Italy, were both 
launched during the year ended 31 December 2013. The International plan is being further rolled out to employees in Germany 
and it is expected that this process will be completed in 2014. 
The Group’s Share Incentive Plans entitle employees to purchase shares from pre-tax pay for between £10 and £125 per month, 
or Euro equivalent, and receive one matching share for every two shares purchased. 
Since commencement of the Share Incentive Plans during the year ended 31 December 2013, matching share awards  
have been granted over 0.3 million Ordinary Shares in relation to these schemes in the year with an estimated fair value  
of £0.6 million. The fair value of each matching share award is estimated using the market value at the date of grant. 
Under the Share Incentive Plans, the shares vest at the end of a three-year period dependent upon the following: continued 
employment by the Group (or on leaving employment in certain circumstances) and continued ownership of the associated 
purchased shares up to the point of vesting. 
Annual Incentive Plan 
Executive Directors and certain members of senior management are eligible for awards under the AIP, of which at least 40%  
is granted in the form of a nil-cost option. 
In March 2013 awards were made over 1.1 million Ordinary Shares under this plan with an estimated fair value of £2.2 million 
based on the market value on the date of grant. 
The awards outstanding at 31 December 2013 have no performance criteria attached, other than the requirement that the 
employee remains in employment with the Group for three years from the date of award (with the exception of the awards  
to the Chief Executive – specific terms in this case are set out in the Directors’ remuneration report).

In respect of the outstanding options at 31 December 2013, the weighted average remaining contractual life is 2.20 years 
(2012: 2.85 years). No share options expired during the year (2012: nil). 
The weighted average share price during the period of exercise was £2.17 in the year ended 31 December 2013  
(2012: not applicable). 
The Group recognised total expenses of £4.1 million in the year ended 31 December 2013 (2012: £0.3 million) relating  
to equity settled share-based compensation plans. 
Further information on share based payments in respect of Directors is provided in the Directors’ remuneration report.

Share ownership
Share capital
The details of the Company’s share capital are presented  
in note 27 to the consolidated financial statements.
Dividends
The Group aims to generate long-term sustainable value for 
shareholders, while balancing operational, regulatory, rating 
agency and policyholder requirements. The Board has adopted 
a progressive dividend policy for the Company, which will aim 
to increase the dividend annually in real terms to reflect its cash 
flow generation and long-term earnings potential.
It is expected that one-third of the annual dividend will 
generally be paid in the third quarter as an interim dividend 
and two-thirds will be paid as a final dividend in the second 
quarter of the following year. The Board may revise the 
dividend policy from time to time.
In addition, if the Board believes that the Group has capital 
that is surplus to the Board’s view of its requirements, it is 
intended that it will be returned to shareholders. The Company 
may consider a special dividend and/or the repurchase  
of its own shares as a means of distributing surplus capital  
to shareholders.
The Company pays its dividends in Pounds Sterling to 
shareholders registered on its principal register in the UK.
Shareholders may have their cash dividends paid directly into 
a bank or building society by completing a dividend mandate 
form, which is available from the Company’s share registrar 
(“Registrar”) Computershare Investor Services PLC in the UK. 
Contact details for the Registrar are set out on page 180. 
Alternatively, shareholders may access their shareholdings 
online and download a dividend mandate from the Investor 
Centre, please see page 180 for details.
Shareholder enquiries
Shareholders with queries on any matter relating to their shares 
are invited to contact our Registrar using the contact details 
listed on page 180 of this Annual Report & Accounts.
Shareholders should notify the Registrar of any change in 
shareholding details in a timely manner.
Shareholders can also access their current shareholding details 
online at www.investorcentre.co.uk/directline. Investor Centre 
is a free-to-use, secure, self-service website where shareholders 
can manage their holdings online. The website enables 
shareholders to:
• check their holdings;
• update their records (including address and direct credit details);
• access all their securities in one portfolio by setting up a 
personal account;
• vote online; and
• register to receive electronic shareholder communications.
The website requires shareholders to quote their Shareholder 
Reference Number in order to access this information.
Shareholder warning
5,000 people contact the FCA about share fraud each year, 
with victims losing an average of £20,000.
Fraudsters use persuasive and high-pressure tactics to lure 
investors into scams. They may offer to sell shares that turn out 
to be worthless or non-existent, or to buy shares at an inflated 
price in return for an upfront payment. While high profits are 
promised, if you buy or sell shares in this way you will 
probably lose your money.
How to avoid share fraud
• Keep in mind that firms authorised by the FCA are unlikely to 
contact you out of the blue with an offer to buy or sell shares
• Do not get into a conversation; note the name of the person 
and firm contacting you and then end the call
• Check the Financial Services Register from www.fca.org.uk 
to see if the person and firm contacting you are authorised 
by the FCA
• Beware of fraudsters claiming to be from an authorised firm, 
copying its website or giving you false contact details
• Use the firm’s contact details listed on the Register if you 
want to call it back
• Call the FCA on 0800 111 6768 if the firm does not  
have contact details on the Register or you are told they  
are out of date
• Search the list of unauthorised firms to avoid at  
www.fca.org.uk/scams 
• Consider that if you buy or sell shares from an unauthorised 
firm you will not have access to the Financial Ombudsman 
Service or Financial Services Compensation Scheme
• Think about getting independent financial and professional 
advice before you hand over any money
• Remember: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is

Report a scam
If you are approached by fraudsters please tell the FCA using 
the share fraud reporting form at www.fca.org.uk/scams, 
where you can find out more about investment scams.
You can also call the FCA Consumer Helpline on  
0800 111 6768.
If you have already paid money to share fraudsters you should 
contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040.
Tips on how you can protect your shares
• Ensure all your certificates are kept in a safe place,  
or consider holding your shares in the UK’s electronic 
registration and settlement system for equity, CREST,  
or via a nominee
• Keep all correspondence from the Registrar that shows your 
shareholder reference number in a safe place and shred 
unwanted correspondence
• Inform the Registrar as soon as you change your address
• If you receive a letter from the Registrar regarding a change 
of address and you have not recently moved, please contact 
them immediately
• Be aware of when the dividends are paid and contact the 
Registrar if you do not receive your dividend
• Consider having your dividends paid directly into your bank 
account (you will need to fill out a dividend mandate form 
and send it to the Registrar); this reduces the risk of the 
cheque being intercepted or lost in the post
• If you change your bank account, inform the Registrar of the 
details of your new account immediately
• If you are buying or selling shares, deal only with brokers 
registered in the UK or in your country of residence
• Be aware that the Company will never contact you by 
telephone concerning investment matters. If you receive  
such a call from a person purporting to represent the Group 
please contact the Company Secretary immediately

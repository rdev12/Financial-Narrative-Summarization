The Chief Executive’s review and certain other sections of the Annual 
Report contain forward looking statements that are subject to factors 
associated with, amongst other matters, the economic and business 
circumstances occurring from time to time in the countries and sectors  
in which the Group operates. It is believed that the expectations 
reflected in these statements are reasonable but they may be affected 
by a wide range of variables which could cause actual results to differ 
materially from those anticipated at the date of the Annual Report.

ACQUISIt IONS 
It	 is	 said	 that	 the	 true	 test	 of	 the	 quality	 of	a	 company	 and	 its	
management	 is	 how	 they	 cope	 with	a	 recession.	 To	 date,	 SSL	
has	 passed	 that	 test.	 Our	 geographic	 spread,	 the	 quality	 of	 our	
brands	 and	 their	 market	 position,	 the	 continued	 enhancement	
and	development	 of	 our	 products	 and	 the	remorseless		
focus	 on	 cost	 and	 efficiency	 have	 led	 to	a	 resilient	 financial	
performance	 through	 the	 worst	 worldwide	 recession	 since	
before	 the	 Second	 World	 War.	
	 The 	 last	 year	 has	 also	 been	 helped	 by	 the	 success		
of	 our	 strategy	 of	 expanding	 our	 geographic	 footprint.	 Our	
Russian	 and	 Ukraine	 acquisitions	 have	 to	 date	 exceeded	 all		
our	 expectations	 and	 it	 is	 also	 worth	 recording	 the	 excellent	
results	 which	 were	 achieved	 in	 China	 and	 Japan.	
	 The 	 results	 from	 the	 more	 established	 markets	 were	
more	 than	 satisfactory,	 but	 it	 is	 to	 the	 management	 team’s	
credit	 that	 it	 is	 some	 of	 our	 more	 recent	 investments	 which		
are	 driving	 the	 growth	 of	 the	 Company.
	 Total 	 sales	 in	 the	 year	 rose	 24.9	per	 cent	 to		
£802.5	 million.	 Underlying	 sales	 growth	 for	 our	 branded	
consumer	 products	 (excluding	 the	 effect	 of	 acquisitions)		
was	 4.1	per	 cent	 to	 £632.3	 million	 with	 growth	 in	 each	 of	 our	
major	 categories,	 Durex,	 Scholl	 Footcare	 and	 Scholl	 Footwear.	
Underlying	 operating	 profit	 increased	 by	 5.6	per	 cent	 to		
£96.7	 million.	 Total	 operating	 profit,	 including	 acquisitions,	
grew	 40.8	per	 cent	 to	 £126	 million.	 Profit	 before	 tax	 grew		
50.7	per	 cent	 to	 £115.3	 million,	 and	 Earnings	 Per	 Share	 grew		
by	 20.0	per	 cent	 to	 33.6	 pence.
dividends   The	 Directors	 recommend	 an	 increased	 final	 dividend,	 up		
25	 per	 cent,	 of	 8.0	 pence	 per	 ordinary	 share	 (2009:	 6.4	 pence),	
which,	 subject	 to	 shareholder	approval	 at	 the	 Annual	 General	
Meeting	 (‘AGM’)	 on	 22	 July	 2010,	 will	 be	 paid	 on	2	September	
2010	 to	 shareholders	 on	 the	 register	 on	6	 August	 2010.	 This		
will	 make	a	 total	 dividend	 of	 11.1	 pence	per	 ordinary	 share	
(2009:	 9.0	 pence).	
o utloo K
The	 new	 financial	 year	 has	 started	 as	 we	 expected.	 The	 global	
economy	 seems	 to	 be	 improving	 although	 in	 certain	 territories	
recovery	 will	 be	 slow.	 This	 is	 in	 line	 with	 our	 predictions	 and		
we	 continue	 to	 expect	 to	 perform	 strongly.	 The	 twin	drivers		
of	 innovation	 led	 organic	 growth	 in	 Durex	 and	 Scholl	 and	
well-chosen	 acquisitions	 support	 both	 our	 earnings	 target,		
of	 increasing	 EPS	 by	 50	per	 cent	 in	 the	 three	 years	 to	 March	
2012,	 and	 our	 continuing	longer-term	 growth	 ambitions.	 We	
have	 the	 brands,	 the	 market	 positions	 and	 the	 geographic	
footprint	 combined	 with	 the	 continued	 product	development	
and	 innovation	 to	 be	confident	 of	 continuing	 to	 perform	
strongly.
	 Once 	 again	 this	 year,	 our	employees	 around	 the	 world	
have	 shown	 real	 commitment	 and	 passion	 to	 achieve	 these	
strong	 results.	 On	 behalf	 of	 the	 Board,	I	 offer	 sincere	 thanks		
for	 their	 contribution.	 ● 06/07	 C hi Ef	 Ex ECutiv E’s	 REvi EW

As	a	 business	 we	 have	 set	 increasingly	 challenging	 targets,	 and	
we	 continue	 to	 remain	 on	 track	 to	 achieve	 50	per	 cent	 growth	
in	 EPS	 over	 three	 years.	 We	 expect	 to	 make	 further	 significant	
progress	 in	 the	 current	 year	 and	 to	 achieve	 the	 target	 next		
year	 once	 we	 have	 the	 full	 benefit	 of	 our	 Russian	 acquisition.	
	 Of 	 course,	 whilst	 we	 are	 very	 pleased	 to	 be	 hitting	
profit	 targets,	 we	 are	 equally	 pleased	 that	 our	 cash	 flow	 is	
strong,	 which	 allows	us	 both	 to	 invest	 in	 the	 business	 and		
to	 increase	 returns	 to	 our	 shareholders.

Yes,	 we	 have	 seen	 some	 impact	 from	 decreased	 consumer	
spending,	 particularly	 in	 some	 of	 our	 larger	 markets	 including	
the	 UK	 and	 Italy.	 We	 have	 also	 seen	 customer	 inventory	
reductions	 in	 some	 of	 our	 markets.	 We	 are	 fortunate,	 however,	
that	 our	 categories	 are	 more	 resilient	 than	 many	 other	
consumer	 products.	 We	 have	 also	 been	 working	 closely	 with	
our	customers	 to	deliver	 outstanding	 in-store	 execution,	
education	 and	 promotions.	 Our	 distribution	 channels	 have	
been	 enhanced	 with	 the	 expansion	 of	 our	 consumer	websites	
in	 many	 markets.
whAt  do   you   consider  ssl ’s   greA test   Achieve Ment   in   this  pA st  yeA r?
There	 have	 been	numerous	 examples	 of	 outstanding	
successes	 this	 year	 from	 all	corners	 of	 our	 business.	 Russia	
has	 grabbed	 the	 headlines,	 but	 in	 many	 ways	 our	 strong	
organic	 growth,	 driven	 by	 solid	 product	 innovations,	 has	 been	
the	 most	 pleasing	 thing	 for	 SSL.	
h ow  hAs  the  r ussi An  A cquisition   progressed?
We	 continue	 to	 be	 very	 pleased	 with	 this	 acquisition	 which		
is	 progressing	 well.	 It	 is	a	 complex	 business,	 employing	 more	
than	 3,000	 people,	 and	 we	 are	 building	 strong	 relationships	
throughout	 the	 organisation.	 The	 Russian	 business	 has	 already	
had	a	 significant	 impact	 on	 our	 bottom	 line	 and	 we	 expect	 this	
to	 continue	 as	 we	 join	 the	 two	businesses	together	 to	provide		
a	 platform	 for	 growth	 in	 the	 future.
hAve   the   first  M onths   since   the   opening   of   your  c hinese  fA ctory   in  q ingd Ao  M et   your   expect Ations?
Yes.	 Whenever	 we	 open	a	 new	 facility,	 let	 alone	 one	 the	 size		
of	 Qingdao,	 we	 expect	 three	 years	 before	 we	 achieve	 full	
production	 and	 high	 yields.	 Qingdao	 is	 ahead	 of	 this	 timetable,	
with	 global	 shipments	 starting	 as	 anticipated,	 and	 further	
capacity	 increases	 planned	 for	 next	 year.	 The	development	 of	
our	 Chinese	 factory	adds	 to	 our	 robust	 supply	 chain	 platform	
(with	 key	 operations	 also	 in	 India,	 the	 UK	 and	 Thailand)	 which		
is	 strengthened	 by	 sharing	processes	 and	 talent	 across	 sites,	
and	 by	 close	 relationships	 with	 commercial	 offices	 around

SSL	 is	a	 fast-evolving	 business,	 with	 sales	 that	 have	 all	 but	
doubled	 in	 the	 past	 five	 years	 and	a	broad	 and	 growing	
geographic	 footprint.	 It	 is	essential	 that	 our	 management	
structures	 reflect	 the	 changing	 nature	 of	 the	 Group	 and	
provide	 foundations	 for	 further	 growth	 in	 future.	 For	 example,	
we	 have	 integrated	 those	 teams	 that	 bring	 new	 products	 to

functions	 including	 Regulatory	 and	 Innovation	 and	 has

The	 economy	–	I	do	 not	 think	 we	 can	 take	 global	 recovery	 in		
all	 markets	 for	 granted.	 In	 many	 consumer	 markets	 we	 would	
expect	 consumer	 growth	 to	 be	 slower	 than	 historical	trends.	
This	 will	 continue	 to	 place	 pressure	 on	 our	 innovation	 pipeline	
to	 ensure	 we	 bring	 relevant	 and	 competitive	 products	 to	 meet	
consumer	 needs.	
	 The 	 integration	 of	 our	 Russian	 business	 is	 an	 ongoing	
challenge	 and	 we	 need	 to	 make	 sure	 we	 get	 the	 most	 from	 it,	
while	 smoothly	 integrating	 its	 business	 into	 SSL	 to	provide	a	
continuing	 platform	 for	 growth	 in	 the	 future.	
	 As 	 with	 any	 business,	 our	 success	 is	 ultimately	 entirely	
dependent	 upon	 our	 people.	 Nurturing	 SSL’s	 unique	 culture		
is	 vital	 to	 our	 success	 and	 will	 continue	 to	 be	a	 focus	 for	 the	
management	 team.	 ●
2010	A nd 	bEYO nd
Our	 immediate	 priorities	 are	 continuing	
the	 successful	 integration	 of	 our	 Russian	
business,	 and	 ensuring	a	 strong	 pipeline		
of	 new	 products	 to	 support	 our	 organic	
growth.
	 Certainly, 	 the	 global	 financial	 outlook	
is	 more	 promising	 for	 the	 next	 12	 months,	
with	 our	 most	 established	 marketplaces,	
the	 UK	 and	 Italy,	 forecast	 to	 return	 to	
growth.	 We	 are	 well	 placed	 to	 capitalise	 on	
the	 resulting	 improvement	 in	 consumer	
confidence,	 with	 quality	 products	 that	
address	 everyday	 needs.
	 Our 	 recently	 established	 Product	
Delivery	 team	 is	 geared	 up	 as	a	 real	 engine	
room	 within	 the	 business.	 It	 is	 responsible	
for	 ensuring	 we	 have	a	 consistent	 flow	 of	
new	 and	 innovative	 products	 reaching	 the	
marketplace.	 We	 have	 invested	
significantly	 in	 recruiting	 key	 talent	 to	 this	
team	 and	I	 am	 enthusiastic	 about	 how	 they	
will	 ensure	 we	 remain	 at	 the	 forefront	 of	
innovation	 within	 our	 categories.	 Their	
focus	 is	 on	 the	 consumer,	 supported	 by	
extensive	 research	 and	 testing	 in	 each	
stage	 of	 the	process	 from	 conceptual	
innovation	 to	 regulation.	 The	 team	 has	
also	 forged	 strong	 relationships	 with	
partners	 from	 the	 scientific	 and	 academic	
worlds,	 using	 external	 knowledge	 and	
expertise	 to	 maximise	 our	 growth.	
	 Our 	 balance	 sheet	 is	 strong,	 and	 we	
will	 look	 for	appropriate	 acquisition	
opportunities	 that	 could	 exploit	 our	
business	 fundamentals.	
	 After 	 significant	 investment	 in	 our	
production	 facilities	 in	 the	 UK,	 Thailand	
and	 China	 in	 recent	 years,	 we	 will	 next	
focus	 on	 India.	 Our	 partnership	 with	 the	
TTK	 Group	 remains	 strong	 and	 we	 have	
plans	 for	 investing	 in	 and	 improving	 the	
production	 facilities	 at	 our	 sites	 in	
Southern	 India.
	 One 	 of	 our	 competitive	advantages		
is	 our	 employee	 culture,	 and	together		
with	 the	 Board	 and	 Executive	 Committee,	
I	 will	 be	 looking	 to	 further	 capitalise	 on	 the	
spirit	 of	entrepreneurship	 and	 passion		
felt	 among	 SSL	employees	 globally		
by	 relaunching	 our	 vision,	values	 and

capacity	 of	 this	 site,	 so	 that	 by	 2012	 it	 is	 producing	 nearly	 one

	 Our 	 Thai	 factory	 in	 Bangpakong	 has	 also	 seen	a		
30	per	 cent	 capacity	 increase,	 thanks	 to	 new	 lines	 and		
demand	 from	 the	 worldwide	 commercial	 operation.

for	 synthetic	 condoms	 such	 as	 the	 new	 Durex	 Feeling	 range.	
Over	 the	 next	 year	 investment	 will	 continue	 across	 the		
Indian	 sites.
	 With 	 our	 acquisition	 in	 Russia,	 we	 have	 also	 brought	 on	
board	 new	 facilities,	 such	 as	a	 packing	 plant	 at	 Serpukhov,	 near	
Moscow.	 We	 are	 now	 trialling	a	 new	 strategy	 based	 at	 this	 site,	
where	 foiled	 condoms	 are	 shipped	 from	 Asia	 and	 packed	 in	
boxes	 on	 arrival	 at	 this	 site.	 This	 allows	 more	 flexibility	 for	 local	
markets	 and	 also	 saves	 on	 shipping	 costs.	 We	 will	 assess	 this

Ou R	 FRAmEw ORk SSL ’s products are designed to help people to enjoy more 
healthy and fulfilling lives, and we appreciate the importance 
of connecting our business decisions to environmental, 
ethical and social concerns in order to ensure this. Our 
framework to maximise and enhance our commitment to 
corporate responsibility has four key elements:
in the m Arketpl Ace 
Covering the whole supply chain from raw material  
selection, third-party supplier assessments and  
in-house manufacture to product delivery and

relationships with national health authorities and SSL ’s 
responsibilities to shareholders.

in environmental care, environmental performance and

g lob Al freight development progr Amme
SSL ’s global freight development programme was launched  
in 2007 in response to the increasing spend on freight and  
the need for greater visibility of transit stocks.
 One area of focus has been the optimisation of 
logistics from our internal supply points in Asia Pacific, which 
account for 80 per cent of total volume. This has delivered a 
33 per cent increase in the volume shipped in 40-foot 
containers over the year, with a 10 per cent increase in fill rate. 
These sustainable improvements represent a reduction in 
excess of 500 containers per year, which provides 
environmental as well as financial benefits.
t hird p Arty suppl y Audits
We perform quality audits on third party suppliers across  
our product range as part of SSL ’s duty of care to the 
consumer and to ensure business continuity. More than  
50 manufacturers supply SSL with products, and audits are 
designed to assess their ability to consistently manufacture 
products while meeting quality, safety, efficacy and regulatory 
requirements.
 In 2009, SSL recruited an auditor in China to review our 
locally-based third parties, which has resulted in significant 
savings. We have also worked in partnership with two potential 
suppliers to help them achieve the ISO 9001:2008 quality 
management standard.
business continuity review
We have undertaken a top-level review of business continuity 
arrangements in our key factories and commercial offices. 
Whilst appropriate levels of insurance will continue to provide 
baseline protection, a comprehensive exercise undertaken  
at the Venus building (SSL ’s largest office) has shown that a 
significant additional amount of business continuity risk can 
be mitigated for a comparatively modest expenditure of 
money and effort. The Venus project was enhanced by 
simulating an actual disaster scenario, rather than the more 
conventional route of publishing an agreed procedure. This 
successful approach is now being deployed in other key 
business locations.
in the workpl Ace
employee o pinion s urvey
Our employee opinion survey, which is now run annually, 
provides staff with a formal opportunity to communicate  
their views about SSL and the way the business is run. 
 We distributed online and paper versions of the  
survey in November 2009, and it was completed by more than 
2,700 SSL employees. The results revealed that 81 per cent  
of respondents are satisfied with SSL ’s global leadership and 
direction, compared with a norm of 63 per cent for other 
companies, while 85 per cent of those surveyed said they  
feel proud to work for the Company. Some 79 per cent of  
SSL staff are satisfied with their job, while 86 per cent said  
they understand how the work they do contributes to the  
goals of their business unit.
 All participating business units received detailed 
reports covering their results and local action plans were 
developed to address the areas that the survey highlighted  
as needing improvement. Our next survey will be carried out  
at the end of this calendar year.

employee policies
SSL provides a safe, positive and supportive environment for 
employees around the world. SSL is committed to valuing 
diversity and promoting equality. SSL will take steps to ensure 
that opportunities for employment, career progression, 
promotion, training and development and the support 
systems that contribute to employee satisfaction are equally 
accessible to all. No employee or potential employee, whether 
full-time, part-time or temporary, will therefore receive less 
favourable treatment due to their race, colour, sexual 
orientation, nationality, ethnic origin, national origin, disability, 
age, religion, gender, marital status or trade union 
membership.
 SSL is committed to equality of opportunity in all  
its employment practices, policies and procedures. Any 
employee who becomes disabled will be given the fullest 
support to maintain or return to a role appropriate to their 
experience and abilities within the Company.
 We have a range of local, regional and global 
communications tools and forums to inform and involve  
staff in the broader business. This includes our employee 
magazine, Be Inspired, which is published in nine languages, 
three times a year. Many sites also have employee forums, 
team briefings, conferences and intranets that not only keep 
staff abreast of Company news and results, but also invite 
their views and encourage two-way communication on 
matters that may concern them. 
 The SSL Open Door Policy encourages employees to 
report any instances of unsafe or unhealthy working practices, 
dishonesty or malpractice – in complete confidence. Open 
Door is promoted through leaflets and posters at all SSL sites.
 The Group operates a number of employee share 
schemes, including the Performance Share Plan, a long-term 
incentive plan, for senior executives. All eligible UK employees 
will be invited to participate in the UK savings related share 
option scheme, an all employee share scheme, shortly. The 
scheme was approved by shareholders in July 2009.
ssl leA der progr Amme
In January 2010, 30 SSL staff took part in the SSL Leader 
Programme at the IMD business school in Lausanne, 
Switzerland. This week-long programme is the first in a series 
of initiatives aimed at our talented managers around the globe.  
The objective of the programme is to prepare our managers  
to take on greater responsibility and gain an understanding  
of how to align leadership skills to the Company’s business 
objectives, improve strategic thinking and anticipate key issues 
for the business in the future. Feedback from the programme 
was extremely positive. The next group of 30 managers will 
attend a programme in November.
in the environment
SSL takes its responsibility towards the environment  
very seriously, and this is reflected in both our five-year 
Environmental Plan, which was launched in 2008, and our 
annual Environment Report, which assesses how we are 
performing in this area. There have been a number of 
achievements in this field in the last year.
w orld environment dAy
To recognise World Environment Day, SSL invited local tertiary 
students to develop global employee engagement activities 
including a green pledge campaign and environmental 
marketing materials. Our sites across the globe also contributed, 
from rubbish clearing in Canada to tree planting in India.
COmmuNITY
INITIATIvE
SSL continues to partner 
with ‘dance4life’ to raise 
awareness of the safer sex 
message. dance4life uses 
the power of dance and 
music to inspire, educate 
and mobilise young people 
to take action against HIV 
and Aids.’ environment Al highlights
In October 2009, Project Lumen was launched at the Stakehill 
UK distribution centre to reduce electricity consumption by 
using energy efficient lighting. An 83 per cent saving in 
electricity was achieved when low energy lighting was fitted 
with sensors so the lights were activated only when needed, 
and the site’s current year-on-year electricity consumption is 
now down by 31.2 per cent.
 In March 2010, Maintal in Germany became SSL ’s first 
office location to be awarded the ISO 14001 Environmental 
Management Standard. The standard enables firms to control 
the environmental impact of their activities, products and 
services, and we expect more office locations to be awarded 
ISO 14001 in the coming year.
 A real effort has been made to reduce the packaging 
required in the Scholl Biomechanics range. The Gel Bunion 
and Metatarsal protection sleeves, for example, were 
previously packaged in boxes that had a volume of 250cm
3
 
and a weight of 14.44gm. The packaging has been redesigned 
and these products now come in a carton that has a volume  
of 126cm
3
 and weighs 9.02gm – savings of 50.4 per cent and 
62.4 per cent respectively.

in the community
t he durex n etwork
SSL formed the Durex Network in 2005 to formalise the work 
Durex had been doing for many years to promote the safer sex 
message and raise awareness of HIV/AIDS and condom use.
 Durex’s fourth Face of Global Sex (FOGS) report, Sex 
and Relationships Education: Assessing the Gaps for Eastern 
European Youth, was published in June 2009. It focused on 
whether young people in seven Eastern European countries 
felt they had received enough sex and relationships education 
and the factors influencing this perception. A press 
conference in Serbia was successful in achieving broadcast 
and print media coverage with a clear call to action for the 
government to introduce nationwide sex education in schools. 
The World Health Organization, meanwhile, has been 
referencing FOGS reports during planning meetings for 
Reproductive Health Indicators in the European Union.
 In June 2009, Peter Roach, Vice President of the Durex 
Network, spoke at The Global Business Coalition on HIV/AIDS, 
Tuberculosis and Malaria in Washington, DC. The coalition, of 
which SSL is a founding member, is dedicated to combating 
these three pandemics through the business sector’s unique 
skills and expertise. The conference was a good opportunity to 
make other business representatives aware of the importance 
of social investments in public health and some of the specific 
benefits to the corporate sector. 
 The Durex Network also contributed to a successful 
condom zone at the ninth International Congress on AIDS in 
Asia and the Pacific, which took place in Bali, Indonesia in 
August 2009.
thA i sex educ Ation te Acher tr Aining
As part of our ongoing commitment to promoting sex 
education in Thailand, SSL invited hundreds of teachers to 
attend a conference to discuss the future of sex education in 
the country.
 More than 400 teachers from across Thailand attended 
the ‘Durex Train the Trainers Phase T wo’ conference, which 
aimed to raise awareness about sexual health and explore new 
approaches to the issue. ●

(2009: £89.5 million).
 Cash generated from operations in the period was 
£135.8 million (2009: £101.6 million) thanks to the strong 
operating profit performance, continued improvements in 
working capital and a reduced level of restructuring expenditure.

DUREx
Durex sales grew 4.8 per cent to £293.7 million, driven by 
strong growth in China, Poland, the Germanics

 region and 
the Middle East.
 Sales of Durex condoms increased by 4.1 per cent to 
£244.4 million with robust performance across all categories. 
China continues to be a key driver of this growth coupled with 
solid performances in Eastern Europe, Switzerland and the 
Middle East.
 The Durex Play range, which includes personal lubricants 
and vibrators, continued its excellent growth. Sales increased  
8.4 per cent to £49.3 million with Spain delivering in excess of  
50 per cent growth despite a difficult economic environment. 
Benelux and Eastern Europe both made positive contributions 
to the growth.
 The continued success of the Play range demonstrates 
consumers’ desire for, and acceptance of, products designed  
to improve and enhance sexual experiences. Durex Play is well 
positioned to fulfil these needs with innovative product offerings 
and well developed distribution capabilities.
SCHOLL FOOTCARE
Sales of Scholl footcare were £168.0 million, an increase of 
4.6 per cent over the prior year. Japan, France and Germany 
all performed well, contributing to the overall growth in the 
category. The positive performance from these markets was 
adversely impacted by pharmacy destocking in Italy together 
with a difficult trading environment in the UK. 
 Our Cracked Heel Repair Cream Active Repair K+ has 
now sold almost £20 million since its launch in 2008 and is 
regularly recommended by doctors and footcare professionals 
around the world. Our latest innovation is a Hard Skin range, 
including a cream with a unique formulation of salicylic and lactic 
acids to soften and remove calluses.
SCHOLL FOOTWEAR
Scholl footwear sales increased by 7 .4 per cent to £105.9 million, 
driven by good performances in France, Italy and Germany. 
 Europe, as we have seen historically, accounts for the 
majority of our footwear business, however, during the year we 
have delivered promising results in Asia Pacific, largely driven by 
Thailand and Australia.

LOCALL y OWNED BRANDS
Sales of locally owned brands were down 4.4 per cent, or £3.0

pharmacies, coupled with the difficult UK trading environment, 
has adversely impacted the performance of this category. 
Successful launches of our innovative head lice treatment, Full

 Gross profit increased to £423.4 million (2009: £405.7 
million), representing a gross margin of 62.3 per cent compared 
with 60.8 per cent in the prior year. This improvement in gross 
margin demonstrates the continuing benefits being derived 
from the restructuring of our supply chain and the beneficial mix 
effect of good growth in the higher margin branded consumer 
business and the reduction in non-core, lower-margin other sales.
 Brand contribution increased by £16.8 million to 
£275.7 million, an increase of 6.5 per cent. Brand contribution 
represents 40.6 per cent of sales, an improvement of 1.8 per 
cent on the prior period as the strengthening gross margin has 
dropped straight to the brand contribution line. We have 
continued to invest in our brands, with advertising and promotion 
expenditure as a percentage of sales maintained at 15.5 per cent. 
We believe that this continued investment will position our 
brands to benefit from any improvement in consumer 
confidence and expenditure.
 Operating costs increased by £11.7 million, or 7 .0 per cent, 
to £179.0 million. Operating costs as a percentage of sales 
increased from 25.1 per cent to 26.3 per cent. £5.5 million  
of the absolute increase in operating costs is due to further 
incremental investment in our sales and marketing infrastructure 
and in innovation in the period. Administration costs increased 
by £6.2 million, of which broadly half was represented by 
increased amortisation, net one-off costs and incremental 
costs relating to the integration of the new businesses.
 Operating profit increased by £5.1 million, or 5.6 per cent, 
to £96.7 million, representing a 14.2 per cent operating margin 
(2009: 13.7 per cent).

The acquired businesses operate in two channels, consumer 
and medical. Branded consumer sales consist of condoms  
and lubricants mainly under the Contex and Durex brands, 
pregnancy testing kits under the Evitest brand and plasters using 
the Silkoplast brand. Scholl footcare currently has a minimal 
presence in Russia.
 Other sales consist of third party distributor brand  
sales such as medical gloves and surgical masks.
 The gross margin, at 61.7 per cent, is broadly in line with 
the Group’s average. Below that, however, the percentages of 
spend on advertising and promotion and on fixed operating 
costs differ significantly from the rest of the Group as their 
operating models are based more around trade relationships 
and effective use of their distribution networks. Targeted 
advertising and a fuller utilisation of distribution capabilities 
should generate excellent returns over coming periods.

with £13.0 million in 2009. 
 Net underlying interest costs decreased by £2.1 million,

lower average borrowings during the period. The IAS 19 pension 
interest charge for the period was £4.0 million (2009: £3.3 
million). The remaining charge of £0.6 million (2009: £1.5 million) 
primarily relates to changes in the fair value of financial 
instruments under IAS 39.
 The tax charge for the period was £30.0 million (2009: 
£21.0 million). The effective tax rate is 26.1 per cent (2009: 27 .5 
per cent) principally due to the higher weighting of profits 
generated in lower tax jurisdictions.
 The minority interests’ share of profit for the period is 
£13.9 million (2009: £1.0 million). The increase is primarily due  
to the consolidation of BLBV from 1 June 2009 when the 
shareholding increased to 50.6 per cent.
eArnings & dividends
Earnings per share increased by 20.0 per cent to 33.6 pence 
(2009: 28.0 pence). 
 The Directors recommend an increased final dividend up 
25 per cent to 8.0 pence per ordinary share (2009: 6.4 pence), 
which, subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General 
Meeting (‘AGM’) on 22 July 2010, will be paid on 2 September 
2010 to shareholders on the register on 6 August 2010. This will 
make a total dividend of 11.1 pence per ordinary share (2009: 9.0 
pence). Shareholders are able to take the dividend as cash or in 
shares, through the Dividend Re-investment Plan (‘DRIP’). 
Shareholders who wish to elect for the DRIP for the forthcoming 
final dividend, but have not already done so, should contact the 
Registrar, Capita Registrars, by 8 August 2010. 30/31	 FINANCIAL	RE v IEw	 CONTINUED

cA sh flow And bAlA nce s heet
Cash generated from operations in the period was £135.8 million 
(2009: £101.6 million). The increase in cash generated of £34.2 
million is due largely to the strong operating profit performance, 
continued focus on driving improvements in working capital and 
reduction in the level of exceptional cash costs relating to the 
restructuring of our supply chain. The Group continues to focus 
on improving the underlying cash flow from operations and this 
remains a key metric for our operational management 
throughout the Group. 
 One-off restructuring cash costs, relating principally  
to the ongoing restructuring of our European supply chain, 
amounted to £4.8 million in the period (2009: £12.3 million). 
 Cash outflow on acquisition relates to our investments 
in Russia and Ukraine. This amounted to £80.3 million in the 
period. In addition on 29 April 2010 we increased our 
shareholding in our Russian business to 75.3 per cent for  
USD 219.5 million (£144.0 million).
 On 11 May 2010, the Group exchanged contracts with 
the owners of Rosetex, a Polish condom brand, for the purchase 
of the brand and certain related assets for consideration of 
£3.9 million. Annual sales of Rosetex condoms are approximately 
£2.1 million.
 The cash outflow on acquisitions of property, plant and 
equipment amounting to £10.1 million relates principally to the 
ongoing investment in our manufacturing facilities – in China, 
Thailand, India and the UK.
 The acquisition of intangible assets relates to the 
continued rollout of the SAP IT platform, investment in our 
e-commerce platform and other smaller investments in  
product licences.
 Interest and tax payments amounted to £33.6 million. 
Dividends amounted to £31.7 million comprising £20.2 million 
paid to equity holders in SSL International plc plus £11.5 million 
paid to minority interests.
 Cash payments to the Group’s pension schemes 
amounted to £10.0 million in the period (2009: £9.8 million), 
in line with our deficit recovery schedule.
 The major movements in the Group’s balance sheet are 
shown in Table 4.

Closing net debt was £41.1 million compared with £17 .7 million at

 The Group’s main banking facility is a £410 million 
revolving credit facility. This facility was arranged in December 
2009 and is committed until June 2013. 
 The Group’s financial forecasts, taking account of 
reasonably possible fluctuations in trading performance and 
known significant committed expenditures, show that the  
Group should be able to operate within its current facility for  
the foreseeable future.
cA pit Al structure And tre Asury policy
iAs 32, iAs 39 And ifrs 7
IAS 32, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 require that certain disclosures relating 
to financial instruments are given in the financial statements, in 
order to provide information on the impact of such instruments 
on the Group’s risk profile, how this may affect the Group’s 
performance and financial position, and how those risks are 
managed. The impact of those financial instruments is 
considered in notes 23 and 24. f oreign exch Ange risk objective
The nature of the Group’s trading activities generates 
transactional foreign exchange rate risks. These arise from the 
sourcing of raw materials from different countries, the location 
of the Group’s production facilities throughout the world and the 
sale and distribution of finished goods in many countries. The 
objective of the Group’s foreign exchange policy is to minimise 
the trade exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations for the 
overseas entities and manage the risk from the centre. This 
requires that all trading-related exposures should be centralised 
in accordance with prescribed procedures and timetables under 
the direction of the Group Treasury function, which hedges the 
major exposures using forward contracts and options, usually for 
a period of between six and 12 months.
interest r Ate exposure objective
The interest rate risk management policy aims to reduce the 
impact of interest rate fluctuations on the Group’s net interest 
expense to acceptable levels. This is achieved through balancing 
the ratio of fixed or hedged debt to those financial liabilities with 
floating interest rates. Board approved instruments available to 
hedge this exposure include interest rate swaps, interest rate 
options and forward rate agreements. Details of the interest rate 
profile are given in note 16.
l iquidity risk
The primary objective of the Group Treasury Policy is to  
ensure that, at all times, the Group is able to meet its financial 
commitments as they fall due. To facilitate this, the Group 
Treasury function is responsible for the management of cash 
and liquid resources for the whole Group, and ensures that the 
Group has sufficient liquidity to meet any reasonable change  
in funding requirements. The Group’s liquidity, being defined as 
the aggregate of the Group’s cash, liquid resources and central 
undrawn committed facilities as at 31 March 2010, amounted  
to £375.6 million (2009: £230.5 million).
g oing c oncern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely  
to affect its future development, performance and position, the 
financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position 
and borrowing facilities are described in the Business Review 
section of the Annual Report and Accounts. In addition, notes 
20, 23 and 24 to the financial statements include the Group’s 
objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its 
financial risk management objectives, details of its financial 
instruments and hedging activities, and its exposure to credit  
risk and liquidity risk.
 The Group has delivered strong growth in the year to 
March 2010 and, notwithstanding the ongoing difficult trading 
environment, the Group’s growth prospects remain strong. As a 
consequence the Directors believe that the Group is well placed 
to manage its business risks successfully despite the uncertain 
economic outlook.
 The Directors confirm that, after making enquiries, they 
have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group 
have adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. ●

Business review  Annu Al r eport And Accounts 2010
There are risks and uncertainties connected to the Group’s 
businesses. The factors listed opposite are among those that 
the Group thinks could cause the actual results to differ 
materially from expected and historical results.
 Risk management is an important element of the system 
of internal control. This system is designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives 
and can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance 
against material loss. 
 The risk management process involves making all 
managers within the Group responsible for risk management 
and for ensuring that a full assessment of risks, both financial 
and  non-financial, has been completed. This is achieved by a 
bottom-up and top-down review of risks throughout the Group, 
from which a Group Risk Matrix (the ‘Matrix’) has been developed. 
This process has embedded risk management within the 
operational and executive management throughout the Group. 
 The Matrix is reviewed twice a year. Overall responsibility 
for the risk management process lies with the Executive 
Committee, which consists of the Executive Directors and  
certain other senior Executives. An overview of the process  
is presented above.
 The latest review of risks was undertaken in the light of 
the current economic outlook. The Matrix includes an assessment 
of the impact of the continuing economic difficulties on risks 
identified by the Group.

There is a written schedule of matters reserved to the Board.  
This schedule includes:
  Approval / development of the Group’s long-term objectives and 
commercial strategy;
  Approval of annual operating and capital expenditure budgets and  
any material changes to them;
  Review of performance in the light of the Group’s strategy, objectives,

corrective action is taken;
  Approval of major capital projects, including acquisitions;
  Approval of contracts which are material strategically, or by reason  
of size; and
  Monitoring the system of internal control and corporate governance.
To ensure proper consideration at the appropriate time, the Board  
has a schedule of matters for each meeting. These matters include:
  Reports from the Chief Executive and Finance Director;
  Health and safety;
  Presentations from the heads of the business units;
  Investor relations; 
  Regulatory reviews; and

* Non-Executive Directors
One of the Board meetings is devoted solely to strategy. If a Director  
is unable to attend a meeting, they receive the relevant papers and  
are invited to comment in advance of the meeting. 
 During the year under review, the Board continued to be led  
by the Chairman, Gerald Corbett. Garry Watts, the Chief Executive, is 
primarily responsible for the effective running of the Group’s business. 
There is a clear, written schedule on the division of responsibilities 
between the Chairman and the Chief Executive. In addition to the 
Chairman and Chief Executive, there are three Non-Executive Directors 
(one of whom, Peter Read, is the Senior Independent Director (‘SID’)) 
and two Executive Directors.
 Details of the Chairman’s professional commitments  
are included in his biography. The Board is satisfied that the other 
commitments of the Chairman do not interfere with the performance 
of his duties as Chairman. The Board considers that all of the Non-
Executive Directors are independent in character and judgement, and 
by reference to section A.3.1 of the Code and that controls are in place to 
ensure that no single Director has unfettered powers of decision.
 The management of operational matters within the Group is 
delegated to the Executive Committee, which comprises the Executive 
Directors and certain other senior executives. Biographical information 
on the members of the Executive Committee is shown on page 36. The 
Executive Committee meets monthly.
Bo Ard ev Alu Ation
During the year, the Board reviewed the process for the evaluation of the 
performance of the Board, its committees and the individual Directors. 
Previous evaluations have been conducted internally and led by the 
Chairman, whilst the SID conducted the evaluation of the Chairman.  
The Board concluded that this process remained appropriate. 
 The Chairman held discussions with the individual Directors. 
The evaluation took into account the views of each of the Directors  
on a number of areas, including the development of strategy; risk 
management; the composition of the Board and its processes; and  
the Board committees. The SID held discussions with the individual 
Directors in relation to the performance of the Chairman. The results of 
the evaluation were presented to the Board at its meeting in April 2010. 
No significant areas for development were identified.
 The Board considers the annual evaluation to be a valuable 
process, which has contributed to fostering an environment within the 
Board that is challenging but supportive, encourages focus on the main 
issues facing the Group and further enhances the Board’s procedures 
and working practices.
diAlogue with sh Areholders
The Company has a comprehensive investor relations programme 
involving existing and potential shareholders within the UK and overseas. 
This is led by the Chief Executive and the Finance Director, who along 
with other senior executives, meet with institutional investors on a 
regular basis. The Chairman, Senior Independent Director and other 
Non-Executive Directors are available to meet with shareholders as 
required. The Senior Independent Director attends the annual and 
half-year results presentations with shareholders and analysts. An 
investor relations report which includes details on share price 
movement, any significant changes in shareholdings and analysts’ 
reports is presented and considered at each Board meeting. 
 The Board uses the Annual General Meeting, which all  
Directors attend, to communicate with investors and encourage  
their participation. The Directors are available to speak informally  
with shareholders after the meeting.

Bo Ard c ommittees
The Board has established three committees. Each committee 
operates in accordance with formal terms of reference, which are 
reviewed annually and can be viewed on the Company’s website,  
www.ssl-international.com. The committee chairmen report at the next 
Board meeting on the proceedings of the committee which they chair.
Audit c ommittee
The Audit Committee comprises the three independent Non-Executive 
Directors and is chaired by Richard Adam. Mr Adam is the Finance 
Director of Carillion plc and therefore has recent and relevant financial 
experience.
 The Audit Committee met on three occasions during the year. 
At the end of each meeting, the Audit Committee meets privately with 
the external auditors without management. The Company Secretary 
acts as secretary to the Audit Committee. The activities of the Audit 
Committee are undertaken in line with an annual work plan.
PRINCIPAL ACTIv ITIES OF THE COMMITTEE DURING THE yEAR:
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: The Audit Committee reviewed and 
considered with management, the annual and half-year results and 
interim management statements. As a part of its review, the Audit 
Committee considered the reports of the external auditor on the annual 
and half-year results.
INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT: The Group has in place 
an ongoing process for evaluating the system of internal control and this 
is monitored by the Audit Committee. The Group maintains an internal 
audit function and the Head of Internal Audit attends each meeting of 
the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee reviews the Group’s internal 
audit processes and approves the annual internal audit plan. The Head 
of Internal Audit also meets in private with and has direct access to the 
Audit Committee.
 The Audit Committee reviews the Group’s risk management 
procedures. A significant element of this is the Group Risk Matrix (the 
‘Matrix’), which was reviewed by the Audit Committee twice during the year.
WHISTLE BLOWING ARRANGEMENTS: The Audit Committee reviewed 
the Group’s whistle blowing arrangements to ensure that employees 
may raise concerns about possible malpractice or wrongdoing by the 
Group or any of its employees on a confidential basis. The arrangements 
provide for the proportionate and independent investigation of any  
such matters.
Ex TERNAL AUDITORS: The KPMG Audit Director attends all Audit 
Committee meetings. The performance of KPMG as the external auditor 
was reviewed during the year and having undertaken this review, the 
Audit Committee recommends their reappointment.
 Safeguarding the independence of the external auditors is 
paramount and controls are in place to ensure their continued 
independence. However, there are occasions when services can be 
more efficiently undertaken by the external auditor and at no risk of 
impairment of their independence. The Audit Committee has put in 
place a detailed policy on the provision of services by the external 
auditors, which sets out the services that the external auditors are 
allowed to carry out on behalf of the Group and those which are 
prohibited to them. Under this policy, external auditors cannot be 
engaged to provide any of the following services:
  Design or implementation of IT systems;
  v aluation;
  Internal audit; and
  Corporate finance advice, recruitment, or executive compensation 
advice. 
Secondment of senior audit staff to the Company is also prohibited.
 Under this policy, it has been agreed that due to their 
understanding of the Group’s business and therefore ensuring cost 
efficiency, the external auditors may be engaged for the following 
non-audit services, for which there is a pre-agreed limit for fees  
(not including v AT) which do not require prior approval from the  
Audit Committee:
  Audit-related regulatory reporting including half-yearly review, 
covenant reporting and other audit certificates (£100,000 p.a.);
  Further assurance including advice on accounting matters, non-
regulatory reporting on internal controls or corporate governance, due 
diligence work and environmental audits (£50,000 per project); and
  Tax compliance and tax advisory services (£50,000 per project).

 The Audit Committee is satisfied that the level and scope of 
non-audit services undertaken by the external auditors does not impair 
their independence.
 A breakdown of fees paid to the external auditors during the 
year is set out in note 2 on page 65. The Audit Committee reviewed the 
fees and recommended their approval to the Board.

intern Al control
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control  
and for reviewing its effectiveness, and this is monitored by the Audit 
Committee. Key elements of this system include:
  Regular Board meetings with a formal schedule of matters reserved 
for Board discussion;
  Clearly defined segregation of duties, organisational structures and 
appropriate delegation of authority (adherence to which is kept under 
review);
  Centralised treasury operations operating within defined limits;
  Group accounting manuals and procedures; 
  Annual compliance statements from all statutory units within the 
Group, stating compliance with Group accounting manuals; and
  An effective internal audit function, which reports regularly to the 
Audit Committee and provides independent scrutiny of internal 
control systems and risk management procedures.
 The Board has established ongoing procedures for identifying, 
evaluating and managing significant risks and these are reviewed 
regularly. Risk management is embedded within the day-to-day activities 
of all executives. Management of this area is the responsibility of the 
Executive Committee. A significant element of this process is the 
maintenance of a Group Risk Matrix (the ‘Matrix’). The Matrix contains 
both financial and non-financial risks, identified through regular 
top-down and bottom-up reviews. More detail on the Matrix is given on 
pages 32 to 33.
 However, such a system is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can 
provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
 The Board believes that the Company operates an effective 
ongoing and embedded system of internal control, including in  
relation to the financial reporting process and the preparation of the 
consolidated accounts and is confident that it complies with Internal 
Control Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code (the ‘Turnbull 
Report’). This process has been in place for the year under review and up 
to the date of the approval of this report.
 Further information about the risk management processes is 
given on pages 32 and 33.
directors’ conflicts of interests
The Company’s Articles of Association permit the Board to consider 
and, if it sees fit, to authorise potential conflicts of interest and to impose 
limits or conditions, as appropriate when giving any authorisation. The 
Nomination Committee is responsible for reviewing annually any conflict 
authorisations granted by the Board and will make recommendations  
as to their continuation and any changes to any terms or conditions. 
Conflicts were authorised by the Board in compliance with the formal 
conflict management procedures. Directors are required to inform the 
Chairman and the Company Secretary of any new potential or actual 
conflict of interest. The procedures for ensuring that the Board’s powers 
of authorisation of conflicts are operated effectively will be reported 
annually.

During the year and up to the date of this report, the Directors consider 
that the Company complied with the Code. 
g oing concern
After making enquiries, the Directors believe that the Group and the 
Company have adequate resources to operate for the foreseeable

subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) 
on 22 July 2010, will be paid on 2 September 2010 to shareholders on the 
register on 6 August 2010. This will make a total dividend of 11.1 pence per 
share (2009: 9.0 pence). Shareholders are able to take the dividend as 
cash or in shares, through the Dividend Re-investment Plan (‘DRIP’). 
Shareholders who wish to elect for the DRIP for the forthcoming final 
dividend but have not already done so should contact the Registrar,

dear s hareholder
i am very pleased to submit the directors’ r emuneration 
report for the year ended 31 m arch 2010.
 t he r emuneration c ommittee’s (the ‘c ommittee’) 
aim is to maintain a remuneration framework which 
incentivises the senior team to outperform against 
challenging targets, which are set to drive sustainable 
business performance. t he link between the achievement 
of the g roup’s goals and the reward of our talented senior 
management team (‘smt ’) is a continuing key factor in the 
outstanding performance of the g roup. t he c ommittee 
reviews this approach annually. t he committee believes 
that the policy described in this report contributes 
towards the success of the ssl g roup and does not 
encourage the executives to take undue risks. 
 t he smt has delivered exceptional returns to 
shareholders, as is shown by the five-year tsr chart on 
page 51. o ver this period, an initial £100 investment in ssl 
shares would be worth around £290 at 31 march 2010.  
t his compares with around £140, if the money had been 
invested in the ftse 350. w e have progressed in the ftse 
and at the time of writing, ssl sits within the top 130 uk 
listed companies. At the same time, the geographical size 
and complexity of the g roup has increased significantly, 
which has led to a very material change to the scope and 
complexity of the smt ’s roles.
 ssl has significant ambition for further growth in 
the next few years driven by the energy, experience and 
drive of the executive team that we now have in place. the 
c ommittee wishes to recognise this with motivational 
rewards for achievement of the ambitious targets as well 
as to ensure that, as ssl grows, our talented team is 
retained and adequately rewarded in a competitive 
environment. t herefore, the c ommittee has determined 
that there should be a material adjustment to the 
remuneration of the executive directors and certain 
members of the smt. details of the increases for executive 
directors are described in this report.
 t he c ompany’s major institutional shareholders 
have been consulted regarding changes to remuneration. 
peter reAd
CHAIRMAN, REMUNERATION COMMITTEE r emuner Ation policy
The main objective of the policy is to attract, retain and motivate those 
people of the highest calibre who have the skills needed to lead the 
Group to achieve its objectives year on year.
 The Committee is satisfied that the remuneration policy does 
not in any way encourage the SMT to take inappropriate business risks. In 
particular the Committee considers that there is an appropriate balance 
between performance and non-performance linked elements of pay 
and a complementary blend of different financial performance metrics, 
with performance measured over annual and longer-term periods. This 
ensures that there is encouragement for sustained and significant 
improvement in overall financial performance.
 The principles of the policy are:
  Providing a truly motivational incentive scheme which drives 
individuals to work to realise the Company’s ambition for growth in the 
short and long term;
  Ensuring that there is an appropriate balance between short-term and 
long-term targets, with a significant proportion of the remuneration 
subject to carefully considered long-term performance conditions;
  Aligning the interests of Executives with those of shareholders;
  Effectively using the Company’s equity for the purposes of reward and 
retention; and
  Encouraging Executives to build and maintain a meaningful 
shareholding in the Company.
In making the changes to the remuneration levels this year, the 
Committee considers that it has acted fully in line with the policy and in 
the best interests of shareholders and the Company. The Committee is 
satisfied that the remuneration is no more than could be earned by the 
Executive Directors if they were to pursue their executive careers 
elsewhere within the industry in which they operate. 
 The structure of remuneration for Executive Directors is 
illustrated in the charts below. This shows the proportionate breakdown 
of the package at target and maximum remuneration (showing the target 
levels of the annual bonus and Performance Share Plan) as a proportion 
of the maximum:
Proportion of fixed vs performance-related remuneration (%)
CHIEF EXECUTIVE
TARGET
MAXIMUM
OTHER DIRECTORS
TARGET
MAXIMUM
020406080 100
Salary Pension Annual Bonus Performance Share Plan
This shows that a significant proportion of the package comprises 
short- and long-term performance linked elements, with the proportion 
increasing at the higher level of performance.
 BASE SALARy: Salaries are reviewed annually and are 
determined by individual performance and responsibilities and by 
reference to market salary levels obtained from independent sources. 
This is the only element of remuneration which is pensionable. The base 
salaries of the Executive Directors were frozen during the year ended  
31 March 2010 and in prior years the level of any increases has tended 
to be relatively modest compared to the increase in scope and 
responsibility of the individuals’ roles. 
 For the year commencing 1 April 2010, the base salaries of the 
Executive Directors have been increased, recognising their outstanding 
performance (and their increased value in the employment market) and 
to reflect the expanded scope of their roles and responsibilities. 
Accordingly, the base salaries of Garry Watts, Ian Adamson and Mark 
Moran have increased to £675,000, £400,000 and £375,000 
respectively (previously £575,000, £315,000 and £290,000).
 Pay and conditions in the workforce are taken into account 
when considering the Executive Directors’ salaries. Whilst the material 
increases to base salary levels of Executive Directors have not been 
replicated wholesale throughout the Group, salary reviews across the 
Group are similarly structured to take into account significant increases 
in responsibility and outstanding performance. Otherwise, salary 
increases are, in the main, generally in line with market norms or (if 
greater) salary inflation in the countries in which the Group operates.
 ANNUAL BONUS: This is a cash plan, with performance targets 
that are designed to drive growth and complementary behaviours within 
the wider executive population, aligned to the sustainable achievement 
of Group objectives.
 The maximum potential bonus payable is 175 per cent of  
base salary for the Chief Executive and 150 per cent for the Executive 
Directors (previously 125 per cent and 115 per cent respectively).  
No specific targets are set for the Executive Directors relating to 
environmental, social and governance (‘ESG’) performance. The 
Company’s performance in relation to ESG matters is robustly 
monitored and the Committee would consider any failure in these areas 
when determining any payment of bonus. The increase in annual bonus 
potential is appropriate, recognising the highly challenging targets set 
from a level of profitability at a five-year high and the fact that the sliding 
scale of performance has been increased very significantly from 102.5 
per cent to 107.5 per cent of target in order for maximum bonus to be 
payable.
 As the performance measures have served the Company well 
to date, they are unchanged from the previous year. One-third of the 
annual bonus is based upon Economic v alue Added (‘Ev A’) targets, and 
two-thirds is based on earnings per share (‘EPS’) targets.
 Ev A (which is calculated as normalised operating profit after tax 
less the cost of all capital employed to produce those earnings) 
captures the three basic generic strategies for creating value:
  To increase economic return for capital employed;
  To grow by investing in new products whose return more than 
compensates for the risk taken; and 
  To curtail investment and divert capital from uneconomic activities.
The potential payment of the annual bonus for both Ev A and EPS parts 
of the annual bonus will be as shown in the following table:
performance vs target  97.5% 100% 107.5%
% of salary for Chief Executive 17.5%	 87.5%	 175.0%
% of salary for Executive Directors 15.0%	 75.0%	 150.0% 44/45	 REMUNERATIo N	RE po RT	 CONTINUED
govern Ance  Annu Al r eport And Accounts 2010
The threshold of 97.5 per cent of target represents an increase over  
the 2009/10 EPS and an improvement in Ev A over the prior year.  
No bonus would be payable on results below the threshold. Maximum 
bonus would be paid upon the achievement of 107.5 per cent of target 
(2009/10: 102.5 per cent).
 The Committee has increased the scale of performance versus 
maximum to reflect the Company’s significant ambition for further 
growth and recognising the increase to the annual bonus potential.
  The annual bonus is designed to drive complementary 
behaviours across the senior executive population as well as to align with 
the Group’s goals and with shareholders’ interests. The table below 
illustrates the cascade of targets for the year ended 31 March 2010 for 
the ‘Business Driver Group’. The Business Driver Group has historically 
consisted of 35 employees. To reflect the expansion of the Company, 
the Business Driver Group has now increased to approximately 60 
employees and in addition to the Executive Directors, comprises the 
Executive Committee and certain other senior executives. This 
expanded population also reflects the Group’s widening geographical 
spread. Typically, individuals will be incentivised on two to three of  
these targets:

Overall, the Committee is satisfied that the annual bonus has created an 
excellent link between reward and Company performance.
perform Ance shA re plA n (‘ psp ’)
All Executive Directors and the Business Driver Group participate in the 
PSP, which is the Group’s only long-term incentive plan. As previously 
explained, the Business Driver Group has increased from 35 employees 
to approximately 60 employees. Under the PSP, conditional awards of 
shares are granted each year.
 Subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions, 
determined annually by the Committee, awards vest on the third 
anniversary of grant.
 Details of outstanding awards are shown on page 49.
 To incentivise the Executive Directors to realise the Company’s 
ambition to create significantly more shareholder value, the Committee 
has determined that the annual award made to Executive Directors be 
increased from 100 per cent to 200 per cent of salary. Awards made to 
certain other key executives will also increase but will be at a lower 
multiple of base salary. The vesting of these awards continues to be 
subject to the achievement of a combination of EPS (one-third) and EvA 
(two-thirds) targets. The continued policy of basing the performance 
conditions on the Company’s financial performance creates a very 
effective incentive. The Committee monitors performance targets to 
ensure that such targets remain sufficiently stretching and aligned to  
the interests of shareholders.
 Due to the financial nature of the performance conditions it is 
not possible to calculate an expected value using an option valuation 
model.
 The vesting schedule for the proposed award is as follows:
 eps (1/3rd) ev A (2/3rds) 
 c ompound annual  Aggregate 
 growth rate (cA gr ) over  generated over the 
 the three financial three financial years 
 years ending m arch 2013 ending m arch 2013

A sliding scale of payment will operate between the points in the target 
range. Despite EPS and Ev A also being used for the annual bonus plan, 
the Committee is satisfied that there is little overlap between the two 
plans. Under the PSP, performance is measured over three years, 
compared to a single financial year for the annual bonus, thus requiring 
sustained high performance for targets to be achieved.
 EPS and Ev A will be calculated by the Company and 
achievement of the targets will be independently verified before the 
awards vest. The Committee is satisfied that the target range for both 
measures is sufficiently stretching and that their achievement would 
result in significant shareholder value creation. In particular, it is 
recognised that a relatively low (by market standards) proportion of  
the award vests at the initial vesting threshold.
 Awards will not confer shareholder rights until the awards have 
vested and participants have received their shares. Participants will be 
entitled to receive a payment (in cash and/or shares) on, or shortly 
following, the vesting of their awards, of an amount equivalent to the 
total dividends that would have been paid on those shares between  
the time when the awards were granted and the time when they vest.
 Shares to satisfy awards may be purchased in the market (via 
the Company’s Employee Benefit Trust) or by newly issued shares. 
Dilution for all schemes is held within the Association of British Insurers 
(ABI) limits. The dilution levels compared to ABI limits as at 31 March 
2010 were: 
ABi limit    ssl dilution
10% over 10 years for all share schemes  3.92%
5% over 10 years for discretionary schemes  3.22% shA reholding guidelines
All participants in the PSP are required to retain a proportion of the 
shares (net of tax) that vest to them until a shareholding measured by 
reference to their base salary is achieved. All Executive Directors will be 
expected to retain at least 50 per cent of shares (net of tax) which vest 
to them under the PSP until a shareholding equivalent to 100 per cent of 
base salary is achieved. All Executive Directors hold shares in excess of 
this amount. Other participants will be expected to build shareholdings 
ranging from 25 per cent to 50 per cent of base salary.
employee s Avings rel Ated sh Are option scheme
The Company operates a HMRC approved employee savings related 
share option scheme (‘SAy E Scheme’). The previous scheme expired in 
July 2006. The final grant was made under this scheme on 28 January 
2005 offering three- and five-year savings contracts, with a 237 pence 
option price. The final options under the five-year contract matured on  
1 April 2010. A new HMRC SA y E scheme was approved by shareholders  
at the 2009 Annual General Meeting. The first invitation to all eligible  
UK employees will be made during 2010. As is the case with all savings-
related share option schemes open to employees, there are no 
performance criteria. 
o ther sh Are pl Ans
Shareholder approval is being sought at the 2010 Annual General 
Meeting to establish two new HMRC approved share plans, a Share 
Incentive Plan and a Company Share Option Plan.
pensions
The Company operates a number of retirement benefit programmes 
throughout the world. Such benefits reflect local competitive conditions 
and legal requirements.
 In the UK, the Company operates three defined benefit 
schemes and a contracted-in defined contribution scheme, the SSL UK 
Pension Scheme (the ‘SSL Scheme’) for UK employees. All UK defined 
benefit schemes are closed to new entrants and future pension accrual.
 Ian Adamson and Mark Moran participate in the SSL Scheme and 
contribute 5 per cent of their base salary. They receive 25 per cent of base 
salary in respect of retirement provision. Any contributions that are not 
made in respect of retirement provision are paid as a salary supplement.
 Ian Adamson is also a member of the Seton Healthcare Group 
Plc and Life Assurance Scheme, one of the defined benefit schemes 
referred to above.
 Garry Watts, Chief Executive, is not a member of the SSL Scheme 
but operates a personal pension plan. Garry Watts receives 25 per cent of 
base salary in respect of retirement provision. Any contributions that are 
not made in respect of retirement provision are paid as a salary supplement.
o ther Benefits
The Company provides other benefits to all Executive Directors and 
certain other Executives, in line with the benefits generally provided in 
their country of employment, namely a company car or car allowance, 
life assurance, income protection and private medical insurance. The 
value of all taxable benefits of the Executive Directors is disclosed in the 
Directors’ emoluments table on page 46.
s ervice contr Acts
It is Company policy that the notice period in Executive Directors’ contracts 
should not exceed one year. However, the Committee retains the discretion 
to offer a notice period to an Executive Director in excess of one year, 
in exceptional circumstances, where this is considered necessary.
 The Executive Directors’ contracts have no fixed term but 
provide that either the Director or the Company may terminate the 
employment by giving one year’s notice.

There are no express provisions for compensation payable in the event 
of termination except that Garry Watts’ contract provides that, if the 
Company terminates Mr Watts’ appointment with immediate effect, 
in addition to his contractual notice period, Mr Watts shall be entitled 
to a payment equivalent to the average of any bonus paid within the 
three-year period prior to the date of termination. The Committee is 
satisfied that the inclusion of an award in respect of annual bonus is 
appropriate, as this incorporates a performance-related element  
to any compensation payment.
 If the employment of an Executive Director is terminated, the 
Committee’s policy is to apply mitigation to compensation payments at 
a level determined by reference to the individual circumstances of the 
Executive Director. Appropriate external and human resource advice 
would be obtained in each case.
n on- executive directors
Save as disclosed below, none of the Non-Executive Directors has a 
service contract.
 Gerald Corbett was appointed Non-Executive Chairman of  
the Company on 1 August 2005 for an initial term of three years. The 
appointment has been renewed for a further three years and is 
terminable upon 12 months notice by either party. Mr Corbett receives 
an annual fee of £195,000 (increased from £180,000 with effect from  
1 April 2010) and a company car.
 The basic annual fee for Non-Executive Directors is £45,000 
(increased from £40,000 with effect from 1 April 2010). Committee 
Chairmen receive an additional fee of £10,000 p.a. The Senior 
Independent Director receives a further £5,000 p.a.

The Company recognises that Executive Directors may be invited to 
become Non-Executive Directors of other companies. These 
appointments can be beneficial to both the individual and the Company 
in providing further experience and knowledge, but the Company’s

Full details of the options over ordinary shares in the Company held by 
Executive Directors who served during the year and any movements in 
those options are shown below:
earnings per share figures for the financial years ended 2002, 2003 
and 2004 were rebased. In light of the rise in the share price during 
the year to 31 March 2008, the Committee agreed that the earnings 
per share figures for the financial year 2001 be rebased. The 
calculations to determine all figures were independently checked by 
Ernst & young LLP, although Ernst & young LLP expressed no opinion 
on the accuracy of the base data and the appropriateness of the 
underlying assumptions. 
3.  On 9 June 2009, Garry Watts, Ian Adamson and Mark Moran 
respectively exercised options over shares in the Company as 
follows: 98,305 granted at 295.0 pence per share, 54,915 granted at 
295.0 pence per share and 145,630 granted at 309.0 pence per 
share. The market price on 9 June 2009 was 507.5 pence per share. 
On 25 November 2009, Garry Watts exercised options over 72,260 
shares in the Company, granted at 506.5 pence per share. The 
market price on 25 November 2009 was 733.0 pence per share. All 
exercises were in respect of the SSL International 1996 Executive 
Share Option Scheme.
4.  There are no performance criteria for exercise of options under the 
SAy E scheme.
5.  The market price of the Company’s shares was 813.0 pence on 
31 March 2010 and ranged from 426.8 pence to 813.0 pence during 
the year.
6.  No options were granted in the period.
7.  On 6 April 2010, Ian Adamson and Mark Moran exercised options 
over shares in the Company, granted at 237.0 pence per share – 
2,091 shares and 6,972 shares respectively. The market price on  
6 April 2010 was 841.5 pence per share. Both exercises were in 
respect of the SSL Sharesave Scheme (an employees’ share 
scheme).
8.  The aggregate gross gains made by Directors on the exercise of share 
options during the year were £778,336.95 (2009:£22,596.37).  
The gains are calculated based on the market price at the date of 
exercise, although the shares may have been retained and no  
gain realised.
notes:
1.  Exercise is subject to growth in normalised earnings per share during 
the performance period exceeding the retail price index (RPI). The 
targets for each grant are as follows:
1.1  Exercise is subject to growth in normalised earnings per share for not 
less than three years commencing on 1 April 2001 exceeding the 
growth in RPI by at least an average 2 per cent p.a. This condition has 
been met.
1.2  Exercise is subject to growth in normalised earnings per share for 
three years commencing on 1 April 2002 exceeding the growth in RPI 
by no less than 2 per cent p.a. This condition has been met.
1.3  Exercise is subject to growth in normalised earnings per share for 
three years commencing on 1 April 2004 exceeding the growth in RPI 
by no less than 3 per cent p.a. This condition has been met. 
1.4  Exercise is subject to performance conditions that must be satisfied 
over initially a three-year period although this may be extended up to 
five years. The exercise is subject to growth in normalised earnings 
per share exceeding the growth in RPI by at least an average of 3 per 
cent p.a. and TSR of the Company when compared to TSR of 
companies of the FTSE 250 reaching sixth decile for 50 per cent of 
the option to become exercisable, between sixth and eighth decile 
for a pro-rata between 50 per cent and 100 per cent of the option to 
become exercisable and eighth decile and above for 100 per cent of 
the option to become exercisable. Both the earnings per share and 
TSR conditions have been met.
2.  Following the disposal of the Group’s medical business (and the 
resultant reduction in earnings), the Committee reviewed the 
performance conditions attaching to options granted under the  
SSL 1996 Executive Share Option Scheme. It was agreed that the 
performance criteria should be rebased to fairly compare historical 
earnings with those in the ongoing business, but the rebased figures 
should be no less stretching than the previous targets. Given the 
share price at the time of grants (which was in excess of 480 pence), 
the Committee determined that only earnings since the financial 
year ended 31 March 2002 would be reviewed. Consequently, the

The vesting of awards is subject to the satisfaction of performance 
targets over a three-year period. The award price is the average of the 
middle market quotations for an SSL share derived from the Official List 
of the UKLA for the five consecutive dealing days preceding the date of 
the award.
notes:
1.  These awards vested in full on 9 June 2009. The market price on 
9 June 2009 was 507 .5 pence. The aggregate gross gains made by 
Directors on the vesting of awards under the Performance Share Plan 
during the year were £1,843,970.80 (2009: £1,526,623.56). The gains 
are calculated based on the market price at the date of vesting of share 
awards, although the shares may have been retained and no gain 
realised. Under the awards, executives are entitled to a cash payment 
equivalent in value to the dividends payable on the vested shares over 
the vesting period. The value of the dividend equivalent was: G Watts 
— £44,672.74; I Adamson — £20,861.20; and M Moran — £20,861.20.
2.  Over the period, RPI has grown by 8.0 per cent. EPS grew by 96.4 per 
cent, therefore, the award will vest in full.
3.  The vesting of these awards are subject to the satisfaction of 
performance targets over the three-year period commencing on  
1 April 2008. To the extent to which these targets are met, 50 per cent 
of the total shares calculated above will vest on the fourth anniversary 
of the date of grant and the remaining 50 per cent of the total shares 
calculated above will vest on the fifth anniversary of the date of grant, 
assuming the Director is still employed by SSL on those dates.

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the 
Group and Parent Company financial statements, in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. 
 Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and 
Parent Company financial statements for each financial year.  Under 
that law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and 
have elected to prepare the Parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with UK accounting standards and applicable law (UK 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
 Under Company law the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Parent Company and of 
their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and 
Parent Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
  for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
  for the Parent Company financial statements, state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to 
any material departures disclosed and explained in the Parent 
Company financial statements; and
  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it 
is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Parent Company 
will continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting  
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Parent Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Parent Company and enable them to ensure 
that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and 
detect fraud and other irregularities.
 Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Directors’ report, Directors’ remuneration 
report and Corporate governance statement that complies with that law 
and those regulations.
 The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
r esponsi Bility st Atement of the directors in respect 
of the Annu Al fin Anci Al report
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
  the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable 
set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and loss of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
  the Directors’ report, Chairman’s statement, Chief Executive’s review 
and Financial review include a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Company and  
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties  
that they face.

for the year ended 31 March 2010 1. Group accountinG policies
In the financial statements and related notes, the term ‘Company’ 
refers to SSL International plc, a company incorporated in the UK; the 
Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its 
subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’ or ‘SSL’).
(a) Basis of preparation 
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going 
concern basis, in pounds sterling, rounded to the nearest hundred 
thousand and are prepared on an historical cost basis, modified to 
include revaluation to fair value of certain financial instruments as 
described below. After making enquiries, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
forseeable future as detailed in the Financial Review on page 31. 
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the Annual Report and financial statements. The Group 
financial statements have been prepared and approved by the 
directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the EU (‘Adopted IFRS’). The Company has 
elected to prepare its Parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with UK GAAP, these are presented on pages 102 to 109. 
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently 
in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the 
financial statements, except as noted below.
In these financial statements the following new standards have 
been adopted for the first time:
IAS 1 (revised 2007) ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ is 
mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 
2009. The statement requires the presentation of a statement of 
changes in equity as a primary statement, separate from the income 
statement and statement of comprehensive income, which has 
replaced the statement of recognised income and expense. As a result, 
a consolidated statement of changes in equity has been included in the 
primary statements, showing changes in each component of equity for 
each period presented. Comparative information has been re-
presented so that it is in conformity with the revised standard. The 
Group has adopted the revised standard; there is no impact upon the 
financial statements other than presentation.
IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ is mandatory for the first time for 
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. The standard 
requires that the segments should be reported on the same basis as 
the internal reporting information that is provided to, and regularly 
reviewed by, the chief operating decision-maker (‘CODM’), whom the 
Group has identified as the Executive Directors.
The Board has reviewed the requirements of IFRS 8, including 
consideration of what results and information the Executive Directors 
review regularly to assess performance and allocate resources, and 
concluded that, as under IAS 14, the Group’s reportable segments 
remain geographical, which is consistent with both the basis of internal 
reporting and the allocation of resources by the CODM. The Directors 
consider there to be three operating segments, being Europe, 
Americas, and Asia Pacific and the Rest of the World, each of which is 
separately reportable. The Executive Directors assess the commercial 
performance of these geographical segments based upon analysis of 
sales and segmental result, which is defined as operating profit. 
Manufacturing performance and resource allocation is likewise 
assessed on its net cost to the operating segments versus internal 
targets and outsourced alternatives. Central costs relate entirely to  
the European segment, and are therefore included within the result  
for that segment.
The European and Asia Pacific and the Rest of the World 
segments generate revenue from the sale of Durex, Scholl footcare and 
Scholl footwear branded products, in addition to sales derived from 
locally-owned brands and the distribution of other consumer products. 
The Americas segment derives sales from the sale of Durex branded 
products.
During the year, the Group has also adopted the following 
other new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations 
issued under IFRS which are mandatory for accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2009, but which have no material effect 
on the Group’s results or equity:
Amendments to:
IFRS 2 ‘Share based payment: Vesting conditions and cancellations’
IFRS 7 ‘Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments’
IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’
IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’
IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’
IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’
Interpretations:
IFRIC 14 ‘IAS 19 — The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding 
requirement and their interaction’
SSL’s management considers the following accounting 
policies to be significant in the context of the Group’s operations.
(B) Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consist of the financial statements of 
the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries).
SubS idiarieS
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when 
the Group has the power, either directly or indirectly, to govern the 
financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain economic 
benefits from its activities. The financial statements of subsidiaries are 
included in the consolidated financial information from the date 
control commences until the date that control ceases.
Where the reporting date of the subsidiary undertaking differs 
from that of the Group, the Group’s share of results included in the 
consolidated income statement is based on rolled forward information 
which coincides with the Group’s reporting date.
TranS ac TionS elimina Ted on con Solida Tion
Intragroup balances, and any unrealised gains and losses or income 
and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in 
preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised losses are 
eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent 
that there is no evidence of impairment.
(c) use of estimates and jud Gements
The preparation of the financial statements requires management to 
make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
application of the accounting policies and the reported amounts of 
assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Estimates and underlying 
assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revision to accounting 
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised 
and in any future periods affected.
The Directors believe that the most critical accounting policies 
and significant areas of judgement and estimation arise from 
accounting for defined benefit pension schemes under IAS 19 
‘Employee Benefits’, for goodwill and intangible assets under IAS 36 
‘Intangible Assets’ and provisions under IAS 37 ‘Provisions, Contingent 
Liabilities and Contingent Assets’. Judgement is also required in the 
classification of borrowings between current and non-current.
Defined benefit pension schemes are accounted for in 
accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries, but 
significant judgements are required in relation to the assumptions for 
future salary and pension increases, inflation, the discount rate applied 
to the liabilities, investment returns and member mortality that 
underpin their valuations. Information on the assumptions used and 
notes to the consolidated financial statements
60/61  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
a nnual r eport and a ccounts 2010  (f) o ther intanGiB le assets
Intangible assets that are acquired, which can be separately identified 
and the cost of which can be measured reliably, are capitalised and 
amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful economic 
lives subject to any recognised impairment in value, usually between 
three and 20 years. In determining the useful economic life each asset 
is reviewed separately and consideration given to the period over which 
the Group expects to derive economic benefit from the asset. The 
useful economic life for significant assets is reviewed annually.
Software developments and licences capitalised are stated at 
cost less accumulated amortisation and are amortised on a straight 
line basis over their estimated useful economic lives as follows:
 software development: five to 10 years
 software licences: over the length of the licence
Where an asset is deemed to have an indefinite useful economic life it 
is not amortised but is, instead, subject to annual impairment review to 
ensure the carrying value of the asset is supportable.
(G) impairment
Financial aSSe TS
A financial asset is assessed at each reporting date to determine 
whether there is any objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial 
asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that 
one or more events have had a negative effect on the estimated future 
cash flows of that asset. All impairment losses are recognised in profit 
or loss. 
n on-financial assets
The carrying value of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than 
inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting 
date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.  
If any such indication exists then the asset’s recoverable amount is 
estimated. For goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives, 
the recoverable amount is estimated at each reporting date.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of  
an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.  
A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable asset group that 
generates cash flows that are largely independent from other assets 
and groups. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. 
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are 
allocated first to reduce the carrying value of any goodwill allocated to 
the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in 
the unit (group of units) on a pro-rata basis.
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is 
the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In 
assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted 
to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific 
to the asset.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In 
respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods 
are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has 
decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there 
has been a change in estimates used to determine the recoverable 
amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the 
asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that 
would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation,  
if no impairment loss had been recognised.
the sensitivity of the liability to a change on the assumptions can be 
found in note 17 .
The measurement of intangible assets both on business 
combinations and other asset acquisitions requires assessment of  
the existence of such assets and whether they can be separately and 
reliably measured. Assumptions and estimates are made about future 
cash flows and appropriate discount rates to value identified intangible 
assets, and for subsequent annual impairment reviews as performed in 
accordance with IAS 36. For details of goodwill and intangibles and the 
impairment reviews performed refer to note 8.
When accounting for provisions, the Group has taken internal 
and external advice in assessing the level of provision required. Details 
of the provisions made and the key assumptions can be found in  
note 18.
The basis of the classification of the Group’s committed 
borrowing facility is provided in note 16.
(d) r evenue
Revenue represents the fair value of consideration receivable, being 
the value of goods provided during the year net of trade discounts, 
cash discounts, retrospective and other rebates, value added and sales 
taxes. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised upon transfer to 
the customer of significant risks and rewards of ownership. Generally, 
this will be when goods are dispatched to the customer. Credit note 
reserves are provided at each period-end to account for management 
estimates of customer returns and are deducted from revenue. Any 
returns in excess of the amount provided would also be deducted from 
revenue. Discounts and rebates are accounted for in the period they 
are earned.
(e) Business com Binations and Goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and 
businesses, representing any excess of the fair value of the 
consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, is capitalised and is subject 
to impairment review annually, and when there is any indication that the 
carrying value may not be recoverable. 
On the subsequent disposal or termination of a business 
acquired since 1 March 1998, the profit or loss on disposal or 
termination is calculated after charging the carrying value of any related 
goodwill. 
Prior to transition to IFRS, goodwill was amortised in line with 
UK GAAP. On transition to IFRS, the goodwill balance was frozen.
The Group’s policy up to and including the year ended  
28 February 1998 was to write off goodwill arising upon acquisition 
against reserves. Under IFRS 1 and IFRS 3 such goodwill will remain 
eliminated against reserves and will not form part of any subsequent 
profit/loss on disposal. 
STep acquiSiT ionS
Step acquisitions arise when the Group acquires control of an entity 
through successive share purchases. The identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities acquired are recorded at fair value on the date 
that control is acquired. On the date that control is obtained, the 
amount recognised as goodwill or negative goodwill is determined 
separately for each tranche acquired, calculated as the difference 
between the fair value of the consideration paid and the fair value of 
the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, in 
accordance with IFRS 3 (2004) Business Combinations. Any changes in 
the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired between 
the initial investment date and the date that control is obtained are 
recorded in other reserves in equity to the extent that they have not 
previously been recognised in the income statement. notes to the consolidated financial statements

reserve. On a subsequent disposal such gains or losses will form part  
of the profit / loss on disposal within the income statement. Any 
ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss. 
(k) post-retirement Benefits
deF ined conT ribuT ion planS
Obligations for defined contribution plans are recognised as an 
expense in the income statement when they are due.
deF ined beneFiT planS
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans 
is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of 
future benefits that employees have earned in return for their service in 
the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine 
its present value, and any unrecognised past service costs and the fair 
value of any plan assets are deducted. The discount rate is the yield at 
the reporting date on AA credit-rated bonds that have maturity dates 
approximating the terms of the Group’s obligations. The calculation is 
performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit 
method. When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the 
recognised asset is limited to the net total of any unrecognised past 
service costs and the present value of any future refunds from the plan 
or reductions in future contributions to the plan. An economic benefit 
is available to the Group if it is realisable during the life of the plan or on 
settlement of the plan liabilities.
When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the 
increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised in 
the income statement on a straight-line basis over the average period 
until the benefits become vested. T o the extent that the benefits vest 
immediately, the expense is recognised immediately in the income 
statement. The Group recognises all actuarial gains and losses arising 
from defined benefit plans directly in equity immediately.
(l) employee Benefits
Share ba Sed paymenT T ranS ac TionS
The Group operates a number of employee share schemes. The fair 
value of employee share options granted is recognised as an employee 
expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is 
measured at grant date, using an appropriate valuation model, taking 
into account the terms and conditions upon which the share options 
were granted. These will include both performance and service 
conditions. The resulting cost is charged to the income statement  
over the vesting period of the options. At each balance sheet date the 
cumulative charge in respect of each option plan is adjusted to reflect 
expected and actual levels of options vesting.
The fair value of the amount payable to employees in respect 
of share appreciation rights, which are settled in cash, is recognised as 
an expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period 
in which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment. 
The liability is remeasured at each reporting date and at settlement 
date. Any changes in the fair value are recognised within the income 
statement as an employee expense.
For options granted before 7 November 2002 the recognition 
and measurement principles of IFRS 2 have not been applied in 
accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 1. Any cost in 
relation to these options is expensed to the income statement as 
incurred.
o verS ea S Termina Tion coSTS
The Group’s net obligation in respect of termination costs other than 
pension plans is the amount of future payment that sales agents are 
entitled to based on contracts and legal obligations, discounted to 
determine the present value. The discount rate is the yield at the 
reporting date on AA credit-rated bonds that have maturity dates 
approximating the terms of the Group’s obligations.
1. Group accountinG policies CONTINUED
(h) property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment assets are carried at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment in value. T o 
the extent that borrowing costs relate to the acquisition, construction 
or production of a qualifying asset, borrowing costs are capitalised as 
part of the cost of that asset. Depreciation is provided to write 
property, plant and equipment down to a residual value over their 
estimated useful economic lives on a straight-line basis at the following 
annual rates: 
Freehold land No depreciation is charged on 
freehold land
Freehold and leasehold buildings 2 per cent of cost or over the life  
of the lease if less than 50 years 
Motor vehicles 25 per cent of cost
Plant, equipment, fixtures and 
fittings
7 per cent to 25 per cent of cost 
Assets under the course of 
construction
No depreciation is charged on 
assets under the course of 
construction
The residual value and estimated useful economic life for significant 
property, plant and equipment is reassessed annually. 
(i) l eases
Leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks 
and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. All other 
leases are accounted for as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised and included 
within property, plant and equipment at the lower of fair value and the 
present value of minimum lease payments. Each asset is depreciated 
over the shorter of the lease term or the asset’s useful life.
The obligations related to finance leases, net of finance lease 
charges in respect of future periods, are included within financial 
liabilities. The interest element of the rental agreement is charged to 
the income statement over the term of the lease to reflect a constant 
rate of interest on the outstanding capital amount payable.
Costs in respect of operating leases are charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease 
incentives are spread over the term of the lease on a straight-line basis.
(j) f oreiG n currency transactions
T ransactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective 
functional currencies of Group entities using the rate of exchange 
ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of 
exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the foreign exchange 
arising is taken to the income statement. 
Financial ST aT emenTS o F Foreign opera TionS
Income statements of foreign operations are translated into sterling at 
the average rate applicable to the respective accounting period as an 
approximation of the rate at the date the transactions took place. 
Assets and liabilities, including goodwill, of foreign operations 
are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet 
date. Gains or losses on translations of foreign operations are included 
as a movement on the cumulative foreign exchange reserve. On a 
subsequent disposal such gains or losses will form part of the profit / 
loss on disposal within the income statement. Gains and losses prior  
to adoption of IFRS are deemed to be nil.
neT inveSTmenT in Foreign opera TionS
The portion of the gain or loss on an instrument used to hedge a net 
investment in a foreign operation, that is determined to be an effective  (m) r esearch and development
Research expenditure is charged to income in the year in which it is 
incurred. Development expenditure is capitalised only if development 
costs can be measured reliably, the product is technically and 
commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable,  
and the Group intends to, and has sufficient resources to, complete 
development and to sell the asset. Other development expenditure  
is recognised in profit or loss as incurred. No development costs  
are capitalised at 31 March 2010 or 31 March 2009.
(n) c ash equivalents
Cash equivalents are current asset investments, which are disposable 
without curtailing or disrupting the business, and are either readily 
convertible into known amounts of cash, at, or close to their carrying 
values or traded in an active market. Cash equivalents comprise 
short-term bank deposits which have a maturity of three months or 
less at the date of acquisition (other than cash).
(o) inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.  
In determining the cost of raw materials, consumables and goods for 
resale, the FIFO method is used, and includes expenditure incurred in 
acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location 
and condition. For work in progress and finished goods, cost is taken  
as production cost which includes an appropriate proportion of 
overheads based upon normal operating capacity.
Net realisable value is determined as estimated selling price 
less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in 
marketing, selling and distribution.
(p) Grant income
Revenue grants are recognised in the income statement as a reduction 
in the related expense.
Capital grants are shown in deferred income within the 
balance sheet and released to match the depreciation charge on the 
associated asset.
(q) income tax
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is 
recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates 
to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in 
equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income 
for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of 
previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability 
method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and 
the amounts used for taxation purposes. The amount of deferred tax 
provided is based upon the expected manner of realisation or 
settlement of the carrying values of the assets or liabilities, using tax 
rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary 
differences: the intitial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction 
that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting 
nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments and 
subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in 
the foreseeable future. In addition, deferred tax is not recognised for 
taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of 
goodwill.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the 
asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that 
it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to 
allow all or part of the asset to be realised.
(r) provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has  
a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, 
which can be measured reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect 
is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected 
future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to  
the liability.
(s) f inancial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments (derivatives) to hedge 
its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from 
operational, financing and investment activities. The Group does not 
hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair 
value. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivative financial instruments 
are stated at fair value. The fair value of derivative financial instruments 
is determined by reference to discounted cash flows or option 
valuation models. Where derivatives do not qualify for hedge 
accounting, any gains or losses on remeasurement are immediately 
recognised in the income statement. Where derivatives qualify for 
hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on 
the nature of the hedge relationship and the item being hedged. The 
effectiveness of hedges is tested at each period end to ensure that the 
hedge remains effective.
Interest-bearing borrowings are initially stated at fair value  
less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any 
difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the 
income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective 
interest basis.
Fair value hedging
Derivative financial instruments are classified as fair value hedges  
when they hedge the Group’s exposure to changes in the fair value  
of a recognised asset or liability. Any gain or loss from remeasuring  
the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the income 
statement within financing costs. Any change in the fair value of the 
hedged item, attributable to the hedged risk, is adjusted against the 
carrying value of the hedged item and recognised immediately in the 
income statement within financing costs.
caS h Flow hedging
Derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedges 
when they hedge the Group’s exposure to variability in cash flows that 
is attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or 
liability. Changes in the fair value of the derivative hedging instrument 
designated as a cash flow hedge are recognised directly in equity to the 
extent that the hedge is effective. T o the extent the hedge is ineffective, 
changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss.
diS con Tinuance oF hedge accoun Ting
If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge 
accounting, expires, or is sold, terminated or exercised, then hedge 
accounting is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or loss 
previously recognised in equity remains there until the forecast 
transaction occurs. When the hedged item is a non-financial asset, the 
amount recognised in equity is transferred to the carrying amount of 
the asset when it is recognised. In other cases the amount recognised 
in equity is transferred to profit or loss in the same period that the 
hedged item affects profit or loss. notes to the consolidated financial statements

expectations of the level of drawdown required for the next 12 months.
a ccoun Ting STandardS i SSued buT no T adop Ted
The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and International 
Financial Reporting Committee (IFRIC) have also issued the following 
standards and interpretations which have been endorsed by the EU at 
31 March 2010 with an effective date of implementation after the date 
of these financial statements.
inT erna Tional a ccoun Ting ST andardS b oard:
IFRS 3 (revised 2008) ‘Business Combinations’ is effective for 
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009. The standard 
specifies how an entity should account for busness combinations in 
the annual financial statements. The revised Standard will be adopted 
by the Group for all business combinations on or after 1 April 2010 and 
will be applied prospectively from that date. The main changes to the 
standard that are expected to impact upon the Group are the 
requirements:
 to expense all acquisition-related costs through profit and loss, and:
 to measure contingent consideration at fair value at the acquisition 
date, and to record subsequent adjustments to contingent 
consideration through profit and loss, rather than as an adjustment 
to goodwill. 
a mendmenTS T o:
 IAS 27 ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’. The 
revised standard prescribes that changes in ownership interests  
that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for within 
shareholders’ equity as transactions with owners acting in their 
capacity as owners. No gain or loss is recognised on such 
transactions, and goodwill is not remeasured. 
 IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement-Eligible 
Hedged Items’. This amendment addresses two particular situations 
(the designation of a one-sided risk in a hedged item, and also the 
designation of inflation as a hedged risk).
 IFRS 5 ‘Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued 
operations’. This amendment clarifies that the assets and liabilities  
of a subsidiariy should be classified as held for sale if the Parent is 
committed to a plan involving loss of control of the subsidiary, 
regardless of whether the entity will retain a non-controlling interest 
after the sale.
inT erna Tional Financial r epor Ting inT erpre TaT ionS 
c ommiTT ee: inT erpre TaT ionS 
 IFRIC 16 ‘Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation’. The 
revised interpretation includes an amendment to the restriction on 
the entity that can hold the hedging instrument.
 IFRIC 17 ‘Distributions of non-cash assets to owners’. This 
interpretation clarifies that a dividend payable should be recognised 
when the dividend is appropriately authorised and is no longer at the 
discretion of the entity. Also an entity should measure the dividend 
payable at the fair value of the net assets to be distributed. In 
addition, an entity should recognise the difference between the 
dividend paid and the carrying amount of the net assets distributed 
in profit or loss.
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards 
and interpretations will have a material effect on the Group’s financial 
statements in the period of initial application.
No significant impact is expected from other Standards and 
Interpretations that are endorsed but not yet effective. 2. o peratinG profit

unrecoG nised deferred tax assets and lia Bilities 
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of unused income tax losses of £215.1 million (2009: £221 million), and unused capital 
losses of £146.1 million (2009: £146.1 million). The decrease in income tax losses in the year of £5.8 million is explained by a foreign currency 
retranslation difference of £9.6 million on losses carried forward at 2009, net of an increase in losses carried forward of £3.8 million.
It is probable that future taxable profit will not be available against which the Group can utilise the benefits therefrom. Included in the losses are US 
income tax losses of USD 102 million (2009: USD 102 million) which are unlikely to be available for use due to the change of ownership restrictions.
£47 .1 million (2009: £50.0 million) of income tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely. The remaining losses held in overseas entities may 
expire over periods of up to 20 years.
Following the recent introduction of a UK dividend exemption, there should be no deferred tax liability in respect of unremitted earnings other 
than where a withholding tax liability may arise on payment of a dividend. The potential deferred tax liability in respect of this withholding tax is 
£6.9 million, but the Group is in a position to control the timing of the dividends, and therefore no liability has been recognised. In the previous 
period, prior to the introduction of the UK dividend exemption, the unrecognised deferred tax liability in respect of unremitted earnings of  
non-UK subsidiaries was £69.1 million.
5. earninG s per £0. 10 ordinary share
Earnings per share has been calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares in issue during the year.
The profit attributable to ordinary shareholders is as follows:

6. seG mental anal ysis
Segment information is presented in the consolidated financial statements in respect of the Group’s geographical segments. The geographical 
segment reporting format reflects the Group’s management and internal reporting structure. There have been no changes to the basis of 
segmentation or the measurement of segment results since the last annual financial statements.
Intra-segment pricing is determined on an arm’s length basis.
Segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. No individual 
customer accounted for more than 10 per cent of revenue in any year reported in the consolidated financial statements. The European and Asia 
Pacific and the Rest of the World segments generate revenue from the sale of Durex, Scholl footcare and Scholl footwear branded products, in 
addition to sales derived from locally-owned brands and the distribution of other consumer products. The Americas segment derives sales from 
the sale of Durex branded products. Details of the Group’s product range are included in the business review on pages 13 to 16.
Geo Graphical se Gments
The Group is comprised of the following geographical segments:
 Europe (includes acquired Russian and Ukrainian operations)
 Americas
 Asia Pacific and Rest of the World
Central costs relate entirely to the European segment, and are therefore included within the result for that segment.
The following tables present an analysis of the Group’s revenue and results by geographical segment:

Capital expenditure on plant, equipment and motor vehicles in the year of £5.5 million comprised £0.1 million of capitalised finance leases 
(2009: £0.1 million). 
Included within plant, equipment and motor vehicles are assets held under finance lease with a net book value of £0.1 million (2009: £0.1 million). 
As detailed in note 3, additions during the year ended 31 March 2010 include £0.3 million of capitalised borrowing costs (2009: £0.6 million). 
The carrying value of temporarily idle plant at the year end is £nil (2009: £nil). Group assets held under course of construction total £3.5 million (2009: £22.8 million) of which £3.5 million (2009: £22.8 million) is included in 
plant, equipment and motor vehicles. The assets under construction at 31 March 2010 relates to production equipment in the new China factory 
which has not yet been validated. The assets under construction at 31 March 2009 related to the factory under construction in China, and the 
expansion of the manufacturing facilities in Thailand.
As entities are transferred onto SAP, fully written down assets are removed from the system. This is the main driver of the high level of disposals 
during the current and prior year. The prior year disposals also includes the write down of assets in Guernsey and Rubi, Spain against the European 
supply chain restructuring provision.

Key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes in revenues and direct costs during 
the period. Risk adjusted pre-tax discount factors of 10.3-30.6 per cent (2009: 11.4-12 per cent) have been applied to the projections. The pre-tax 
discount rate has been based on management’s calculation of the pre-tax Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) using the capital asset 
pricing model to calculate the cost of equity. A range of alphas were used to reflect the risk of the different cash generating units. The Directors  
do not believe that a reasonably possible change of assumptions would cause the recoverable amounts to fall below book value for any of the 
following material assets.
m aterial assets 
Scholl b rand 
The Scholl brand, with a carrying value of £61.2 million at 31 March 2010 (2009: £61.4 million), is not amortised. The brand has been tested for 
impairment using the method described below. No charge for impairment was required in the year.
For the purposes of impairment testing of the Scholl brand, the Group is regarded as two cash generating units, that part relating to Scholl-
branded products and that relating to all other consumer products. The Scholl brand’s recoverable amount was determined by discounting 
future cash flows expected to be generated from continuing use of the brand using the following key assumptions:
 cash flows for year one were based upon budgeted operating results.
 revenue growth was anticipated at 2 per cent (2009: 2 per cent) per annum and operating results held at a constant percentage of revenue  
for a further period of eight years. This is considered an appropriate medium-term assumption based on prior performance.
 operating results were then held at the year nine figures into perpetuity reflecting the Directors’ assertion that the brand has an indefinite  
useful economic life based upon its proven value over long periods and its position in the market which is considered sustainable for the 
foreseeable future.
 a pre-tax risk adjusted discount factor of 10.1 per cent (2009: 11.4 per cent) was applied to the pre-tax cash flow projections.
For the Scholl brand to be impaired, with all other assumptions held constant, the pre-tax risk adjusted discount factor would need to increase  
to 38.2 per cent before the brand’s value in use calculation showed any impairment. Removing the revenue growth from the expected cash flows 
would decrease the valuation by £28.9 million, however the brand would still show no impairment. A decrease in the operating margin percentage 
by one percentage point would reduce the valuation by £28.2 million, however the brand would still show no impairment.

Goodwill denominated in Chinese Renminbi arose on the acquisition of the remaining 50 per cent of the ordinary share capital of Qingdao 
London Durex Company Limited in January 2007 . The carrying value of the goodwill at 31 March 2010 is £25.2 million (2009: £26.4 million).
For the purposes of impairment testing of the China goodwill, the Chinese commercial business and manufacturing entities of Qingdao London 
Durex Company Limited and SSL Healthcare Shanghai Limited were identified as a single cash generating unit. The recoverable amount was 
determined by discounting future cash flows expected to be generated from continuing use of the goodwill using the following key assumptions:
72/73  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
a nnual r eport and a ccounts 2010   cash flows for year one were based upon budgeted operating results.
 revenue growth was anticipated at 3 per cent (2009: 3 per cent) per annum, based on medium- to long-term forecasts, with operating results 
held at a constant percentage of revenue for a further period of nine years. This is in line with historical experience.
 operating results were then held at the year 10 figures into perpetuity reflecting the expected maintenance of the position in the market.
 a pre-tax risk adjusted discount factor of 11.5 per cent (2009: 12 per cent) was applied to the projections.
For the China goodwill to be impaired, with all other assumptions held constant, the pre-tax risk adjusted discount factor would need to increase 
to 71 per cent before the value in use calculation showed any impairment. Removing the revenue growth from the expected cash flows would 
decrease the valuation by £27 million, however the goodwill would still show no impairment. A decrease in the operating margin percentage by 
one percentage point would reduce the valuation by £3.3 million, however the goodwill would still show no impairment. 
vaS yli goodwill and in Tangible aSSe TS 
The Vasyli business was acquired in November 2007 , with goodwill of £12.8 million initially recognised on acquisition. During the current and prior 
financial year, the Directors have reviewed the contingent consideration payable in the forthcoming year, as detailed in note 17 , and consequently 
the goodwill relating to the Vasyli business was increased to £20.7 million at 31 March 2009 and £37 .3 million at 31 March 2010. The carrying value 
of the other intangible assets acquired as part of the Vasyli acquisition at 31 March 2010 is £2.7 million (2009: £3.1 million). The useful economic 
lives attributed to the other intangible assets at recognition were 20 years for the brands and related intellectual property, and three to five years 
for customer relationships; no changes have been made to the estimated remaining useful economic lives since acquisition.
An impairment review has been performed at 31 March 2010 in relation to the revised goodwill of £37 .3 million. The Vasyli business, encompassing 
sales of the Orthaheel, Orthastyle, Vasyli and VAS brands across the Group, was identified as a single cash-generating unit. The recoverable 
amount was determined by discounting future cash flows expected to be generated from continuing use of the goodwill using the following key 
assumptions:
 cash flows for year one were based upon budgeted operating results.
 cash flows for years two and three were based upon the business plan forecast operating results.
 revenue growth was anticipated at 3 per cent (2009: 3 per cent) per annum from year four to year 10, nil thereafter, and operating results held at 
a constant percentage of revenue.
 operating results were then held at the year 10 figures for a further 10 years reflecting the current expected useful life of the goodwill and related 
brands and the longer-term strategic benefit of the integration of the Vasyli business with that of Scholl footcare.
 a pre-tax risk adjusted discount factor of 11.7 per cent (2009: 11.8 per cent) was applied to the projections.
For the Vasyli goodwill to be impaired, with all other assumptions held constant, the pre-tax risk adjusted discount factor would need to increase 
to 19.7 per cent before the value in use calculation showed any impairment. Removing all revenue growth from the expected cash flows would 
decrease the valuation by £10.1 million, however the goodwill would still show no impairment. A decrease in the operating margin percentage by 
one percentage point would reduce the valuation by £1.8 million, however the goodwill would still show no impairment.

The Medcom Russia business was acquired in June 2009 (as detailed in note 9); the individually material assets recognised at acquisition were 
the Contex brand valued at £126.6 million and goodwill of £27 .6 million. These assets are denominated in Russian Roubles, and at 31 March closing 
exchange rates, were valued at £140.9 million and £30.8 million respectively.
The carrying value of the other intangible assets acquired as part of the Medcom Russia acquisition at 31 March 2010 is £9.6 million. The useful 
economic lives attributed to the other intangible assets at recognition were 10 years for the brands and related intellectual property, and six years 
for customer relationships; no changes have been made to the estimated remaining useful economic lives since acquisition.
An impairment review has been performed at 31 March 2010 in relation to the Contex Russia brand and Medcom Russia goodwill of £140.9 million 
and £30.6 million. The cash flows of the Medcom Russia business were separated into two cash-generating units; the first encompassing cash 
flows generated from the sale of Contex-branded condoms and lubricants within Russia and the CIS states, and the second including cash flows 
generated by the sale of all other consumer and medical goods across Russia and the CIS states. The recoverable amount was determined by 
discounting future cash flows expected to be generated from continuing use of the Contex brand and goodwill using the following key 
assumptions:
 cash flows for year one were based upon budgeted operating results.
 cash flows for years two and three were based upon the business plan forecast operating results.
 revenue growth was anticipated at 13 per cent from year two, to 7 per cent in perpetuity in line with inflation assumptions for the region.
 operating results were held at a constant percentage of revenue.
 results into perpetuity were then calculated based on the operating results for year ten, reflecting the expected indefinite useful economic life 
of the goodwill and Contex brand, and the longer-term strategic benefit of the integration of the Medcom business with that of the Group.

For the Medcom Russia goodwill to be impaired, with all other assumptions held constant, the pre-tax risk adjusted discount factor would need to 
increase to 118 per cent before the value-in-use calculation showed any impairment. Removing all revenue growth from the cash flow projections 
would decrease the valuation by £69.5 million, however the goodwill would still show no impairment. A decrease in the operating margin

2010 closing exchange rates, were valued at £11.2 million and £11.1 million respectively.
The carrying value of the other intangible assets acquired as part of the Medcom Ukraine acquisition at 31 March 2010 is £1.4 million (2009: £nil). 
The useful economic lives attributed to the other intangible assets at recognition were 10 years for the brands and related intellectual property,

For the Medcom Ukraine goodwill to be impaired, with all other assumptions held constant, the pre-tax risk adjusted discount factor would need 
to increase to 32.6 per cent before the value in use calculation showed any impairment. Reducing all revenue growth by one per cent would 
decrease the valuation by £0.5 million, however the goodwill would still show no impairment. A decrease in the operating margin percentage by

For the Contex Ukraine brand to be impaired, with all other assumptions held constant, the pre-tax risk adjusted discount factor would need to

9. a cquisition of su Bsidiaries
BeleGGinG smaatschappij l emore B v (BlBv) 
On 1 June 2009, the Group fulfilled its intention to increase its investment in the issued share capital of Beleggingsmaatschappij Lemore BV 
(‘BLBV’) from 15.5 per cent to 50 per cent plus one share, thereby securing control of the company. The cash consideration was £60.2 million.
On 12 February 2010, the Group exercised an option, conditional upon the approval of SSL’s shareholders, to increase its stake in BLBV to 75.3 per 
cent, and has a further option, exercisable in 2011, to take the Group shareholding in BLBV to 100 per cent. BLBV is the Parent Company of a group 
of companies involved in the sale and distribution of consumer and medical products across Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent 
States (‘CIS’). Approval for the increase in the stake was received post year-end (see note 26).

related to costs incurred in the year ended 31 March 2009 in relation to the acquisition of the 15.5 per cent interest.
Negligible intangible assets were included in the underlying records of BLBV, or its main trading subsidiary, Medcom MP. On acquisition, the Group 
identified the following intangible assets:
 Contex brand and related trademarks: this is the market-leading brand of condoms and lubricants in Russia, and was one of the primary 
reasons for the acquisition of BLBV. The Contex brand is considered to have an indefinite economic life, and has been valued using the ‘excess 
earnings’ method at RUB 6,287 million (£126.6 million). Rouble-denominated cash flows have been based upon local management forecasts for 
the first five years, with future sales growth rates incorporating Russian inflation expectations, ranging from 23 per cent in the first year 
post-acquisition to 7 per cent in perpetuity. The discount rate of 18.7 per cent has been adjusted for risk factors specific to Russia and Medcom. 
Capital asset charges have been applied using risk-adjusted weighted average costs of capital in respect of fixed assets, working capital and the 
local workforce.
 Other brands: additional brands, relating to condoms, pregnancy testing kits, plasters and medical gloves have been valued at RUB 342 million 
(£6.9 million) using the ‘relief from royalty’ method. Royalty rates of between 2.5 per cent and 7 per cent have been used in the valuations, 
dependent upon the relative strength of the brands, and a discount rate of 20.2 per cent has been applied to the expected royalty savings.  
The brands have been assessed as having remaining useful economic lives of 10 years, with future growth rates incorporating Russian inflation, 
ranging from 13 per cent in the first year post-acquisition to 7 per cent after year five.
 Customer relationships — customer relationships totalling RUB 133 million (£2.7 million) have been recognised with regards to existing 
customer lists and contracts. The customers were separated into two groups sharing similar characteristics, namely ‘consumer’ and ‘medical’, 
with cash flows forecast over a period of six years, representing the expected useful life of the relationships. The rouble-denominated cash 
flows were based upon local management forecasts; sales growth assumptions incorporate Russian inflation expectations, ranging from 13 per 
cent in the first year post-acquisition to 7 per cent in year six. A discount rate of 21.7 per cent was applied.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of BLBV is attributed to the anticipated profitability of the distribution of the Group’s existing products,  
for example, the Durex and Scholl footcare portfolios in the Russia and CIS markets and distribution channels, and the anticipated future 
manufacturing synergies arising from the combination. notes to the consolidated financial statements

Fair value adjustments were made to the working capital balances acquired reflecting management’s assessment of the recoverability of 
inventory and trade receivables and unrecorded trade payables. A deferred tax liability was also recognised in respect of the temporary timing 
differences created by the fair value adjustments. Given the short time frame between the intial and subsequent investments, and the fact that 
there was no significant change to the business during this period, the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired between the two 
dates are consistent.
BLBV contributed £115.9 million revenue and £28.6 million to the Group’s profit before tax for the period between the date of acquisition and  
31 March 2010.
It is not practicable to disclose what the contribution to Group revenue and profits would have been had the acquisition of BLBV been completed 
on the first day of the current period, as consoldiated financial information was not prepared on an IFRS basis prior to 1 June 2009.
GainB ridG e investments (c yprus) l imited (‘GainB ridG e’)
On 1 October 2009, the Group completed the acquisition of 100 per cent of the shares of Gainbridge from CCD Estate, for cash consideration of 
€20.6 million (£18.7 million), at which point control of the group was deemed to pass to SSL International plc. Gainbridge is a holding company 
invested primarily in companies engaged in the packaging and distribution of condoms and medical products in the Ukraine, and owns the market 
leading condom brand in Ukraine.
The initial accounting for the transaction has been determined using the purchase method of accounting, and a provisional assessment has been 
made of the fair value to the Group of the assets and liabilities acquired. Fair values will be reviewed based upon additional information available 
up to one year from the acquisition date.

using the ‘relief from royalty’ method. Royalty rates of 7 per cent have been used in the valuations, and a discount rate of 25.5 per cent has been 
applied to the expected royalty savings. The brands have been assessed as having remaining useful economic lives of 10 years, with future 
growth rates incorporating Ukrainian inflation, ranging from 13 per cent in the first year post-acquisition to 7 per cent after year five.
 Customer relationships—customer relationships totalling UAH 2.6 million (£0.2 million) have been recognised with regards to existing customer 
lists and contracts. The customers were separated into two groups sharing similar characteristics, namely ‘consumer’ and ‘medical’, with cash 
flows forecast over a period of 2.5 years, representing the expected useful life of the relationships. The hryvnia-denominated cash flows were 
based upon local management forecasts; sales growth assumptions incorporate Ukraine inflation expectations, ranging from 23 per cent in the 
first year post-acquisition to 13 per cent in year two. A discount rate of 27 per cent was applied.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of Gainbridge is attributed to the anticipated profitability of the distribution of the Group’s existing 
products, for example, the Durex and Scholl footcare portfolios in Ukraine, and the anticipated future manufacturing synergies arising from  
the combination.
Fair value adjustments were made to the working capital balances acquired reflecting management’s assessment of the recoverability of 
inventory and trade receivables and unrecorded trade payables. A deferred tax liability was also recognised in respect of the temporary timing 
differences created by the fair value adjustments. 
Gainbridge contributed £7 .3 million revenue and £0.5 million to the Group’s profit before tax for the period between the date of acquisition and 
31 March 2010.
It is not practicable to disclose what the contribution to Group revenue and profits would have been had the acquisition of Gainbridge been 
completed on the first day of the current period, as consoldiated financial information was not prepared on an IFRS basis prior to 1 October 2009.

The Group holds a strategic non-controlling interest of 11 per cent in Stirus Global Solutions Limited, which is classified as a financial asset 
available for sale. Stirus Global Solutions Limited is an unquoted entity, therefore fair value of the shareholding cannot be readily ascertained; the 
investment is therefore held at initial cost and subject to annual impairment review. An impairment charge of £1.0 million was recorded in the year 
ended 31 March 2010 in relation to this investment.      
On 19 May 2008 the Group completed the first stage of its investment in Beleggingsmaatschappij Lemore BV, ‘BLBV’, acquiring a 15.5 per cent 
stake for £24.6 million, plus acquisition costs of £6.1 million, with the ability to purchase the remainder exercisable over the next two years. The 
investment was classed as a financial asset available for sale and was held at fair value at 31 March 2009. At that date, the Directors concluded 
that it was not appropriate to account for the investment in BLBV as an associate because the Group held less than 20 per cent of the voting 
power, and the options to purchase the remainder of BLBV were not exercisable at the balance sheet date; it was concluded that the Group did 
not exercise significant influence over the financial and operating policy decisions of BLBV.
On 1 June 2009, the Group completed the second stage of its investment and gained control of BLBV as detailed in note 9; from this date, the 
results of BLBV have been included in the Group results, therefore the investment has been replaced wiht the results of the business in the 
financial statements. notes to the consolidated financial statements

financial risk management policies in place to ensure that all payables are paid within the agreed payment terms. Current payables include 
amounts due to be settled in Sterling, Euros, US Dollars, Thai Baht, Malaysian Ringgit, Chinese Renminbi, Russian Roubles, and other currencies.

The disclosures below detail the cash flow hedge relationships between the Group’s variable rate loans and interest rate swaps.
The principal features of the Group’s borrowings are as follows:
Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand. Overdrafts and facilities of £9.0 million (2009: £13.5 millon) are unsecured. The average effective 
interest rate on bank overdraft approximates 2.25 per cent (2009: 1.25 per cent) per annum.
The Group has the following bank facilities:
 A syndicated Group facility of £410.0 million available until June 2013, of which £108.9 million (2009: £137 .4 million) had been drawn down at 
31 March 2010. Drawdowns can be made for periods of one, two, three or six months, or any other mutually-agreed term; interest rates are set  
at the corresponding LIBOR plus 215 basis points at the time of the drawdown.
 The individual drawdowns under the Group facility at 31 March 2010 all had repayment dates in April 2010; the drawdowns under the Group 
facility at 31 March 2009 all had repayment dates in April 2009. At 31 March 2010 and 31 March 2009, the Group had the ability to roll-over these 
drawdowns, and expected that they all would be rolled over for at least 12 months, therefore the borrowings under the facility were classed as 
non-current.
 At 31 March 2009, SSL Healthcare Italia SpA had fixed rate unsecured loans of £10.2 million; as there was no committed facility, the loans were 
disclosed within current liabilities.
 Various overdraft facilities exist across the Group, including a UK facility of £7 .5 million (2009: £7 .5 million) (net).
undrawn BorrowinG facilities 
At 31 March 2010, the Group had available £301.1 million (2009: £82.6 million) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all 
conditions precedent had been met.

the	 Group	 facility	 designated	 as	 part	 of	 the	 cash	 flow	 hedge	 relationship	 are	 for	 periods	 of	 one	 month,	 repayable	 in	 April	 2010,	 and	 therefore	 are	 held	 at	
notional	 value	 which	 is	 deemed	 equivalent	 to	 fair	 value.	 The	 interest	 rate	 swaps	 are	 held	 at	 fair	 value.	 Changes	 in	 fair	 value	 totalling	 £0.8	 million	 (2009:	
£3.2	 million)	 have	 been	 charged	 directly	 to	 equity	 in	 relation	 to	 fair	 value	 movements	 in	 the	 interest	 rate	 swaps	 during	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 March	 2010.	
Changes	 in	 fair	 value	 of	 £2.7	 million	 (2009:	 £0.1	 million)	 previously	 charged/credited	 directly	 to	 equity	 have	 been	 recycled	 through	 profit	 and	 loss	 in	 the	
current	 year.	 The	 cash	 flow	 hedge	 was	 100 per cent	 effective	 in	 the	 current	 and	 prior	 year. Bank loans held as a net investment hed Ge 
The Japanese Yen drawdown on the Group Facility of £6.5 million (2009: £6.5 million) is designated as a net investment hedge of the Group’s 
investment in subsidiaries denominated in Japanese Yen. As explained in note 20, the net investment hedge was 100 per cent effective in the 
current and prior year.
oBliG ations under finance leases 
Finance lease liabilities are secured on the assets to which they relate. The average lease term outstanding is one year. For the year ended  
31 March 2010, the average effective borrowing rate was 8.6 per cent (2009: 6.7 per cent). Interest rates are fixed at the contract date.  
The lease obligations are denominated in Thai Baht, and the fair value of the Group’s lease obligations approximates their carrying value.

o verseas termination costs 
Included	 within	 overseas	 termination	 costs	 is	 an	 amount	 of	 £4.1	 million	 (2009:	 £3.8	 million)	 for	 the	 estimated	 amounts	 payable	 to	 employees	 and	
agents	 in	a	 number	 of	 overseas	 subsidiaries.	 These	 payments	 are	 based	 on	 service	 and	 are	 payable	 to	 employees	 and	 agents	 upon	 termination	 of	
services	 for	 the	 Group,	 regardless	 of	 the	 reason	 for	 such	 termination.	 The	 terms	 of	 the	 payments	 vary	 by	 territory	 and	 include,	 for	 example,	
average	 salary	 over	 the	 service	 life	 of	 the	 employee	 or	 the	 final	 salary	 of	 the	 employee,	 or	 payment	 required	 under	 collective	 agreements	 to	 sales	
agents	 upon	 termination	 of	 their	 contracts	 by	 the	 Group.	 The	 main	 assumptions	 underlying	 the	 calculation	 (on	a	 weighted	 average	 basis	 across	
the	 various	 schemes)	 are	 salary	 increases	 of	1	 per	 cent,	 an	 inflation	 rate	 of	2	 per	 cent	 and	a	 discount	 rate	 of	 5.3	 per	 cent.	 The	 calculation	 of	 the	
provision	 is	 determined	 by	 contractual	 obligation	 and	 therefore	 can	 be	 estimated	 reliably.	 No	 terminations	 are	 expected	 in	 the	 forthcoming	 year.
euro Pean su PPly c hain restructuring 
During	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 March	 2008,	 as	 part	 of	 the	 European	 supply	 chain	 restructuring	 programme,	 provisions	 of	 £41.3	 million	 were	 made	 in	
relation	 to	 the	 closure	 of	 the	 manufacturing	 facilities	 at	 Rubi	 (Spain)	 and	 Guernsey,	 the	 closure	 of	 the	 T echnical	 Services	 Centre	 in	 Cambridge,	
and	 the	 restructuring	 of	 the	 Footwear	 Development	 Group.	 Operations	 in	 Spain	 and	 Cambridge	 had	 ceased	 by	 31	 March	 2008;	 operations	 in	
Guernsey	 ceased,	 and	 substantially	 all	 of	 the	 remaining	 European	 supply	 chain	 restructuring	 activities	 were	 completed,	 during	 the	 previous	
financial	 year.
During	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 March	 2010,	 the	 surplus	 property	 at	 Guernsey	 has	 been	 disposed	 of.	 The	 remaining	 elements	 of	 the	 restructuring	
programme	 to	 be	 completed	 are	 the	 final	 integration	 and	 validation	 of	 plant	 transferred	 from	 Guernsey	 to	 Peterlee,	 and	 the	 disposal	 of	 the	
surplus	 property	 in	 Rubi.	 The	 key	 remaining	 uncertainties	 at	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date	 were	 in	 relation	 to	 the	 disposal	 of	 this	 property,	 for	 example	
whether	 the	 property	 will	 be	 sold	 or	 sub-let,	 the	 potential	 proceeds	 receivable	 under	 either	 alternative,	 and	 the	 time	 period	 in	 which	 the	 disposal	
will	 be	 completed.	 It	 is	 anticipated	 that	 all	 of	 the	 remaining	 European	 supply	 chain	 restructuring	 provision	 will	 be	 utilised	 within	 the	 forthcoming	
year,	 subject	 to	 property	 transactions	 being	 completed.
o ther
Other	 provisions	 relate	 to	a	 number	 of	 pre-merger	 environmental	 provisions	 of	 £1.6	 million	 and	 surplus	 property	 provisions	 of	 £3.6	 million.
Environmental	 provisions	 are	 provided	 for	 to	 the	 extent	 that	a	 present	 obligation	 exists,	 it	 is	 probable	 such	 costs	 will	 be	 incurred	 and	 they	 can	 be	
estimated	 reliably.	 No	 provision	 is	 made	 for	 possible	 additional	 costs	 that	 are	 not	 currently	 probable.
The	 surplus	 property	 provision	 relates	 to	 Group	 commitments	 under	 non-cancellable	 leases	 which,	 following	 historical	 restructuring	 exercises,	
are	 no	 longer	 used	 by	 the	 Group.	 The	 obligation,	 net	 of	 expected	 rental	 income,	 has	 been	 provided	 for.
Surplus	 property	 and	 environmental	 costs	 of	 £4.1	 million	 have	 been	 included	 as	 non-current.	 It	 is	 expected	 that	 all	 other	 provisions	 will	 be	 utilised	
during	 the	 next	 financial	 year.

Contingent	 consideration	 of	 £25.5	 million	 (2009:	 £9.4	 million)	 relates	 to	 the	 acquisition	 of	 the	 Vasyli	 business	 during	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 March	 2008.	
The	 consideration	 is	 contingent	 upon	 the	 level	 of	 Orthaheel-branded	 sales	 achieved	 across	 the	 Group	 in	 the	 15	 months-ended	 30	 June	 2010,	 and	
is	 capped	 at	 £25.5	 million.	
The	 estimated	 liability	 recognised	 within	 provisions	 during	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 March	 2010	 reflects	 the	 amount	 which	 is	 considered	 probable		
to	 be	 paid	 based	 on	 actual	 sales	 for	 2009/10	 and	 detailed	 budgets	 for	 the	 three	 months	 to	 30	 June	 2010.	 This	 estimate	 has	 been	 increased	 by

(a) d efined contribution schemes
Since	 1995,	 the	 Group	 has	 operated	a	 contracted-in	 defined	 contribution	 scheme	 which	 is	 open	 to	 UK	 employees.	 It	 also	 operates	 defined	
contribution	 executive	 pension	 plans	 for	 senior	 executives.	 Employer	 contributions	 are	 charged	 to	 the	 income	 statement	 in	 the	 period	 in	 which	
they	 are	 incurred.
The	 total	 pension	 cost	 for	 the	 Group	 in	 respect	 of	 UK	 defined	 contribution	 schemes	 was	 £1.5	 million		 (2009:	 £1.5	 million).
(b) d efined benefit schemes
The	 Group	 continues	 to	 operate	a	 number	 of	 defined	 benefit	 schemes	 following	 the	 mergers	 of	 Seton	 Healthcare	 Group	 plc	 and	 Scholl	 PLC	 to	
form	 Seton	 Scholl	 in	 1998,	 and	 the	 subsequent	 merger	 of	 Seton	 Scholl	 and	 LIG	 in	 1999.	 All	 UK	 schemes	 have	 been	 closed	 to	 new	 entrants	 and	 no	
further	 benefits	 are	 accruing.		 Benefits	 for	 members	 who	 are	 still	 employed	 by	 the	 Group	 remain	 linked	 to	 their	 final	 earnings.		 The	 finances	 of	 all	
schemes	 are	 assessed	 regularly	 by	 independent	 actuaries	 and	 all	 assets	 of	 the	 schemes	 are	 held	 in	 separate	 trustee-administered	 funds.	 The	
schemes	 provide	 benefits	 for	 employees	 as	 outlined	 below:
(i) s eton Prior	 to	 1995,	 the	 Group	 operated	a	 defined	 benefit	 scheme	 for	 employees.	 Accrual	 of	 further	 service-related	 benefits	 under	 this	 scheme	 ceased	
in	 August	 1995,	 but	 existing	 benefits	 at	 that	 date	 are	 being	 maintained.	 The	 latest	 valuation	 of	 the	 scheme	 was	 at	5	 April	 2009.	 The	 Group	 expects	
to	 make	 contributions	 of	 £1.2	 million	 into	 the	 scheme	 during	 the	 next	 financial	 year,	 subject	 to	 the	 results	 of	 the	5	 April	 2009	 actuarial	 valuation	 for	
funding	 purposes.	
(ii) s choll
Accrual	 of	 further	 service	 related	 benefits	 under	 this	 defined	 benefit	 scheme	 ceased	 in	 August	 2000,	 but	 benefits	 accrued	 to	 31	 August	 2000	
continue	 to	 be	 provided	 from	 the	 scheme.	 The	 most	 recent	 valuation	 by	 independent	 actuaries	 was	 at	5	 April	 2009.	 The	 Group	 expects	 to	 make	
contributions	 of	 £1.0	 million	 into	 the	 scheme	 during	 the	 next	 financial	 year,	 subject	 to	 the	 results	 of	 the	5	 April	 2009	 actuarial	 valuation	 for	 funding	
purposes.

o verseas Pensions and similar obligations
The	 Group	 has	a	 number	 of	 pension	 schemes	 in	 different	 countries,	 both	 defined	 benefit	 and	 defined	 contribution.	 Defined	 benefit	 schemes	 are	
set	 up	 under	 separate	 trust	 funds	 and	 liabilities	 are	 generally	 assessed	 annually	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 advice	 of	 independent	 actuaries.	 The	 total	
pension	 cost	 for	 the	 Group	 in	 respect	 of	 overseas	 defined	 contribution	 schemes	 was	 £5.9	 million	 (2009:	 £2.4	 million).
Details	 of	 the	 material	 overseas	 defined	 benefit	 schemes	 are	 included	 below.	 The	 most	 recent	 actuarial	 valuations	 for	 each	 scheme	 were	
updated	 for	 IAS	 19	 purposes	 to	 31	 March	 2010	 by	 independent	 qualified	 actuaries.

For	 the	 UK	 schemes,	 the	 mortality	 assumption	 was	 updated	 at	 31	 March	 2009	 to	 include	a	 minimum	 underpin	 for	 future	 improvements	 in	
mortality	 of	 1.0	 per	 cent	 per	 annum	 for	 males	 and	 0.5	 per	 cent	 per	 annum	 for	 females.	 The	 assumed	 life	 expectancy	 for	a	 65	 year	 old	 male	 retiring	
in	 the	 current	 period	 is	 21	 years	 (2009:	 20.7	 years)	 and	 for	a	 male	 retiring	 in	 20	 years	 at	 age	 65,	 life	 expectancy	 is	 22.9	 years	 (2009:	 22.6	 years).	 The	
assumed	 life	 expectancy	 for	a	 65	 year	 old	 female	 retiring	 in	 the	 current	 period	 is	 22.4	 years	 (2009:	 23.2	 years)	 and	 for	a	 female	 retiring	 in	 20	 years	
at	 age	 65,	 life	 expectancy	 is	 23.6	 years	 (2009:	 24.4	 years).	
The	 expected	 rate	 of	 return	 on	 pension	 scheme	 assets	 is	 determined	 as	 management’s	 best	 estimate	 of	 the	 long-term	 returns	 of	 the	 major	 asset	
classes	 in	 which	 the	 schemes	 invest	—	 equities,	 corporate	 bonds,	 and	 government	 bonds	 for	 the	 UK	 schemes,	 and	 insurance	 contracts	 for	 the	
overseas	 schemes	—	 weighted	 by	 the	 actual	 allocation	 of	 assets	 among	 the	 categories	 at	 the	 measurement	 date.	 Based	 on	 the	 assumptions	
made	 and	 the	 distribution	 of	 assets,	 the	 weighted	 average	 expected	 return	 on	 assets	 as	 at	 31	 March	 2010	 is	 6.6	 per	 cent	 (31	 March	 2009:	 6.4	 per	
cent).	 These	 rates	 are	 net	 of	 an	 allowance	 for	 investment	 management	 expenses.	 An	 allowance	 for	 administrative	 expenses	 is	 included	 in	 the	
present	 value	 of	 scheme	 liabilities. The	 assets	 in	 the	 schemes	 as	 at	 31	 March	 2010	 and	 the	 previous	 four-year-ends	 were:

packages	 to	 motivate	 employees.	 They	 should	 also	 align	 the	 interests	 of	 employees	 with	 those	 of	 shareholders,	 as	a	 whole,	 through	 long-term	
share	 ownership	 of	 the	 Company.	
g rou P annual bonus scheme
This	 scheme	 is	a	 performance	 bonus	 scheme	 for	 Directors	 and	 senior	 employees	 within	 the	 UK	 and	 overseas.	 Annual	 bonuses	 are	 paid	 in	 cash	
and	 reflect	 both	 corporate	 and	 individual	 performance	 measures.	 Maximum	 bonuses	 are	 paid	 upon	 achievement	 of	 102.5	 per	 cent	 of	 the	 target	
for	 Directors	 and	 senior	 employees.	 This	 reduces	 on	a	 straight-line	 basis	 to	 46	 per	 cent	 of	 the	 maximum	 for	 the	 achievement	 of	 the	 target	 for	
Directors	 and	 senior	 employees.	 The	 bonus	 further	 reduces	 in	a	 straight	 line	 to	 10	 per	 cent	 of	 the	 maximum	 for	 reaching	 97.5	 per	 cent	 of	 the	
target.	 No	 bonus	 is	 payable	 for	 achieving	 less	 than	 97.5	 per	 cent	 of	 the	 target.
l ocal bonus schemes
Individual	 countries	 run	 local	 bonus	 schemes	 for	 senior	 employees	 who	 fall	 outside	 the	 Group	 annual	 bonus	 scheme.	 Performance	 targets	 are	
set	 locally	 and	 payment	 of	 bonuses	 is	 at	 the	 discretion	 of	 local	 management.
executive share o Ption Plans
The	 Group	 has	a	 number	 of	 executive	 share	 option	 schemes:
ssl 1990 share option scheme
This	 was	a	 senior	 executive	 scheme	 approved	 in	 June	 1990	 for	a	 period	 of	 10	 years.	 As	 the	 scheme	 has	 now	 expired,	 no	 further	 grants	 may	 be	
made.	 There	 are	 no	 outstanding	 options	 under	 the	 scheme.	 Exercise	 of	 any	 grants	 made	 since	 June	 1999	 is	 subject	 to	 performance	 targets		
being	 met.	
ssl 1996 share option scheme
This	 is	a	 senior	 executive	 scheme	 approved	 in	 July	 1996	 for	a	 period	 of	 10	 years.	 No	 further	 grants	 may	 be	 made	 after	 July	 2006.	 Prior	 to	 March	
2005,	 annual	 grants	 were	 made	 under	 this	 scheme	 following	 announcement	 of	 final	 results.	 Since	 the	 development	 of	 the	 new	 Performance	
Share	 Plan,	 as	 detailed	 overleaf ,	 no	 grants	 have	 been	 made	 during	 the	 current	 or	 prior	 year.	 Exercise	 of	 all	 grants	 is	 subject	 to	 performance	 targets

made	 of	 deferred	 shares,	 funded	 by	 the	 sacrifice	 of	 up	 to	 50	 per	 cent	 of	 the	 executive’s	 annual	 bonus.	 These	 deferred	 shares	 are	 matched	 by

on	 maturity	 of	 the	 related	 savings	 contract.	 No	 payment	 was	 required	 for	 the	 grant	 of	 an	 option.	 Options	 are	 not	 transferable.	 Employees	 may	
choose	 to	 withdraw	 from	 the	 scheme	 at	 which	 point	 they	 will	 receive	 their	 cash	 savings	 plus	 interest.

s hare caP ital
The	 Company	 has	 one	 class	 of	 ordinary	 share,	 which	 carries	 no	 right	 to	 fixed	 income.
19,190,000	 new	 ordinary	 shares	 of	 10	 pence	 were	 placed	 with	 institutions	 at	a	 price	 of	 £4.55	 per	 share	 on	 28	 January	 2009,	 generating	 gross	
proceeds	 of	 £87 .3	 million	 (£84.3	 million	 net	 of	 financing	 costs,	 some	 of	 which	 had	 been	 accrued	 but	 not	 paid	 at	 31	 March	 2009).	 The	 share	 placing	
was	 enacted	 via	 the	 use	 of	a	 new	 subsidiary	 Company,	 SSL	 Capital	 Limited,	 registered	 in	 Jersey;	 the	 institutions	 subscribed	 for	 less	 than	 10	 per	
cent	 of	 the	 ordinary	 shares	 and	 100	 per	 cent	 of	 preference	 shares	 in	 the	 subsidiary,	 which	 were	 subsequently	 exchanged	 for	 an	 allotment	 of	 the	
newly	 issued	 shares	 in	 SSL	 International	 plc.	
Shares	 issued	 under	 employee	 share	 options	 generated	 proceeds	 of	 £2.3	 million	 (2009:	 £1.1	 million).
The	 holders	 of	 ordinary	 shares	 are	 entitled	 to	 receive	 dividends	 as	 declared	 from	 time	 to	 time	 and	 are	 entitled	 to	 one	 vote	 per	 share	 at	 meetings	
of	 the	 Company.	 Details	 of	 the	 share	 option	 schemes	 in	 place	 are	 included	 in	 note	 19.
s hare Premium and merger reserve
The	 share	 premium	 account	 and	 the	 merger	 reserve	 are	 non-distributable.	 The	 increase	 in	 the	 merger	 reserve	 of	 £82.4	 million	 during	 the	 year	
ended	 31	 March	 2009	 arose	 from	 accounting	 for	 the	 share-for-share	 exchange	 in	 which	 SSL	 International	 plc	 issued	 new	 ordinary	 shares	 in	
exchange	 for	 the	 remaining	 ordinary	 and	 preference	 shares	 in	 SSL	 Capital	 Limited.
c umulative foreign exchange reserve
The	 cumulative	 foreign	 exchange	 reserve	 comprises	 all	 foreign	 exchange	 differences	 arising	 from	 the	 translation	 of	 foreign	 operations	 as	 well		
as	 from	 the	 translation	 of	 liabilities	 that	 hedge	 the	 Group’s	 net	 investment	 in	 foreign	 subsidiaries.	 During	 the	 year,	 foreign	 exchange	 losses	 of		
£nil	 (2009:	 losses	 of	 £1.8	 million)	 on	 foreign	 currency	 borrowings	 were	 offset	 by	 gains	 of	 £nil	 (2009:	 gains	 of	 £1.8	 million)	 arising	 from	 retranslation	
of	 foreign	 assets,	 designated	 as	 the	 hedging	 instrument.	 The	 net	 investment	 hedge	 was	 100	 per	 cent	 effective	 in	 the	 current	 and	 prior	 year.
c ash flow hedge reserve
The	 cash	 flow	 hedge	 reserve	 comprises	 the	 effective	 portion	 of	 interest	 rate	 swaps	 designated	 as	 cash	 flow	 hedges	 of	 variable	 rate	 borrowings	
transferred	 to	 the	 reserve	 during	 the	 current	 and	 previous	 financial	 year.
	
caP ital management 
The	 Group	 manages	 its	 capital	 to	 ensure	 that	 entities	 in	 the	 Group	 will	 be	 able	 to	 continue	 as	 going	 concerns	 whilst	 maximising	 the	 return	 to	
stakeholders	 through	 the	 optimisation	 of	 the	 debt	 and	 equity	 balance.	 The	 capital	 structure	 of	 the	 Group	 consists	 of	 debt,	 which	 includes	 the	
borrowings	 disclosed	 in	 note	 16,	 cash	 and	 cash	 equivalents,	 and	 equity	 attributable	 to	 equity	 holders	 of	 the	 Parent,	 comprising	 issued	 capital,	
reserves	 and	 retained	 earnings	 as	 disclosed	 above.	 The	 Group	 manages	 its	 capital	 structure	 through	 maintaining	 close	 relationships	 with	 its	
bankers	 who	 provide	 the	 majority	 of	 funds	 used	 for	 operational	 requirements.	 The	 key	 indicator	 of	 capital	 management	 performance	 used	 by	
internal	 management	 is	 the	 level	 of	 net	 debt,	 which	 is	 defined	 as	 financial	 liabilities	 less	 cash	 and	 cash	 equivalents.	 Net	 debt	 is	 monitored	 on	a	
monthly	 basis	 to	 ensure	 that	 actual	 results	 are	 in	 line	 with	 net	 debt	 forecasts.
The	 Group’s	 main	 banking	 facility	 is	a	 syndicated	 Group	 facility	 of	 £410.0	 million.	 This	 facility	 was	 arranged	 in	 December	 2009	 and	 is	 committed	
until	 June	 2013.	 The	 banking	 syndicate	 comprises	 ten	 members	 and	 is	 administered	 by	 Barclays	 Bank	 plc.	 Further	 information	 in	 relation	 to	 the	
Group’s	 financial	 liabilities	 is	 given	 in	 notes	 16	 and	 22.	A	 reconciliation	 of	 movements	 in	 net	 debt	 is	 provided	 in	 note	 22.	 Net	 debt	 at	 31	 March	 2010	
is	 £41.1	 million	 compared	 with	 £17 .7	 million	 at	 31	 March	 2009.
The	 Group	 is	 required	 to	 maintain	 covenant	 ratios	 in	 respect	 of	 net	 debt	 to	 earnings	 before	 interest,	 depreciation	 and	 amortisation	 (EBITDA)	 and	
net	 interest	 costs	 to	 earnings	 before	 interest,	 depreciation	 and	 amortisation	 (EBITDA).	A	 further	 covenant	 requires	 subsidiaries	 accounting	 for		
70	 per	 cent	 of	 the	 unconsolidated	 assets	 of	 the	 Group	 to	 be	 guarantors.	 The	 Group	 has	 met	 its	 covenant	 ratios	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 March	 2010.	
The	 Group	 has	 prepared	 forecasts	 of	 the	 cash	 flows	 for	 the	 next	 18	 months	 which	 indicate	 that	 the	 Group,	 after	 considering	 all	 known	
commitments	 and	 appropriate	 sensitivities,	 will	 meet	 its	 covenant	 requirements	 for	 this	 period. There	 were	 no	 changes	 in	 the	 Group’s	 approach	 to	 capital	 management	 during	 the	 year.	 Neither	 the	 Company	 nor	 any	 of	 its	 subsidiaries	 are	
subject	 to	 externally	 imposed	 capital	 requirements.
The	 Group	 has	 the	 authority	 to	 purchase	 its	 own	 shares	 on	 the	 market	 for	 the	 purpose	 of	 issuing	 shares	 under	 the	 Group’s	 share	 option	 and	
performance	 share	 plans.	 No	 such	 purchases	 were	 made	 during	 the	 current	 or	 previous	 financial	 year.	 Decisions	 to	 purchase	 shares	 are	 made	 on	
a	 specific	 transaction	 basis	 by	 the	 Board;	 there	 is	 no	 defined	 share	 buy-back	 plan.	 In	 order	 to	 maintain	 or	 adjust	 the	 capital	 structure,	 the	 Group	
may	 adjust	 the	 amount	 of	 dividends	 paid	 to	 shareholders,	 issue	 new	 shares	 or	 sell	 assets	 to	 reduce	 debt.

23. f inancial risK management
The	 Group	 has	 exposure	 to	 the	 following	 risks	 from	 its	 use	 of	 financial	 instruments:	 credit;	 liquidity;	 interest	 rate;	 and	 currency.	 Further	
information	 on	 the	 Group’s	 exposure	 to	 these	 risks	 is	 presented	 below,	 with	 an	 explanation	 of	 the	 Group’s	 policies	 and	 processes	 for	 measuring	
and	 managing	 these	 risks.
The	 Board	 of	 Directors	 has	 overall	 responsibility	 for	 the	 establishment	 and	 review	 of	 the	 Group’s	 risk	 management	 policies	 and	 procedures;	 these	
guidelines	 are	 designed	 to	 identify	 and	 analyse	 the	 risks	 faced	 by	 the	 Group,	 including	 setting	 and	 monitoring	 compliance	 with	 appropriate	 limits	
and	 controls.	 The	 policies	 are	 reviewed	 regularly	 and	 amended	 where	 appropriate	 to	 reflect	 changes	 in	 the	 Group’s	 operations,	 risk	 exposure	 and	
market	 conditions.	 The	 Board	 is	 assisted	 by	 the	 Group’s	 Business	 Assurance	 function,	 which	 undertakes	 regular	 and	 ad	 hoc	 reviews	 of	 risk	
management	 controls	 and	 procedures,	 the	 results	 of	 which	 are	 reported	 to	 the	 Audit	 Committee.
The	 Group’s	 T reasury	 function	 provides	 services	 to	 the	 business,	 co-ordinates	 access	 to	 domestic	 and	 international	 financial	 markets	 and	
monitors	 and	 manages	 the	 financial	 risks	 relating	 to	 the	 operations	 of	 the	 Group.
c redit risK 
Credit	 risk	 is	 the	 risk	 of	 financial	 loss	 to	 the	 Group	 if	a	 customer	 or	 counterparty	 to	a	 financial	 instrument	 fails	 to	 meet	 its	 contractual	 obligations,	
and	 arises	 principally	 from	 the	 Group’s	 trade	 receivables	 and	 investment	 securities.
t rade and other receivables
The	 Group’s	 exposure	 to	 credit	 risk	 is	 influenced	 by	 the	 individual	 characteristics	 of	 each	 customer;	 the	 default	 risk	 of	 the	 industry	 and	 country	 in	
which	 customers	 operate	 has	 less	 of	 an	 influence	 on	 credit	 risk.	 Geographically,	 approximately	 80	 per	 cent	 of	 the	 Group’s	 debtors	 are	 in	 Europe.
Group	 exposure	 to	 credit	 risk	 is	 controlled	 by	 setting	a	 policy,	 which	 is	 reviewed	 annually,	 for	 limiting	 credit	 exposure	 to	 counterparties,	 reviewing	
credit	 ratings,	 and	 limiting	 individual	 aggregate	 credit	 exposures	 accordingly.	 The	 Group	 considers	 the	 possibility	 of	 material	 loss	 in	 the	 event	 of	
non-performance	 by	a	 financial	 counterparty	 to	 be	 unlikely.	 Customer	 credit	 risk	 is	 monitored	 at	a	 subsidiary	 level	 by	 divisional	 management,	 and	
is	 reviewed	 at	 Group	 level	 by	 country.
Goods	 are	 sold	 subject	 to	 retention	 of	 title	 clauses,	 so	 that	 in	 the	 event	 of	 non-payment	 the	 Group	 may	 have	a	 secured	 claim.	 The	 Group	 does	 not	
require	 collateral	 in	 respect	 of	 trade	 and	 other	 receivables.
The	 Group	 establishes	 an	 allowance	 for	 impairment	 that	 represents	 its	 estimate	 of	 incurred	 losses	 in	 respect	 of	 trade	 and	 other	 receivables	 and	
investments.	 The	 main	 components	 of	 this	 allowance	 are	a	 specific	 loss	 component	 that	 relates	 to	 individually	 significant	 exposures,	 and	a	
collective	 loss	 component	 established	 for	 groups	 of	 similar	 assets	 in	 respect	 of	 losses	 that	 have	 been	 incurred	 but	 not	 yet	 identified.	 The	
collective	 loss	 allowance	 is	 determined	 based	 on	 historical	 data	 of	 payments	 statistics	 for	 similar	 financial	 assets.
i nvestment securities 
Surplus	 funds	 are	 invested	 in	 high	 quality	 liquid	 marketable	 investments.	 Investments	 are	 of	a	 plain	 vanilla	 nature	 with	 no	 embedded	 derivatives.	
The	 Group	 deposits	 central	 funds,	 when	 available,	 with	 highly	 rated	 banks,	 in	 line	 with	 Group	 policy.	 The	 central	 funds	 on	 deposit	 at	 the	 balance	
sheet	 date	 were	 £20.4	 million	 (2009:	 £104.5	 million).	
Guarantees 
The	 Group’s	 policy	 is	 to	 provide	 financial	 guarantees	 only	 to	 wholly-owned	 subsidiaries.	 At	 31	 March	 2010,	 no	 guarantees	 were	 outstanding		
(2009:	 none).
l iquidity risK 
Liquidity	 risk	 is	 the	 risk	 that	 the	 Group	 will	 not	 be	 able	 to	 meet	 its	 financial	 obligations	 as	 they	 fall	 due.	 The	 Group’s	 approach	 to	 managing	 liquidity	
is	 to	 ensure,	 as	 far	 as	 possible,	 that	 it	 will	 always	 have	 sufficient	 liquidity,	 under	 both	 normal	 and	 stressed	 conditions,	 without	 incurring	
unacceptable	 losses	 or	 risking	 damage	 to	 the	 Group’s	 reputation.
The	 Group	 manages	 liquidity	 risks	 by	 ensuring	 that	 any	 anticipated	 funding	 requirements,	 based	 on	 detailed	 cash	 flow	 forecasts	 at	 subsidiary	 	
and	 Group	 level,	 will	 be	 met	 by	 access	 to	 different	 sources	 of	 funding.	 Typically,		 the	 Group	 ensures	 that	 it	 has	 sufficient	 cash	 on	 demand	 to	 meet	
expected	 operational	 expenses	 for	a	 period	 of	 30-60	 days,	 including	 the	 servicing	 of	 financial	 obligations.	 In	 addition,	 the	 Group	 maintains	 the	
credit	 facilities	 detailed	 in	 note	 16.
Committed	 undrawn	 facilities	 available	 to	 the	 Group	 in	 respect	 of	 which	 all	 conditions	 precedent	 had	 been	 met	 at	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date	 were		
as	 follows:

Market	 risk	 is	 the	 risk	 that	 changes	 in	 market	 prices,	 such	 as	 foreign	 exchange	 rates,	 interest	 rates,	 and	 equity	 prices,	 would	 affect	 the	 Group’s	
income,	 the	 value	 of	 its	 holdings	 of	 financial	 instruments,	 or	 its	 obligations	 in	 respect	 of	 retirement	 benefits.
f oreiG n currency risk 
The	 Group	 is	 exposed	 to	 currency	 risk	 on	 sales,	 purchases	 and	 borrowings	 that	 are	 denominated	 in	a	 currency	 other	 than	 the	 functional	 currency	
of	 the	 Group’s	 entities.	 Where	 practicable,	 the	 Group	 uses	 forward	 foreign	 exchange	 contracts	 to	 hedge	 major	 transactional	 exposures	 on	
working	 capital	 balances.	 At	 the	 start	 of	 each	 financial	 year,	 the	 Group	 hedges	 approximately	 50	 to	 70	 per	 cent	 of	 its	 estimated	 foreign	 currency	
exposure	 in	 respect	 of	 forecast	 sales	 and	 purchases	 over	 the	 forthcoming	 financial	 year.
Interest	 on	 borrowings	 is	 primarily	 denominated	 in	 Sterling,	 such	 that	 no	 related	 foreign	 currency	 derivatives	 are	 required.	
In	 respect	 of	 other	 monetary	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 denominated	 in	 foreign	 currencies,	 the	 Group	 ensures	 that	 its	 net	 exposure	 is	 kept	 to	 an	
acceptable	 level	 by	 buying	 or	 selling	 foreign	 currencies	 at	 spot	 rates	 when	 necessary	 to	 address	 short-term	 imbalances.
The	 Group’s	 investment	 in	 its	 Japanese	 subsidiary	 is	 hedged	 by	a	 Japanese	 Yen-denominated	 secured	 bank	 loan	 which	 mitiages	 the	 currency	 risk	
arising	 from	 the	 subsidiary’s	 net	 assets.
i nterest rate  risk
The	 Group’s	 variable	 rate	 borrowings	 are	 exposed	 to	a	 risk	 of	 change	 in	 cash	 flows	 due	 to	 changes	 in	 interest	 rates	 over	 the	 longer	 term;	 the	 Group	
has	 reduced	 its	 exposure	 to	 this	 by	 entering	 into	 interest	 rate	 swaps	 over	 £60.0	 million	 of	 the	 drawndown	 facility.	 The	 remaining	 drawndown	
facility	 of	 £48.9	 million	 was	 at	 LIBOR	 plus	 215	 basis	 points	 at	 31	 March	 2010	 with	 all	 contracts	 ending	 in	 April	 2010.	 Interest	 rates	 will	 be	 reset	 for	
each	 tranche	 on	 the	 amounts	 redrawn	 in	 April	 2010.
o ther market price risk
The	 Group	 does	 not	 speculate	 in	 equity	 securities,	 nor	 does	 the	 Group	 enter	 into	 commodity	 contracts	 other	 than	 to	 meet	 the	 Group’s	 expected	
usage	 requirements.	 The	 Group	 held	a	 strategic	 investment	 of	 £1.0	 million	 in	 the	 equity	 securities	 of	 an	 unlisted	 company	 at	 31	 March	 2009,	 as	
detailed	 in	 note	 10;	 this	 is	 not	 deemed	 to	 expose	 the	 Group	 to	 market	 price	 risk,	 although	 the	 investment	 is	 subject	 to	 annual	 impairment	 reviews	
and	a	 £1.0	 million	 impairment	 provision	 has	 been	 recorded	 during	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 March	 2010.

There	 are	 no	 customers	 representing	 more	 than	 2.0	 per	 cent	 (2009:	 3.3	 per	 cent)	 of	 the	 total	 balance	 of	 trade	 receivables.	 In	 determining	 the	
recoverability	 of	a	 trade	 receivable,	 the	 Group	 considers	 any	 change	 in	 the	 credit	 quality	 of	 the	 trade	 receivable	 from	 the	 date	 credit	 was	 initially	
granted	 up	 to	 the	 reporting	 date.	 The	 concentration	 of	 credit	 risk	 is	 limited	 due	 to	 the	 customer	 base	 being	 large	 and	 unrelated.	 Accordingly,	 the	
Directors	 believe	 that	 there	 is	 no	 further	 credit	 provision	 required	 in	 excess	 of	 the	 allowance	 for	 impairment.	 Movement	 on	 the	 allowance	 for	
impairment	 in	 respect	 of	 trade	 receivables	 is	 disclosed	 in	 note	 12.	 The	 allowance	 for	 impairment	 has	 been	 determined	 based	 on	 historical	 trends,	
and	 relevant	 market	 and	 customer	 information.	 The	 Group	 believes	 that	 no	 impairment	 allowance	 is	 necessary	 in	 respect	 of	 trade	 receivables	
not	 past	 due.	 All	 receivables	 classified	 as	 non-current	 are	 within	 the	 respective	 payment/contractual	 terms.

(2009:	 repayment	 dates	 were	 in	 April	 2009);	 however,	 at	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date,	 it	 was	 expected	 that	 all	 of	 these	 drawdowns	 would	 be	 rolled	 over	
for	 at	 least	 12	 months,	 and	 therefore	 classification	 as	 non-current	 liabilities	 at	 31	 March	 2010	 and	 31	 March	 2009	 was	 concluded	 to	 be	 appropriate.

basis for determining fair values
The	 following	 summarises	 the	 significant	 methods	 and	 assumptions	 used	 in	 estimating	 the	 fair	 values	 of	 financial	 instruments	 reflected	 in	 the	
table	 above.
available for sale financial assets
The	 available	 for	 sale	 financial	 assets	 at	 31	 March	 2009	 related	 to	 unquoted	 entities,	 therefore	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 shareholding	 could	 not	 be	 readily	
ascertained.	 Both	 investments	 were	 therefore	 held	 at	 initial	 cost,	 which	 is	 deemed	 to	 be	 comparable	 to	 fair	 value,	 although	 the	 investments	 are	
subject	 to	 annual	 impairment	 review.
derivatives
The	 fair	 value	 of	 forward	 exchange	 contracts	 is	 based	 on	 their	 listed	 market	 price,	 if	 available.	 If	a	 listed	 market	 price	 is	 not	 available,	 then	 fair	 value	
is	 estimated	 by	 discounting	 the	 difference	 between	 the	 contractual	 forward	 price	 and	 the	 current	 forward	 price	 for	 ther	 residual	 maturity	 of	 the	
contract	 using	a	 risk-free	 interest	 rate	 (based	 on	 government	 bonds).
The	 fair	 value	 of	 interest	 rate	 swaps	 is	 based	 on	 broker	 quotes.	 Those	 quotes	 are	 tested	 for	 reasonableness	 by	 discounting	 estimated	 future	 cash	
flows	 based	 on	 the	 terms	 and	 maturity	 of	 each	 contract	 and	 using	 market	 interest	 rates	 for	a	 similar	 instrument	 at	 the	 reporting	 date.
n on-derivative financial liabilities
Fair	 value	 is	 calculated	 based	 on	 the	 present	 value	 of	 future	 principal	 and	 interest	 cash	 flows,	 discounted	 at	 the	 market	 rate	 of	 interest	 at	 the	
reporting	 date.	 In	 respect	 of	 finance	 leases,	 the	 market	 rate	 of	 interest	 is	 determined	 by	 reference	 to	 similar	 lease	 agreements.	 The	 carrying	
values	 of	 all	 borrowings	 are	 equal	 to	 the	 fair	 values	 due	 to	 the	 relatively	 short	 contractual	 maturity	 dates.
t rade and other receivables
The	 fair	 value	 of	 trade	 and	 other	 receivables	 is	 estimated	 as	 the	 present	 value	 of	 future	 cash	 flows,	 discounted	 at	 the	 market	 rate	 of	 interest		
at	 the	 reporting	 date. f air value hierarchy

The	 Company	 operates	a	 number	 of	 employee	 share	 schemes.	 The	
cost	 to	 the	 Company	 of	 making	 awards	 in	 the	 form	 of	 shares	 or	 rights	 to	
shares	 under	 these	 schemes	 is	 charged	 to	 the	 profit	 and	 loss	 account	
as	 an	 employee	 expense	 over	 the	 period	 to	 which	 the	 employee’s	
performance	 relates.	 The	 Company	 issues	 equity	 settled	 share	 based	
payments	 to	 certain	 employees	 of	 the	 Company	 and	 its	 subsidiary	
undertakings.	 Equity	 settled	 share	 based	 payments	 are	 measured	 at	
fair	 value	 at	 the	 grant	 date	 using	 an	 appropriate	 valuation	 model,	 taking	
into	 account	 the	 terms	 and	 conditions	 precedent	 at	 the	 time	 of	 grant.	
The	 impact	 of	 any	 non-market	 vesting	 conditions	 is	 excluded.
The	 total	 amount	 to	 be	 expensed	 over	 the	 vesting	 period	 is	
determined	 by	 reference	 to	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 equity	 instruments	
granted	 and	 the	 number	 of	 equity	 instruments	 which	 eventually	 vest.	
At	 each	 balance	 sheet	 date,	 the	 Company	 revises	 its	 estimate	 of	 the	
number	 of	 instruments	 that	 are	 expected	 to	 vest.	 It	 recognises	 the	
impact	 of	 the	 revision	 of	 original	 estimates,	 if	 any,	 in	 the	 profit	 and	 loss	
account,	 and	a	 corresponding	 adjustment	 to	 equity	 over	 the	 remaining	
period.	 When	 awards	 are	 made	 to	 employees	 of	 subsidiary	
undertakings	 and	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 award	 is	 not	 recharged	 to	 the	
subsidiary,	 the	 award	 is	 treated	 as	a	 capital	 contribution	 to	 the	
subsidiary,	 with	a	 corresponding	 increase	 in	 the	 cost	 of	 investment.
(h) dIvI dend Inco Me
Dividend	 income	 from	 subsidiary	 undertakings	 is	 recognised	 within	
other	 income	 at	 the	 point	 the	 dividend	 has	 been	 declared.	 Dividends	
declared	 after	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date	 are	 not	 recognised	 in	 the	 profit

The	 Company	 has	 taken	 advantage	 of	 the	 exemption	 available	 in	 FRS	 8:	
‘Related	 Party	 Disclosures’	 and	 has	 not	 disclosed	 transactions	 or	
balances	 with	 wholly-owned	 subsidiaries.
(i) t ransaction exposure he Dging
Forward	 currency	 contracts	 hedging	 transaction	 exposures	 are	 fair	
valued	 through	 the	 profit	 and	 loss	 account.
(ii) Fair value he Dges
Derivative	 financial	 instruments	 are	 classified	 as	 fair	 value	 hedges	 when	
they	 hedge	 the	 Company’s	 exposure	 to	 changes	 in	 the	 fair	 value	 of	a	
recognised	 asset	 or	 liability.	 Any	 gain	 or	 loss	 from	 remeasuring	 the	
hedging	 instrument	 is	 recognised	 immediately	 in	 the	 profit	 and	 loss	
account.	 Any	 change	 in	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 hedged	 item,	 attributable		
to	 the	 hedged	 risk,	 is	 adjusted	 against	 the	 carrying	 value	 of	 the	 hedged	
item	 and	 recognised	 immediately	 in	 the	 profit	 and	 loss	 account.
(iii) c ash Flow heD ges
Changes	 in	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 derivative	 hedging	 instruments	
designated	 as	a	 cash	 flow	 hedge	 are	 recognised	 directly	 in	 equity	 to		
the	 extent	 that	 the	 hedge	 is	 effective.	 To	 the	 extent	 that	 the	 hedge	 is	
ineffective,	 changes	 in	 fair	 value	 are	 recognised	 in	 profit	 or	 loss.
Derivative	 financial	 instruments	 qualifying	 for	 fair	 value	 hedge	
accounting	 are	 principally	 foreign	 currency	 and	 interest	 rate	 swaps.
Discontinuance oF he Dge accounting
Hedge	 accounting	 is	 discontinued	 prospectively	 when	 the	 hedging	
instrument	 expires	 or	 is	 sold,	 terminated	 or	 exercised,	 or	 no	 longer	
qualifies	 for	 hedge	 accounting. (I) Int AngIBle Assets

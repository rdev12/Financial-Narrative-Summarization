Review of Operations
Overall the Group performed extremely well in 2009.
The Group acted for 1,389 clients in 2009 compared
to 1,381 in 2008. 230 of these clients used more than
one of our businesses (256 in 2008) which represented
70% of total operating income (2008 – 66%).
150 clients paid us over £100,000 in 2009, compared
to 170 in 2008. Our top 30 clients represented 57% of
total operating income (2008 – 48%).
Our two largest clients represented 22.3% of our
operating income (2008 – 18.4%). Both clients have
been retained since 2003, are high margin and have
normal renewal terms. They are both covered by more
than one contract covering the various different
services provided to the client so that the ending of
one contract would be unlikely to lead to all contracts
for the same client coming to an end.
Average fee income per client in 2009 was £89,000
compared to £81,000 in 2008. Average income per
employee was £118,000 in 2009 compared to
£111,000 in 2008. In 2009, 46% of our income came
from overseas work compared to 37% in 2008.
Divisional Performance
2009 was a good year for the Public Relations Division,
the Advertising and Marketing Services and the Sports
Marketing Divisions, but a disappointing one for our
Research Division.
Public Relations continues to be our largest division
being 54% of operating income (2008 – 55%),
Advertising and Marketing Services was 27% 
(2008 – 27%), Sports Marketing was 14% 
(2008 – 12%) and Research 5% (2008 – 6%). The full
year impact of the Essentially acquisition should mean
that Sports Marketing should be about 20% of Group
operating income in 2010.

Overall the division showed good revenue growth with
strong cost control which resulted in an improved
margin. Some businesses were affected by the
downturn but this was more than offset by other
businesses performing beyond our expectations,
notably our geopolitical business, Corporate
Citizenship and Good Relations.

Operating Profit Margin       12.0%       11.6%
Operating income continued to grow whilst costs have
grown at a slower rate leading to an improvement in
operating profit margin. We believe this trend can continue.
There was a strong performance from VCCP both in
the UK and Germany, as well as our digital and search
businesses. Teamspirit, our financial services
marketing business, performed ahead of our
expectations and well ahead of 2008.
Sports Marketing – Fast Track 
and Essentially

Operating Profit Margin       20.6%      20.5%
The 2009 results include two months of the
acquisition of Essentially and a full year of Fast Track.
2008 relates only to Fast Track. The integration of Fast
Track and Essentially is going well and both
businesses have continued to grow. The Fast Track
business in the Middle East has done particularly well.
These are high margin businesses in a marketplace
that we believe will continue to grow despite the
economic uncertainty.

The Research Division remains very disappointing. 
The marketplace has been affected by the economic
downturn but our businesses have also underperformed.
Within the division Facts International has performed
very well and we are using that business and its
management as a basis for restructuring the whole division.
The acquisition of Tree will provide additional
opportunities for growth and we expect the division as
a whole to show a profit in the first six months of the
year and continue to grow thereafter.
“We outperformed the market and our competitors in
2008 and we have done so again in 2009. These are
our best results ever and we are very pleased and
delighted. We have made three acquisitions, controlled
costs and strengthened our existing business. 2010 has
started well and we are cautiously optimistic for the
outcome of the full year.”

Chairman’s Statement
(continued)
Corporate activity
We have completed the acquisition of Tree (London)
Limited (Tree) following the announcement that we
had entered into the Heads of Terms on 15th January
2010. Tree is a research and data analytics company
which we have acquired from Cagney plc for 
£2 million in cash. The transaction has been funded
from the proceeds of a cash placing made on 
15th January 2010.
During 2009 we acquired the sports marketing
business, Essentially, and we merged Pelham Public
Relations, a financial public relations business, with
our existing Bell Pottinger Corporate and Financial
business.
These three businesses will enhance the range of
services we can offer to our clients and will give us
additional opportunities for growth in 2010 and
beyond.
Corporate and Social Responsibility
The Group continues to be carbon neutral and
reduced its carbon footprint by 42% in 2007 and
2008. We are expecting to have reduced it by a
further 5% during 2009. We continue to consider and
enhance the environmental impact of our businesses
and are working closely with our major suppliers to
ensure best practice is embedded in our wider
operations. We continue to be included in the
FTSE4Good and have been re-accredited with a 
Big Tick by Business in the Community for our work
on climate change.

Sharp and Dohme.
� The winning presidential election campaign in Gabon. Outlook
Part of our 2009 strategy was to strengthen our
existing business ready for any upturn in the 2010
market. We believe this strategy will be beneficial for
2010. Highlights are:
� We have considerably improved our financial public
relations offering through the merger with Pelham.
In the first quarter this business has increased its
income and its new business conversion has been
very good.
� Our public affairs business has had a record start to
the year following the appointment of Tim Collins as
Managing Director to work alongside Peter Bingle,
the Chairman.
� The whole Public Relations Group has been
strengthened by the promotion of Paul Bell to Chief
Executive alongside Kevin Murray, the Chairman.
Paul previously ran our most successful public
relations business, Bell Pottinger Sans Frontieres.
� We acquired Essentially which is now being
integrated with Fast Track. This year’s results show
the Sports Marketing Division separate from the
Advertising and Marketing Service Division in order
to highlight its growth potential for 2010.
� The management of our Research Division has
been changed. We have appointed Crispin Beale as
Chief Executive. Crispin, together with his Chairman
Nick Lamb, more than doubled the profits of Facts
International in 2009. We are confident the Division
will return to profitability and will once again become
an important part of our total business.
� We have completed the acquisition of Tree which
will become part of the Research Division and will
supply our clients with a service not previously
available within the Group.
� Following winning Marketing Magazine’s agency 
of the year and Campaign magazine’s ‘campaign’
of the year, VCCP is receiving a record number of
new business opportunities. VCCP has won TCP ,
Jungle Formula and Gatwick Express already this
year and has opened an office in the Czech
Republic to service both the Czech Republic and
Slovakia for O2.
� We will continue our policy of controlling our costs,
increasing the proportion of our costs that are
variable and we are targeting an improvement in 
our margin.
� We will continue our policy of considering earnings
enhancing acquisitions that expand our range of
services and starting up new businesses to service
our existing client list.
� We are well funded and continue to be very cash
generative.
All in all we are cautiously optimistic for the outcome
of 2010.

Annual Report and Accounts 2009 5 6 Chime Communications plc
Jeff Immelt of GE first coined the phrase, 
“Re-set World” to describe a business
environment turned on its head by the credit
crunch and subsequent downturn. Immelt was
not talking primarily about Communications.
But he could have been. At Chime we believe
that Communications is one of the areas of
business activity that has been “Re-set” more
rapidly and completely than any other.
Overview 
What does the Communications Re-set look like? 
The simple answer is that it looks increasingly digital.
Of course, the internet was around long before the
credit crunch but the last two years have accelerated
its role in Communications and its impact on brands
and reputation. Today the web is the distribution
channel through which brands and products are
consumed as well as communicated, a social channel
through which reputation is created and enacted, 
a channel for immediate measurement and dialogue, 
a means of distribution and transaction and a channel
that demands rapid responses from all communicators
be they individuals, brands, companies or countries.
The multi-functionality has changed the way that
Communications approaches the internet; it has 
also triggered important changes in the way other
channels are used.
Take the introduction of multimedia newsrooms across
both TV news channels and national newspapers,
which deliver stories in different forms, through
different media channels at different times of the day.
The approach that works for TV won’t necessarily
work online; the strengths of a radio discussion are
very different to those of mobile channels. All are more
likely to be consumed at different times. Recognising
the differences between the channels and the value
that each can bring to a story is now central to all
communication plans. In a fragmenting media universe,
the ability to communicate a message irrespective of
format and channel has become the goal.
Integration 
Advertisers and advertising agencies have long
spoken of the need for creative ideas that can
transcend one media channel or another. They haven’t
always acted like they mean it. All too often, a ‘Big Idea’ 
has come to mean a big TV ad with other formats
tagged on. In the Re-set World this is simply no longer
an option: building a campaign around one dominant
channel simply misses too many consumer contact
points. In a recent piece for the advertising trade
magazine, Campaign, VCCP’s Stu Parkinson argues
convincingly that even those at the cutting edge of
digital advertising must remember the importance of
ideas, experiences and connections that work across
channels. We would cite O2’s communications as a
perfect example of that approach.
Chime’s purpose is the business of building brands
and reputations and this happens through
conversations. Today, the dialogue is more prominent
than ever; and because of the internet, it is also vastly
more measurable. Increasingly the objective of
Communications is to build social participation with
and around a brand rather than simply delivering a
fully formed brand message to consumers. Aleksandr,
the computer-generated Meerkat used by VCCP to
promote compare-the-market through Twitter,
Facebook and (yes) TV, provides a great example.
Re-set reputations 
In the Re-set World, brands and corporate reputation
cannot be separated. Consumers can no longer be
expected to focus on the former while conveniently
ignoring the latter. Toyota was able to track the impact
of its product recall through the increasing number of
Google searches for rivals General Motors and Ford.
The brand of Manchester United has been subverted
by fans angered by their perceptions around
management of the club. The Re-set world of
re-set
Chief Executive’s Statement communications is about customer participation as
much as customer satisfaction.
Sustainability, which cynics once predicted would
disappear from the agenda at the first sniff of a recession,
has instead seen its scope and significance hugely
expanded. Sustainable businesses are no longer seen
as ‘green’; they are well-run businesses, and it is well-
run businesses and brands that consumers choose to
align themselves with in the Re-set World. Transparent,
credible sustainability is today as important to brand
success as the size of a media budget. Unilever has
recognised as much with the introduction of its brand
footprint strategy, drawing clear connections for
consumers between governance and the products
they choose.
Re-set opportunities 
The Communications Re-set has brought disruption
elsewhere. And with that disruption comes opportunity.
The importance of brand experience in engaging
across fragmented media channels is helping to drive
the growth of our Sports Marketing division, as the
tangible connections delivered by sponsorship are
given global reach through the power of the internet.
Emirates’ hugely successful strategy of supporting the
passion drivers (usually sports) for different communities
around the world, HSBC’s exceptional activation
strategy for the Lions rugby tour of South Africa: both
show the rapidly accelerating importance of brand
experiences that stand above different formats.
The government work conducted by Chime agencies
such as Bell Pottinger Sans Frontières is also taking
place against the background of a Re-set World.
Today it is the developed world that must deal with
perceptions of debt and instability, whilst developing
economies appear poised to take advantage. Our
involvement with countries such as Bahrain is very
exciting in this regard.
Research, meanwhile, is re-inventing itself to suit 
the demands for dialogue, accountability and
actionable insight. Today it must provide clients 
with immediate benefits in increasing the efficiency 
of campaigns whilst providing foresight around 
future trends and opportunities.
These are just some of the ways in which interpreting
the Re-set World is helping to keep Chime ahead of its
competitors as we strive to deliver our brand promise of
‘the Modern Communications Group’. The growth that
the Group has delivered over the last year has been
achieved not despite the Re-set World but because 
of it. The core strengths of our approach will enable
Chime companies to continue to take a leading role in
re-interpreting Communications and helping clients to
meet their challenges in the years ahead.

Directors and the Board

Directors which, on 31 December 2009 comprised

of their duties, if necessary. The Company also 
makes appropriate training available to all existing
Directors. All Directors, in accordance with the Code,
will submit themselves for re-election at least once
every three years. 
When absence from meetings is unavoidable the
views of the Director concerned are sought in
advance then put to the meeting in order to facilitate 
a comprehensive discussion. Each Director continues
to make themselves available to their fellow directors
and ensures he/she contributes to the major decisions
before the Board. 
Executive Directors are entitled to accept external
appointments outside the Company and retain the fees
from such appointments provided that the Chairman’s
permission is sought and confirmed by the Board.
Chairman, Chief Executive and Senior
Independent Director
The Chairman, Lord Bell, is responsible for the running
of the Board and he ensures that all Directors receive
sufficient, accurate and timely information on financial,
business and corporate issues prior to meetings. He
also ensures that the Non-Executive Directors have
access to any further supplementary information they
may require should they request it. 
The Chief Executive’s (Christopher Satterthwaite)

business and implementing Group strategy. He is also

Director’s Statement on Corporate Governance 16 Chime Communications plc
Non-Executive Directors 
The individual Non-Executive Directors have different
skills, experience and qualifications from working
presently or previously in varied sectors of the
economy and as such they are able to bring
independent judgement to bear on matters for
consideration by the Board. 
Rodger Hughes was appointed as a Director by the
Board in July 2007 and elected by shareholders in
May 2008. He is the Senior Non-Executive Director
and Chairman of the Audit, Remuneration and
Nomination Committees.
The Hon. Richard Alston was appointed as a Director
by the Board in July 2008 and was elected by the
shareholders at the AGM in May 2009. 
Catherine Biner Bradley was appointed as a Director
in 2001 and last re-elected by shareholders in 
May 2009.
Paul Richardson is the WPP plc representative on the
Board under the subscription agreement of 1997 and
has been a Director of the Company since that date.
He was last re-elected by shareholders at the AGM in
May 2009. Under the Code and due to his length of
service, he is required to retire and submit for re-
election by shareholders annually. 
The Board considers its current Non-Executive
Directors to be of sufficient calibre and number that
their views may be of sufficient weight that no
individual or small group can dominate the Board’s
decision-making process. Their qualifications and
experience is relevant to their directorships and in 
their appointments to the Committees where relevant
(see page 10).
The Non-Executive Directors’ terms and conditions of
appointment are available for inspection at the
Company’s registered office on request and will be
available, together with the Executive Directors’
service contracts, at the forthcoming AGM.
Independence of Non-Executive Directors 
The Code states that it is for the Board to determine
whether a Director is independent in character and
judgement and consider whether there are any
relationships or circumstances that are likely to affect
a Director’s judgement. 
In applying the Code, the Board has considered
whether the length of service of Paul Richardson 
(13 years) has compromised his independence. He is
experienced and accomplished in his fields of
expertise. In his association with the Company he has
acquired an understanding of the Company’s
operations, its markets and the issues determining its
success. He has shown commitment to the Company 
in both time and effort. The Board does not consider
his long service as a Director to be detrimental or to
have eroded his objectivity and it should not raise any
concerns about his ability to perform his duties. 
Paul Richardson is the WPP plc representative on the
Board as stated above. 
Performance evaluation has shown that he continues
to have a good record of involvement in Board-level
discussions and contributes additional help to further
the Company’s strategies. The Board considers Paul
Richardson to be independent. 
The question of Non-Executive Directors’
shareholdings should also be considered when
assessing independence. Rodger Hughes and
Catherine Biner Bradley each hold a small number of
shares in the Company as disclosed on page 31. The
Board considers that these holdings are not significant
and believes this should not raise questions regarding
their independence. The Board considers that
Directors owning shares in the Company directly
aligns them with the interests of the shareholders.
Following performance evaluations for 2009 the Board
has considered the independence of its Non-Executive
Directors and continues to consider them to be
independent in both judgement and character and
that the circumstances shown above are unlikely to
affect their respective judgements when considering
matters of the Company. 
Retirement and Proposed Re-Election 
of Directors
In line with the provisions of the Code directors are
required to submit to the shareholders for re-election
every three years. Additionally the Company believes
that governance is served by that rule being
supplemented by one third of the total number of
Directors standing for re-election at each AGM. As a
result, the following Directors are due to retire
immediately before, and are proposed for re-election
at, the forthcoming AGM.
Mark Smith (retiring by rotation). Mark is the Group
Finance Director and was first appointed to the Board
in 1994 and last re-elected by shareholders in 2007. 
Catherine Biner Bradley (retiring due to length of
service). Catherine is a Non-Executive Director and a
member of each of the three standing Committees.
She was first appointed to the Board in 2001 and last
re-elected by shareholders in 2009. Catherine is
proposed for re-election due to her length of service
being 9 years (in September 2010). Under the Code
Catherine will now retire and be proposed for re-
election annually. Annual Report and Accounts 2009 17
Paul Richardson (retiring due to length of service). Paul
is the WPP plc representative on the Board and in
addition to being appointed as a Non-Executive
Director in 1997 sits on the three standing
Committees. Under the Code, due to his length of
service he is required to retire and be proposed for 
re-election annually. He was last re-elected at the
AGM in May 2009.

restricted to those Non-Executive Directors deemed
to be independent by the Board and is shown on
page 10.

appointments to the Nominations Committee for
onward recommendation to the Board. The
Committee is comprised of three independent non-
executive directors, which is the minimum
membership required under the Terms of Reference.
Two members constitute a quorum.
The Audit Committee is required to include one
financially qualified member (as recognised by the
Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies).
Currently the Audit Committee Chairman, Rodger
Hughes and Paul Richardson both meet that
requirement.
The members of the Audit Committee are:
Name Date of appointment Qualification
Rodger Hughes (Chairman) 1st July 2007 Chartered Accountant
Catherine Biner Bradley 4th December 2003 Lawyer
Paul Richardson 3rd December 1998 Chartered Accountant
The Board considers that the relevant experience and specialist expertise of each of the current members of
the Committee is highly beneficial to the performance of the Committee. 18 Chime Communications plc
The Audit Committee in 2009
The Committee met on four occasions during the
year. Paul Richardson was absent from one meeting.
The external auditors are represented at each
meeting and may request a meeting of the Committee
without management being present if necessary. 
In 2009 the Audit Committee has discharged its
responsibilities by performing the standing duties
summarised above and the following activities:
� considered a review of the internal controls and
risk management systems including the resources
required for an appropriate internal audit function
for the Group’s growth;
� monitored the continuing development of the
Company’s contingency plans;
� considered the response to new and revised
legislation and regulatory requirements; 
� reviewed the Group’s draft preliminary and interim
results statements prior to Board approval and
reviewed the external auditors’ detailed reports
thereon;
� reviewed the Group’s interim management
statements and pre-close period updates prior to
their release;
� reviewed the appropriateness of the Group’s
accounting policies;
� reviewed regularly the impact on the Group’s
financial statements of matters such as the adoption
of new International Financial Reporting Standards;
� recommended to the full Board, which adopted
the recommendation, the reappointment of
Deloitte LLP as the Group’s external auditors;
� reviewed and approved the audit fee and reviewed
non-audit fees payable to the Group’s external
auditors; and
� reviewed the external auditors’ plan for the audit of
the Group’s accounts, which included key areas of
scope of work; key risks on the accounts;
confirmations of auditor independence and the
proposed audit fee and approving the terms of
engagement for the audit.
External auditors
� The Audit Committee is responsible for the
development, implementation and monitoring of the
Group’s external audit function. Oversight and
responsibility for monitoring the independence,
objectivity and compliance by the external auditors
with ethical and regulatory requirements lies with the
Committee, and day to day responsibility is
delegated to the Group Finance Director. The
external auditors are jointly responsible to the Board
and the Audit Committee but the Committee is the
primary contact. The Committee monitors and,
where appropriate, approves the parameters for the
engagement of the external auditors to supply non-
audit services.
To fulfil its responsibility regarding the independence of
the external auditors in 2009, the Audit Committee
reviewed:
� the external auditors’ plan for the current year, noting
the role of the senior statutory audit partner, who
signs the audit report and who, in accordance with
professional rules, has not held office for more than
five years, and any changes in the key audit staff;
� the arrangements for day-to-day management of
the audit relationship;
� a report from the external auditors describing their
arrangements to identify, report and manage any
conflicts of interest; and
� the overall extent of non-audit services provided by
the external auditors in addition to its case-by-case
approval of the provision of non-audit services by
the external auditors.
To assess the effectiveness of the external auditors,
the Audit Committee reviewed:
� the arrangements for ensuring the external auditors’
independence and objectivity;
� the external auditors’ fulfilment of the agreed audit
plan and any variations from the plan;
� the robustness and perceptiveness of the auditors
in their handling of the key accounting and audit
judgements; and
� the content of the external auditors’ reporting on
internal control.
Following the above, the Audit Committee has
recommended to the Board that Deloitte LLP is 
re-appointed.
Remuneration Committee 
Summary of the role of the 
Remuneration Committee
The Committee measures the performance of the
Executive Directors and of key members of senior
management as a prelude to recommending their
annual remuneration. The Committee is also
responsible for overseeing grants under the
Company’s Co-Investment Plan, Executive Share
Option Scheme, the Savings-Related Share Option
Scheme, the Deferred Share Plan and the VCCP Key
Players Incentive Scheme to employees of the Group.
When required the Chairman, Lord Bell, attends the
meetings but is not actually a member. The
remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is
recommended by the Chairman and Finance Director
and takes account of the time spent on Board and
Committee matters. Final decisions are made by the
Board but no Director takes part in any discussion
regarding his or her own remuneration.  Annual Report and Accounts 2009 19
Composition of the Remuneration Committee
The membership of the Committee is shown on page
10. Rodger Hughes is Chairman.
The Remuneration Committee in 2009
The Committee met on three occasions during the
year. All the members were present at two meetings;
Paul Richardson was absent on one occasion. 
The Committee has considered the maturity in 2010
of the 2006 Co-Investment Plan for Executive
Directors and senior executives and has supervised
the development of a replacement plan to be
introduced in 2010 (further details are included in the
Remuneration report on page 27 and in the Notice of
Meeting for the forthcoming AGM). 
It has reviewed and approved a further grant under
the Company’s Deferred Share Plan for senior
managers and of the Savings-Related Share Option
Scheme, which is open to all staff after a qualifying
period of employment. The Committee has reviewed
and made a further grant under the VCCP Key Players
Incentive Scheme. The Committee continues to
monitor the administration of the incentive schemes
and the performance targets that apply to each. 
The Committee has considered the performance of
the individual Executive Directors against a
predetermined set of key performance indicators and
has agreed their remuneration as set out on page 29.
The Committee has also approved the disclosures 
to shareholders in the financial statements of 
the Company. 
The Committee has re-appointed Towers Watson as
external advisors on remuneration matters.
Nominations Committee 
Summary of the role of the Nominations
Committee
The Committee leads the process of appointments to
the Board by evaluation of the skills, knowledge and
experience required for a particular appointment.
The Code requires the Company to have a formalised
process for the selection and appointment of new
Directors. The Board considers that a prescriptive
procedure is inappropriate and could prove restrictive
and costly both in terms of identifying potential
candidates and the selection process itself. The
Company does not believe that it should commit to
the exclusive use of external recruitment consultants,
although there may be occasions where this method
is employed. 
Composition of the Nominations Committee
The membership of the Committee is shown on page
10. Rodger Hughes is Chairman.
The Nominations Committee in 2009
The Committee did not meet during the year.
Performance evaluation 
The Directors
The performance evaluation of the individual Directors
for 2009 took place in early 2010. 
The Remuneration Committee, led by Rodger Hughes,
the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director,
evaluated the performance of the Executive Directors.
This was against individual key performance indicators
set during the year by the Committee. 
The Executive Directors, led by the Chairman, is
responsible for the assessment of the performance of
the Non-Executive Directors. 
The performance evaluations of the Directors showed
continued commitment by each Board member and
did not identify any areas of concern.
The Board, the committees and the
management process
Additionally, and in line with the requirements of the
Code, the Company carries out annual performance
evaluations of the Board, the Committees and the
processes utilised by each forum. The aim of the
evaluation is to recognise the strengths and address
any weaknesses of the management process; to
ensure that the Board meets its objectives and that
effectiveness is maximised. 
The work of the Board and its Committees together
with the processes used and the business transacted
during the year is assessed by each forum, taking into
account the specific workloads of each; the
knowledge and expertise of its members and; the
recommendations made to the Board regarding
specific tasks put before the Committees concerned. 
The performance evaluations of the Board and
Committees did not identify any issues of concern or
failure or incapacity to perform the duties for which
they are convened or in meeting the duties as
summarised above.
Relations with shareholders
The Company is keen to promote two-way
communications with its institutional and private
investors and responds quickly to queries received.
Lord Bell, Chairman; Christopher Satterthwaite, 
Chief Executive; and Mark Smith, Group Finance
Director, are the Company’s principal spokespersons
with investors, analysts, the press and other 
interested parties. 
All shareholders are sent copies of the Company’s
Annual and Interim Reports and, where appropriate,
circulars and prospectuses. The Annual and Interim 20 Chime Communications plc
reports are also published on the Group website,
www.chime.plc.uk, together with announcements,
press releases and Company information. This
enables investors worldwide to keep informed of the
Company’s progress. Shareholders are given at least
21 days’ notice of the Annual General Meeting at
which all Directors are generally present and at which
questions are both invited and encouraged. 
Electronic and Web Communications
At the AGM in 2008 shareholders passed a resolution
authorising the Company to utilise electronic means of
communication with its members. In February 2010
shareholders were given the option to receive
shareholder communications by electronic means.
The Company believe this equates with the advice it
gives to its clients regarding utilising all channels of
communication and also further illustrates our
commitment to the environment by reducing the
carbon emissions associated with the production and
delivery of printed matter.
Accountability and audit
Financial reporting 
A review of the businesses in the Group is included in
the Chief Executive’s Review. The Board uses this,
together with the Chairman’s Statement and the
Directors’ report on pages 32 to 37 to present a
balanced and understandable assessment of the
Company’s position and prospects. The Directors’
responsibilities for the financial statements are described
on page 38 of the Report and Financial Statements. 
Internal control 
The Board has established a process for identifying,
evaluating and managing significant risks faced by the
Group. The Board regularly reviews the process,
which has been in place from the start of the year to
the date of approval of this report and which is in
accordance with revised guidance on internal control
published in October 2005 (the Turnbull Guidance).
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of
internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. 
The control and risk management procedures are
designed to highlight any weaknesses and/or failures
in the systems to the Board at the earliest opportunity
together with action taken and/or proposed. Such a
system is designed to manage rather than eliminate
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and
can only provide reasonable and not absolute
assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
Information on the Group’s significant risks, together
with the relevant control and monitoring procedures, 
is reviewed on a monthly basis by the heads of the
business units under the guidance of a nominated
Executive Director. This information is presented to the
Executive Directors to assess any identified risks and
the overall effectiveness of the system of internal
control. An update on all significant risk management
issues is made to the Board at each quarterly meeting.
Additionally, companies annually complete a review of
specified risk areas and their local risk management
processes under the supervision of the trading division
finance directors, the Group Internal Auditor and the
Company Secretary. The Company also has a sub-
committee of the Audit Committee, the Risk
Management Committee, that specifically monitors
and investigates potential areas of risk raised by the
trading companies and by the Group centralised
administrative management in areas such as Legal,
Human Resources and IT.
The Board recognises the need to ensure that
established risk management procedures and
standards are integrated into all acquired businesses
and accordingly potential areas of non-compliance are
identified during the due diligence process and
addressed post-completion. 
The internal audit function reports directly to the Audit
Committee. A review of this function has been
conducted and reported to the Board within the
annual review of the system of internal controls.
Recommended changes to the scope and application
of internal audit procedures have been adopted and
resourced accordingly. The internal audit programme
for the year has been presented to and approved by
the Audit Committee. 
The Group has a number of overseas companies
including businesses in Europe, the USA and the
Middle East. The acquisition of Essentially Group plc 
in November has further increased the number of
overseas locations with additional offices in Australia,
India and New Zealand. The Audit Committee has
broadened the scope of work of both the internal
audit functions and the systems of risk management
in order to ensure standards of control are maintained
throughout the enlarged Group. Control of the
overseas businesses is currently effected by
designated senior executives reporting directly to 
the Board. 
Given the nature of the Group’s activities, the Board
recognises the risks associated with its ability to attract,
motivate and retain talented employees. Accordingly, a
significant part of the Group’s risk management
procedures are focused in this area and the Group
continues to utilise employee benefits schemes shown
on pages 80 and 81 to help meet this requirement. 
Code of Conduct
Whilst the Company accepts that each of its individual
brands will have its own unique culture, the Group has
adopted a set of key values, underpinned by a
published Code of Conduct covering ethical issues
such as bribery and corrupt practices, conflicts of Annual Report and Accounts 2009 21
interest, confidentiality, equal opportunities and
discrimination. This is available to all employees and
forms part of the induction process for new staff.
Compliance with the code is verified via the system of
risk identification and management on a regular basis.
The Code remains under review and will be adapted
as market forces and legal requirements demand or if
additional risks are identified.
The Group has a clear, written whistleblowing policy
and procedure available to all staff regarding concerns
of employees about ethical behaviour and non-
compliance with regulatory requirements and/or the
law. During 2010 the Group will set up a help line, 
to be run by an external third party, in order that 
staff can report any perceived shortcomings within 
its operations.
The Group has material investments in a small number
of associated companies that are not managed by 
the Group. Accordingly, the Group can only influence,
not control, their management practices and therefore
the review of internal controls for these operations 
is less comprehensive than that for the Group’s
managed operations. 
Financial control 
The financial control procedures are described under
the following five headings: 
1. Financial reporting – The Group has a
comprehensive system for reporting financial results
to the Board; each trading company prepares
monthly results with a comparison against budget.
The Board reviews these for the Group as a whole
and by operating segment and determines
appropriate action. Towards the end of each
financial year the operating units prepare detailed
budgets for the following year. 
Budgets and plans are reviewed and necessary
changes made by the Board before being 
adopted formally. 
2. Quality and integrity of personnel – One of the
Group’s core values is integrity; this is regarded as
vital to the maintenance of the Group’s system of
internal financial control and is reflected in the
quality and experience of the Group’s financial staff. 
3. Operating unit financial controls – Key controls over
major business risks include reviews against
performance indicators and exception reporting.
The trading companies regularly assess their exposure
to major business risks and appropriate action is
taken both at operating and Group level in order to
ensure that risk is minimised as far as possible. 
4. Electronic Data Systems – The Group’s financial
and management information is processed by and
stored on data systems. Accordingly, the Group has
established controls and procedures over the
security of data held. The Group has put in place
arrangements for processing to continue and data
to be retained in the event of complete failure of 
any system. 
5. Controls over central functions – A number of the
Group’s key functions, including treasury, taxation,
acquisitions and insurance are dealt with centrally.
Each of these functions has clear and detailed
procedures and is required to report to the Board
on a regular basis; the treasury details are reported
daily to the Finance Director. 
The Audit Committee and Auditors 
The Audit Committee has considered reports made to
it by the executive management of the Group, which
assesses the major business risks and the control
environment against the criteria for assessing internal
financial controls which are set out in the guidance 
for Directors on reporting on internal control. The Audit
Committee has reported to the Board that it has been
able to review the effectiveness of the Group’s system
of internal financial control for the accounting year and
the period to the date of approval of the financial
statements. 
The Group has a policy for the employment of the
auditors for non-audit work. The auditors work on tax
issues and work closely related to their role as the
Company’s auditors but any increase in fees is strictly
controlled by the Audit Committee. Any other non-
audit assignments can be awarded to the auditors
during the year but only where fees and the scope of
work remains within Audit Committee approved limits. 
Going concern basis 
The Group’s business activities, together with the
factors likely to affect its future development,
performance and position are set out in the
Chairman’s Statement on pages 2 to 5. The financial
position of the Group, its cash flows and borrowing
facilities are described in the Finance Director’s Report
on pages 8 and 9. In addition, note 41 of the financial
statements include the group’s objectives, policies
and processes for managing its capital; its financial
risk management objectives and details of its financial
instruments; and its exposure to credit risk and
liquidity risk.
As highlighted in note 41 to the financial statements,
the Group meets its day to day working capital
requirements through an overdraft facility that is due
for renewal in June 2010 and a committed facility
which matures in June 2013. These facilities are
subject to banking covenants as disclosed in note 41. 22 Chime Communications plc
In preparing forecasts the directors have taken into
account the following key factors:
� The possible impact of the continued economic
downturn on the Group’s business,
� Key client account renewals
� The level of committed and variable costs
� Current new business targets compared to levels
achieved in previous years
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account
of reasonably possible changes in trading performance,
show that the Group should be able to operate within
the level of its current facility and banking covenants. 
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the
Company and the Group have adequate resources to
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable
future. Thus they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual
financial statements.
More detail on the Group’s cash position and facilities
at 31 December 2009, as well as maturities of the
financial liabilities, can be found in note 27 to the
financial statements. The principal risks and
uncertainties faced by the Group are included in the
Directors Report. Details of potential contingent
liabilities and potential cash outflows in relation to
these liabilities can be found in note 36. 
Social responsibility 
We are in the business of managing brand and
corporate reputation on behalf of clients and the
Board acknowledges that being socially responsible is
an important factor in the management of our business. 
The Board confirms that regular consideration is given
to the significance of social, environmental and ethical
(SEE) issues (as defined by the Association of British
Insurers), and as part of our wider operational risk
framework, identifies significant risks arising from
these areas to short-term and long-term value. 
The Group also considers corporate responsibility to
be an area of business opportunity. Our subsidiary,
Corporate Citizenship, provides not only a focus for
our investment in this field but provides the Group with
specialist expertise. 
The Board believes that corporate responsibility
should underpin everything that we do. The Group is
therefore committed to demonstrating the importance
of this, not only in our work for clients, but in our own
working practices. 
The Company measures the performance of each of
its businesses against a benchmark list of minimum
corporate responsibility standards. These cover:
� Promoting good environmental practices – both in
our own operations and to our wider stakeholders;
� Empowering community work – the promotion of
volunteering and charity work by our staff and 
companies alike;
� Young people – via our internship, work experience
and graduate schemes
The standards are designed to be stretching and, 
as such, encourage continual improvement in these
important areas. The minimum standards will be
developed in future to encompass other areas of
corporate responsibility. 
We continue to report our corporate responsibility
performance to our stakeholders via our website.
These detail not only the principles of our approach;
our targets and our performance but also give
examples of the initiatives undertaken. 
The Company continues to be listed on the FTSE4Good
Index, which evaluates companies’ performance on 
a number of corporate responsibility criteria. Business
in the Community awarded the Group a second 
Big Tick award during 2009 for continued progress in
enhancing our environmental performance. 
Environment 
The business of Chime Communications is primarily in
the UK and delivers services to clients based on image,
ideas, research and content. As such, our direct and
indirect impact on the environment is minimal and
considered low-risk. 
However, we acknowledge that our customers, staff
and other stakeholders have an interest in our impact
on the environment and as such we have committed
to monitor and improve our environmental
performance where possible. The Group has reduced
its carbon footprint by 42% since becoming Carbon
Neutral in 2007. We are currently assessing our
emissions reductions during 2009 and expect to meet
our target of a further 5% reduction. We continue to
consider and enhance the environmental impact of
our businesses and are working closely with our major
suppliers to ensure best practice is embedded in our
wider operations. We regularly incorporate our
environmental performance in business presentations
as we believe this is an important consideration when
evaluating reputation both for our companies and our
clients alike.  Annual Report and Accounts 2009 23
Health and safety 
The Board believes that our people are our most
important asset. Our businesses do not include any
industrial or manufacturing processes and our staff are
mainly office-based. As such, risk of accidents is low.
We do acknowledge that we may expose our staff to
additional areas of risk which, whilst not unique to
Chime (for example, business travel, event
organisation and lone or remote working), do require
further scrutiny, mitigation and procedural guidance in
order to maximise the wellbeing of our people. 
A revised policy and set of procedures was published
to staff in September 2008 and has been promoted to
staff throughout 2009.
Employee issues 
As a people business, our reputation depends on the
skills, knowledge and integrity of our people. Chime
has fostered an entrepreneurial culture and each of
our businesses is encouraged to create a stimulating,
rewarding and inspiring work environment for our people. 
We recognise that central oversight on human
resources issues is beneficial and continually review
the employment standards across the Group as part
of the general management and risk identification
processes. 
In order to attract and retain talented staff we continue
to operate our Executive Share Option and Savings-
Related Share Option Schemes together with our
Deferred Share Plan and VCCP Key Players Incentive
Scheme. We also continue to review our incentive
schemes on an ongoing basis to ensure they are fit 
for purpose. 
Ethics 
The Group meets all relevant laws, regulations and
codes of practice issued by any relevant Government
or appropriate regulator. We ensure that all our people
are aware and comply with such standards. In
addition, we recognise that integrity is essential to the
maintenance of our reputation in the marketplace. As
part of our regular review process, issues of conduct
are identified, reviewed and the Board is alerted as
appropriate. We utilise our published Code of Conduct
(see page 20) which formalises the values, behaviour
and ethical standards expected of Chime employees.
This area remains under review. We maintain our
whistleblowing policy and procedure (see page 21) 
and ensure that our published standards of behaviour
are communicated to both new and existing staff. 
Compliance statement 
Statement about applying the principles 
of the Code
The company has applied the principles set out in

with the Code as reported above.
Statement of compliance with the Code
Throughout the year ended 31 December 2009, the
company has been in compliance with the Provisions
of the Code on Corporate Governance issued in 2006,
and as amended in section 1 of the Combined Code
issued in 2008 by the FRC (The Code), except for
Code A.4.6 – Processes used by the Nominations

Group policy on the remuneration of Directors
and employees
This Report sets out the Group’s Remuneration
policies for the Directors for the year ended
31 December 2009. Except where noted, these
policies are likely to continue to apply in future years,
unless there are specific reasons for change. It has
been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 to the
Accounting regulations under the Companies Act
2006. The report also meets the relevant requirements
of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority
and describes how the Board has applied the
principles relating to Directors’ remuneration in the
Combined Code. As required by the Act, a resolution
to approve this report will be proposed at the Annual
General Meeting of the Company at which the
financial statements will be approved. 
The Act requires the auditors to report to the
Company’s members on certain parts of the Directors’
remuneration report and to state whether in their
opinion those parts of the report have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Accounting
Regulations. The report has therefore been divided
into separate sections for audited and unaudited
information.
Unaudited Information
Remuneration Committee
The composition, chairmanship and activities of the
Remuneration Committee are set out on pages 10 
and 18. The members of the Committee receive
remuneration as set out in this report. They abstain
from participating where their own interests are
concerned and have no involvement in the day-to-day
management of the Group’s operations. Other
Directors attend meetings by invitation only but this
would not include when matters relating to their own
remuneration arrangements are discussed. In addition
to the current members of the Committee, Julian
Seymour (resigned 31 December 2007) was a
member when the 2006 Co-Investment Plan, as
detailed later, was approved by the Committee. A
summary of the role, key responsibilities and the work
carried out by the Committee are outlined within the
Corporate Governance Report on pages 18 to 19.
During the financial period under review, the
Remuneration Committee sought the assistance of
the Chairman and Finance Director relating to
Directors’ performance and remuneration. The
Committee used Towers Perrin (now Towers Watson)
to provide advice primarily on competitive market
levels, on the performance-related elements of the
Executive Directors’ remuneration and formulation of
new long-term incentive scheme. Towers Watson
were not contracted to supply any other services
during 2009. The Remuneration Committee also
approved the grant of share options under the
Savings-Related Share Option Scheme, the grant of
shares under the VCCP Key Players Incentive Scheme
and the grant of shares under the Deferred Share Plan. 
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on
request from the Company Secretary and will be
available for inspection at the forthcoming Annual
General Meeting. 
Remuneration Policy
The Group is committed to attracting and retaining
high quality staff. Remuneration is set at levels
commensurate with competing firms in the same
industry and is monitored on a regular basis. The
performance measurement of the Executive Directors
and key senior management and the determination of
their annual remuneration packages are undertaken
by the Committee. More generally, the Committee
reviews executive remuneration arrangements
regularly to ensure that they remain effective,
competitive and appropriate to the Group’s
circumstances and prospects, and monitors incentive
award levels and consequent company liabilities. It
also reviews the awards of shares made under the
various Savings Related, Deferred, VCCP Key Players
Incentive Schemes and Co-Investment Plan in terms
of their effect on dilution limits.
Three of the four Executive Directors spend a large
proportion of their time on fee earning client work.
Their remuneration packages are therefore based on
the appropriate market rate for two different functions.
One is the management of the Group in the executive
roles of Chairman, Deputy Chairman and Chief
Executive and the other is as client handlers and new
business winners. Looked at in those terms their
remuneration is considered to be in line with market
rates. The Committee places considerable emphasis
on the performance linked elements of their
remuneration i.e. Annual Bonus, Deferred Share
Incentives and Long-Term Incentives.
Executive Directors are entitled to accept external
appointments outside the Company and retain any
fees paid to them providing that the Chairman’s
permission is sought and confirmed by the Board. 
The fees payable to the Non-Executive Directors
represent compensation in connection with Board and
Committee meetings, and where appropriate for
devoting additional time and expertise for the benefit
of the Group in a wider capacity. Non-Executive
Directors do not participate in the Company’s pension
or share option or other incentive plans. The Board
considers that the Non-Executive Directors’
remuneration conforms with the requirements of the
Combined Code. 
Director’s Remuneration Report Annual Report and Accounts 2009 25
Remuneration packages of the executive directors
In 2009 there were five main elements of the
remuneration packages for Executive Directors:
� basic annual salary and benefits;
� annual bonus payments which cannot exceed 
50% of salary;
� deferred share incentives;
� long-term incentive plans; and
� pension arrangements.
Basic Annual Salary and Benefits
In setting salary levels, the Remuneration Committee
considers the experience and responsibility of the
Executive Directors and their personal performance
during the previous year. The Committee also takes
account of salary levels within other companies of 
a similar size and nature, as well as the rates of
increases for other employees within the Group. The
Remuneration Committee reviews salaries with effect
from January each year. The benefits provided by the
Group to the Executive Directors consist principally of
pension contribution, a car or car allowance and
private medical insurance.
With the exception of the Chief Executive (who
received an increase in 2009), no increases in salary
were awarded to the Executive Directors in either
2008 or 2009 consistent with greater emphasis on
incentivising performance through bonuses. 
Annual Bonus
The Executive Directors’ annual bonus arrangements
are focused on the achievement of the Group’s short-
term objectives. The annual bonus allocation is
capped at a maximum of 50% of salary for the
Executive Directors; of this up to 25% of the relevant
Director’s salary may be payable if the Company
meets the profit targets set by the Board. A further
maximum of 25% may be paid to each Executive
Director, based on performance against key
performance indicators linked to the Group’s stated
strategy and tailored to their individual roles. Some of
these are non-financial. The Remuneration Committee
reviews the specific key performance indicators for
each Director and assesses their overall performance
both against those indicators and generally. Based on
this assessment the Committee determines what, if
any, further bonus is payable. The Committee believes
the performance metrics chosen align with shareholder
value creation. Bonus payments are not pensionable.
For 2009, the key performance indicators included:
� Growth in operating profit margin
� Growth in income from international work
� Growth in number and value of shared clients
� Growth in average fee per client
� Revenue generation

The Committee considered the performance of the
Directors in March 2010. The profit targets set by 
the Committee have been met in a challenging
environment and performance again compares
favourably with that of competitors. The Committee
has also assessed each Directors’ achievements
against their individual key performance indicators.
Bonus awards averaging 40% of salary have been
approved by the Committee reflecting generally
excellent performance.
The resultant bonuses for 2009 are shown in the
remuneration table on page 29.
Deferred Share Plan
During 2006 the Company introduced a Deferred
Share Plan (the Plan). Under the Plan restricted rights
over existing Chime Communications shares are
granted to Executive Board Directors, subsidiary
Board Directors and senior employees of the Group. 
A participant of the Plan must remain employed by the
Group for a fixed period as determined by the
Remuneration Committee at the date of grant after the
date of grant for the shares to vest with the employee.
There are no other performance criteria attached to
the restricted shares. The plan aims to encourage the
retention of key employees. All grants under the Plan
are approved by the Remuneration Committee. The
grants under the Plan to date have been relatively
modest. The Deferred Share Plan replaced the
Executive Share Option Scheme. There are presently
deferred share plans that have vesting periods of two,
three and four years.
The Executive Directors received grants under the
Plan in 2006, but are excluded from participation in
any other incentive scheme for the duration of the
current Co-Investment Plan or any replacement long
term investment plan. Details of their participation are
shown in the table on page 30.
The rules of the Plan as approved by the shareholders
in general meeting in 2006 authorise the Remuneration
Committee to use its discretion to “to get or keep
favourable tax, exchange control or regulatory
treatment of participants” and as such the Committee
has considered and authorised an earlier maturity date
of March 2010 (previously July 2010) as it will benefit
the members at no additional cost to the shareholders.
The grant comprises 34 members and totals 151,000
shares. The Executive Directors are not members of
the Plan under this grant as noted above. 26 Chime Communications plc
Co-Investment Plan
In 2006 shareholder approval was granted to
introduce a Co-Investment Plan (CIP). The CIP was
established to align the interests of the Company’s
most senior executives to the three year business plan
put in place during 2006. Participation in the plan is
dependent upon the commitment by the executive to
maintain an investment in the Company’s shares until
the end of the performance period, with an initial value
of up to 50% of salary, capped at a total value of
£175,000 per participant. In return for this commitment
the executive is granted an award over a maximum of
five times as many matching shares. The number of
matching shares that vest, if any, is dependent upon
the achievement of performance targets measured
over a four year performance period.
50% of the matching shares is tied to the aggregate
reported earnings per share (EPS) and 50% are tied to
total shareholder return (TSR) relative to a peer group
of other media companies. The comparator group for
awards in 2006 and 2007 was ITE group, Wilmington
Group, M&C Saatchi, Tarsus Group, Next Fifteen
Communications, Cello Group, Huntsworth, Centaur
Media, Future, Chrysalis Group, Bloomsbury
Publishing, Creston, Media Square and STV Group.
No further awards were made after 2007.
The maximum award is for achieving EPS growth
equivalent to 26% per annum compounded and a
TSR ranking in the top 15% of the comparator 
group. In addition to the above requirements the
Remuneration Committee must be satisfied as to the
underlying financial performance of the Company. 
Relative TSR is recognised as one of the best
indicators of whether a shareholder has achieved a
good return on investing in the Group relative to its
peer group. In addition, an EPS performance
condition provides an appropriate measure of the
Group’s underlying financial performance.
Under the rules of the CIP the Executive Directors
received no awards (post 2006) under any of the
Company’s long-term incentive schemes for the
duration of this scheme. 
The table on page 30 shows the maximum number of
shares that will vest with the Executive Directors
should the performance targets be met in full together
with the number of shares to be awarded at current
estimated performance. The CIP includes four other
senior executives in addition to the Executive Directors.
Under the rules of the CIP , the Remuneration
Committee has the authority to make adjustments to
the published EPS if events happen that make it fair
and reasonable to do so. 
In 2010 it was agreed that an adjustment would be
made to the published EPS for the year ended 31
December 2009. The adjustment is detailed in note 5
to the accounts. In the view of the Remuneration
Committee the adjustment represents amounts which
were either non-recurring, non-trading items or where
the accounting treatment was not anticipated when
the plan was established. This adjustment represents
only 2% of EPS.
Level of Award
The Committee has considered the potential level of
the award and has determined that the part that is
dependent on EPS performance between 2006 to
2009 will be 49.7%. The TSR performance period
ends on the date of the preliminary announcement of
results on 10th March 2010 and will therefore require
further calculation after that date. Estimates made in
early March forecast that the TSR target would be met
in full and therefore this would indicate the payment of
that element at 100%. If realised as estimated the total
number of shares that will vest will be 74.85% of the
maximum as shown on page 30.
Vesting Date
The rules of the CIP approved by shareholders in
2006 provide that the Committee may:
(i) change the CIP to take account of changes to
the ICTA 1988 or other relevant law and:
(ii) may change the Plan to get or keep favourable
tax, exchange control or regulatory treatment
for Participants or any member of the Group
The CIP provided the Company with an element of
executive retention in that the participants would forfeit 
their right to matching shares if they left the Company
after the performance period ended but prior to the
original Vesting Date of 10th September 2010. 
The Committee has considered and resolved that the
participants of the Plan will be given the option to elect
to have their matching shares (either in total or 
in part) vest at the earlier date of 19th March. Any
earlier vesting on this date would be subject to a
number of conditions. 
A participant vesting at the earlier date would agree 
to forfeit the vested matching shares should they leave
the company’s employment in the period prior to 
the original Vesting Date of 11th September 2010. 
As each of the participants have contractual notice
periods in excess of six months the Committee has
assessed that this is unlikely but protection for the
shareholders is still appropriate. In addition the
Committee wished to ensure that should a participant
leave the Company as a “bad leaver” (as defined in the
rules of the CIP) during the period to 10th September
2010 then any costs attributable to the earlier vesting
would also require repayment to the Company. Annual Report and Accounts 2009 27
Any participant of the Plan opting to vest early would
agree not to sell their matching shares prior to the
original Vesting Date.
The Committee believes that these changes, with the
executive retention and cost repayment measures in
place, are in the interests of shareholders. 
Replacement Plan
As the current CIP matures in March 2010 the
Committee has developed a replacement long term
investment plan in order to continue to incentivise the
Executive Directors and senior management.
Shareholder approval of the new plan will be sought at
the forthcoming AGM and further details will be
circulated to shareholders with the Notice of Meeting.
VCCP Key Players Incentive Scheme
During 2008 the Company introduced an Incentive
Scheme for key individuals within the VCCP Group.
Under the Scheme a bonus pool is calculated with
reference to growth in profits of the VCCP Group, the
bonus pool is payable 50% in cash and 50% in
restricted rights over existing Chime Communications
shares. The distribution of the pool is restricted to
senior employees of the VCCP Group. The Scheme
covers the period 1 January 2008 to 31 December
2012. A participant of the Scheme must remain
employed by the Group for a fixed period as
determined by the Remuneration Committee at the
date of grant after the date of grant for the cash and
shares to vest with the employee. The Scheme allows
for a claw-back facility if the profits of the VCCP Group
fall below a base level of profits. There are no other
performance criteria attached to the cash or restricted
shares. The Scheme aims to encourage the retention
of key employees within the VCCP Group. All grants
under the Scheme are approved by the Remuneration
Committee. The grants under the Scheme todate have
been relatively modest.
Share Option Schemes
Previously the Company has operated an Executive
Share Option Scheme for Executive Directors,
subsidiary Board Directors and senior employees. 
All executive options granted from November 1997
(other than special executive options) are subject to
the Group achieving during the period of grant, an
average total shareholder return on the shares for the
preceding three years which exceeds the average
FTSE 100 total shareholder return for the same
period and a percentage growth in earnings per share
which is at least equal to the percentage growth in
the Retail Price Index plus 6% over three years. The
exercise price of the options granted under the above
scheme is equal to the market value of the
Company’s shares at the time when the options were
granted. There have been no grants of Executive
Share Options since 2005. Executive share options
are only expected to be granted in future if there 
is a contractual commitment or in exceptional
circumstances.
The Company also operates a Savings-Related Share
Option Scheme which is open to all employees after
an initial qualifying period of employment.
Pensions
Pension contributions on behalf of the Executive
Directors are paid by the Company to the Group’s
money purchase pension scheme or to a personal
pension scheme up to the value of 20% of their 
basic salary.
Directors’ interests in contracts and other
transactions with Group companies
No Director has a material interest in any contract
with any Group company other than a service
contract.
Directors’ contracts
The Company’s policy is that Executive Directors
should normally be employed on rolling contracts
which may be terminated by the Company giving no
more than 12 months’ notice and which otherwise
expires on retirement, currently at age 65. In
December 2006 the Company agreed a new service
contract with Lord Bell in order that he may continue
as a Director beyond age 65. All Executive Directors
and employees have rolling contracts of employment
with a notice period that does not exceed 12 months.
Any compensation payable on early termination of
employment contracts would be in line with
contractual and statutory requirements.  28 Chime Communications plc

Directors are able to use the shares allocated to them under the Deferred Share Plan as part of their investment to
qualify for the plan. 
No other terms of the Deferred Share Plan were varied during the year, or previous years.

The earlier vesting date of 19th March 2010 was approved by the Remuneration Committee in March 2010 –
further details are shown on page 26.
As described on page 26 estimates made in early March forecast that overall performance against both the EPS
and the TSR elements of the target performance of the CIP would result in 74.85% of the maximum number
shown above vesting to the Executive Directors. If this is the case the matching shares awarded would be as
follows: Lord Bell – 313,199 shares; Piers Pottinger – 344,703 shares; Christopher Satterthwaite – 336,376
shares and; Mark Smith – 244,310 shares.  Annual Report and Accounts 2009 31

Results and dividends
The Group’s income statement is set out on 
page 40 and shows a profit before tax for the year 
to 31 December 2009 of £18,553,000 (2008 –
£16,339,000). The Directors recommend the payment
of a final dividend of 3.50p per ordinary share to be
paid on 18 June 2010 to the ordinary shareholders
on the register on 28 May 2010 which together with
the interim dividend paid on 16 October 2009 makes
a total of 5.10p per share for the year (2008 – 4.72p).
Dividends are recognised in the accounts in the year
they are paid, or in the case of a final dividend when
approved by shareholders, such that the amount
recognised in the 2009 accounts comprises 2008’s
final dividend and 2009’s interim dividend.

The Group’s policy is not to make direct donations to
support political parties. However, the nature of the
Group’s work is such that to support its commercial
activities, certain companies within the Group may
need to attend or sponsor events which are organised
by political parties or other political organisations, for
which a charge is made. In addition, the Group may
invite clients and prospective clients to attend events
which fall within the meaning of the Companies Act
2006 provisions. The Companies Act 2006 defines
‘”political party”, “political organisations”, “political
donation” and “political expenditure” widely and as a
result, it is possible that political organisations may
include bodies concerned with matters such as policy
review and law reform, or the representation of the
business community or sections of it, or the
representation of other communities or special 
interest groups.
During the year and adopting this wider definition, the
Group made payments that might be deemed to be
political donations totalling £38,536 (2008 – £22,000)
to various organisations, £32,686 connected with 
the Conservative Party, £2,500 connected with the
Scottish National Party, £2,000 connected with the
Liberal Democrats and £1,350 connected with the
Labour Party.
Employee involvement
The Group places considerable value on the
involvement of its employees and has continued to
keep them informed on matters affecting them as
employees and on the various factors affecting the
performance of the Group. This is achieved principally
via the Group’s intranet site, emails and formal and
informal functions. In addition, the Group’s Savings-
Related Share Option Scheme, Performance Related
Pay and bonus schemes encourage employees at all
levels to contribute to the achievement of the Group’s
short and long term goals.
Employment of disabled persons
The Group believes in an equality of opportunity for all
employees based on merit and that no employee or
job applicant should receive less favourable treatment
on the grounds of: age, sex, marital status, disability,
colour, race, religion, nationality or ethnic origin.
The Group gives full and fair consideration to all
applications for employment made by disabled
persons, having regard to their particular aptitudes
and abilities. Opportunities for training, career
development and promotion do not disadvantage
these employees.
Creditor payment terms
The Group’s policy on suppliers is that they will be
paid in accordance with agreed terms and conditions
of trade on a regular basis.
The number of days outstanding between receipt of
invoices and date of payment, calculated by reference
to the amount owed to trade creditors at the year-end
as a proportion of the amounts invoiced by suppliers
during the year, was 40 days in aggregate for the
Group (2008 – 38). The Company did not have any
trade creditors at 31 December 2009 or 2008.
Additional information for shareholders
The following information, which summarises certain
provisions of the current Articles and Association of
Chime Communications plc (“the Articles”) and
applicable English law concerning companies (the

resolution decide, or if no such resolution is in effect or
such resolution does not make specific provision as
the Board may determine. There is currently no such
applicable resolution in effect. 
Voting rights
Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to attend and
speak at general meetings of the Company. On a
show of hands every holder of ordinary shares who is
present in person shall have one vote. On a poll every
holder of ordinary shares present in person shall have
one vote for every share of which he is the holder.
Votes may be exercised in person or by proxy. Every
notice of general meeting of the Company shall

voting rights in respect of each resolution proposed 
at such meeting. Electronic and paper proxy
appointments must be received not later than 48
hours before the general meeting, provided that at an
adjournment of a meeting the proxy form must be

unless all calls or other sums presently payable by 
the holder of such ordinary shares have been paid. 
A holder of ordinary shares may lose the entitlement 
to vote at a general meeting where that holder has
failed to respond to a disclosure notice made by the
Company under the Companies Acts with information
concerning interests held in those shares. 
Variation of rights
The Company may resolve by the consent of not less
than 75% in nominal value of the issued shares of 
the Company, and subject to the Companies Acts, 
to vary all or any of the rights attaching to the shares
of the Company. 
Restriction on transfer of shares
The Directors may refuse, provided such refusal does
not prevent dealings in the shares of the company
from taking place in an open and proper manner or 
where the Company has a lien over such shares, to
register a transfer of certificated shares which are not
fully paid, or where the instrument of transfer has not
been correctly stamped and lodged at the place
designated by the Board accompanied by the
certificate of shares and such other evidence of title as
may be reasonably required to show the right of the
transferor to make the transfer. The Directors may also
refuse to register a transfer unless: (i) it is to a person
who is not a minor; (ii) a bankrupt; (iii) is subject to an
order made on the grounds of some mental or other
incapacity that prevents management of their own
affairs; (iv) it is in favour of not more than four
transferees; and (v) the instrument of transfer is in
respect of one class of shares only. 
Transfers of uncertificated shares of the Company
may be made using the CREST system and the
Directors may refuse a transfer of shares in
accordance with the rules governing the operation 
of the CREST system. 
Significant direct or indirect holdings of
securities and special rights
The holdings of shares of the Company by the
Directors are notified on page 31. Significant holdings
in the shares of the Company are notified on page 35.
Under the subscription Agreement between the
Company and WPP plc of 1997, WPP plc has the
right to appoint two non-executive directors of the
Company provided it holds not less than 20% of the
shares of the Company and the right to appoint one
non-executive director provided it holds not less than
12.5% of the shares of the Company. There are no
other holdings of shares of the Company in which
there are special rights. 
Dividends and other payments
The Company may by ordinary resolution from time to
time declare dividends in accordance with the rights 
of the members subject to the provisions of the
Companies Acts and provided that the dividend does
not exceed the amount recommended by the Board
of Directors. The Board may pay interim dividends in
such amount as the Board considers justified by the
financial position of the Company. 
Employee share trust
The Company operates a number of schemes in 
order to incentivise the employees of the Company.
Shares are held by a trustee in order to satisfy the
entitlements of employees under the Group’s share
schemes other than those that are satisfied by the
issue of new shares. The shares held by the trustee
do not have any special rights with regard to the
control of the Company. The rights attaching to the
shares held by the trustee are generally not
exercisable by the relevant employees except where
the interest is held beneficially by them. Further details
son the share schemes may be found on pages 26 
and 27.  Annual Report and Accounts 2009 35
Appointment and replacement of Directors
Directors may be appointed by ordinary resolution of
the Company in general meeting or by the Board
upon the recommendation of the Nominations

other Directors of the Company being not fewer than

and in accordance with the relevant Articles and
legislation. 
Acquisition of the Company’s own shares
The Company may purchase its own shares in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Companies Acts, subject to the resolution of the
shareholders. Shares purchased by the Company
may be held in treasury or should, if not held in
treasury, be cancelled immediately thus reducing the
issued share capital of the Company. 
At the end of the year, the Directors had authority,
under the shareholders’ resolution issued on 13 May
2009, to purchase through the market £4,754,825 of
the Company’s own ordinary shares at prices not less
than 25p per ordinary share and not more than five
per cent above the average of the middle market
quotations as derived from the London Stock

Substantial interests
At 8 March 2010 the following interests, other than those of the Directors set out above, in 3% or more of the
issued ordinary share capital had been notified to the Company:

Significant agreements
The following significant agreement contains
provisions entitling the counterparties to exercise
termination or other rights in the event of a change of
control of the Company:
� Under the £32 million committed banking facility
agreement dated 18 August 2008 between the
Company and The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc,
upon a change of control of the Company or any
of its subsidiaries, without the consent of the bank,
the bank may by written notice declare the loan, all
interest accrued and all other sums payable under
the agreement to be immediately due and payable
and/or terminate the obligations of the bank under
the agreement.
The Directors confirm there are no contractual or other
arrangements between the Group and any person
which are essential to the business of the company.
Risks and uncertainties
The Board has considered the principal risks and
uncertainties affecting the Group as at 31 December
2009 and these are summarised below. The Group
has specific policies in place to ensure risks are
properly evaluated and managed at the appropriate
level within the Group. These policies are set out in the
Directors’ Statement on Corporate Governance, in the
section headed internal control on page 20. 36 Chime Communications plc
1. The Group receives a significant portion of its
revenues from a limited number of large clients,
and the loss of those clients would adversely
impact the Group’s prospects, business, financial
condition and result of operations.
A relatively small number of clients contribute a
significant percentage of the Group’s operating
income. The Group’s two largest clients
accounted for approximately 22.3 % of operating
income in the year ended 31 December 2009
(2008 – 18.4%) and the Group’s 30 largest clients
accounted for approximately 57% of operating
income in the year ended 31 December 2009
(2008 – 48%).
2. The Group is dependent on key personnel and its
relationships with clients.
The Group’s future success is substantially
dependent on the continued services and
continuing contributions of its Directors, senior
management and other key personnel. The loss 
of the services of any of the Group’s executive
officers or other key employees could have a
material adverse effect on the Group’s business. 
3. The Group’s industry is highly competitive.
The Group may face significant competition, both
actual and potential, including competition from
global competitors which have large capital
resources in the provision of similar services to
those provided by the Group. Competition in the
industry is based upon: range and quality of
services offered; geographical reach; reputation;
and client relationships. 
4. Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets
recorded on the Group’s balance sheet with respect
to acquired companies may become impaired. 
The Group has a significant amount of goodwill
and other acquired intangible assets recorded on
its balance sheet with respect to acquired
companies. The Group annually tests the carrying
value of goodwill for impairment. The estimates
and assumptions about results of operations and
cash flows made in connection with impairment
testing could differ from future actual results of
operations and cash flows. In addition, future
events could cause the Group to conclude that
the asset values associated with a given operation
have become impaired. 
5. The Group has a large amount of deferred
contingent consideration payable pursuant to
previous acquisitions that may become payable.
The Group has deferred contingent consideration
payable in the upcoming years pursuant to the
terms of previous acquisitions of businesses. 
The fulfilment of these payment obligations may
detrimentally affect cash available to the Group 
to manage and grow its business efficiently. 
6. The Group may be exposed to liabilities from
allegations that certain of its clients’ advertising
claims may be false or misleading or that its
clients’ products may be defective. The Group 
has insurance against such claims.
7. The Group is subject to the risk of failure of its
information systems.
The Group’s ability to maintain financial controls
and provide a high-quality service to clients
depends, in part, on the efficient and uninterrupted
operation of its management information systems,
including its computer systems. The Group’s
computer systems may be vulnerable to damage
or interruption from floods, fires, power loss,
telecommunications failures, physical or electronic
break-ins, power outages, computer viruses and
other malfunctions and disruptions. 
8. The Group may be unsuccessful in evaluating
material risks involved in completed and future
acquisitions.
The Group regularly reviews potential acquisitions
of businesses that are complementary to its
businesses. As part of the review, the Group
conducts business, legal and financial due
diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating
material risks involved in any particular transaction. 
9. The Group may be unsuccessful in integrating any
acquired operations with its existing businesses. 
10. Fluctuations of revenues, expenses and operating
results may affect the Group’s results.
The Group’s revenues, expenses and operating
results could vary significantly from period to
period as a result of a variety of factors, some of
which are outside the Group’s control. These
factors include general economic conditions,
conditions specific to the market, seasonal trends
in revenues, capital expenditure, other costs and
the introduction of new products or services by
the Group or its competitors. In response to a
changing competitive environment, the Group may
elect from time to time to make certain pricing,
service or marketing decisions that could have a
material adverse effect on the Group’s revenues,
results of operations and financial condition.  Annual Report and Accounts 2009 37
11. The Group is subject to recessionary 
economic cycles.
The Group’s business is affected by recessionary
economic cycles. Recessionary economic cycles
may also adversely affect the businesses of the
Group’s clients, which can have the effect of
reducing the amount of services they purchase
from the Group. 
12. The Group is subject to currency rate risk.
Fluctuations in exchange rates between
currencies in which the Group operates, relative to
pounds sterling, may cause fluctuations in its
financial results. 
13. The Group may be subject to certain regulations
that could restrict the Group’s activities.
From time to time, governments, government
agencies and industry self-regulatory bodies in the
countries in which the Group operates have
adopted statutes, regulations and rulings that
directly or indirectly affect the form, content and
scheduling of advertising, public relations and
public affairs and market research, or otherwise
affect the activities of the Group and its clients. 
Post balance sheet events
Post balance sheet events are set out in note 42.
Auditors
Each of the persons who is a Director at the date of
approval of this report confirms that:
� so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant
audit information of which the Group’s auditors are
unaware; and
� the Director has taken all the steps that he/she
ought to have taken as a Director in order to make
himself/herself aware of any relevant audit
information and to establish that the company’s
auditors are aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted 
in accordance with the provisions of s418 of the
Companies Act 2006.
Deloitte LLP have expressed their willingness to
continue in office as auditors and a resolution to
reappoint them will be proposed at the forthcoming

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual
Report and the financial statements in accordance
with applicable laws and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare such
financial statements for each financial year. Under that
law the Directors are required to prepare Group
financial statements in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS
Regulation and have also chosen to prepare the
parent company financial statements in accordance
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and
applicable law). Under company law the Directors
must not approve the accounts unless they are
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state
of affairs of the company and of the profit or loss of
the company for that period. In preparing these
financial statements, the Directors are required to:
� select suitable accounting policies and then apply
them consistently;
� make judgments and accounting estimates that
are reasonable and prudent; and
� prepare the financial statements on the going
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume
that the company will continue in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International
Accounting Standard 1 requires that directors:
� properly select and apply accounting policies;
� present information, including accounting policies,
in a manner that provides relevant, reliable,
comparable and understandable information; and
� provide additional disclosures when compliance
with the specific requirements in IFRSs are
insufficient to enable users to understand the
impact of particular transactions, other events and
conditions on the entity’s financial position and
financial performance; and
� make an assessment of the company’s ability to
continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper
accounting records that are sufficient to show and
explain the Company’s transactions and disclose with
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position
of the Company and enable them to ensure that the
financial statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding
the assets of the company and hence for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and
integrity of the corporate and financial information
included on the company’s website. Legislation in the
United Kingdom governing the preparation and
dissemination of financial statements may differ from
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement
We confirm to the best of our knowledge:
� the financial statements, prepared in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards as
adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or
loss of the company and the undertakings included
in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
� the Directors report includes a fair review of the
development and performance of the business
and the position of the company and the
undertakings included in the consolidation taken
as a whole, together with a description of the
principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Independent auditors’ report to the members of
Chime Communications plc
We have audited the Group financial statements of
Chime Communications plc for the year ended 31
December 2009 which comprise the consolidated
income statement, the consolidated statement of
comprehensive income, the consolidated balance
sheet, the consolidated statement of changes in
equity and the consolidated cash flow statement and
the related notes 1 to 42. The financial reporting
framework that has been applied in their preparation is
applicable law and International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Group’s members, 
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of
the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been
undertaken so that we might state to the Group’s
members those matters we are required to state to
them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than
the Company and the Company’s members as a body,
for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions
we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors 
and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities
Statement, the Directors are responsible for the
preparation of the group financial statements and for
being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our
responsibility is to audit the group financial statements
in accordance with applicable law and International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those
standards require us to comply with the Auditing
Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for
Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the
financial statements are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This
includes an assessment of: whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances
and have been consistently applied and adequately
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant
accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the
overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the group financial statements:
� give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s
affairs as at 31 December 2009 and of its profit for
the year then ended;
� have been properly prepared in accordance with
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
� have been prepared in accordance with the
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued
by the IASB
As explained in note 2 to the group financial
statements, the group in addition to complying with its
legal obligation to apply IFRSs as adopted by the
European Union, has also applied IFRSs as issued by
the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
In our opinion the group financial statements comply
with IFRSs as issued by the IASB
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’
Report for the financial year for which the financial
statements are prepared is consistent with the group
financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by
exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to
report to you if, in our opinion:
� certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration
specified by law are not made; or
� we have not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
� the Directors’ statement contained within the
Directors’ statement on corporate governance in
relation to going concern; and
� the part of the Corporate Governance Statement
relating to the Company’s compliance with the
nine provisions of the June 2008 Combined Code
specified for our review.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the parent company
financial statements of Chime Communications plc for
the year ended 31 December 2009 and on the
information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that
is described as having been audited.

2. Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards. The financial statements have also been
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)
adopted for use in the European Union and therefore
comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on 
the historical cost basis except for certain financial
instruments that are carried at fair value in accordance
with the accounting policies set out below. 
IAS 1 (revised 2007) requires the presentation of a
statement of changes in equity as a primary statement,
separate from the income statement and statement 
of comprehensive income. As a result, a Consolidated
Statement of Changes in Equity has been included 
in the primary statements, showing changes in each
component of equity for each period presented. Further,
IAS 1 requires a third comparative to be included within
Consolidated Balance Sheet (along with supplementary
notes) in the instance that any previously reported
financial information is restated or represented. 
The re-statement of previously reported segmental
information has triggered such a requirement in the
current year.
Critical accounting judgments and key sources 
of estimation uncertainty
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting
policies, management is required to make judgments,
estimates and assumptions that may affect the
financial statements. Management believes that the
judgments made in the preparation of the financial
statements are reasonable. However, actual outcomes
may differ from those anticipated. 
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other
key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance
sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing a
material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities within the next financial year, are
discussed below:
Valuation and asset lives of separately identifiable
intangible assets
In order to determine the value of the separately
identifiable assets on the acquisition of a business 
combination, management are required to make
estimates when utilising the Group’s valuation
methodologies. These methodologies include the use
of discounted cash flows, revenue and profit before
tax multiples. Asset lives are estimated based on the
nature of the intangible asset acquired and range
between 4 and 8 years and indefinite lives.
Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets
There are a number of assumptions management
have considered in performing impairment reviews 
of goodwill and intangible assets, as determining
whether goodwill or intangible assets are impaired
requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash
generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires Directors to
estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from
the cash generating unit and a suitable discount rate
in order to calculate net present value. Note 13 details
the assumptions that have been applied.
Contingent consideration and valuation of put option
Contingent consideration relating to acquisitions has
been included based on management estimates of
the most likely outcome (note 28). Annual Report and Accounts 2009 47
2.Significant accounting policies (continued)
Adjusted results
Management believes that adjusted operating profit
(note 5) and adjusted earnings per share (note 5)
provide additional useful information on underlying
trends to shareholders. These measures are used 
for internal performance analysis and incentive
compensation arrangements for employees. The term
adjusted is not a defined term under IFRS and may
not therefore be comparable with similarly titled profit
measurements reported by other companies. It is not
intended to be a substitute for, or superior to IFRS
measurements of profits. The principal adjustments
made are in respect of:
� Costs of acquisitions – the costs incurred by the
Group in reorganising and integrating acquired
businesses, non-recurring business restructuring,
closure or disposal of businesses and costs
associated with Board level changes;
� Finance income and costs – the costs incurred 
by the Group in reorganising and integrating
acquired businesses banking facilities;
� Amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible
fixed assets and goodwill – the Group continues to
amortise these intangible fixed assets and test for
impairment of these assets but does not see these
charges as integral to underlying trading; and
� Costs of business combinations – IFRS3 (revised) 
to be effective from 1 January 2010 requires
transaction costs, changes in the value of contingent
consideration, settlement of pre-existing contracts
and share-based payments to be expensed,
management do not see these charges as integral
to the underlying trading.
Accounting policies have been applied consistently
between years with the exception of the new
standards or amendments adopted in the year.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the
financial statements of the Company and entities
controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) made up
to 31 December each year. Control is achieved where
the Company has the power to govern the financial
and operating policies of an investee entity so as to
obtain benefits from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and
contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at
their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess
of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the
identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as
goodwill. Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition
below the fair values of the identifiable net assets
acquired (i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited to the
income statement in the period of acquisition. The
interest of minority shareholders is stated at the 
minority’s proportion of the fair values of the assets
and liabilities recognised.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of
during the year are included in the consolidated
income statement from the effective date of acquisition
or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the
financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the
accounting policies used into line with those used by
the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and
expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Going concern
The Directors have, at the time of approving the
financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the
Company and the Group have adequate resources to
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable
future. They continue to adopt the going concern
basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
Further detail is contained in the Corporate Governance
Report on page 21.
Investments in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a
position to exercise significant influence, but not
control or joint control, through participation in the
financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
The results, assets and liabilities of associates are
incorporated in these financial statements using the
equity method of accounting except when classified
as held for sale. Investments in associates are carried
in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-
acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net
assets of the associate, less any impairment in the
value of individual investments. Losses of the
associates in excess of the Group’s interest in those
associates are not recognised, unless the Group has
incurred legal or constructive obligation or made
payments on behalf of the associate. 
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the 
Group’s share of the fair values of the identifiable net
assets of the associate at the date of acquisition is
recognised as goodwill and is included in the carrying
value of the investment. Any deficiency of the cost of
acquisition below the Group’s share of the fair values
of the identifiable net assets of the associate at 
the date of acquisition (i.e. discount on acquisition) 
is credited in the income statement in the period 
of acquisition.
Where a group company transacts with an associate
of the Group, unrealised profits and losses are
eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the
relevant associate. 48 Chime Communications plc

2. Significant accounting policies (continued)
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the
excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s
interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets,
liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed 
for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is
recognised in the income statement and is not
subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary or associate, the attributable
amount of goodwill is included in the determination of
the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of
transition to IFRSs has been retained at the previous
UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for
impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves
under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated
and is not included in determining any subsequent
profit or loss on disposal. 
Future anticipated payments to vendors in respect of
earnouts are based on the Directors’ best estimates 
of future obligations, which are dependent on future
performance of the interests acquired and assume 
the operating companies improve profits in line with
Directors’ estimates and are included in liabilities
greater or less than one year as appropriate. When
earnouts are to be settled in cash or share consideration,
the fair value of the consideration is obtained by
discounting to present value the amounts expected to
be payable in the future. The resulting interest charge
is included within finance costs.
Under IFRS, an impairment charge is required for both
goodwill and other indefinite lived assets when the
carrying amount exceeds the ‘recoverable amount’,
defined as the higher of fair value less costs to sell 
and value in use. Our approach in determining the
recoverable amount utilises a discounted cash flow
methodology, which necessarily involves making
numerous estimates and assumptions regarding
revenue growth, operating margins, tax rates,
appropriate discount rates and working capital
requirements. These estimates will likely differ from
future actual results of operations and cash flows, 
and it is possible that these differences could be
material. In addition, judgements are applied in
determining the level of cash-generating unit we
identify for impairment testing and the criteria we use
to determine which assets should be aggregated.
Segmental reporting 
The Group has adopted IFRS 8 Operating Segments
with effect from 1 January 2009. IFRS 8 requires
operating segments to be identified on the basis of
internal reports about components of the Group that
are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive to
allocate resources to the segments and to assess
their performance. In contrast, the predecessor
Standard (IAS 14 Segment Reporting) required the
Group to identify two sets of segments (business and
geographical), using a risks and returns approach,
with the Group’s system of internal financial reporting
to key management personnel serving only as the
starting point for the identification of such segments. 
As required by IFRS 8 the prior year comparatives have
been restated to reflect the change in management
reporting of the Fast Track Group of companies into a
new Sports Marketing Division. Management created
this new reporting division after the acquisition of the
Essentially Group in October 2009. Management
stated its intention to report this division in the
prospectus made available to Shareholders in October
2009. The Fast Track Group includes Fast Track Sales,
Fast Track Events, Fast Track Sailing, Fast Track
Sports Media Consultancy Espana, Stuart Higgins
Communications and The Sports Business. The Fast
Track Group of companies was previously reported
within the Advertising and Marketing Services division,
it is now included within Sports Marketing. The effect
of this change on the Advertising and Marketing
Division is a decrease in the following for 2008:
revenue £29,531,000 operating income £13,614,000;
operating profit £2,654,000; capital additions
£576,000, depreciation £571,000; segment assets
£45,732,000; segment liabilities £10,337,000.
As required by IAS 1 (Presentation of Financial
Statements) and as a result of a change in previously
reported comparative segmental information
management has provided balance sheets and notes
to the balance sheet for the current year plus the prior
two years, i.e. 2008 and 2007.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the
consideration received or receivable and comprises the
gross amounts billed to clients in respect of fees earned,
expenses recharged and commission-based income. 
Operating income is revenue less amounts payable 
on behalf of clients to external suppliers where 
they are retained to perform part of a specific client
project or service, and represents fees, commissions
and mark-ups on rechargeable expenses and
marketing products. 
Contractual arrangements are reviewed to ascertain
whether the group acts as principal or agent with
regards to third party costs. If the relationship is that
of agent then the recharge of third party costs is not
recognized through revenue or cost of sales. Annual Report and Accounts 2009 49
2. Significant accounting policies (continued)
Revenue recognition (continued)
Revenue and operating income are stated exclusive of
VAT, sales taxes and trade discounts.
Public Relations
Revenue is typically derived from retainer fees and
services performed subject to specific agreement.
Revenue is recognised when the service is performed
in accordance with the contractual arrangement.
Revenue is recognised on long-term contracts
through an assessment of the time incurred to date
compared to the total hours required to complete the
contract, and an assessment of the value delivered to
the client compared to the total value of the contract.
If the outcome of these can be assessed with
reasonable certainty, revenue and related costs are
recognised in the income statement.
Advertising and Marketing Services, Sports Marketing
and Research
Apart from where it is derived from retainer contracts
(as above), operating income is recognised on each
contract in proportion to the level of services performed.
Costs relating to contracts in progress at the balance
sheet date are carried forward in work in progress.
Losses are recognised as soon as they are foreseen.
The Group receives volume rebates from certain
suppliers for transactions entered into on behalf of
clients. Based on the terms of the relevant contracts
and local law these are either remitted to clients or
retained by the Group. If amounts are passed on to
clients they are recorded as liabilities until settled or, 
if retained by the Group, are recorded as revenue
when earned.
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the
terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks
and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other
leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases and the related 
lease obligations are recorded in the balance sheet 
at the fair value of the leased assets at the inception 
of the leases or, if lower, the present value of minimum
lease payments. The excess of the lease payments
over the recorded lease obligations is treated as
finance charges which are amortised over each lease
term to give a constant rate of charge on the remaining
balance of the obligation. Rental costs under operating
leases are charged to the income statement in equal
annual amounts over the periods of the leases.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to
enter into an operating lease are also spread on a
straight-line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in UK companies denominated in
currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at
the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the
transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary
assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign
currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing 
on the balance sheet date. Gains and losses arising
on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for 
the period. Non-monetary items that are measured 
in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are 
not retranslated.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the
Group’s overseas operations are translated at the
exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expenses are translated at the average
exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates
fluctuate significantly. Exchange differences arising, 
if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the
Group’s translation reserve. Such translation reserve
differences are recognised as income or as expenses
in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Translation differences on non-monetary financial
assets and liabilities are reported as part of the fair
value gain or loss. Translation differences on non-
monetary financial assets, such as investments in
equity securities classified as available for sale, are
included in the fair value reserve in equity.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the
acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets 
and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the
closing rate. 
Finance costs
Finance costs which include interest, bank charges
and the unwinding of the discount on deferred
consideration, are recognised in the income statement
in the year in which they are incurred.
Operating profit
Operating profit is stated before the share of results 
of associate, investment income and finance costs. 
Retirement benefit costs 
The pension cost is the amount of contributions
payable by the Group to the defined contribution
pension scheme and to personal pension schemes 
of certain employees during the accounting period.
These are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax
currently payable and deferred tax. 50 Chime Communications plc
Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
Year ended 31 December 2009
2. Significant accounting policies (continued)
Taxation (continued)
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for
the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as
reported in the income statement because it excludes
items of income or expense that are taxable or
deductible in other years and it further excludes items
that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s
liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the
balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or
recoverable on differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in
the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for
using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax
liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable
temporary differences and deferred tax assets are
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable
profits will be available against which deductible
temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets
and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary
difference arises from goodwill or from the initial
recognition (other than in a business combination) of
other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects
neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable
temporary differences arising on investments in
subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint
ventures, except where the Group is able to control
the reversal of the temporary difference and it is
probable that the temporary difference will not reverse
in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is
reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to
the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient
taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of
the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are
expected to apply in the period when the liability is
settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged
or credited in the income statement, except when it
relates to items charged or credited directly to equity,
in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost net
of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided in equal instalments to write
off the cost less residual value over the estimated
useful economic lives of asset type as follows:
Short-term leasehold improvements 5 years
Motor vehicles 6 years
Fixtures, fittings and equipment 4 years
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated 
over their expected useful lives on the same basis 
as owned assets or, where shorter, the term of the
relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset 
is determined as the difference between the sales
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and 
is recognised in the income statement.
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets comprise acquired customer
relationships and contracts, brands and computer
software. Customer relationships and corporate brand
names acquired as part of acquisitions of business are
capitalized separately from goodwill as an intangible if
their value can be measured reliably on initial
recognition and it is probable that the expected future
economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will
flow to the Group. Corporate brands are considered
to have indefinite economic life and are therefore
testing annually for impairment. Computer software is
capitalised based on the cost incurred to acquire and
bring to use the specific software. Intangible assets
are stated at cost net of amortisation and any
provision for impairment. The costs are amortised over
their estimated useful lives using the following rates:
Computer software 4 years
Customer relationships 4 – 8 years
Brand names Indefinite life
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and
intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the
carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets
to determine whether there is any indication that those
assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such
indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset
is estimated in order to determine the extent of the
impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not
generate cash flows that are independent from other
assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount
of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is
tested for impairment annually and whenever there is
an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less
costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in
use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to
their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that
reflects current market assessments of the time value
of money and the risks specific to the asset for which
estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-
generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying
amount, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-
generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. Annual Report and Accounts 2009 51
2. Significant accounting policies (continued)
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and
intangible assets excluding goodwill (continued)
An impairment loss is immediately recognised as an
expense in the income statement.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the
carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is
increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable
amount, but so that the increased carrying amount
does not exceed the carrying amount that would 
have been determined had no impairment loss been
recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in 
prior years.
Work in progress
Work in progress is stated at the lower of invoiced
cost and net realisable value, net of payments
received on account. Cost represents work supplied
from outside the Group awaiting billing to clients at the
year-end and directly attributable overhead costs.
Provisions
Provisions are recognized when the Group has a
present obligation as a result of a past event and it is
probable that the Group will be required to settle that
obligation, and are discounted to present value where
the effect is material.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised
on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes
a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash comprises cash, overdrafts and cash held on
short-term deposit (up to three months). Cash
equivalents are cash deposits held on three months
deposit at the Royal Bank of Scotland plc. The
deposits guarantee the loan note creditors. Interest
accruing on the deposits are payable to the holders 
of the loan notes less any costs arising.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are
stated at their nominal value as reduced by
appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable
amounts. 
Investments
Investments are recognised and derecognised on a
trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment
is under contract whose terms require the delivery of
the investment within the timeframe established by the
market concerned, and are initially measured at cost,
including transaction costs.
Investments are classified either as available for sale,
and are measured at subsequent reporting dates at
fair value, or at amortised cost, where no fair value is
readily determinable. Gains and losses on available for
sale financial assets arising from changes in fair value
are recognised directly in equity, until the security is
disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which
time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised
in equity is included in the net profit or loss for the period.
Bank borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are
recorded at the fair value of proceeds received, net of
direct issue costs.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated
at their nominal value.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are
recorded at the fair value of proceeds received, net of
direct issue costs.
Put options over equity
Put options over equity are held on the balance sheet
at fair value, with movements in fair value being taken
to the income statement.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2
Share-based Payments. IFRS 2 has been applied to
all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002
that were invested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based
payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-
based payments are measured at fair value at the date
of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of
the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based
on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually
vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market based
vesting conditions. Fair value is measured for all
schemes with market-based conditions by use of the
Monte Carlo model. For all other schemes, fair value is
measured by use of the Black-Scholes model. The
expected life used in the model has been adjusted,
based on management’s best estimate, for the effects
of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and
behavioural considerations.
A liability equal to the portion of the goods or services
received is recognised at the current fair value
determined at each balance sheet date for cash-
settled share-based payments. 52 Chime Communications plc

Share-based payments (continued)
The Group also provides employees with the ability to
purchase the Group’s ordinary shares at 80% of the
current market value. The Group records an expense,
based on its estimate of the 20% discount related to
shares expected to vest on a straight-line basis over
the vesting period. Further details are included in note
38 to the accounts.
Standards not affecting the reported results nor
the financial position
The following new and revised Standards and
Interpretations have been adopted in the current year.
Their adoption has not had any significant impact on
the amounts reported in these financial statements but
may impact the accounting for future transactions and
arrangements.

2. Significant accounting policies (continued)
Standards not affecting the reported results nor the financial position (continued)
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have
not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet
been adopted by the EU):
IFRS 1 (amended)/IAS 27 (amended) Cost of an Investment in a Subsidiary, Jointly Controlled 
Entity or Associate
IFRS 3 (revised 2008) Business Combinations
IAS 27 (revised 2008) Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements
IAS 28 (revised 2008) Investments in Associates
IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners
The principal impact of IFRS3 is the requirement to expense legal and professional costs incurred in relation to
acquisitions rather than including within the cost of acquisition.
Other than IFRS3, the Directors do not expect that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future
periods will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.

Diluted earnings per share is calculated on the profit for the year attributable to parent company shareholders
divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year adjusted for the
potentially dilutive impact of employee share incentive schemes and shares to be issued as part of deferred or
contingent consideration on acquisitions of subsidiaries. 
As at 31 December 2009, some share options were outstanding that had a higher purchase price than the
market price of the shares. These options have been excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share
as they would have been antidilutive.
Adjusted earnings per share has been presented to allow shareholders a further understanding of the trading
performance of the Company. The denominators used are the same as those detailed above for both basic and
diluted earnings per share. Annual Report and Accounts 2009 65

In accordance with the Group’s accounting policy, the carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets are
reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset
might be impaired. The 2009 impairment review was undertaken as at 31 December 2009. The review assessed
whether the carrying value of goodwill was supported by the net present value of future cash flows derived from
assets using a projection period of up to five years for each cash-generating unit.  The basis for this is the 2010
budget with growth rates of between 2% and 17%. The 2010 budgets are based on management’s best
estimates taking into account prior period results and industry knowledge. After the projection period, steady
growth has been assumed at rates not exceeding long-term average growth rates for the industry for each cash-
generating unit, with no improvements in operating margin being assumed. An annual growth rate of 2.0% 
(2008 – 2.0%) and a pre-tax discount rate of 12.5% (2008 – 10.4%) have been assumed.
The Board has considered reasonable possible sensitivities. If discount rates were increased by 2%, the carrying
value of goodwill could potentially be impaired by £2.8 million in the Public Relations Division and £0.5 million in
the Advertising and Marketing Services Division or 2.29% of the total. 66 Chime Communications plc

Losses of £0.8 million (2008 – £0.8 million, 2007 – £0.8 million) and $5.4 million in the US (2008 – $5.0 million,
2007 – $4.4 million) have not been recognised in deferred taxation due to insufficient certainty that there will be
appropriate profits available in the future to utilise them. 
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings
of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was £Nil (2008: £1,929,000, 2007:
£1,209,000). No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because dividends paid post 1 July
2009 should fall within the dividend exemption and the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal
of the temporary differences. It is also probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The average credit period taken on provision of services is 50 days (2008 – 50 days, 2007 – 55 days). 
The Group’s trade receivables are stated after allowances for bad and doubtful debts. This allowance has been
determined by considering specific doubtful balances and by reference to past default experience, an analysis of
which is as follows.

23. Trade and other receivables (continued)
The provision for irrecoverable trade receivables relates to debts that are past due and impaired.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value. 
Trade and other receivables are predominantly non-interest bearing. Concentrations of credit risk with respect 
to trade receivables are limited due to the Group’s customer base being large, unrelated and largely billed in
advance. Due to this, the Directors believe there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the
allowance for bad and doubtful debts. For further detail on how the Group manages credit risk see note 41.
24. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and equivalents include £58,172 (2008: £416,055) of cash held as security for cash backed loan notes.
These are held at Royal Bank of Scotland and are redeemable on demand by the loan note holders. 
See note 25 for further details.

The vacant property provision remaining at 31 December 2009 relates to three buildings, one near Heathrow, 
one in Central London and one in Boston, USA. 
The Heathrow building is approximately 12,000 sq ft and the Group has a lease which runs to September 2016.
The current rental cost is £350,000 per annum with upward only rent reviews due in September 2010 and 2015.
The Group has sublet 7,000 sq ft, the remaining 5,000 sq ft is occupied by Group companies. The rental 
income achieved on the sub-let space is lower than the rent currently being paid under the lease. A provision of
£388,000 was made in 2009. The provisions are an estimate of the difference between anticipated income and
costs through to the end of the lease, considering expected movements in the rental market.
The Central London building has a lease that expires in June 2010. The space is currently sub-let and the rental
income achieved is less than currently being paid under the lease. The lease was acquired on the acquisition of
Pelham Public Relations. A provision of £26,000 was made in 2009.
The Boston, USA building is approximately 3,900 sq ft and the Group has a lease which runs to November 2013.
The lease can be terminated in August 2011. The current rental cost is $141,000 per annum with upward only
rental reviews. The Group has sub-let the space, however the rental income achieved on the sub-let space is
lower than the rent currently being paid under the lease. A provision of $250,000 was made in 2009. The
provisions are an estimate of the difference between anticipated income and costs through to the end of the 
lease. Contingent consideration relates to acquisitions made in current and previous years. The amounts payable
are dependent on the future profits of the companies acquired. Further details of the deferred considerations
arising from current year acquisitions are shown in note 35.
The “contingent consideration share” balance comprises shares to be issued in respect of acquisitions and has
been shown as a liability in accordance with IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and Disclosure.
Details of contingent consideration shares to be issued and their basis are disclosed in note 36. The number of
shares to be issued in all instances is based on the current market value prior to the issue of the shares.
Timing of payments of deferred consideration is set out in the relevant Sale and Purchase Agreements.
The Gross obligation under put option has arisen as a result of a shareholders’ agreement with a minority 
interest. The value of the option has been estimated with regards to future profitability of the operation based on
multiples of earnings. 80 Chime Communications plc

38. Share-based payments
Equity-settled share option plan
The Group operates five share plans; an executive
share option scheme, an employee savings related
scheme, a deferred share scheme, a Co-Investment
Plan and the VCCP Partners Scheme.
The exercise price of the options granted under the
executive share option scheme is equal to the market
value of the Group’s shares at the time when the
options are granted. The vesting period is generally
three years but if they are special options it is five
years. If the options remain unexercised after a period
of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire.
Furthermore, options are forfeited if the employee
leaves the Group before the options vest. All
executive options granted from November 1997
(other than special executive options) are subject to
performance criteria as set out in the report to the
shareholders on Directors’ remuneration.
The exercise price of the options granted under the
employee savings related scheme is 80% of the
market value at the date of offer. The vesting period is
five years, if the options remain unexercised six
months after this date, the options expire.
Furthermore, the options are forfeited if the employee
leaves the Group before the options vest.
Under the deferred share scheme, restricted shares
are awarded to employees at no cost to the
employee. The vesting period is fixed at the grant
date by the Remuneration Committee. Currently there
are grants over vesting periods of two, three and
fours years from the date of award. If the employee
leaves the Group before vesting then the restricted
shares are forfeited. The employee receives the
dividend on the shares during the vesting period.
Under the VCCP Incentive Scheme, restricted shares
are awarded to employees at no cost to the
employee. The vesting period is fixed at the grant
date by the Remuneration Committee. Currently there
are grants over a vesting period of fours years from
the date of award. If the employee leaves the Group
within the first two years of grant then the restricted
shares are forfeited. 
The matching shares awarded under the Co-
Investment Plan are awarded to employees at no
cost. The vesting period is either 3.5 years or 4 years
depending on when the award was made. If the
employee leaves the Group before vesting then the
matching shares are forfeited. If the employee
disposes of any of their committed shares then the
matching shares awarded would be reduced
accordingly retrospectively.
The matching shares awarded are subject to
performance criteria as set out in the report to the
shareholders on Directors’ remuneration.

41. Financial Instruments
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, bank overdrafts, finance leases, cash and
short-term deposits. The main purpose of the financial instruments is to provide finance for the Group’s
operations. The Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade
payables, which arise directly from operations. During the year the Group has financed its business through an
overdraft facility and revolving committed facility arranged with the Royal Bank of Scotland plc (note 27).
The Group uses financial instruments to manage its bank borrowings: this is done by the use of foreign
exchange rate swaps. The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for financial trading
purposes but derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments. Derivative
financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value at the contract date and continue to be stated at fair
value at the balance sheet date with gains and losses on revaluation being recognised immediately to the
income statement.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign
currency risk. The policy for managing these risks is reviewed and agreed with the Board.
Interest rate risk: The Group manages its interest rate risk by the use of fixed rate and variable rate financial debt.
Fixed interest rates are for periods of up to three months at a time. The interest rate margins paid by the Group
on financial debt are disclosed in notes 25 and 27. Surplus cash deposits earn interest based on LIBID. The
Group monitors interest rates and assess the risks through sensitivity analysis.
If interest rates had been 1% higher during the period under review the impact to profit before tax would have
been a decrease of £57,690 (2008 – £120,770), conversely if interest rates had been 1% lower during the
period under review, the impact to profit before tax would have been an increase of £57,092 (2008 – £119,645).
The impact on shareholders’ equity would have been £41,537 (2008 – £ 116,025) if interest rates had been
worse by 1%, and £41,106 (2008 – £82,155) if interest rates had been better by 1%.
Liquidity risk: The Group has an agreed committed facility of £30 million with the Royal Bank of Scotland as set
out in note 27. The facility matures in June 2013. There is also an uncommitted facility available of £2 million,
which is reviewed on a rolling basis. The Group had an overdraft facility of £500,000 as at 31 December 2009
with Allied Irish Bank, this was acquired on the acquisition of the Essentially Group Ltd. This was cancelled
during February 2010. The Group also has through its acquisition of Pelham Public Relations an overdraft facility
of £50,000 and a committed facility of £400,000 until April 2015 with HSBC. The Group manages liquidity risk
by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash
flows. At 31 December 2009 the Group had net cash of £4,824,000.
Maturity of borrowings: The maturity profile for the anticipated cash flows including interest in relation to the
Group's borrowings on an undiscounted basis is as follows:
                                                                                                                                                                                                £’000
The borrowings are repayable as follows:
On demand or within one year                                                                                                                                    66
In the second year                                                                                                                                                      80
In the third to fifth year                                                                                                                                              240
After five years                                                                                                                                                            28
                                                                                                                                                                                414
All other financial liabilities are considered current except the financial liability relating to the put option.
Externally imposed capital requirement: Under the terms of the Group’s banking covenants the Group must
meet certain criteria based on interest and dividend cover and net debt to EBITDA. There have been no
breaches of the banking covenants in the current or prior year. 94 Chime Communications plc

41. Financial Instruments (continued)
Foreign currency risk: 
The Group has sixteen overseas subsidiaries which trade in Europe, America, South Africa, Australia, New
Zealand, India and the Middle East. At 31 December 2009 the net foreign currency monetary assets were
£1,316,933 (2008 – £984,352) in America, the net foreign currency monetary liabilities were £2,612,824 (2008 –
£2,351,575) in Europe. The Group has one overseas associate, Meropa Communications (Pty) Limited, which
trades in South Africa. The Group does not hedge this translation exposure to its earnings. 
The Group does on occasion agree to bill clients in a currency other than the local currency; it also makes some
purchases overseas where the supplier bills in their local currency. The Group does not hedge the translation
exposure on the fees due to the Company. The Group converts any fees received in foreign currency on receipt
on funds. In some instances where it is viewed appropriate, the proceeds from the client are kept in currency so
as to minimise the foreign exchange exposure on the transaction if there are third party costs to be paid out of
the funds in that currency. In this instance the Group uses short-term foreign exchange swaps to manage the
Group’s borrowings. The fair value of the swaps entered into at 31 December 2009 is estimated at £6,010
(2008 – £29,973). There were two swaps open over the year end. This amount is based on the market values of
equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date. 
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to reasonably possible changes in the US Dollar and Euro
exchange rates on the net foreign currency monetary assets, with all other variables held constant, on the
Group’s profit before tax.

Capital risk management: The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to
continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt
and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings
discussed in note 27, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent,
comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 29 to 32 and the Consolidated
Statement of Movement in Equity.

Market price risk: the Group’s exposure to market price risk comprises interest rate risk and currency rate risk.
The Group regularly monitors these exposures which, setting aside the interrelationships between such rates
and their wider impact on the economy, are not considered to have a significant impact on the Group. 
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities: Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument can
be exchanged in an arm’s length transaction between informed and willing parties, other than a forced or
liquidation sale.
The following table provides a comparison of the book values and the fair value of the Group’s financial liabilities
and assets as at 31 December 2009:

Further details of the ageing of trade receivables can be found in note 23 to the financial statements.
The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties. Customers who wish to trade on credit terms
are generally subject to credit verification procedures. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an
ongoing basis with the result that the Group’s exposure to bad debts has not been significant.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Group’s customer base
being large and unrelated.
With respect to credit risk arising from other financial assets of the Group, which comprises cash and cash
equivalents, the Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum amount
of exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.
Gross obligations under put options
The Gross obligation under put option has arisen as a result of a shareholders’ agreement with a minority
interest. The fair value of the option is a level 3 fair value measurement, and has been estimated with regards to
future profitability of the operation based on multiples of earnings. If growth rates used are sensitised by + 10%
the impact on the Group’s profit before tax would be a decrease of £159,000 (2008: N/A), conversely if growth
rates used are sensitised by –10% the impact on the Group’s profit before tax would be an increase of 
£235,000 (2008: N/A).
There were no transfers between fair value levels during 2009 or 2008.
42. Post balance sheet events
On 15 January 2010 the Group successfully completed a placing of 2,250,000 new ordinary shares of 25p each
at a premium of 175p.The placing was fully underwritten by Numis Securities Limited.
On 20 January 2010 the Group paid the consideration due on the purchase of Pelham Public Relations Limited.
The fair value of the consideration given for the acquisition was £3,400,000; this was satisfied as to £1.8 million
in cash and £200,000 by the issue of 100,000 new ordinary shares of 25p each at a premium of 175p and 40%
of the ordinary share capital of Bell Pottinger Corporate & Financial, valued at £1,400,000.
On 10 March 2010 the Group completed its acquisition of Tree (London) Limited from Cagney Plc. The fair value
of the consideration given for the acquisition was £2,000,000, this was satisfied in cash. A full fair value exercise
in respect of this acquisition has yet to be completed and full details will be provided in the interim report for the
period ended 30 June 2010. 98 Chime Communications plc

Notes to the Company financial statements
Year ended 31 December 2009
1. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The separate financial statements of the Company
are drawn up in accordance with the Companies Act
1985 and United Kingdom generally accepted
accounting principles (“UK GAAP”). The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. The estimates and underlying
assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in
the period in which the estimate is revised if the
revision affects only that period or in the period of the
revision and future periods if the revision affects both
current and future periods.
The particular accounting policies adopted are
described below. They have all been applied
consistently throughout the year and the prior year. 
The financial statements are prepared on a going
concern basis as explained in the Directors’ Report.
Cash flow
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption
contained in FRS 1 “Cash flow statements” and has
not produced a cash flow statement.
Financial instruments
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption
contained in FRS 29 “Financial Instruments:
Disclosures” and has not produced any disclosures
required by that standard, as full FRS 29 disclosures
are available in Chime Communications Plc Annual
Report for the year ended 31 December 2009.
Related parties 
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption
contained in FRS 8 “Related party disclosures” and
has not reported transactions with fellow Group
undertakings.
Accounting convention
The financial statements are prepared under the
historical cost convention.
Investments
In the Company’s accounts, investments in
subsidiary and associate undertakings are stated at
cost less provision for any impairment in value.
Deferred consideration
When earnouts are to be settled in cash or shares
with a fixed monetary value, the fair value of the
consideration is obtained by discounting to present
value the amounts expected to be payable in the
future. The resulting interest charge is included within
finance costs of deferred consideration.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities, in respect of
financial instruments, are recognised on the balance
sheet when the Company becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by
the Company are classified according to the
substance of the contractual arrangements entered
into and the definitions of a financial liability and an
equity instrument. An equity instrument is any
contract that evidences a residual interest in the
assets of the Company after deducting all of its
liabilities and includes no obligation to deliver cash or
other financial assets. Equity instruments issued by
the Company are recorded at the proceeds received,
net of direct issue costs. 
Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of equity settled share
based compensation plans for the employees of
subsidiary undertakings, using the Company’s equity
instruments. The fair value of the compensation
given in respect of these share-based compensation
plans is recognised as a capital contribution to the
Company’s subsidiary undertakings, over the vesting
period. The capital contribution is reduced by any
payments received from subsidiary undertakings in
respect of these share-based payments.
Dividends paid or received
Dividends paid and received are included in the
financial statements in the period in which the related
dividends are actually paid or received or, in respect
of the Company’s final dividend for the year,
approved by shareholders.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, which include these
of the Company, together with the factors likely to
affect its future development, performance and
position are set out in The Chairman’s Statement on
pages 2 to 5. The financial position of the Group, its
cash flows and borrowing facilities are described in
the Finance Director’s Report on pages 8 and 9. 
In addition, notes 41 of the consolidated financial
statements include the Group’s objectives, policies Annual Report and Accounts 2009 101
and processes for managing its capital; its financial
risk management objectives and details of its
financial instruments; and its exposure to credit risk
and liquidity risk.
As highlighted in note 41 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Group meets its day to day working
capital requirements through an overdraft facility that
is due for renewal in June 2010 and a committed
facility which matures in June 2013. These facilities
are subject to banking covenants as disclosed in
note 41 to the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing forecasts the Directors have taken into
account the following key factors:
� the possible impact of the continued economic
downturn on the Group’s business;
� key client account renewals;
� the level of committed and variable costs; and
� current new business targets compared to levels
achieved in previous years.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking
account of reasonably possible changes in trading
performance, show that the Group should be able to
operate within the level of its current facility and
banking covenants. 
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the
Company and the Group have adequate resources
to continue in operational existence for the
foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the
going concern basis of accounting in preparing the
annual financial statements.
More detail on the Group’s cash position and
facilities at 31 December 2009, as well as maturities
of the financial liabilities, can be found in note 27 to
the consolidated financial statements. The principal
risks and uncertainties faced by the Group are
included in the Directors Report. Details of potential
contingent liabilities and potential cash outflows in
relation to these liabilities can be found in note 36 to
the consolidated financial statements. 
2. Profit of parent company
As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the income statement of the parent company is not
presented as part of these accounts. The parent company’s profit for the financial year amounted to £9,982,000
(2008 – £6,318,000).
3. Equity dividends
The equity dividends paid by the Company are disclosed in note 11 of the consolidated financial statements.

MEXICO FACILITY RE-OPENS
Following a fire at our Mexican 
Aerospace facility in October 2014, 
much of 2015 was focused on getting 
this factory back on track. Thanks to the 
efforts of our team in Mexico, the first 
customer delivery was made two 
weeks after the incident, while still 
operating in a much reduced capacity. 
New equipment arrived during the first 
half of 2015 and following extensive 
building work, the building was 
re-opened in October 2015.
THE GROUP OPENS FOUR  
NEW FACILITIES
In February 2015, the Group opened a 
new 39,000 sq. ft. facility within close 
proximity to Boeing South Carolina, 
which will operate as an extension to 
Senior Aerospace AMT. The first phase 
of expansion into a new 196,000 sq. ft. 
factory in Thailand was completed during 
the year and phase two construction is 
well underway. At SSP, the construction 
of a new additional 59,000 sq. ft. 
production facility was completed during 
the year. The Group has opened a new 
26,000 sq. ft. facility in India to support 
the manufacture of EGR coolers for a 
blue-chip customer.

We were pleased to report this year that 
the Group’s environmental improvements 
were recognised for the depth and 
quality of climate change data it has 
disclosed to investors and the global 
marketplace through CDP, the 
international NGO, formerly known as 
the Carbon Disclosure Project that drives 
sustainable economies. Senior’s efforts 
were recognised when it was included

Attending the Management & Leadership,

programmes, has been an integral factor  
in achieving my goal. Overall, I am a big 
believer in the benefits of developing 
people and am thankful that Senior 
supported me with this investment. ”
STRONG ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT
The Group benefits from having empowered, 
entrepreneurial and highly engaged local 
management. Our business leaders appreciate 
the autonomous environment which they 
operate in, within a suitable governance and 
control framework. They are also increasingly 
collaborating across the business. This 
culture of empowerment and autonomous 
collaboration, along with the strong reputation of 
the Group helps attract and retain experienced 
senior executives from within the industry. 
VALUES
Senior’s values of safety, integrity, customer 
focus, respect and trust, accountability, and 
excellence along with entrepreneurial spirit 
guide our people in the judgements, actions 
and decisions they make each day. This is 
underpinned by our “tell it as it is” philosophy. 
Senior’s long term goals are underpinned 
by an absolute commitment to the highest 
standards of safety and ethics and to 
developing talent across the organisation.

DEVELOPING OUR PEOPLE 
The Group’s employees are one of its 
most valuable assets and the delivery of 
our strategy depends on the right people, 
skills and capabilities being in place. Talent 
development and succession planning is a 
key priority for our business and the Group 
is increasing focus in this area with the 
recruitment of a Group HR Director. 
To operate at the highest levels we need to 
invest in our people wherever they are located 
and whatever role they hold. Our extensive 
training and development programmes are 
designed to help them learn new skills, 
refine existing ones and progress internally. 
Each of Senior’s businesses is responsible for 
continuously developing its people and the skills 
and training needs of employees are typically 
reviewed through a performance review and 
development process. There are a range of 
personal development opportunities at local 
level including, specific job-related skills and 
vocational and professional qualifications.
The Group is also working closely with 
educational bodies and schools to promote 
Science, Technology, Engineering and 
Mathematics subjects at an early age, and is 
partnering with universities to promote our 
graduate opportunities and attract more 
talented young people. For example, Senior 
Flexonics Blois has entered into a partnership

with a number of local technical and 
engineering schools to provide placement 
for graduates, technicians and apprentices. 
In 2015, the partnership won the regional 
collaboration award. Many of our businesses 
have also entered into long-standing 
apprenticeship schemes, partnering with local 
education organisations to provide practical 
work experience to young people. The high 
standard of our schemes has resulted in a 
number of Senior apprentices winning national 
and regional apprenticeship awards.
GROUP DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME 
In addition to local training and development, 
Senior operates a Group Development 
Programme which seeks to develop mid- to 
senior-level managers so that they acquire the 
broader skills essential to operate at higher 
management levels. In 2015, Senior introduced 
an Operational Excellence module to its Group 
Development Programme to develop a greater 
understanding of some of the best practice 
tools and techniques of operations management. 
The Group Development Programme enables 
employees from different businesses to learn 
together and create a common culture. Since 
its introduction, 554 employees have received 
training on the programme. Employee 
development, together with a renewed 
emphasis on succession planning, will remain 
an important focus for the Group in the future.
DIVERSITY 
As an international Group, with 7,472 people 
working globally, we are committed to 
attracting, developing and retaining the best 
people from different backgrounds and cultures, 
creating a dynamic workforce that can apply 
diverse perspectives and backgrounds to 
competitive advantage. We believe a diverse 
workforce enhances innovation and are keen to 
improve age, gender and ethnic diversity across 
our businesses. Senior’s employment policies 
are non-discriminatory, complying with all current 
legislation to engender equal opportunity 
irrespective of age, race, gender, ethnic origin, 
nationality, religion, health, disability, marital status, 
sexual preference, political or philosophical 
opinions or trade union membership.

STATEMENT
2015 PERFORMANCE
Senior delivered a solid performance in 2015 
against the backdrop of difficult market 
conditions, particularly on the industrial side 
of the business. Adjusted profit before tax 
decreased to £99.3m, down 3%, or 6% on 
a constant currency basis, over the prior year. 
This was mainly due to gains in the Aerospace 
Division being more than offset by significant 
declines in the Flexonics Division reflecting 
the challenging market conditions resulting 
from global uncertainty in the oil and gas, 
commodity and industrial sectors.
Group cash generation remains strong, with 
free cash flow of £51.7m for the year resulting 
in a strong financial position for the Group at 
the end of 2015. 
DIVIDEND
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 
4.36 pence per share which would bring  
total dividends, paid and proposed, for 2015  
to 6.20 pence per share. The increase of  
10% over 2014 despite the decrease in 
adjusted earnings per share reflects  
the Group’s encouraging medium-term 
prospects and dividend cover of 3.1 times.
GOVERNANCE
The Board recognises the importance of 
setting the right tone from the top of the 
organisation, and for this reason has been 
encouraged by the work undertaken in 2015 
to update key policies such as the Senior Code 
of Conduct as part of a holistic corporate 
framework. The Board has continued to 
maintain oversight of capital allocation, 
performance and risk management. During 
2015, significant improvements were made to 
the Group’s risk management processes and 
these have been explained on pages 26 to 31 
of this Annual Report.
SAFETY
As a Board we are committed to the safety  
and well-being of our employees. Our goal is to 
eliminate occupational injury and illness through 
our Zero Harm strategy so everyone returns 
home safely at the end of the day. It is with 
great sadness, therefore, to report on two 
deaths that occurred in 2015 from activities 
closely associated with Senior. A sub-contractor 
died while working on the construction of the 
Group’s new facility in India and in December 
an engineer was fatally injured while working 
for our Chinese joint venture. Following both of 
these incidents, a comprehensive investigation 
was conducted and a series of corrective 
actions have been implemented and the 
lessons shared across the Group. 
SUSTAINABILITY
Environmental stewardship and corporate 
responsibility are values core to Senior and 
performance in these areas is increasingly 
important to our investors, customers and 
employees. As the Group expands, the 
responsibility to improve the environmental 
performance and strengthen the focus on 
safety within newly acquired businesses is  
a key operational aim. During 2015, the Group 
has increased its efforts in this area and has 
developed a new 20/20 Vision which outlines 
our approach to Sustainability for the next five 
years. Consequently, this year’s Annual Report 
includes an expanded Corporate Responsibility 
section outlining all of the key themes and 
actions which underpin our 20/20 Vision.
ACQUISITIONS
As well as growing organically, Senior 
seeks to increase shareholder value through 
the acquisition of capabilities adjacent to its 
existing portfolio. 
This strategy continued in 2015 with the 
acquisition of Lymington Precision Engineering 
(“LPE”) and Steico Industies Inc., (“Steico”).

STRATEGIC REPORT STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
LPE represents an excellent addition to 
Senior’s portfolio, strengthening the Group’s 
precision machining capabilities and providing 
access to LPE’s strong customer relationships 
and adjacent markets. 
Steico represents an important addition to 
Senior’s Aerospace Division, broadening our 
product offering and enabling Senior to respond 
to our customers’ desire for us to offer more 
complete fluid systems work packages. The 
Board is delighted to welcome the employees 
of both businesses to the Group.
THE BOARD
Mark Rollins retired from the Board on 
31 May 2015 after 17 years with the Group 
including seven years as Chief Executive. Mark 
made an outstanding contribution to Senior 
during his time with the Group, and on behalf 
of the Board, I would like to thank him for his 
dedicated and successful service to Senior and 
to wish him all the very best for a long and 
fulfilling retirement. 
In May 2015, David Squires joined the Group  
as Chief Executive-designate, before taking 
over as Group Chief Executive on 1 June 2015. 
I am extremely pleased to have David on the 
team and have already observed the benefits 
of his depth and breadth of experience, 
following 25 years in the global aerospace and 
defence industry, working in both developing 
and larger organisations.
I am also pleased to welcome Susan Brennan 
to Senior, as a non-executive Director. 
Susan Brennan is Chief Operations Officer at 
Bloom Energy Corporation, a leading developer 
of solid oxide fuel cell technology based in 
Sunnyvale, California. Susan has more than 
25 years of manufacturing experience, including 
automotive vehicle, powertrain and components 
assembly. She served as VP of Manufacturing 
at Nissan North America, Inc. and as Director 
of global manufacturing at Ford, where she led 
a global business office for Ford’s assembly, 
powertrain and stamping plants.
Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to 
thank Andy Hamment for his contribution to 
Senior. Andy has decided to retire from the 
Board after the conclusion of the Company’s 
AGM on 22 April 2016.
EMPLOYEES
Senior’s continued strength is a reflection 
of the quality of the people within the Group. 
Senior now employs over 7,400 people with 
around 1,300 located in Asia, demonstrating 
the ever-increasing global nature of the 
Group. On behalf of the Board, I would like 
to thank all of the Group’s employees for their 
significant contribution to Senior’s success 
over the past year.
STRATEGY
The Group’s primary performance objective 
is to create long-term sustainable growth in 
shareholder value. It aims to achieve this 
objective through the development of a 
portfolio of collaborative high value-added 
engineering manufacturing companies within 
its five market sector framework: three in 
the Aerospace Division (Fluid Conveyance 
Systems, Gas Turbine Engines and Structures) 
and two in the Flexonics Division (Land Vehicle 
Emission Control and Industrial Process 
Control), with each strategic market sector 
offering deliverable growth opportunities. 
The Group’s strategy has proven to be 
successful over recent years and, whilst 
evolving as the Group gets larger and market 
conditions change, it continues to provide  
a solid foundation for the Group’s future 
growth aspirations.

Senior plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015  9 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S 
STATEMENT
Since joining the Group on 1 May 2015 and 
succeeding Mark Rollins as Group CEO on 
1 June 2015, I have immersed myself in 
the business and spent time with many 
stakeholders including customers, investors, 
our leadership teams and other employees 
across the Group from shop floor to 
boardroom. Since last May I have visited all 
33 operating businesses across the 14 
countries in which we operate. As intended, 
this has given me a clear understanding of 
our business. What I discovered as I visited 
our operations was confirmation of my 
expectations as I joined Senior: I was joining 
a company that was already well run and 
therefore the primary focus would be on 
enhancing a business that is well positioned for 
the future, rather than having to completely 
transform the organisation. That said, there is 
much to do to ensure that the Group continues 
to grow sustainably, maintains and improves 
its competitiveness and meets our customers’ 
demands for ever-improving levels of 
operational excellence. 
I will comment more on the work which the 
Executive Leadership Team has been doing 
since I joined, but first let me comment on 
the 2015 results.
OVERVIEW OF 2015 RESULTS
Senior delivered a solid set of results in 2015 
given the challenging conditions in some of 
our end markets. 
Group revenue increased by 3.5% to £849.5m. 
This included a favourable exchange impact of 
£24.9m and the beneficial incremental impact 
from three acquisitions of £25.4m. Excluding 
the year-on-year effect of acquisitions, Group 
revenue from organic operations was down 
£21.6m on a constant currency basis. The 
overall organic revenue decline was primarily 
due to gains within the Aerospace Division 
that were more than offset by declines in the 
Flexonics Division, reflecting the challenging 
market conditions faced by the truck and 
off-highway and industrial businesses.
Adjusted operating profit decreased by £3.8m 
(3.4%) to £107.8m, with the Group achieving 
an adjusted operating margin of 12.7%. This 
included a favourable exchange impact of 
£3.9m and £1.6m of year-on-year operating 
profit contributed by acquisitions. Adjusted 
operating profit from organic operations 
decreased by 8.1% on a constant currency 
basis, excluding the effect of acquisitions and 
exchange movements. As previously disclosed, 
margins were impacted during the year by 
volume reductions on mature programmes, 
such as the A330, lower profits on aluminium 
revert prices, temporary activities to protect 
customer schedules and volume reductions in 
the off-highway, power and energy markets.
In challenging market conditions, it is important 
to balance the desire to cut costs with 
maintaining appropriate production capacity. 
The Group diligently implemented a number 
of cost reduction actions during the year, 
particularly within the Flexonics Division. These 
included: transferring work to competitive cost 
countries, implementing furloughs at specific 
factories, reducing Flexonics headcount from 
3,057 to 2,783 and curbing non-essential 
discretionary spending.

customer relationships and 
global footprint”

STRATEGIC REPORT STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
The Group continues to generate healthy cash 
flow and delivered free cash inflow of £51.7m 
after gross investment in capital expenditure of 
£48.6m. This investment in capital equipment 
is essential in our business to meet increasing 
levels of demand that are being communicated 
to us by our Aerospace customers. The level of 
net debt at the end of December 2015 was 
£194.6m and the ratio of net debt to EBITDA 
was 1.4x, within the Group’s normal target 
range of 0.5x to 1.5x and comfortably below 
the Group’s bank covenant level of 3.0x. The 
Group is financially strong and is able to fund 
future organic and acquisitive growth.
Recognising the underlying strength of the 
business and its future prospects, the Board 
is proposing a final dividend of 4.36 pence 
per share. This would bring total dividends, 
paid and proposed for 2015 to 6.20 pence 
per share, representing an increase of 10% 
over the prior year.
STRATEGY
The Group’s overall strategy remains 
unchanged. Demand for large commercial 
aircraft remains robust with Boeing and Airbus 
having record nine-year orderbooks. Trends in 
world air traffic are positive and are forecast 
to remain so. In addition, new platforms in 
military, regional and business jet markets, 
combined with increasing shipset content, will 
help propel future growth. While exposure to 
certain markets in our Flexonics Division poses 
near-term challenges, we are confident of the 
long-term attractiveness of these end markets 
and in particular of the many growth 
opportunities with existing and new customers 
in this sector. It is our intention to retain the 
balance between Aerospace and Flexonics and 
to grow both segments of our business. Of 
course, from time to time it is appropriate to 
review the portfolio of the Group and where 
necessary specific disposals or mergers of 
operations will be considered.
Over the past six months, the Executive 
Leadership Team has undertaken a strategic 
assessment of the business and has developed 
goals and priorities which have been reviewed, 
discussed and agreed with the Board. These 
strategic priorities are set out below:
1.  Enhance Senior’s Autonomous and 
Collaborative Business Model.
2. Focus on Growth.
3.  Introduce a High Performance 
Operating System.
4. Competitive Cost Country Strategy.
5.  Considered and Effective Capital Deployment.
6. Talent Development.
To complement these strategic goals and 
priorities, we have defined the core values 
which underpin the culture we aim to nurture in 
Senior. At a practical governance level we have 
updated key policies, such as the Senior Code 
of Conduct, as part of a holistic Corporate 
Framework. These updated policies are being 
implemented with training for all appropriate 
employees during the first half of 2016.
SUMMARY
I am excited about the future of Senior plc. 
Of course, there are some near-term challenges 
in some of our cyclical industrial and land vehicle 
markets – we are monitoring these carefully 
and responding accordingly. In Aerospace, 
order books for large commercial aircraft have 
never been higher, extending to more than 
nine years. Anyone who has flown in the most 
modern aircraft, will know that it is not just 
greater fuel efficiency that is driving record 
levels of new aircraft deliveries; it is also 
demand from increasingly knowledgeable 
passengers for greater levels of comfort and 
a better overall flying experience. When one 
considers that one in two of the world’s 
population has never travelled by air, then it is 
reasonable to conclude that the decades’ long 
growth experienced in this industry is set to 
continue for many more years. In all of our 
markets we work with truly world-class 
companies, leaders in their sectors; we will 
maintain an ever closer dialogue about their 
present and future requirements so we can 
tailor our investments accordingly.

MARKET CONDITIONS
Aerospace markets continue to be generally 
buoyant while land vehicle and industrial 
markets remain challenging.
The production ramp-up of new engine option 
single aisle and wide-body aircraft means the 
outlook for the large commercial aerospace 
sector is both strong and visible. Airbus has 
announced that they are planning to increase 
single aisle aircraft production to a rate of 60 per 
month in 2019 and Boeing has announced a 
similar increase to a rate of 57 in 2019. Airbus 
has already delivered their first A320neo in 
January 2016 while Boeing successfully 
completed the first flight of their 737 MAX 
with LEAP 1B engines.
The Group is a supplier to all of the major 
aero-engine manufacturers and will benefit 
in particular from additional content on the 
new CFM International LEAP engines, the 
Pratt  & Whitney Geared Turbo Fan engines, 
as well as the Rolls-Royce Trent 1000, Trent 
7000 and XWB engines.
In the Flexonics Division, progress continues 
with the development of Senior’s EGR cooler 
offering, with product on test with a number 
of potential new customers. Overall volumes 
in heavy-duty trucks increased in 2015 although 
growth slowed in the second half of the year 
and is expected to decline in 2016. The 
off-highway sector has been weak in 2015 
and remains so in the early months of 2016. 
Passenger vehicle demand in Europe was 
strong through 2015 and into 2016.
The Petrochemical market remains uncertain. 
The direct impact of lower oil prices can be 
seen from the equipment destocking evident 
across the sector, thus reducing activity at 
LPE and Upeca Flexonics. As this destocking 
completes we can expect some recovery in 
demand with fuller recovery once oil prices 
recover to a stable level.
OUTLOOK
2016 has started much as 2015 ended with 
mixed trading conditions across our end 
markets. In Aerospace we expect further 
revenue growth in 2016 with a stronger profit 
in the second half, driven by increasing 
revenues and the operational improvements 
we are implementing across the Division. 
However, challenging market conditions in 
some of our Flexonics markets, including truck 
and off-highway and oil and gas, mean that the 
outlook for Flexonics remains uncertain. Whilst 
the Group will continue with its focus on cost 
management and efficiency initiatives, these 
challenging conditions are expected to 
outweigh progress in the Aerospace Division. 
Looking further ahead, the Board believes 
Senior remains well positioned to make good 
progress. Senior has established a global 
footprint which is providing opportunities 
to increase market share and deliver strong 
organic growth. New aerospace programmes 
are entering production, whilst build rates on 
key existing platforms are increasing, thus 
providing opportunities for improvements in 
operational efficiency. Staying focused on 
customer alignment, operational excellence 
and investing in organisational capability and 
leadership talent will enable Senior to continue 
to grow organically over the longer-term. 
Furthermore, Senior’s cash- generative nature 
and robust financial position provide a solid 
platform from which the Group can continue 
to pursue growth opportunities to complement 
its existing portfolio.

Senior plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015  13 MARKET OVERVIEW  
CONTINUED
AEROSPACE KEY MARKETS
Large Commercial Aircraft (40% of Group)
Senior continues to enjoy strong demand from 
the large commercial aircraft sector, where 
order books are at record levels, representing 
a healthy nine years’ production at current build 
rates. Senior has healthy shipset content on all 
the key large commercial aircraft platforms and 
will benefit from expected increases in build 
rates of all the key platforms. Senior has also 
secured significantly higher content on the new 
engine versions of the leading narrow-bodied 
aircraft than the current versions, thus allowing 
the Group to outgrow the market, as these 
new engine versions come into service and 
production ramps up. 
The charts below illustrate the growth in 
Senior’s shipset values over the past nine years 
and the estimated annual production volumes 
of the major platforms.
Forecast annual growth in global passenger 
air traffic is the key driver of demand for new 
commercial aircraft, and hence for many of 
Senior’s core aerospace products.
Regional and Business Jets (8% of Group)
The Group’s regional jet market revenue (3% 
of Group) is expected to benefit in the medium 
term as new platforms come to market, such 
as the Bombardier CSeries, Mitsubishi MRJ 
and Embraer E2-Jet. Senior has significantly 
higher shipset content on these new platforms 
than legacy regional jets. Customer deliveries 
of the CSeries are expected to commence in 
2016, whilst the MRJ and E2-Jets are 
anticipated to enter into service from 2018.
Senior’s business jet revenue (5% of Group) 
comes mainly from the larger sized business 
jets which are facing some challenging markets 
in the short term. The recent acquisition of 
Steico brings additional content to the Group on 
platforms such as HondaJet, which commenced 
customer deliveries in December 2015, and 
Bombardier Global 7000 and 8000, which is 
anticipated to enter into service from 2018. 
Military Aerospace (13% of Group)
The Group’s revenue from the military and 
defence sector is expected to benefit from the 
A400M reaching full rate production in 2016 
and the Joint Strike Fighter, which is scheduled 
to ramp-up significantly between now and end 
of the decade. Additionally, European and US 
defence budgets are starting to rise as a result 
of increased geo-political tensions.

FLEXONICS KEY MARKETS
Land Vehicles (16% of Group)
Demand for the majority of the Group’s products 
in the land vehicles market is linked to the 
increasingly stringent global requirements for 
reduced carbon emissions. This arises in the 
form of reduction targets for emissions from 
cars, trucks and off-highway vehicles and through 
increased fuel efficiency from their engines. 
The chart below highlights the deployment of 
emissions standards in major geographies.
In the truck and off-highway sector (10% of 
Group), Senior’s revenue arises predominantly 
from North American markets, where markets 
are expected to remain challenging in the near 
term. Production of North American heavy-duty 
diesel trucks is forecast to decline significantly 
in 2016 as a result of the overall industrial 
slowdown coupled with higher inventory levels. 
However, production is anticipated to improve 
in the medium to longer term as demand for 
replacement capacity is driven by regulatory 
changes. The off-highway market, particularly 
for agricultural and mining vehicles, is expected 
to remain weak in 2016 from the indirect 
impacts of lower oil and commodity prices. 
In the passenger car sector (6% of Group), 
Senior’s revenue arises predominantly from 
European markets. This market sector is 
forecast to grow in the medium to longer term 
as illustrated in the chart below.
In the medium to longer term, demand for the 
Group’s products in these sectors is anticipated 
to increase as a result of growth in GDP and as 
emissions regulations continue to tighten, 
particularly in geographies outside of North 
America and Europe. Senior is developing new 
heat exchanger and other exhaust gas recycling 
solutions for the next generation of heavy-duty 
diesel engines, as well as mid to smaller range 
engines and alternative energy applications. 
The Group is also pursuing potential growth 
opportunities in a number of emerging markets.
Industrial (15% of Group)
Senior designs and manufactures products 
for global industrial process control markets 
including petrochemical, HVAC and power 
and energy markets, to meet an increasingly 
stringent regulatory environment. In the near 
term, industrial markets, particularly oil and gas 
related, are continuing to be impacted by the 
decline in oil prices as investment in the sector 
is reduced or postponed, compounded by 
destocking across the sector.
Over the longer term, projected increases in 
global energy usage, tightening emission 
control regulations and emerging changes in 
power generation will drive increased global 
demand for the Group’s industrial products.

Senior plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015  17 AREAS OF STRATEGIC FOCUS 
The following six areas of specific strategic focus have been identified as key 
elements of our business model, which will drive the creation of shareholder 
value. They will receive specific attention and focus over the coming years.
 
01 
ENHANCE SENIOR’S AUTONOMOUS AND 
COLLABORATIVE BUSINESS MODEL
Senior’s business model is one of empowering 
and holding accountable individual businesses, 
operating within a clearly defined divisional 
structure, to develop and deliver business plans 
in line with overall Group strategy. This allows 
Senior to retain an entrepreneurial spirit as 
it grows, which in turn enables innovative 
solutions to be developed for our customers 
and agility in decision-making and delivery. 
At the same time, a strong control framework 
ensures disciplined governance is maintained. 
The control framework is continuously 
improved, taking account of changing legislation, 
regulations and best practices. Increasing 
collaboration amongst business in the Group 
is a priority to ensure economies of scale are 
realised whilst maintaining the autonomous 
business structure. Business leaders throughout 
Senior are actively embracing collaboration 
activities with priorities set at Group level in 
consultation with the operating units.
OUR PLANS FOR 2016
•  Implement engagement guidelines 
to help optimise the transfer of work 
to cost competitive locations and to 
facilitate higher level solutions to 
meet customer needs
•  Appoint key customer account 
managers to facilitate greater 
customer intimacy and alignment and 
leverage cross-selling opportunities
•  Engender a deeper culture of shared 
practice and know-how across the 
Group by tailoring the management 
incentive scheme to encourage 
further collaboration
•  Roll out Group-wide interactive 
communication tools and processes 
to facilitate further collaboration
02 
 
FOCUS ON GROWTH
Senior’s end markets grow naturally at around 4% 
through the cycle. We believe it is possible to 
outgrow our end markets and we seek to do that 
both organically and through acquisition by:
• growing market share, particularly with 
key customers; 
• focusing on innovation; 
• geographical expansion; and
• seeking out and exploiting 
adjacent opportunities. 
Our operating businesses are increasingly 
working together to ensure we remain aligned 
to our customers. There is much more we can 
do in this area and plans are being developed to 
leverage our natural strengths between specific 
operating businesses and specific customers. 
There are opportunities for higher level products 
and sub-systems to be offered to customers 
through the combined resources and capabilities 
of two or more operating businesses. This is 
underway where it makes sense to do so.
Technology road maps are being developed, 
taking account of customer feedback regarding 
their future requirements. Our manufacturing 
expertise is highly regarded and we aim to stay 
at the forefront by tracking and investing in 
advanced manufacturing methods and the use 
of advanced materials. This is an area that is 
receiving additional focus moving forward.
Geographically, our markets in Europe and North 
America remain compelling, however Asia still 
represents the largest incremental growth region 
for the Group. We are aggressively and 
proactively pursuing our opportunities in Asia. 
We will continue to supplement organic growth 
with acquisitive growth, retaining our pragmatic 
approach to identifying and executing transactions 
that will enhance capability across the Group. An 
integration playbook has been developed and is 
now being deployed to ensure that post acquisition 
integration is effective for both Senior and the 
acquired businesses. Integration progress will 
be reviewed regularly by the Executive Leadership 
Team. The same new robust business review 
process that is being introduced for the existing 
portfolio will also apply to all acquisitions.
OUR PLANS FOR 2016
•  Further increase our levels of 
customer intimacy and alignment; 
introduce key customer account 
managers

INTRODUCE A HIGH PERFORMANCE 
OPERATING SYSTEM
Senior is implementing a high performance 
operating system of its own, drawing on the 
many excellent practices from individual 
operating units across the Group. The key 
elements of this system include: 
1.  An operational toolkit readily available to 
all businesses incorporating: best practice 
processes such as lean and continuous 
improvement techniques; supplier management 
and development processes; engineering, 
new product introduction (NPI) and project 
management processes; 5/6S methodology; 
factory visual management systems as well 
as other operational areas such as risk 
management and financial management.
2.  A strengthened business review process at 
operating business, Division and Group levels 
utilising a balanced scorecard incorporating 
KPIs that are relevant for each operating 
business. The focus of the business review 
process is on performance, growth, operational 
excellence and talent development.
OUR PLANS FOR 2016
•  Introduce best practice operational 
toolkit and processes
•  Introduce a new holistic and 
intensive business review process
•  Update the Group’s reporting 
systems and data collection 
infrastructure to improve efficiency 
and facilitate faster decision making 
•  Establish a procurement council to 
leverage our global spend and to 
implement best in class supply 
chain processes
04 
COMPETITIVE COST  
COUNTRY STRATEGY
Senior has established manufacturing facilities in 
14 countries around the world. We are continuing 
to invest capital to ensure our businesses stay 
competitive at a capability and cost level. Much 
of the investment is focused at our facilities in 
Thailand, Malaysia, China, India, Mexico and the 
Czech Republic to help ensure we meet our 
customers’ cost and price challenges whilst 
protecting margins. We will actively move 
products and establish increasingly sophisticated 
capabilities in these competitive cost economies 
to free up capacity in our European and North 
American factories which is needed to satisfy 
anticipated increasing levels of demand.
OUR PLANS FOR 2016
•  Complete the construction of Phase 2 
of our new facility in Thailand for 
airframe structures
•  Ramp-up cooler production at our 
new facility in India
•  Ramp-up common rail production 
in Mexico
•  Transfer various fluid systems and 
structures work packages to 
Aerospace Mexico
•  Begin construction of a new facility 
in the Czech Republic to support 
new programmes in both the 
Flexonics and Aerospace Divisions
06 
 
TALENT DEVELOPMENT
Senior has a skilled workforce and some highly 
experienced entrepreneurial business leaders. 
We are bringing renewed focus to further 
developing leadership talent and upgrading 
functional capability across the Group. We are 
ensuring robust succession plans are in place 
across our operating businesses and Divisions. 
We are working with capable external partners 
to deliver tailored training and development 
programmes for Senior’s top talent.
OUR PLANS FOR 2016
•  Recruit a Group HR Director, a new 
position for the Group
•  Work with our external partners, 
to deliver advanced leadership 
development for our top talent 
from around the world
•  Further develop our succession 
planning processes
•  Collaborate across the businesses 
on recruitment and selection
05 
CONSIDERED AND EFFECTIVE 
CAPITAL DEPLOYMENT
Senior understands the importance of 
considered and effective capital deployment 
in the interest of maximising the creation of 
shareholder value. The Executive Leadership 
Team continually reviews investment priorities 
across the Group to ensure that the best choices 
are made for the allocation of capital. All 
significant investments undertaken by Senior 
are assessed using a rigorous investment 
appraisal process and are supported by a 
business case. The Group has a financial 
objective to maintain an overall return on capital 
employed in excess of the Group’s cost of capital 
and to target a pre-tax return in excess of 15%.
OUR PLANS FOR 2016
•  Invest approximately £45m 
in organic capital expenditure
•  Continue to pay a progressive 
dividend reflecting earnings per 
share and free cash flow generation 
over the medium term
•  Reduce the level of working capital 
as a % of revenue

(2014 – 65%) of Group revenue and consists 
of 19 operations. These are located in North 
America (ten), the United Kingdom (four), 
continental Europe (three), Thailand and Malaysia.

The Division’s most important market is large 
commercial aircraft where Boeing and Airbus 
collectively delivered 1,397 aircraft in 2015, 
3.3% more than the prior year. They booked 
net orders of 1,848 aircraft, which were ahead 
of aircraft deliveries for the sixth year in 
succession. As a consequence, their combined 
order book grew to 12,626 aircraft at the end of 
the year, representing a very healthy nine years’ 
production at current build rates, meaning good 
growth can be expected in the future.
Senior’s sales in the large commercial aircraft 
sector increased by 3.3%
(1)
 during the year, 
with organic growth, excluding acquisitions, 
of 2.3%. The Group benefited from higher 
deliveries of the 737 and 787 and increased 
production of the A350; however, these 
increases were partly offset by the impact of 
the decline in A330 build rates, particularly in 
relation to the Trent 700 engine.
The Division’s sales to the regional jet market 
increased by 9.5%
(1)
 in the year, mainly as a 
result of increased non-recurring engineering 
revenue on the Mitsubishi Regional Jet 
programme, which flew for the first time in 
November 2015. Revenue derived from the 
business jet sector declined by 13.5%
(1)
 during 
the year, with organic revenue down 14.0% 
due to Bombardier’s decision to cancel the 
Learjet 85 (“L85”) programme and due to 
reductions in Global 5000/6000 build rates.
Revenue from the military and defence sector 
increased by 12.4%
(1)
 in the year, with organic 
growth, excluding acquisition, of 11.9% primarily 
due to improved pricing and increases in 
production of the Joint Strike Fighter, A400M 
and P-8. This was offset partially by the 
anticipated build rate reductions for V-22 Osprey 
and CH-47 Chinook, coupled with the non-repeat 
of a Black Hawk spares order from 2014.
Around 10% of the Aerospace Division’s 
revenue was derived from other markets such 
as space, non-military helicopters, power and 
energy, medical and semi-conductor 
equipment, where the Group manufactures 
products using very similar technology to that 
used for certain aerospace products. Overall, 
revenue derived from these markets decreased 
by 6.2%
(1)
 on an organic basis, mainly due to 
reduced income from machined waste metal 
as a result of lower prices of waste aluminium 
and reduced power and energy related sales, 
partly offset by increased sales to the semi-
conductor equipment market.
The divisional adjusted operating margin 
declined by 1.1 percentage points to 13.4% 
(2014 – 14.5%)
(1)
. Margins were impacted by 
volume reductions for the Trent 700 engine for 
the A330, reductions in build rates of Global 
5000/6000, the cancellation of L85, lower 
aluminium revert prices and costs associated 
with temporary activities in the second half of 
the year to protect customer schedules. 
Additionally, costs associated with the 
industrialisation of new programmes such as 
the A350, the A320neo and the ramp-up of the 
Trent 1000 TEN engine were higher in the first 
half of year, but reduced in the second half as 
industrialisation transitions to series production. 
On 17 December 2015, the Group acquired 
Steico Industries, Inc. (“Steico”), a leading 
manufacturer of precision tube and duct 
assemblies for the commercial and defence 
aerospace industries, based in Oceanside, 
California, USA. Steico brings new and adjacent 
capabilities to the Group and enables the Division 
to offer the full range of tube and duct assemblies 
covering a wider scope of aerospace fluid 
systems. With content on key growth 
platforms such as the 737 MAX, A350 and 
Joint Strike Fighter, the business is expected 
to outgrow end markets. 
On 21 December 2015, Senior signed an 
agreement to sell the assets of the Group’s 
small Wichita based commodity composites 
business to Leading Composite Technologies Inc. 
The sale was completed on 16 February 2016.
Senior has healthy content on the A320neo, 737 
MAX, 787, A350 and Joint Strike Fighter, all of 
which are forecasting significant increases in 
production over the coming years. The Group will 
also benefit from greater content on the new 
engine aircraft, with 43% more content on the 
A320neo, 36% more on the 737 MAX, 18% more 
on the A330neo and 94% more on Embraer’s 
E2-Jets, than the current A320, 737, A330 and 
ERJ175/190/195 aircraft, respectively. Customer 
deliveries of the A320neo began in January 2016, 
whilst the 737 MAX and A330neo are scheduled 
to enter service in 2017 and the E2-Jet in 2018. 
Overall the future prospects for the Group’s 
Aerospace Division are visible and encouraging.

FLEXONICS
DIVISIONAL REVIEW
The Flexonics Division represents 32% 
(2014 – 35%) of Group revenue and consists of 
14 operations which are located in North America 
(four), continental Europe (three), the United 
Kingdom (two), South Africa, India, Brazil, 
Malaysia, and China where the Group also has a 
49% equity stake in a land vehicle joint venture.

Total Group sales to truck and off-highway 
markets decreased by 17.5%
(1)
. Senior’s sales 
to the North American truck market decreased 
by £4.7m (8.2%), with broadly flat sales of EGR 
coolers for new vehicles, as market production 
slowed in the second half of the year, and 
spares sales were lower as product longevity 
improved following technological advances 
made by Senior. Sales to the North American 
off-highway market decreased by £8.8m 
(32.0%) due to weaker demand for agricultural 
and mining vehicles; this has also resulted in an 
impairment loss of £18.8m relating to the 
goodwill allocated to our GA business. Sales to 
European truck and off-highway markets declined 
by £5.4m (27.7%) due to non-repeat of prior 
year prebuild by our customers ahead of further 
tightening of Tier 4 emission regulations and 
lower sales of high-pressure rails as a result of 
our customer’s joint venture concluding.
Group sales to passenger vehicle markets 
increased by 1.8%
(1)
 in the year, with modest 
improvements in the Division’s main European 
market, partially offsetting weaker market demand 
in Brazil. In India, a new 26,000 sq. ft. leased 
facility is being fitted-out to support a new EGR 
cooler contract for a customer who has 
established a new production operation in India. 
Production is anticipated to ramp-up in 2016.
In the Group’s industrial markets, organic sales 
excluding the benefit of Upeca Flexonics and 
LPE were down 12.1%
(1)
. Organic sales to 
petrochemical markets were up £1.8m (4.1%) 
with weaker markets offset by the incremental 
sales from the large industrial expansion joint 
orders for North American and South Korean 
petrochemical projects that shipped between 
H2 2014 and Q3 2015. As anticipated, organic 
sales to power and energy markets decreased 
by £13.9m (27.8%) due to weaker power 
generation and nuclear activity, and lower 
revenue from fuel cell dielectrics due to lower 
volumes and a reduction in price resulting from 
a design change. Elsewhere, weaker European 
solar and HVAC sales, coupled with lower sales 
to steel mills and medical markets, were partly 
offset by slightly improved Canadian sales to 
HVAC and cryogenic markets.
The adjusted operating margin decreased to 
14.3% (2014 – 15.5%). On an organic basis, 
excluding acquisition of LPE, the margin 
declined by 0.5 percentage points to 15.0% 
principally due to the impact of volume 
reductions in the off-highway and power and 
energy markets, offset partly by appropriate 
cost mitigating actions and favourable sales 
mix from the large industrial expansion joint 
orders.
On 31 March 2015, the Group acquired LPE, 
a leading manufacturer of precision-machined 
components, fabrications, assemblies and kit 
sets for the oil and gas, telecommunications, 
aerospace, defence, land and sea systems, 
nuclear and marine industries, based in 
Lymington, Hampshire, UK. LPE has seen some 
weakness in its core oil and gas related markets, 
compounded by destocking across the industry 
and we expect this to continue through 2016. 
However, we remain confident of the medium- 
to longer-term prospects of this business as 
LPE strengthens Senior’s precision machining 
capabilities and provides access to its strong 
customer relationships and adjacent markets.
In 2016, production of North American 
heavy-duty diesel trucks is forecast to decline 
further as a result of overall industrial slowdown 
coupled with a longer replacement cycle and 
the off-highway market is expected to remain 
weak due to the indirect impacts of lower oil 
and commodity prices. However, the Group 
anticipates partly offsetting some of these 
market headwinds with new product launches 
such as EGR coolers for a large off-highway 
customer. Industrial markets, particularly oil and 
gas related, are expected to remain challenging 
in the near term as investment in the sector is 
reduced or postponed. 
Looking further ahead, global environmental 
legislation continues to tighten and coupled 
with projected increases in global energy 
usage, will drive increased demand for many 
of the Flexonics Division’s products. Senior is 
developing solutions for the next generation 
of diesel engines, as well as alternative energy 
applications. As a result of its global footprint, 
technical innovation and customer relationships, 
the Group remains well positioned for the 
future as new Flexonics programmes and 
products enter production.

FINANCIAL DETAIL
Revenue
Group revenue increased by 3.5% to £849.5m 
(2014 – £820.8m). This included a favourable 
exchange impact of £24.9m and the beneficial 
incremental impact from three acquisitions 
of £25.4m (£0.9m from Steico acquired in 
December 2015, £16.9m from LPE acquired in 
March 2015 and £7.6m from Upeca acquired in 
April 2014). Excluding the year-on-year effect  
of acquisitions and favourable exchange, Group 
revenue from organic operations was down 
£21.6m on a constant currency basis. In 2015, 
63% of revenue originated from North 
America, 16% from the UK, 11% from the Rest 
of Europe and 10% from the Rest of the World.
Operating profit
Adjusted operating profit decreased by £3.8m 
(3.4%) to £107.8m (2014 – £111.6m), with the 
Group achieving an adjusted operating margin 
of 12.7% (2014 – 13.6%). This included a 
favourable exchange impact of £3.9m and  
the year-on-year adjusted operating profit 
contributed by acquisitions of £1.6m  
(Steico less than £0.1m, LPE £0.8m and  
Upeca £0.8m). If the effect of acquisitions  
and exchange movements are excluded, 
adjusted operating profit from organic 
operations decreased by 8.1% on a constant 
currency basis.

OPERATING MARGIN 
12.7%
The Group’s operating margin is 12.7%.
Finance costs
Total finance costs, net of investment 
income of £0.3m (2014 – £0.1m), decreased 
to £8.5m (2014 – £9.0m). Net interest costs 
on borrowings decreased to £8.0m (2014 – 
£8.1m) as the lower blended interest rate on 
committed facilities, following the repayment 
of $35.0m and $25.0m private placement loan 
notes during H2 2014 and 2015 respectively, 
offset the effects of the increased debt 
associated with the acquisition of LPE  
and Steico and the adverse foreign exchange 
impact on the translation of interest on US dollar 
denominated borrowings. The net IAS 19 
pension finance cost decreased to £0.5m 
(2014 – £0.9m) principally due to a reduction 
in the net retirement benefit obligations at 
31 December 2014 compared to 
31 December 2013.
Research and development
The Group’s expenditure on research and 
development increased to £16.3m during 2015 
(2014 – £11.5m). Expenditure was incurred 
mainly on designing and engineering products 
in accordance with individual customer 
specifications and developing specific 
manufacturing processes for their production.
Profit before tax
Adjusted profit before tax decreased by £3.3m 
(3.2%) to £99.3m (2014 – £102.6m). On a 
constant currency basis, adjusted profit before 
tax decreased by 6.2% (2014 – £105.9m). 
Reported profit before tax decreased £16.8m 
to £63.8m (2014 – £80.6m). The reconciling 
items between adjusted and reported profit 
before tax are shown in Note 4 of the 
Financial Statements.
Exchange rates
Around 82% of the Group’s profits are 
generated outside of the UK and, consequently, 
exchange rates can significantly affect the Group’s 
results. Exchange rates used for the currencies 
most relevant to the Group’s operations are:
Profit and loss –
average rates
2015 2014 £ Impact
£ : US Dollar 1.53 1.65 +7.8%
£ : Euro 1.37 1.24 -9.5%
Balance sheet –
period end rates
2015 2014 £ Impact
£ : US Dollar 1.47 1.56 +6.1%
£ : Euro 1.36 1.29 -5.1%
Using 2015 average rates would have 
increased 2014 revenue by £24.9m and 
increased 2014 adjusted operating profit by 
£3.9m. A 10 cents movement in the £:$ 
exchange rate is estimated to affect full-year 
revenue by £35.0m, operating profit by £4.7m 
and net debt by £10.0m. A 10 cents movement 
in the £:€ exchange rate is estimated to affect 
full-year revenue by £6m, operating profit by 
£0.3m and net debt by less than £0.3m.
Tax charge
The adjusted tax rate for the year was 20.0% 
(2014 – 19.5%), being a charge of £19.9m 
(2014 – £20.0m) on adjusted profit before tax 
of £99.3m (2014 – £102.6m). Over the medium 
term our tax rate is likely to increase as the mix 
of our business changes and we respond to 
legislative changes arising from the OECD’s 
Base Erosion Profit Shifting (“BEPS”) project. 
Cash tax paid as a percentage of adjusted profit 
before tax was 8.0% (2014 – 12.4%). The rate 
of cash tax paid is lower than our adjusted tax 
rate in both years due to the availability of 
tax losses, accelerated tax relief for capital 
expenditure and tax deductible items that do 
not affect adjusted profit. Our reported tax rate, 
including items excluded from adjusted 
operating profit of £4.6m (2014 – £2.9m), 
was 24.0% (2014 – 21.2%), being a charge 
of £15.3m (2014 – £17.1m) on reported profit 
before tax of £63.8m (2014 – £80.6m). 
Tax policy
The Group believes it has a corporate 
responsibility to act with integrity in all tax 
matters. It is the Group’s obligation to pay 
the amount of tax legally due and to observe 
all applicable rules and regulations in the 
jurisdictions in which it operates. While meeting 
this obligation, the Group also has a responsibility 
to its shareholders to plan, manage and control 
tax costs. The Group seeks to achieve this by 
conducting business affairs in a way which is 
efficient from a tax perspective, including 
maintaining appropriate levels of debt in the 
countries we operate in and claiming available 
tax credits and incentives.
The Group is committed to building constructive 
working relationships with the tax authorities 
of the countries in which it operates. The 
Group is also paying close attention to changes 
in international tax legislation arising from the 
OECD’s BEPS project to ensure continued 
compliance within an ever changing environment.
Earnings per share
The weighted average number of shares, 
for the purposes of calculating undiluted 
earnings per share, increased to 418.3 million  
(2014 – 416.3 million). The increase arose 
principally from the vesting of shares awarded 
under the Group’s Long-Term Incentive Plan. 
Adjusted earnings per share decreased by 
4.3% to 18.98 pence (2014 – 19.84 pence). 
Basic earnings per share decreased by 24.0% to 
11.59 pence (2014 – 15.25 pence). See Note 12 
of the Financial Statements for details of the 
basis of these calculations.

Capital expenditure
Gross capital expenditure increased by  
56.3% in 2015 to £48.6m (2014 – £31.1m), 
principally due to investment in future growth 
programmes and necessary replacement and 
compliance expenditure. The Group’s operations 
remain well capitalised. The disposal of assets 
no longer required raised £0.7m (2014 – £0.2m). 
Similar capital expenditure is anticipated for 
2016, with the extent dependent primarily 
upon the timing of build rate increases in the 
large commercial aircraft segment and the 
Group securing the expected new programme 
wins in both Divisions.
Working capital
Working capital increased by £20.3m in 2015 
to £127.9m. £9.4m of this increase was 
acquired with LPE and Steico. The remaining 
increase is primarily due to the unwinding of a 
higher payables balance at 31 December 2014.
Acquisitions
On 31 March 2015, the Group acquired LPE 
based in Lymington, Hampshire, UK as set out 
in Note 31. The initial cash consideration was 
£44.6m comprising a net consideration of 
£45.8m after taking account of £2.7m of net 
debt in the business at acquisition date and 
a payment of £1.5m for its working capital.
On 17 December 2015, the Group acquired 
100% of the issued share capital and trading 
facilities of Steico through a business 
combination. The consideration was £50.2m, 
after taking account of £0.1m working capital 
adjustment, for the issued share capital and 
£10.1m for the trading facility. There is no 
contingent consideration related to the 
acquisition. The acquisition was funded using 
the Group’s existing borrowing facilities and 
$80.0m private placements.
Dividend
The Group has a long track record of dividend 
growth and the Board intends to continue to 
pay a progressive dividend reflecting earnings 
per share and free cash flow generation over 
the medium term. 
A final dividend of 4.36 pence per share is 
proposed for 2015 (2014 – 3.96 pence), 
payment of which, if approved, would total 
£18.3m (2014 final dividend – £16.6m) and 
would be paid on 31 May 2016 to shareholders 
on the register at close of business on 29 April 
2016. This would bring the total dividends paid 
and proposed in respect of 2015 to 6.20 pence 
per share, an increase of 10% over 2014. At the 
level recommended, the full-year dividend 
would be covered 3.1 times (2014 – 3.5 times) 
by adjusted earnings per share. The cash 
outflow incurred during 2015 in respect of the 
final dividend for 2014 and the interim dividend 
for 2015 was £24.3m (2014 – £21.9m).
Goodwill
The change in goodwill from £262.5m at 
31 December 2014 to £284.5m at 
31 December 2015 reflects an increase of 
£2.5m due to foreign exchange differences, 
an increase of £17.1m and £21.2m due to the 
goodwill recognised on the acquisition of LPE 
and Steico, respectively and a reduction of 
£18.8m due to the impairment of the goodwill 
relating to GA.
Retirement benefit obligations
Aggregate retirement benefit liabilities at 
31 December 2015 were £12.6m in excess of 
the value of pension assets, representing a 
decrease in the deficit of £7.2m from 
31 December 2014. The deficit in respect of 
the Group’s UK defined benefit pension plan 
decreased by £8.8m to £0.6m (31 December  
2014 – £9.4m), primarily due to contributions 
in excess of service costs made by the Group. 
The deficit in North America and other 
territories increased by £1.6m. 
Net debt
Net debt increased by £89.6m to £194.6m 
at 31 December 2015 (31 December 2014 – 
£105.0m). This increase was principally due to 
the acquisitions of LPE and Steico (initial cash 
consideration of £44.6m plus net debt acquired 
of £2.7m and cash consideration of £60.3m, 
respectively). These acquisitions were funded 
using the Group’s existing borrowing facilities, 
a new two-year £20.0m revolving credit facility, 
new one-year term loans totalling £25.0m  
and $80.0m private placements. Other 
movements included £24.3m of dividend 
payments, £0.9m purchase of own shares, 
£0.1m loan to the joint venture, £8.4m of 
adverse currency movements and a free  
cash inflow of £51.7m.
The ratio of net debt to EBITDA at the end of 
December 2015 was 1.4x, within the Group’s 
target range of 0.5x to 1.5x and comfortably 
below the Group’s bank covenant level of 3.0x.

Funding and Liquidity
As at 31 December 2015, the Group’s gross 
borrowings excluding finance leases were 
£207.2m (2014 – £117.5m), with 75% of 
the Group’s gross borrowings denominated 
in US dollars (31 December 2014 – 87%). 
Cash and bank balances were £14.4m 
(31 December 2014 – £13.2m).
The maturity of these borrowings, together 
with the maturity of the Group’s committed 
facilities, can be analysed as follows:

  Gross borrowings include the use of bank overdrafts, 
other loans and committed facilities, but exclude 
finance leases of £1.8m. 
At the year-end, the Group had committed 
facilities of £268.4m with a weighted average 
maturity of 3.7 years. These facilities comprise 
private placement debt of £139.4m, term  
loans of £25.0m, and revolving credit facilities  
of £104.0m. The Group is in a strong funding 
position, with headroom of £73.8m under  
its facilities.
The Group has £3.6m of uncommitted 
borrowings which are payable on demand. 
The Group’s committed borrowing facilities 
contain a requirement that the ratio of EBITDA 
(adjusted profit before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation) to net interest 
costs must exceed 3.5x, and that the ratio of 
net debt to EBITDA must not exceed 3.0x. 
At 31 December 2015, the Group was 
operating well within these covenants as 
the ratio of EBITDA to net interest costs 
was 16.7x (31 December 2014 – 16.2x) and 
the ratio of net debt to EBITDA was 1.4x 
(31 December 2014 – 0.8x).

VIABILITY STATEMENT
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code, published 
by the Financial Reporting Council in 
September 2014 (the “Code”), the Directors 
have assessed the prospects of the Group 
over the three year period to 31 December 
2018. The Directors believe this period 
reflects the normal planning cycle of its 
business operations and adequately covers 
customer lead times for both new and 
expansion investment.
Whilst the Directors have no reason to 
believe the Group will not be viable over a 
longer period, given the inherent uncertainty 
involved, the period over which the Directors 
consider it possible to form a reasonable 
expectation as to the Group’s longer-term 
viability, based on the stress-testing and 
scenario planning discussed below, is the 
three-year period to 31 December 2018. This 
period – essentially the period used for the 
Group’s mid-term business plans – has been 
selected because it presents the Board and 
therefore readers of the Annual Report & 
Accounts 2015 with a reasonable degree 
of confidence whilst still providing an 
appropriate longer-term outlook.
In its assessment of the viability of the 
Group, the Directors have considered each 
of the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties 
detailed on pages 30 and 31 and in particular 
the risks associated with potential delays in 
the launch or ramp-up in production of new 
aircraft platforms.
The Directors have adopted a scenario 
approach supported by financial modelling. 
The “Base Case Scenario”, comprising the 
Group Budget for 2016 and the Group’s 
Vision for 2017 and 2018 before future 
acquisitions, is flexed to reflect the 
probability weighted and cumulative 
estimated effects of the Group’s principal 
risks and uncertainties. In addition, the 
Directors have also carried out a Reverse 
Stress Analysis by modelling the point at 
which future viability becomes uncertain.
The scenarios are designed to be severe but 
plausible; and take account of the availability 
and likely effectiveness of the mitigating 
actions that could be taken to avoid or 
reduce the impact or occurrence of the 
underlying risks and that realistically would 
be achieved in the circumstances. In 
considering the likely effectiveness of such 
actions, the conclusions of the Board’s 
regular monitoring and review of risk and 
internal control systems, as discussed on 
page 26, is taken into account.
The Directors consider that this stress-
testing based assessment of the Group’s 
prospects is reasonable in the circumstances 
of the inherent uncertainty involved.
Based upon the robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group and their 
stress-testing based assessment of Group’s 
prospects, all of which are described on  
page 26, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due over the period to 31 
December 2018 subject to Senior retaining 
the ability to acquire funding over the 
three-year period to 2018 in order to 
refinance committed facilities as they fall 
due, which is expected to be the case.
GOING CONCERN
As a consequence of the work undertaken 
to support the viability statement above, 
the Directors have continued to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the 
Financial Statements.
Senior plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015  25 OVERALL APPROACH
Senior plc’s risk philosophy is based around an 
acknowledgement that profits are in part the 
reward for risk taking. Business objectives 
cannot be achieved without assuming some 
degree of risk, and therefore risk should be 
embraced and managed effectively. 
The Group’s Risk Management Philosophy:
• Aims to take a relatively conservative 
approach to risk management.
• Targets an approach that is one of evolution 
rather than revolution.
• Encourages pursuit of opportunities, within 
an effective risk management framework, 
as an essential component of a high 
performance culture.
• Acknowledges that stronger and more 
effective risk management procedures will 
result in management teams being capable 
of embracing increased levels of risk and 
pursuing more opportunities.
• Effectively implemented, should allow 
Senior plc to increase its rate of performance 
delivery without breaching its risk appetite.
• Is designed to enhance senior leadership 
decision making capabilities, strengthen 
accountability and enhance stewardship 
of the Group’s assets. 
• Is a critical factor in enabling management 
teams to deliver against performance and 
organisational objectives, collectively the 
Group’s business objectives.
The Group aims to embed its risk management 
procedures within its existing business 
processes and corporate governance 
structure, rather than impose an additional 
administrative burden on its operations. The 
implementation of this Risk Philosophy is 
supported by an appropriate balance of 
policies, procedures (including a mandatory 
Code of Conduct) and performance metrics 
that are reported on regularly and designed 
to enable the effective monitoring of progress 
against agreed objectives. 
At a minimum, the Group aims to ensure that 
any individually significant event:
• that has or may result in the potential to 
compromise its ability to achieve its 
business objectives; or
• could lead to a material breach of policies 
and procedures; or
• could impact the delivery of earnings 
materially at a local operational level; is 
identified, reported on and actioned through 
the Group’s risk management procedures.
Risk events may occur in one or more 
of the following categories: Strategic, 
Operational, Technology, Compliance 
(including environmental and regulatory), 
Reporting (financial and non-financial), 
Reputational, Financial or Political.
Within each operation, responsibility for the 
implementation of procedures to comply 
with the Group’s risk philosophy and risk 
management framework rests with the senior 
management team, which is accountable to 
the operation’s CEO and Divisional CEO. 
The Group Executive Management Committee 
has responsibility for oversight of all Group 
operations and implementation of risk 
management at a Divisional level, and the 
Senior plc Board is ultimately accountable for 
the implementation of effective risk 
management procedures across the Group.
RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS
During 2015 a number of improvements were 
undertaken to improve the robustness of the 
Group Risk Assessment Process.
In particular, Divisional and Group level Risk 
Assessments were significantly upgraded 
allowing a greater focus to be placed on the 
detailed aspects of each risk, quality of controls 
and further action required to manage our 
business risks. In turn, this approach allows the 
Group to drive benefits from the process that 
directly relate to our Business Objectives.
Senior’s annual Risk Management and 
Assessment Process is based on a framework 
developed by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organisations of the Treadway Commission 
(COSO). The COSO framework is globally 
recognised as the definitive standard against 
which operations measure their risk 
management and internal control systems. 
It outlines five components that, in an effective 
system, work to support the achievement of an 
entity’s mission, strategy and related business 
objectives. These are:
• Control Environment
• Risk Assessment
• Control Activities
• Information and Communication
• Monitoring.
The foundation of Senior’s Risk Management 
approach is a half yearly Risk Assessment 
Review although risks are continuously 
monitored by the Executive Committee and 
the Board. In addition, all entities complete 
an Annual Controls Self-Assessment (CSA), 
which is designed to highlight any significant 
gaps in the internal control system and require 
development of improvement initiatives.
RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
26  Senior plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015
STRATEGIC REPORT STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Risk is considered to be the fact that the 
outcome of a future event is typically uncertain, 
and consequently the result may not be as 
planned. The outcome may be favourable or 
adverse to the one planned. Hence risk 
assessment and risk management should be 
considered in the light of both positive and 
negative outcomes. The possibility of a missed 
opportunity is also a risk. The outcome may be 
impacted by both internal and external factors, 
some of which we may have little or no 
influence over. Hence, it is important to assess 
the relative impacts of the various influencing 
factors and manage those that can be 
managed, whilst acknowledging, but not 
ignoring those that can’t be.
Risk management is the process by which the 
key objectives and the risks in achieving them 
are identified, evaluated, prioritised and controlled.

IMPLEMENT CHANGES
Senior’s operations have an increased awareness 
of risk management and have processes 
that promote consideration of risk as part of 
day-to-day management. This is evidenced by:
• an open culture which encourages 
consultation throughout the company;
• challenging debate and a multi-disciplinary 
approach to acceptance of new business;
• identification of the factors constraining 
current performance and formulation of 
related corrective actions;
• devolved responsibility for identifying and 
managing risk;
• simple and straightforward early warning 
mechanisms e.g. key performance indicators 
(financial and non-financial); and
• consistent and reliable reporting systems.
The risk assessment process is designed to 
provide a basis for the regular review of the 
operating environment and an opportunity to 
assess whether the correct level of resources 
are being targeted at the most appropriate 
areas. In doing so, the intention is to encourage 
proactive management and reduce the time 
spent in “firefighting” mode. This should lead 
to fewer surprises and a greater understanding 
of the Group’s competitive advantage, together 
with the ability to take advantage of it.
In summary, the Senior Risk Management 
process can be illustrated below.
The process is led by the CEOs at each level in 
the organisation although full management 
team involvement is required.

The first review is carried out as a stand-alone 
management meeting with all functional 
managers present at the same time. Each 
manager prepares an initial risk assessment 
covering his or her own area of responsibility, 
but potentially all areas of influence. This is 
presented to the meeting for constructive 
challenge. The CEOs then take the role of 
arbiter and devil’s advocate, and are 
responsible for ensuring the completeness of 
the review and the prioritisation of the items 
coming out of it.
The review documentation is laid out according 
to broad functional areas, which may not 
necessarily align with the management structure 
at each operation. Hence it is the responsibility 
of the Managing Director to ensure that all 
areas of the business are covered in 
appropriate detail.
The typical questions to be asked and debated 
for each functional area are:
• Have there been any problems in the past?
• How is the area controlled and can it 
be improved?
• What impact would it have on the 
business and what is the probability of 
things going wrong?
• Can either the likelihood or severity of the 
impact of things going wrong be managed?
• Should an action plan be devised?
Once the review has been undertaken and 
Risks identified, these are then assessed 
against the framework opposite.
The impact is not only considered in current 
year financial terms, but also in more strategic 
terms, which encompasses the need to build 
relationships with all stakeholders including 
employees, customers and suppliers for the 
longer term success of the business.

PRINCIPAL GROUP RISKS
Overall, the Group’s risk profile was largely unchanged in 2015 when compared to 2014. The principal potential risks and uncertainties, together with 
actions that are being taken to mitigate each risk, are set out below:
RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIONS TO MITIGATE RISK
NEW AIRCRAFT PLATFORM DELAYS 
Significant shipset content has been secured 
on a number of new aircraft platforms 
currently under development or in initial phases 
of production. These include the Airbus A350, 
A320neo, the Boeing 737 MAX and 
Bombardier’s CSeries regional jet. Delays in 
the launch or ramp-up in production of these 
platforms could have a material adverse impact 
on the Group’s rate of organic growth.
• The Group monitors programme development and launch timing of new aircraft platforms very 
closely, utilising internal customer relationships and market intelligence.
• A cautious approach is taken to both capital investment in new programmes, to minimise the 
time between installation and utilisation of new capital equipment, and to the projected build 
rates and associated revenue in financial projections.
• The growing breadth of Senior’s exposure to a comprehensive and diverse range of aerospace and 
land vehicle platforms, together with its broad exposure in global industrial markets, means that the 
Group’s future organic growth profile is not overly dependent on any individual new aircraft platform.
IMPORTANCE OF EMERGING MARKETS 
Customers’ desire to move manufacture of 
components to lower-cost countries could 
render the Group’s operations 
uncompetitive and have an adverse impact 
on profitability. In addition, certain 
customers require global programme 
support as they respond to increasing 
domestic demand in a number of these 
emerging markets.
• The Group’s strategy of developing a portfolio of high value-added engineering manufacturing 
companies has meant that over time it has generally evolved away from products where the 
direct threat of lower-cost country manufacture is significant.
• The Group successfully employs a strategy of retaining commercial and engineering expertise close 
to customers’ locations, principally in North America and Europe. This enables effective support to 
be readily given to its customers, whilst increasing manufacturing at above-average growth rates 
in lower-cost country locations where it makes sense to do so and with customer agreement.
• The Group has an increasing presence in emerging markets via its facilities in Mexico, Thailand, 
the Czech Republic, South Africa, Brazil, India, Malaysia and China. 
• Each of these operations, individually and in combination, has a healthy number of viable 
opportunities for further expansion either to supply domestic markets or to support customers’ 
increasingly global needs.
PRICE-DOWN PRESSURES 
Customer pricing pressure is an ongoing 
challenge within our industries, driven by 
the expectations of airlines, land vehicle 
operators and governments seeking to 
purchase more competitively priced products 
in the future. This will continue to put pressure 
on the Group’s future operating margins.
• The Group works closely with its customers to find innovative ways to produce products at 
a lower cost thus helping them to meet pricing challenges.
• The Group is able to consider bundles of products that in total help achieve customer pricing challenges. 
• Where appropriate, the Group will actively pass work to some of its lower-cost facilities such as 
Mexico, Thailand, the Czech Republic, South Africa, Brazil, India, China and Malaysia with a view 
to help satisfy customer challenges.
ACQUISITIONS 
Failure to execute an effective acquisition 
and integration programme would have a 
significant impact on the Group’s ability to 
generate long-term value for shareholders.
• Consistently strong free cash flow generation gives the Group capacity to continue to execute 
a targeted acquisition programme.
• The Group has a well-established acquisition framework that includes proven valuation, due 
diligence and integration processes.
• During 2015 a “Post-Acquisition Playbook” has been developed which will be used to ensure 
that acquisitions are integrated into the Group efficiently and effectively.
• Post-acquisition reviews are performed on key acquisitions, comprising a full retrospective review 
of each deal process, integration effectiveness, operational performance compared to expectation 
and sharing of lessons learned with the Board and across the senior management team.
STRATEGY 
An appropriately formulated, communicated 
and effectively executed strategy is essential 
in order to avoid the risk of inappropriate 
allocation of resources and failure to deliver 
on long-term performance goals.
• Focus is placed on the strategic planning process, to ensure that the Group formulates the 
most appropriate strategy to capitalise, over time, on the significant breadth of potential growth 
opportunities in its chosen market sectors.
• The process includes regular strategy sessions at operational, Executive Committee and Board level.

RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIONS TO MITIGATE RISK
PROGRAMME PARTICIPATION 
Long-term growth in demand, including 
participation in future development 
programmes in the Group’s major markets, 
is an essential foundation for future growth. 
Failure to secure profitable new programme 
wins could have a severe impact on the 
Group’s long-term performance.
• The Group has developed a portfolio of businesses that are exposed to markets which exhibit 
fundamental long-term growth characteristics.
• Customer value is driven through constructive and co-operative relationships with key 
customers in each market, providing innovative customer solutions and quality products 
delivered on time and in line with specifications.
• The Group ensures that its operations are sufficiently well capitalised to be able to bid 
competitively on new programme opportunities, and maintains close control over operating 
costs to ensure that operations remain competitive on existing programmes.
• The Group utilises an internal contract approval process, comprising both financial and non-
financial analyses, to ensure that bids are submitted and won at acceptable margin levels.
EMPLOYEE RETENTION 
An inability to attract, develop and retain 
high-quality individuals in key management 
positions could severely affect the long-
term success of the Group.
• Capable, empowered and highly engaged individuals are a key asset of the business. 
The strong reputation of the Group helps attract experienced senior executives from within 
the industry.
• The Group sponsors the development and training of key managers, at all levels, through an 
increasingly comprehensive in-house management development programme.
• Senior management turnover ratios remain low, a further indication of success in this important area.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE BREACH 
Corporate governance legislation (such as the 
UK Bribery Act and the US Foreign Corrupt 
Practices Act), regulations and guidance (such 
as the UK Corporate Governance Code and 
global health and safety regulations) are 
increasingly complex and onerous. A serious 
breach of these rules and regulations could 
have a significant impact on the Group’s 
reputation, lead to a loss of confidence on 
the part of investors, customers or other 
stakeholders and ultimately have a material 
adverse impact on the Group’s enterprise value.
• The Group has well-established governance policies and procedures in all key areas, including 
a Group Code of Business Conduct, anti-bribery procedures, a Health and Safety Charter, and 
various policies and procedures over the review and reporting of risk management and internal 
control activities.
• The Group Finance Director, the Group Company Secretary and the Head of Internal Audit 
collectively retain principal responsibility for reviewing governance changes that may have an 
impact on the Group.
• Governance updates are provided to the Board and Executive Committee at appropriate intervals, 
and to key operational management. Recent examples of developments in this area include 
formulation of a Business Continuity Framework, IT Policy Guidelines, and anti-bribery training.
FINANCING AND LIQUIDITY 
The Group could have insufficient 
financial resources to fund its growth 
strategy or meet its financial obligations 
as they fall due.
• The Group’s overall treasury risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial 
markets, and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance.
• Compliance with financial policies and exposure limits are reviewed by the Group’s Treasury 
Committee on a regular basis.
• The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange risk arising 
on operations’ trading activities in foreign currencies, however, it does not enter into or trade 
financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
• The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve 
borrowing facilities, and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, matching 
the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities and paying close attention to the projected 
level of headroom under the covenants contained in its committed borrowing facilities. 
GLOBAL CYCLICAL DOWNTURN 
The potential adverse impact on the Group 
of significant demand declines in key 
markets arising from the consequences of 
either future sovereign debt issues, ongoing 
government austerity measures, and/or 
political instability remains significant.
• The Group is well positioned in its key aerospace, industrial, and emission-related sectors of 
land vehicle markets, where increasingly stringent legislation should ensure that long-term 
demand for the Group’s products remains healthy.
• Through diversity of its end-market exposures and a robust financing position, the Group 
remains well placed to be able to withstand potential negative consequences that may arise 
from a further global cyclical downturn.

20/20 VISION: A NEW VISION FOR 
SUSTAINABILITY
Sustainability drives demand for the majority of 
the Group’s products. Most of them are directly 
or indirectly aligned to the increasingly stringent 
global requirements for reduced carbon 
emissions, improved air quality or higher fuel 
efficiency in engines that power aircraft, trucks 
and passenger vehicles. Sustainability also 
creates value for Senior and its stakeholders 
by helping us to manage our businesses more 
efficiently, mitigate risks, reduce costs and 
protect the communities in which we operate. 
In 2015, we launched our ‘20/20 Vision for 
Sustainability’, a five-year strategy that seeks 
to build upon the improvement made in recent 
years. It was developed following a review of 
material issues significant to our stakeholders, 
and also looked at how Senior could influence 
performance and outcomes in these areas. The 
strategy has three core themes: our workplaces, 
our environment and our communities.  STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
 WORKPLACE
The health and safety of our people 
is our top priority. Our goal is to eliminate 
occupational injury and illness through our Zero 
Harm strategy which underscores our belief 
that all accidents are preventable. As well as 
protecting employees, our focus on health and 
safety improves productivity, helps employees 
to feel valued and protects our reputation. 
We embed a HSE culture across the Group 
by providing the training and tools needed to 
recognise and understand the importance of 
good HSE practices and how to proactively 
mitigate risk. Our people must adhere to 
stringent health and safety procedures which 
are embedded in the Safety Management 
System (“SMS”). Our approach is risk-based 
with regard to safety-critical areas where our 
initiatives include: improved governance; 
development of consistent process and 
toolsets; and significant improvements in 
safety performance monitoring and reporting.
Whilst Senior is pleased to report continued 
improvement in its safety metrics, the Board 
is saddened to report on two deaths that 
occurred in 2015 from activities closely 
associated with Senior. A sub-contractor died 
while working on the construction of the 
Group’s new facility in India, and in December 
an engineer was fatally injured while working 
for our Chinese joint venture. Following both of 
these incidents, a comprehensive investigation 
was conducted. Corrective actions have been 
implemented and the lessons shared across 
the Group.
2015 update
• Reviewed and updated our HSE policies, 
standards and supporting Group operating 
procedures as part of the refresh of the SMS.
• Delivered measurable improvement in 
safety, including a 10.6% reduction in our 
Lost Time Incidents Rate (LTIR) compared 
to 2014. Our long-term goal of reducing by 
20% our overall rate of accidents, including 
those incurring lost time, was met this year.
• Trained over 600 people on our Leading 
for Safety training course which engages 
all employees in safety, improving 
accountability and enabling individuals to 
better identify and eliminate risks.
• Provided new video training globally on our 
10 Golden Rules that set out the minimum 
standard that must be met when performing 
safety-critical tasks.
Our plans for 2016
• Continue to reinforce our 10 Golden Rules. 
• Focus on individual accountability and safety 
behaviours through our Zero Harm programme.
 ENVIRONMENT
Senior’s aspiration for zero harm applies 
as much to the environment as it does to 
health and safety. We are committed to 
implementing and upholding effective 
measures to minimise the environmental 
impact of our activities. Our main impacts on 
the environment are: energy consumption (and 
associated CO
2
 emissions), waste generation 
and recycling, and water consumption and in 
2015 the Group achieved continued reductions 
across all the impacts. Our Group-wide 
environmental management programme includes 
setting environmental targets; communicating 
regulatory developments; training and 
information-sharing; data analysis; internal and 
external auditing of environmental management 
systems and practices; and developing local 
energy conservation projects. Excluding recent 
acquisitions, all Senior operations now retain 
ISO 14001 certification. The remaining facilities 
are targeting certification in 2016.

2015 update
Greenhouse gases 
• Included for the first time in CDP’s Climate A 
List which highlights companies providing a 
high level of transparency in their disclosure 
of climate-related information.
• Achieved further reductions in energy usage 
through ongoing investments in several 
energy efficiency projects, including 
upgrading compressed air plants, improving 
furnace controls and installing high efficiency 
lighting and controls at our facilities. 
These measures have improved energy 
conservation by 10% since 2010.
• Commissioned energy surveys at a key 
number of main production sites.
Waste
• Increased the amount of waste recycled 
to 80% and extended the number of 
businesses achieving zero landfill to six. 
• Total waste generated by the Group 
increased on 2014 levels. We continue  
to design out waste or find alternative  
ways to reuse the material.
Water
Achieved 16% reduction in demand (assuming 
264 megalitres 2014 – 313,545 m
3
/314 
megalitres including 2014 acquisitions) through 
targeted investments in our businesses 
operating aqueous clean lines, a process that 
consumes high volumes of potable water, and 
through improvements to existing systems.
At Senior Aerospace Metal Bellows, a one 
million dollar investment was made in a 
closed-loop water reclamation system which 
cleans process-waste water, eliminating waste 
water and then reusing the clean water, reducing 
the business’s overall water consumption by 
450 m
3
 annually. The water is cleaned to such a 
level that it can be used for process welding 
and the cleaning of medical products. 
Methodology:
1. The Group aims to collect and report its environmental data in accordance with the guidelines specified by the Global Reporting Initiative and the Greenhouse Gas Protocol 
(GHGP), to the extent that this is currently practicable. The figures reported above include data from the Group’s wholly-owned or majority-owned operations. 
2. The Group has followed the 2014 UK Government environmental reporting guidance and applied the greenhouse gas conversion factors contained within the GRI Guidelines 
and the Defra/DECC’s 2014 Conversion Factors for Company Reporting.
3. Billed or metered sources represent the basis of the majority of our data; however, the travel data which represents less than 10% of the total is calculated on an estimated 
basis which we believe to be an accurate representation of use.
4. The Group has used the financial control approach to define its organisational boundary.
5. The Group has chosen sales as its intensity ratio. We are unable to normalise our environmental performance to our products because the Group’s products differ greatly in 
size, form and weight.
6. The Scope 1 and 2 emissions have independently verified in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3410 ‘Assurance engagements on 
greenhouse gas statements’ (ISAE 3410). The auditor’s statement can be located at www.seniorplc.com/sustainability

 INVESTING IN OUR COMMUNITIES
At Senior we believe that community 
engagement not only enhances our local 
reputation but allows us to compete more 
effectively. We encourage our businesses and 
employees to participate in their local 
communities, by investing in, supporting and 
sponsoring good causes. These relationships 
are normally managed at a local level, where 
employees select charitable interests within 
their community. In some cases, our 
businesses make direct financial contributions, 
sponsor or participate in charitable events. 
We encourage our businesses to direct their 
activities towards one of three key areas:
1. Supporting local communities Business 
donations to local charities and good causes; 
employees donating their time or fundraising 
to support causes that they believe in. 
2. Educational activities Developing or 
participating in community outreach 
programmes, formal partnerships and 
specific projects with local schools,  
technical colleges or universities to 
develop an individual’s work-based skills 
and supplement their education.
3. Health and welfare Donations to local 
hospitals, hospices or particular medical 
causes through employees donating their 
time and/or fundraising for local health-
related activities or making cash donations. 
Many businesses have also organised and 
sponsored their employees in charitable 
sports activities.
Senior Flexonics Cape Town celebrated 
Mandela Day by providing winter clothing kits 
to local homeless people. Its employees also 
shared their specialist knowledge in health and 
wellness by running educational programmes for 
underprivileged children on HIV/AIDS, teenage 
pregnancy and the dangers of drug abuse. 
Senior Aerospace BWT created its own Healthy 
Living programme in collaboration with Stockport 
County Football Club providing numerous 
coaching sessions to local primary schools. 
Senior Flexonics Bartlett sponsored and 
participated in the Mill Race Marathon raising 
over $10,000 for local charitable causes. The 
marathon has become an annual event and 
over 40 employees are expected to participate 
in the Mill Race Marathon again in 2016. 
Senior’s businesses in the Washington area 
have for many years partnered with the United 
Way, a local charity, to support vulnerable 
children and their families by improving living 
conditions, quality of life and access to 
education and the local communities. Since 
2010, the three businesses have collectively 
donated $120,000, along with $80,000 by 
loaning employees to develop the programme. 
Over $500,000 has been raised in donations 
over a five-year period from the employees at 
Senior Aerospace AMT, Absolute and Damar 
through an annual United Way employee 
pledge campaign.
 THE HIGHEST ETHICAL STANDARD
We are proud of our reputation and 
place the utmost importance not just on what 
we do, but how we do it. The Senior Code of 
Conduct provides a clear framework for 
decision-making, highlighting the values and 
behaviours we expect our employees and 
agents to demonstrate at all times. Our ethics 
and business conduct programme commits us 
to conducting business fairly, impartially and in 
compliance with local laws and regulations and 
to acting with integrity and honesty in our business 
relationships. Acting ethically is an enabler of 
our business, providing competitive advantage 
by strengthening long-term relationships and 
protecting the Group’s reputation.
We use various forms of communication and 
training, both in-person and through electronic 
media, to embed ethics and integrity 
requirement across the Group. We investigate 
any alleged violations or complaints and take 
the necessary action. A register of reported 
incidents is maintained by the Group Company 
Secretary and the Board receives regular updates.
The Group recognises that the use of third 
party intermediaries can increase potential 
bribery and corruption risks within the markets 
in which we operate. All external sales agents 
working on behalf of Senior across the world 
are required to operate in compliance with 
the Code of Conduct. The Code requires 
a pre-appointment due diligence and risk 
assessment to be undertaken, prior to 
engaging or re-appointing any sales agent 
and requires them to be issued with the Code, 
ensuring that they understand, acknowledge 
and accept its requirements. Senior is also 
in the process of adopting best practice in 
managing its supply chain responsibly. 
2015 update 
• Instigated a comprehensive review of ethics 
and compliance policies.
Our plans for 2016
• Continue to improve and evolve the 
Group’s ethics programme with an 
enhanced Group-wide training programme 
and a closer alignment of the business 
conduct programme with human resources, 
legal and internal audit activities. 
• Roll out the ethics and compliance 
programmes to LPE and Steico Industries 
which were both acquired in 2015.
• Progress the findings of our internal 
review, strengthening our responsible 
business practices. 
• Issue our Responsible Supply Chain 
Management Policy to all suppliers early 
in 2016.

Senior plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015  35 KEY PERFORMANCE  
INDICATORS
The Group uses five financial and two  
non-financial metrics to measure progress in 
implementing its strategy; the Group’s financial 
objectives are as follows:
• to achieve organic revenue growth (at 
constant exchange rates) in excess of the 
rate of inflation;
• to increase adjusted earnings per share 
on an annual basis by more than the rate 
of inflation;
• to increase the Group’s return on revenue 
margin each year;
• to generate sufficient cash to enable the 
Group to fund future growth and to follow  
a progressive dividend policy; and
• to maintain an overall return on capital 
employed in excess of the Group’s cost  
of capital and to target a pre-tax return in 
excess of 15%.
These financial objectives are supported by 
two non-financial objectives:
• to reduce the number of recordable injuries 
which incur lost time by 20% in the five-year 
period to 2015; and
• to reduce the Group’s rate of energy 
intensity by 10% in the five-year period  
to 2015.
The Group collects its environmental data in 
accordance with the guidelines specified by 
the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), to the 
extent that this is currently practicable, and 
has applied the greenhouse gas conversion 
factors contained within the GRI Guidelines 
and the Defra/DECC’s 2013 Conversion Factors 
for Company Reporting. The Group has used 
the financial control approach to define its 
organisational boundary and reports data from 
its wholly-owned or majority-owned operations. 
Billed or metered sources represent the basis 
of the majority of our greenhouse gas emissions; 
however, Scope 3 emissions which represent 
less than 10% of the total, are calculated on 
a pro rata basis which are believed to be a 
reasonably accurate representation of use.
2015 was a challenging year for the Group and 
as a result only two out of five of the Group’s 
financial targets were met. During 2015 further 
improvements were made in the Group’s 
underlying energy and water intensity 
performance and the Group was pleased to 
see CO
2
 emissions decrease. The Group 
achieved its 2015 safety, energy and water 
usage improvement goals. Further details of 
the Group’s performance record in this regard, 
including its long-term performance trends, are 
shown on pages 33 and 34.
The Group believes that corporate responsibility 
is a key part of how we do business at Senior, 
and while we are pleased to achieve the 
five-year targets for improvement set in 2010, 
we believe that further progress is posssible.
New targets have been set for the five-year 
period to 2020 as follows: 
• to reduce the number of recordable injuries 
which incur lost time by 20% in the five-year 
period to 2020; and
• to reduce the Group’s rate of energy intensity 
by 10% in the five-year period to 2020.
A summary of the year-on-year movements 
in these key performance indicators (”KPIs”) 
and the main drivers of the changes are 
described below and overleaf. 
ORGANIC REVENUE (£m )
-2.6%
Organic revenue increased in the Aerospace 
Division due to increased build rates on large 
commercial aircraft programmes, offset slightly 
by lower volumes on the A330 and Global 
5000/6000 programmes. In Flexonics, conditions 
were much tougher and resulted in lower 
demand for truck engine components. Industrial 
markets were down as incremental sales from a 
North American petrochemicals project were 
more than offset by weaker sales in the power 
generation, HVAC and renewables markets.
13 14 15
738
846
824
ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE (P)
-4.3%
Lower revenue at a lower margin results in a 
decline in adjusted profit before tax of 3% to 
£99.3m. Furthermore, the Group’s tax rate 
increased from 19.5% to 20% and the number 
of basic shares increased by 2.0m to 418.3m  
resulting in a 4.3% reduction in EPS in the year.

RETURN ON REVENUE MARGIN (%)
-0.9ppts During the year, the Group experienced a number 
of factors which reduced the margin. Reductions 
in high margin programmes, the cancellation of 
L85, lower aluminium revert prices and costs 
associated with temporary activities in the 
second half of the year to protect customer 
schedules all had a negative impact. A number  
of cost reduction programmes and margin 
improvement plans were implemented, such as 
transferring work to cost competitive countries, 
furloughs at specific factories and headcount 
reductions, and these helped to partly offset the 
decline in margin, but could not mitigate it fully. 13 14 15

LOST TIME INJURY FREQUENCY RATE  
(INCIDENTS PER 100 EMPLOYEES P .A.)
10.6% decrease Senior implemented new safety initiatives 
throughout 2015 and this has contributed to a 
decrease in the lost time injury frequency by 
10.6%. The Group continues to take a proactive 
approach to the health and safety of all employees, 
and is pleased to have achieved the stretching 
targets set in 2010. This target has now been reset 
for the five-year period to 2020.

The Group’s cash conversion remains strong, 
despite challenging trading conditions. The Group 
has been able to fund an increased level of capital 
expenditure of 1.8 times depreciation, continue to 
make strategic acquisitions and propose a 10% 
increase in the annual dividend.

CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS  
(TONNES/£m REVENUE)
1.2% decrease The Group has achieved its published five-year 
target of improving energy efficiency by 10% 
between 2010 and 2015. When adjusting for 
acquisitions, the Group has reduced its underlying 
environmental impact in each of the past 10 years. 
The Group has set a new target to reduce this level 
by a further 10% in the five-year period to 2020.

RETURN ON CAPITAL EMPLOYED (%)
-4.9ppts The Group’s return on capital employed reduced 
in 2015, following the acquisitions of LPE (March 
2015) and Steico (December 2015). Furthermore, 
the impact of lower earnings was compounded 
by increased capital expenditure and additional 
working capital requirements due to production 
ramp-up in large commercial aerospace. The 
overall return on capital employed remains above 
the target of 15%.

The Directors present their Report and 
supplementary reports, together with the 
audited Financial Statements for the year 
ended 31 December 2015.
ACTIVITIES AND BUSINESS REVIEW
Senior plc is a holding company. The nature 
of the Group’s operations and its principal 
activities are set out in the Strategic Report 
on pages 1 to 21. Its Group Undertakings are 
shown on pages 122 and 123. The Strategic 
Report includes details of the market overview; 
key growth drivers; Senior’s business model; 
strategic objectives; risks and uncertainties; 
key performance indicators and a summary 
of 2015 performance.
ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSALS
On 31 March 2015, Senior acquired 100% of 
the issued share capital of Lymington Precision 
Engineering (LPE) Limited and on 17 December  
2015 acquired 100% of the issued share 
capital of Steico Industries, Inc. Further 
details of the businesses are given in Note 31. 
On 21 December 2015, the Group entered into 
a Sale agreement to dispose of its Senior 
Aerospace Composites business, which is 
based in Wichita, Kansas. The sale was 
completed on 16 February 2016.
RESULTS AND DIVIDENDS
The results for the year are shown in the 
Consolidated Income Statement on page 74.
An interim dividend of 1.84 pence per share 
(2014 – 1.67 pence) has already been paid and 
the Directors recommend a final dividend of 
4.36 pence per share (2014 – 3.96 pence). 
The final dividend, if approved, will be payable 
on 31 May 2016 to shareholders on the register 
at the close of business on 29 April 2016. This 
would bring the total dividend for the year to 
6.20 pence per share (2014 – 5.63 pence).
SHARE CAPITAL
The Company has one class of ordinary shares, 
which carries no right to a fixed income. Each 
share carries the right to vote at general meetings 
of the Company. Changes to the Company’s 
issued share capital during 2015 were:
Shares in issue at  
1 January 2015 418,079,790
Senior plc Long-Term  
Incentive Plan 1,332,508 
Senior plc Savings-Related  
Share Option Plan 3,952
Shares in issue at  
31 December 2015 419,416,250
Further share capital details are given in 
Note 25.
Details of employee share plans are set out 
on pages 108 and 109.
There are no specific restrictions on the size of 
a holding nor on the transfer of shares, which 
are both governed by the general provisions of 
the Company’s Articles of Association and 
prevailing legislation. The Directors are not 
aware of any agreements between holders of 
the Company’s shares that may result in 
restrictions on the transfer of securities or on 
voting rights. No person has any special rights 
of control over the Company’s share capital, 
and all issued shares are fully paid. 
With regard to the appointment and 
replacement of Directors, the Company is 
governed by its Articles of Association, the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, the Companies 
Act 2006 and related legislation. The Articles 
may be amended by special resolution of the 
shareholders. The powers of Directors are 
described in the Matters Reserved for the 
Senior plc Board, which may be found on the 
Company’s website. Each year, shareholder 
approval is sought to renew the Board’s 
authority to allot relevant securities. 
There are also a number of other agreements 
that take effect, alter or terminate upon a 
change of control of the Company, such as 
commercial contracts, bank loan agreements, 
property lease arrangements, and employees 
share plans. None of these are considered to 
be significant in terms of their likely impact on 
the business of the Group as a whole. 
Furthermore, the Directors are not aware of 
any agreements between the Company and 
its Directors or employees that provide for 
compensation for loss of office or employment 
that occurs because of a takeover bid. 
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Note 20 contains disclosures on 
Financial Instruments.
DIRECTORS
Details of the Directors who served throughout 
the year can be found on pages 38 and 39.  
The Directors’ interests in the shares of the 
Company are included in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on page 66. No Director 
has any interest in contracts with the Company 
or its subsidiary undertakings.
The provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code require that all Directors of 
FTSE 350 companies should be subject to 
annual election by shareholders. David Squires 
was appointed to the Board on 1 May 2015 and 
Susan Brennan was appointed to the Board 
on 1 January 2016; David and Susan will both 
stand for election at the Annual General Meeting 
(the “AGM”) in April 2016. Celia Baxter, 
Charles Berry, Derek Harding, Giles Kerr and 
Mark E. Vernon will all stand for re-election at 
the AGM in April 2016. Mark Rollins retired 
from the Board on 31 May 2015 and Andy 
Hamment is to retire from the Board following 
the conclusion of the AGM in April 2016. 
BOARD DIVERSITY
The Board remains committed to diversity, 
previously having an aspirational goal of 15% 
female Board representation by the end of 
2013. The appointments of Celia Baxter to the 
Board in 2013, and of Susan Brennan in 2016, 
mean that Senior now has improved female 
representation on its Board. Senior recognises 
the importance of all aspects of Board diversity 
including experience, background and personal 
attributes and will keep under review its 
balance and composition.

Senior plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015  43 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
This Corporate Governance Report describes the 
manner in which the Company has applied the 
Main Principles of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (“the Corporate Governance Code”).
STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE
The Company has been in compliance with 
the Principles set out in Sections A to E of the 
Corporate Governance Code throughout the year.
APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THE 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE
The Principles of good corporate governance 
are detailed in the Corporate Governance Code 
under five areas. These Principles have each 
been reviewed by the Directors and are 
commented upon as follows:
Section A: Leadership
The Board is structured under a Non-executive 
Chairman, and currently includes two Executive 
Directors and six independent Non-executive 
Directors, who were selected for appointment 
because of their wide industrial and 
commercial experience. In addition, the 
Company has an Executive Committee, chaired 
by the Group Chief Executive, comprising the 
Executive Directors and other key executives 
within the Group. Details of the members of 
the Board and of the Executive Committee are 
summarised on pages 38 and 41.
The Directors consider that an effective Board 
is in place which leads and controls the Group, 
with clear divisions of responsibility between 
the running of the Board and the running of the 
Group’s businesses. 
The Board is responsible for strategic decisions 
affecting the Group, including the setting of 
commercial strategy and the approval of Group 
budgets and financial statements. It also 
approves significant financial and contractual 
commitments made by the Group. The Board’s 
Terms of Reference more fully describe the 
responsibilities of the Board and may be found 
on the Company’s website.
The Board delegates a certain number of its 
responsibilities to the Audit, Remuneration, 
Nominations, and Health, Safety & 
Environment (“HSE”) Committees. The Group 
Chief Executive, together with the Executive 
Committee, is responsible for the 
implementation of the decisions made by 
the Board and for the day-to-day conduct of 
the Group’s operations. 
The Board meets formally on a regular basis 
(nine times in 2015); in addition there were 
three meetings of the Audit Committee in 
2015, together with four meetings of the 
Remuneration Committee and three meetings 
of the Nominations Committee. There was full 
attendance at every full Board meeting and 
Committee of the Board during the year. 
Other Committees are appointed by the Board 
to deal with treasury matters and specific 
issues such as acquisitions and disposals.
The minutes arising from all Committee 
meetings are made available to the Board. 
Procedures are in place to ensure that all 
Directors are properly briefed, so that decisions 
taken by the Board are based on the fullest, 
up-to-date, available information. The Non-
executive Directors are encouraged to visit 
the Group’s operations to meet the local 
management teams and discuss any issues 
that they may face. At every Board meeting 
there are reviews of operational, financial and 
administrative matters. Health, safety and 
environmental performance is reviewed by 
the Board on a regular basis; social and ethical 
issues, the agreement of budgets and levels 
of insurance cover are reviewed whenever 
appropriate.
There is a procedure by which all Directors can 
obtain independent professional advice at the 
Company’s expense in furtherance of their 
duties, if required.
Section B: Effectiveness
The Company’s Nominations Committee 
leads the process for Board appointments, 
and supervises management development 
and succession planning. It also makes 
recommendations to the Board on all new Board 
appointments and re-appointments, further 
details of which can be found on page 47. 
The Committee, which consists entirely of 
Non-executive Directors, is chaired by Charles 
Berry, its composition is shown on page 38, 
and its Terms of Reference may be found on 
the Company’s website. The Board considers 
all Non-executive Directors of the Company 
to be independent, having taken into account a 
list of relationships and circumstances that may 
appear relevant in determining independence, in 
accordance with the Corporate Governance Code.
When appointing new Directors, the 
Nominations Committee is fully cognisant of 
the benefits of diversity; the Board’s policy on 
diversity is described on page 47.
During 2015, the Board undertook a recruitment 
process to select a new Non-executive Director 
and Susan Brennan was appointed to the Board 
on 1 January 2016. Details of the appointment 
CHAIRMAN’S LETTER
I am pleased to present the Group’s 
Corporate Governance Report for 2015 on 
behalf of the Board. This report is intended 
to provide shareholders with a clear and 
meaningful explanation of what 
governance means to the Board and how 
this guides its decision-making process. 
Good corporate governance is taken 
seriously across the Group; the Board 
sets the tone and takes the lead on all 
governance matters.
I am pleased to confirm that the Board 
reviewed the requirements of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code in 2015 and 
I confirm that the Company complies, 
and will continue to do so.
Charles Berry 
Chairman

GOVERNANCE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
are included in the Nominations Committee 
Report on page 47. Korn Ferry was the 
consultancy firm appointed to support the 
recruitment process for the new Non-executive 
Director, which was led by the Chairman. 
Korn Ferry has no other connection with 
the Company. A summary of the Directors’ 
biographies appears on page 39. All Directors 
receive induction upon joining the Board and 
are encouraged to update their knowledge and 
skills on a regular basis.
To enable the members of the Board and 
its Committees to discharge their duties 
effectively, the Group Company Secretary 
seeks to ensure that all relevant information 
is provided to the Directors in a timely manner, 
in advance of meetings.
In 2015, an external evaluation of the Board 
and its Committees was commissioned; the 
formal review was undertaken by Equity 
Communications Limited. The review’s 
findings showed that the Board operated 
effectively throughout the period and made 
some suggestions for its future development. 
The findings will be used to help support the 
development of the Board as the Group 
continues with its strategy to grow profitability, 
both organically and by acquisition. Equity 
Communications Limited has no other 
connection with the Company.
In addition, in 2015 the Chairman undertook 
a review of the performance of individual 
Directors; this process involved one-on-one 
appraisal interviews. The results of the 
evaluation process are used to improve Board 
performance and to determine the training 
needs of the Directors. Andy Hamment, in 
consultation with the Directors, undertook 
an evaluation of the Chairman’s performance, 
and concluded that Charles Berry provided 
effective leadership of the Board. Based on the 
results of the performance evaluation process, 
the Chairman considers that all members of 
the Board, the Board collectively, and its 
Committees, continue to contribute effectively 
to the running of the Company.
In compliance with the Corporate Governance 
Code, all Directors offered themselves for 
re-election at the Company’s AGM 2015, with 
the exception of Mark Rollins, who retired from 
the Board on 31 May 2015. At the AGM 2016, 
all Directors will again offer themselves for 
election or re-election with the exception of 
Andy Hamment, who is to retire from the Board 
following the conclusion of the AGM 2016.
Section C: Accountability
The Board determines the nature and extent 
of the significant actions necessary to achieve 
its strategic objectives and maintains a sound 
system of internal control. The Company’s 
Audit Committee reports to and, for certain 
matters, advises the Board of Directors. 
The Audit Committee Report on pages 48 to 
52 describes the role and activities of the Audit 
Committee, together with the significant 
issues that it considered in relation to the 2015 
Financial Statements and its relationship with 
the internal and external Auditors. 
An explanation of how the Board assessed 
the effectiveness of the external audit process, 
the approach taken to re-appoint the external 
Auditor and the Company’s policy on the 
tendering of the external audit are to be found 
on page 51.
Communicating the Code of Conduct and 
operating with integrity
Senior trains its employees on the 
requirements of its Code of Conduct 
(the”Code”) upon induction, educating them on 
what they can and cannot do, and how to 
address any ethical dilemmas they may face. 
The Code is reissued periodically to remind 
employees of the required level of conduct. 
The Group’s ethical procedures and Code were 
reviewed in the light of the UK Bribery Act 
2010 and anti-bribery training was rolled out 
across the Group in 2012; this training is now 
routinely operated on an ongoing basis to new 
employees. An enhanced training programme 
will be rolled out across the Group in 2016.
The Board verifies compliance with the Code 
through its internal audit programme, ensuring 
that employees have received the mandatory 
training and its businesses operate with integrity 
at all times and in compliance with the Code. 
Operating with integrity and in an ethical 
manner builds trust with customers and other 
stakeholders and underpins the Board’s 
strategic objectives.
Human rights
The Group recognises the importance of 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
(“UDHR”) and adheres to the core principles 
and values defined within it. The majority of 
countries in which Senior operates have their 
own laws banning child labour and promoting 
human rights. Senior monitors the ages of its 
workforce across the world to ensure 
compliance and identify any potential 
succession issues.
Senior does not restrict any of its employees 
in any of the countries in which it operates 
from joining a trade union if they wish to do so. 
Senior also works closely with its suppliers to 
ensure that they at least meet internationally 
recognised minimum requirements for workers’ 
welfare and conditions of employment.
Reporting and investigating concerns and 
whistle-blowing
The Company encourages Group employees to 
discuss any ethical concerns that they may 
have with local management. 
As part of its internal control procedures, the 
Company has a Whistle-blowing Policy that 
is communicated throughout the Group. This 
policy provides employees with the opportunity 
to report suspected unethical or illegal 
corporate conduct confidentially and 
anonymously. All reports of suspected 
unethical or illegal corporate conduct are 
independently investigated and tracked from 
inception to resolution and, where necessary, 
actions are taken to rectify any weakness in 
systems that may have been identified. 
These actions, and the overall integrity of the 
reporting system, are subject to regular 
scrutiny by the Audit Committee. This process 
is also available to third parties, such as 
suppliers and customers. Subject to 
confidentiality considerations, the outcome 
of each investigation is provided insofar as 
is possible, to the complainant.
Andy Hamment is currently the Company’s 
Senior Independent Director. Mark Vernon is 
to become the Senior Independent Director, 
when Andy retires from the Board in April 
2016. This position provides employees and 
third parties with an alternative channel of 
communication to resolve issues if they have 
a concern that the Chairman, Group Chief 
Executive or Group Finance Director have failed 
to resolve, or where such contact with them is 
not appropriate. 
Managing external sales agents
The Board recognises the potential bribery and 
corruption risks posed by the markets in which 
the Group operates and, in particular, the use 
of third-party intermediaries it engages. All 
external sales agents and representatives 
working on behalf of Senior across the world 
are required to operate in compliance with the 
Code of Conduct. Local management conducts 
a due diligence and risk assessment process 
prior to engaging or re-appointing any sales 
agent and issues them with the Code, ensuring 
that they understand, acknowledge and accept 
its requirements. In 2013, the Board updated 
Senior plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015  45 the Code of Conduct and improved the guidance 
it provided to the Group’s operations, giving 
detailed information on how they should conduct 
due diligence and risk assess sales agents. 
A further update will be issued during 2016.
Managing gifts and hospitality
The Board recognises that gifts and hospitality 
have the potential to create a conflict of 
interest, or the perception of a conflict of 
interest. As a result, there is a Group policy 
restricting the receiving and giving of gifts 
and hospitality from, and to, third parties. 
This policy requires that all gifts and hospitality 
must be recorded. The Internal Audit function 
assesses compliance with the Group’s gifts 
and hospitality policy during audit visits.
Improvements for 2016
In 2016, a new Code of Conduct is to be 
adopted and issued to the Group’s operations, 
representatives and agents. The Board will 
continue with the measures already 
established, to ensure that all employees and 
sales agents understand the Code of Conduct, 
as appropriate, and comply with them; it will 
continue to ensure that all ethical concerns 
raised are thoroughly investigated. The Board 
will also give increased focus to this area, by 
strengthening internal audits on compliance 
with the Code, ensuring that the training and 
awareness of employees is fully effective and 
that the Code has been issued and 
acknowledged by all sales agents.
Section D: Remuneration
The Remuneration Report on pages 53 to 68 
describes the Board’s approach to remuneration 
matters. The Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
was approved by shareholders at the Company’s 
AGM 2014 and became effective on 
25 April 2014.
Section E: Relations with shareholders
The Company maintains regular contact with 
its institutional shareholders and continued to 
consult with its major shareholders during 
2015. Twice a year, the Group Chief Executive, 
Group Finance Director and Head of Investor 
Relations and Leadership Development 
undertake a series of meetings with the 
Company’s major shareholders, following the 
announcement of the full-year and interim 
results, to discuss both the Board’s strategic 
objectives and the detailed performance of the 
business. During 2015, the Company’s 
Non-executive Chairman also attended the 
full-year and interim results announcements made 
to analysts, in March and July respectively. 
No major shareholder requested a meeting 
with any of the Non-executive Directors during 
the year. The Senior Independent Director is 
also available to attend meetings with major 
shareholders upon request, so providing an 
alternative channel of communication between 
the Company and its shareholders. 
The Company makes constructive use of 
its AGMs to communicate with its private 
shareholders. A presentation on the Company’s 
annual performance was given following 
completion of the formal business at the AGM 
2015, and a copy of the presentation, together 
with other investor relations material, is 
available on the Company’s website.
The total issued share capital of the Company 
as at 3 March 2015 (the date of the Notice of 
Meeting for the AGM 2015), was 418.1 million 
ordinary shares of 10p each. The total number 
of proxy votes received for the AGM 2015 
represented approximately 77.36%  
(2014 – 71.70%) of the issued share capital of 
the Company. All resolutions put to shareholders 
at the AGM 2015 were passed on a poll. 
Details of the electronic poll voting received by 
the Company for the AGM 2015 resolutions are 
set out in the table below. 
Details of the votes to be received by the 
Company for the AGM 2016 resolutions will 
be made available on the Company’s website 
following the close of the meeting.

NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE REPORT
OVERVIEW
The Nominations Committee is chaired by 
myself, and comprised of all Non-executive 
Directors. The Group Company Secretary acts 
as Secretary to the Committee. Senior 
managers and advisers are invited to attend 
a meeting when deemed appropriate. There 
were three scheduled meetings of the 
Committee in 2015. Two members constitute 
a quorum for the Nominations Committee. 
There was full attendance at each of the three 
meetings of the Nominations Committee held 
in 2015. All of the Committee’s attendance 
records are shown on page 38.
The Committee is tasked with administering 
the process for appointments, debating 
succession planning, regularly reviewing such 
processes and overseeing the composition of 
the Board. The Nominations Committee’s full 
Terms of Reference can be found on the 
Company’s website. 
The Nominations Committee enlists external 
consultancy firms to assist in the appointment 
of Directors to the Board. The Company 
provides the appointed consultancy firm with 
a role description, together with the required 
skills and personal attributes to be considered. 
The consultancy firm then filters a list of 
candidates down to a number of those that 
it feels meet the skills and attributes required. 
The consultancy firm then conducts preliminary 
interviews with the selected candidates, then 
referring them to Senior for interview, together 
with a written analysis on each candidate. 
Candidates are subsequently interviewed by 
a number of members of the Board, with the 
final recruitment decision being taken by the 
Board as a whole. 
Following the appointment of a Director, a full 
and comprehensive induction programme is 
provided by the Company. Within the induction 
process, areas such as financial forecasts, 
Group strategy and philosophy are explained, 
together with other relevant topics. Visits to the 
Group’s operations are also undertaken; this 
involves the new Director meeting local 
management teams and learning about the 
key issues faced by each operation.
The Nominations Committee and the Board 
has regard to Lord Davies’ review into Women 
on Boards (February 2011). The Board is 
dedicated to promoting diversity and equality of 
all kinds throughout the Group, regardless of 
geography or position. The Committee regularly 
discusses the benefits of diversification with 
regard to the Board and its Committees.
In 2015, the Nominations Committee sought 
to bring additional skills and experience to 
the Board through the recruitment of a new 
Non-executive Director or Directors. By the 
end of 2015, Susan Brennan had accepted the 
position of Non-executive Director and her 
appointment to the Board became effective 
on 1 January 2016.
APPOINTMENT OF NON-EXECUTIVE 
DIRECTOR
In recruiting the new Non-executive Director, 
the Committee was keen to ensure that the 
chosen candidate would have the right 
personality to fit the Group’s culture and the 
necessary skills and experience to deliver 
continued strong results, both financially and 
operationally, in order to develop and oversee 
the future progression of the Group. A 
comprehensive recruitment process was 
undertaken with the support of Korn Ferry.
The Committee, after taking into account all 
relevant factors, recommended to the Board 
that Susan Brennan be appointed a Non-
executive Director of the Company.
The Board agreed the Committee’s 
recommendation and Susan Brennan accepted 
the appointment in December 2015, 
commencing on 1 January 2016.
SUCCESSION PLANNING
In 2015 the Committee increased its focus 
on the potential of internal employees and 
succession planning within the Group. The 
Head of Leadership Development is currently 
conducting a review of senior executive 
succession planning, containing details of 
proposed talent development, the methods 
for identifying and developing potential internal 
candidates, ensuring that there is an 
appropriate balance of internal and external 
recruitment for the most senior positions. The 
Committee also spends time discussing the 
issue of succession planning for the various 
Board level roles.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CHANGES
Following the conclusion of the AGM to be 
held on 22 April 2016, Andy Hamment is 
to retire as a Non-executive Director of the 
Company and Senior Independent Director; 
Mark E. Vernon will become the Senior 
Independent Director on that date.
INDEPENDENCE
The Nominations Committee and the Board still 
consider all of the Non-executive Directors to 
be fully independent and free from conflicting 
interests which may cause difficulties whilst 
carrying out their duties. Senior considers the 
current Non-executive Directors to be proactive 
in contributing their respective experiences and 
skills gained from various industries.
Conflicts of interests are fully disclosed by 
Directors upon appointment and are reviewed 
on an annual basis. 
Following the changes made in 2015, I am 
confident that we have the desired diversity 
of skills, people, experience and a positive 
attitude that will guide us in delivering 
shareholder value and forging a positive 
direction for the year ahead.

Senior plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015  49 SIGNIFICANT RISKS CONSIDERED BY THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
Significant risks considered by the 
Committee How the risk was addressed by the Committee
Goodwill impairment 
The carrying value of goodwill relies 
on assumptions and judgements made 
by executive management. 
Management performed an  
annual impairment assessment  
at 31 December 2015 for all  
Cash Generating Units (“CGUs”)  
to which goodwill is allocated. 
The Audit Committee recognises the carrying value of goodwill as a key area of judgement and 
as such closely reviews executive management’s assumptions at both year-end and the half-year. 
An impairment loss of £18.8m has been recognised in relation to the full carrying value of goodwill 
allocated to the GA CGU, the Group’s high precision machined component operation based in 
Wisconsin, USA. As noted in the Annual Report & Accounts 2014, visibility of “off-highway” land 
vehicles for use in agricultural markets and mining operations was less clear as the slowing GDP 
growth rate in China impacted commodity prices. During 2015 this has led to lower activity levels 
than had previously been anticipated at GA which intensified in the second half of the year and 
significantly reduced visibility of a possible reversal to the current cyclical down trend. Hence, the 
value in use assessment indicated that, as at 31 December 2015, the GA CGU no longer had 
sufficient headroom over its carrying value of goodwill.
In the case of the Thermal CGU, its recoverable amount exceeded its carrying value by £9.5m. 
However, whilst the business has been trading in line with the expectation set out in the Senior plc 
Annual Report & Accounts 2014, the Directors acknowledge that a reasonable possible change in 
the current assumptions of a further 24% reduction in the risk adjusted cash flow projections would 
result in the recoverable amount of this CGU reducing to a level comparable with its carrying value. 
Factors that could lead to lower cash flows than currently estimated over the initial five-year period 
include: not meeting customers’ expectations for quality and on-time delivery performance which 
would result in additional rework and inspection costs to be incurred; not securing sufficient new 
business with existing customers; and not introducing sufficient new growth customers.
In the case of the LPE and Senior Flexonics Upeca CGUs, their respective recoverable amounts 
exceed their carrying values by £15.9m and £16.0m. However, during the year and in particular in 
the second half of 2015, lower activity levels than previously anticipated have been experienced in 
the Industrial Process Control market due to the down-trend in oil and commodity prices. While this 
has adversely affected trading levels for LPE and Senior Flexonics Upeca in 2015, their mid-term 
expectations over the initial five-year period indicate a reversal to the current cyclical slow-down for 
their markets and prospects. The Directors acknowledge that a reasonable possible change in the 
current assumptions of a further 27% and 32% reduction in their respective risk adjusted cash flow 
projections would result in the recoverable amounts of these CGUs to reduce to a level comparable 
with their carrying values.
Following the annual impairment assessment of all other CGUs, the Audit Committee was satisfied 
that no additional charge for impairment of goodwill was required.
Acquisition accounting  
The Group acquired 100% of the issued 
share capital of Lymington Engineering 
(LPE) Limited on 31 March 2015 for a total 
consideration of £44.6m and Steico 
Industries, Inc. and its trading facility  
on 17 December 2015 for a total 
consideration of £60.3m. There is 
judgement in determining the valuation 
of the intangible assets and associated 
goodwill with the acquisitions.
The Group recognised goodwill of £17.1m and intangible assets of £27.9m on the acquisition of LPE. 
The Group recognised goodwill of £21.2m and intangible assets of £28.4m on the acquisition of 
Steico. The Audit Committee held discussions with executive management regarding the procedures 
performed to fair value the assets and liabilities acquired. The Committee noted the use of external 
valuation experts in order to form the necessary judgements.
The external auditor provided the Audit Committee with details of the audit work performed to 
assess that the assets and liabilities are held at fair value.
The Audit Committee was satisfied that the assumptions used were appropriate and that the assets 
and liabilities are valued at fair value.
Provisions  
Provisions or accruals are held where 
management considers there is an 
obligation, payment is probable and the 
amount payable can be reliably estimated.
Provisions held by the Group include 
but are not limited to:
• those held against inventory; and
• central UK and US tax provisions.
The Audit Committee considered the basis upon which management had made its accounting 
judgements to determine the level of provisions. These were further discussed with the 
external auditor.
The Audit Committee believes there are no reportable issues arising from these significant  
areas of judgement.
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
50  Senior plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015
GOVERNANCE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
The Audit Committee considers that it was 
beneficial for the Company to retain Deloitte 
for this non-audit work because of the firm’s 
expertise in this area and knowledge of the 
Group. The Audit Committee continues to 
closely monitor the nature and level of such 
non-audit work, in order to balance objectivity 
and value for money. 
Policy on tendering 
The Committee notes that the transitional 
guidance on audit tendering issued by the FRC 
indicated that the Company should tender the 
audit, at the latest, at the time of the next audit 
partner rotation currently scheduled for 2019. 
The Committee also notes the final Order from 
the Competition & Markets Authority (which 
applied for financial periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2015) and the new EU 
Regulation under which it is likely that audit 
firms in the UK will need to rotate every 
20 years with a tender after 10 years. The 
transition rules set out in the Order and the EU 
Regulation mean Senior is required to rotate 
auditors by 2023. During 2015 further EU 
guidance became available detailing the 
prohibited non-audit services such as tax 
services, which Deloitte will be unable to 
perform after 31 December 2016. In light of 
this new guidance and the current market 
practice to tender audit services before the 
FRC deadline, the Board has decided to put the 
audit out to tender in the second quarter of 
2016.
Deloitte will continue to be the Group’s auditor, 
subject to shareholder approval, for the year 
ending 31 December 2016, but due to the 
longevity of Deloitte’s appointment they will 
not be invited to tender and therefore new 
auditors will be identified for the year ending 
31 December 2017. A hand over process will 
take place around the 2016 year-end.
EXTERNAL AUDIT 
Independence of the external auditor and 
policy on non-audit services
To fulfil its responsibility regarding the 
independence of the external auditor, the Audit 
Committee reviewed:
• a report from the external auditor describing 
the arrangements that had been made to 
identify, report and manage any conflicts of 
interest and to maintain its independence; 
• the overall extent of non-audit services 
provided by the external auditor; and
• the FRC’s Audit Inspection Unit public report 
on Deloitte.
The Audit Committee’s policy in respect of 
services provided by the external auditor is 
as follows:
• the external auditor is invited to provide 
services which, in its position as auditor, it 
must or is best placed to undertake. This 
includes formalities relating to borrowings, 
shareholder and other circulars, various other 
regulatory reports and certain work in 
respect of larger acquisitions and disposals;
• the auditor may provide tax compliance and 
advice where it is best suited. In all material 
cases such work is put out to tender; and
• other services may not be provided 
where precluded by ethical standards or 
where the Audit Committee believes that 
it would compromise audit independence 
and objectivity.
All proposed contracts for services to be 
provided by the auditor in excess of £25,000 
require the Audit Committee’s approval. 
In 2015, the level of non-audit work undertaken 
by Deloitte slightly decreased, as the Group 
reviewed fewer of its tax arrangements and 
undertook fewer projects which required 
advice and assistance from professional 
advisers. Fees for each category of non-audit 
work undertaken in the year are shown in the 
table below:
Fees
£m
Other tax advisory services 0.2
Total non-audit fees 0.2
Non-audit fees as a % of total  
audit fees 25%
The Audit Committee will be responsible for 
the tender process which will begin in March 
2016, with a selected number of audit firms 
receiving a formal invitation to tender. These 
audit firms will be selected on the basis of their 
appropriate experience, expertise and resources 
to perform the audit to a high standard.
The tender process will involve access to a 
data room, detailed meetings with 
management and selected site visits. The Audit 
Committee will then conduct final interviews 
and selection with the shortlisted firms and 
select the firm to be recommended to 
shareholders at the 2017 AGM.
Assessment of external audit 
effectiveness
As in prior years, the Audit Committee 
reviewed the effectiveness of the external 
auditor process, by assessing a range of key 
areas. In 2015, the Secretary presented the 
Audit Committee with a framework of 
questions to facilitate a debate and to assist 
the Audit Committee in assessing the level of 
auditor effectiveness. The framework required 
Audit Committee members to consider which 
areas of performance needed future focus by 
the auditor, the areas where the auditor was 
meeting expectations and those where the 
auditor was considered to have a special strength. 
The Audit Committee discussed: the audit 
partner and the team as a whole; the audit 
planning approach and its execution; the role 
of executive management in the audit process; 
communications by the auditor to the Audit 
Committee and how it supported the work of 
the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee 
also discussed what insights the auditor had 
provided and where it had added value to the 
overall audit process. The Committee 
concluded that the auditor had challenged 
the thinking of the Company and the Audit 
Committee on a number of significant issues 
and maintained its independence. 
Feedback about the effectiveness of the audit 
process from the local management teams 
was also considered by the Audit Committee. 
Following completion of the assessment 
process, the Audit Committee concluded that it 
is satisfied with the effectiveness of the external 
auditor; as a consequence the Audit Committee 
has recommended to the Board that Deloitte 
LLP be re-appointed as auditor for 2016.
Senior plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015  51 AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
CONCLUSION
As a result of its work during the year, the Audit 
Committee has concluded that it has acted in 
accordance with its Terms of Reference. At its 
meeting held on 22 February 2016, the Audit 
Committee considered each section of and the 
Annual Report & Accounts 2015 as a whole, 
as proposed by the Company; it reached a 
conclusion and advised the Board that it 
considered the Annual Report and Accounts 
2015 to be fair, balanced and understandable 
and that it provided the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
business model and strategy. The Chairman 
of the Audit Committee will be available at the 
AGM 2016 to answer any questions about 
the work of the Committee.
APPROVAL
This Report was reviewed and approved by the 
Audit Committee and signed on its behalf by:
Giles Kerr 
Chairman of the Audit Committee 
26 February 2016
Following the review, the Audit Committee 
and Group Finance Director decided to pursue 
a ‘co-source’ model of Internal Audit and 
engaged PwC to undertake a number of 
specific targeted financial control reviews 
during the second half of 2015.
The Audit Committee and Group Finance 
Director also considered the increased 
requirements for listed companies around risk 
management and continuous assessment of 
risk. In light of a future “co-source” model and 
increased regulatory requirements it was 
decided to create a new role for the Group of 
Head of Risk and Assurance. This person would 
report to the Group Finance Director with a 
dotted line to the Chair of the Audit Committee 
and be responsible for overseeing the risk 
management activities of the Group and Internal 
Audit. This role has now been filled.
As set out on pages 26 to 31, the Group has 
also significantly improved its risk management 
procedures during the year and these have 
been reviewed by the Audit Committee.
The Non-executive Directors are actively 
encouraged to visit the Group’s operating 
businesses unaccompanied by Executive 
Directors. This enables them to meet the 
local management teams and employees and 
also undertake site tours to review matters 
including production methods, health and 
safety and the status of internal audit findings. 
In 2015, a total of 18 site visits were undertaken 
by the Chairman and Non-executive Directors. 
These visits by the Non-executive Directors 
are viewed by the Audit Committee as 
making a positive contribution to the internal 
control framework.
INTERNAL AUDIT
The Audit Committee is required to assist the 
Board in fulfilling its responsibilities relating to 
the effectiveness, resourcing and plans of the 
Group internal audit function. 
2015 was a transitional year for the Group’s 
Internal Audit function. In January 2015, the 
Group’s Head of Internal Audit gave notice of 
his decision to leave the Group, to pursue a 
new opportunity, and then left the Group at the 
end of March. Rather than immediately 
replacing this role, the Audit Committee, along 
with the Group Finance Director decided to take 
the opportunity to undertake a benchmarking 
review of Internal Audit within Senior and 
engaged PwC to perform this review. The scope 
of the review covered the following areas:
• Organisational strategy
• Human resources
• Working practices
• Communication and reporting
• Knowledge management
• Performance management
• Use of technology
The review concluded that the Group’s 
approach to Internal Audit was fit for purpose 
and in line with that to be expected of similar 
sized companies within the FTSE 250, but 
that it would benefit from a targeted ‘back 
to basics’ refresh, with particular focus on 
financial controls.

GOVERNANCE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
REMUNERATION REPORT: ANNUAL STATEMENT
The Terms of Reference (”TOR”) of the 
Committee had not been subject to a full 
review for a number of years and following the 
change of Group Chief Executive it was felt 
appropriate to revisit them to ensure that they 
were still appropriate and unambiguous. The 
amended TOR of the Committee can be found 
in the Corporate Governance area of the Senior 
plc website (www.seniorplc.com) within the 
Committees of the Board section.
In January 2015, the Committee reviewed the 
appropriateness of the performance conditions 
relating to the performance shares granted 
under the Senior plc 2014 Long-term Incentive 
Plan (the “2014 Plan”). Taking due 
consideration of the prevailing economic and 
market conditions, the Committee decided that 
the performance conditions used for the grant 
in 2014 were still suitably stretching for the 
2015 award of performance shares. However, 
having reviewed and considered the out turn of 
2015, the Company’s strategic goals and the 
current uncertainty in the markets, the 
Committee has decided to amend the EPS 
performance condition for the performance 
shares to be granted in 2016 under the 2014 
Plan; details which can be seen on page 68.  
In making this amendment, the Committee 
considers the new targets are no less 
challenging in the light of current 
circumstances and within the approved 
Remuneration Policy. 
Furthermore, the Committee reviewed the key 
performance indicators (“KPIs”) for the 2015 
annual bonus and it was agreed that the 
earnings per share and cash flow targets were 
still appropriate and that the target levels were 
stretching without encouraging inappropriate 
levels of risk. The outturn of the 2015 annual 
bonus for the executive Directors was 15% of 
annual salary which is considerably lower than 
2014, which reflects the difficult trading 
conditions experienced throughout the year. 
The vesting of long-term incentives has also 
reduced, based on the Company’s 2015 
financial performance. The Committee has not 
exercised any discretion to adjust performance 
targets as a result of events that have taken 
place during the year. The Committee will be 
reviewing the structure of the annual bonus 
during 2016 to ensure that the performance 
indicators remain appropriate. Any potential 
changes would be proposed and implemented 
in 2017.
DEAR SHAREHOLDER
Senior’s primary strategic objective of creating 
long-term sustainable growth in shareholder 
value has remained constant during 2015. 
Senior’s culture of empowerment of 
autonomous, but collaborative, operations 
working within a well-defined control 
framework is a key element to realising its 
strategic goals. Senior’s variable remuneration 
arrangements for the executive Directors are in 
our view aligned with those of our 
shareholders, whereby executives are 
incentivised to meet both long- and short-term 
earnings growth, as well as cash flow targets.
The Committee is satisfied that the 
remuneration framework reinforces the link 
between pay and performance and rewards 
senior executives appropriately. No changes to 
the Policy are being proposed for 2016, 
however for ease of reference we have 
included the Policy once again in the 2015 
Annual Report, although we will only be inviting 
shareholders to approve the Annual Report on 
Remuneration, in accordance with the Large 
and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2013 (“the 2013 Regulations”), at 
the AGM 2016.
During the year, the Committee reviewed its 
stance with regard to the disclosure of annual 
bonus targets for Senior’s executive Directors. 
The policy of the Committee is ‘not to disclose 
specific targets while still commercially 
sensitive’. Taking into consideration comments 
received from some shareholder bodies, as 
well as the commercial issues, the Committee 
agreed that they would continue not to disclose 
the specific targets for the year in which they 
operate. However, from now on the specific 
bonus for the year being reported on will be 
fully disclosed retrospectively; this information 
can be seen on page 63.
Having taken due consideration of the 
development and performance of the Finance 
Director since his recruitment in 2013, the 
Committee in line with the approved policy has 
decided in 2016 to regularise the quantum of 
the long term incentive grant and the pension 
allowance with the other executive Director, to 
150% and 20% of basic salary respectively. 
The Committee believes these changes will aid 
the retention of a key executive.
We have retained the same structure as last 
year’s Remuneration Report, whereby it 
consists of three sections:
1. this Annual Statement;
2.  a Policy Report, which describes the 
Company’s policy for the Remuneration of 
executive and non-executive Directors and 
is unchanged from that which was approved 
by shareholders for three years at the 2014 
Annual General Meeting and which is not 
subject to audit; and
3.  the Annual Report on Remuneration on 
pages 60 to 68, produced in accordance 
with the 2013 Regulations and the relevant 
provisions of the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Conduct Authority. Parts of the 
Annual Report on Remuneration are subject 
to audit, which provides details of the 
Directors’ emoluments, shareholdings, 
long-term incentive awards and pensions 
for the year ended 31 December 2015 and 
intentions for 2016.
Celia Baxter 
Chair of the Remuneration Committee
Senior plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015  53 REMUNERATION REPORT: POLICY
In determining remuneration for the executive Directors and other senior managers, the Remuneration Committee seeks to maintain a 
competitive programme which enables the Company to attract and retain the highest calibre of executive.
Performance-related elements of remuneration form a significant proportion of the total remuneration package of each executive Director, 
details of which are set out below. These performance-related elements, which take into account the Company’s risk policies and systems, are 
designed to align the Directors’ interests with those of shareholders and to reward executive Directors for performance at the highest levels.
POLICY FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS

RECRUITMENT OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Salaries for newly appointed Directors will be set to reflect their skills 
and experience, the Company’s intended pay positioning and the market 
rate for the role.
Where it is appropriate to offer a below median salary initially, the 
Committee will have the discretion to allow phased salary increases 
over time for newly appointed Directors, even though this may involve 
increases in excess of the rate for the wider workforce and inflation.
Benefits will be provided in line with those offered to other employees, 
with national or international relocation expenses/arrangements 
(e.g. schooling, tax equalisation) provided for if necessary. 
The aggregate incentive offered to new recruits will be no higher than 
that outlined in the Policy report on pages 54 and 55. The Remuneration 
Committee has flexibility to grant share awards of up to 200% of salary 
upon recruitment. Different performance measures may be set initially 
for the annual bonus and LTIP, taking into account the responsibilities of 
the individual, and the point in the financial year that they joined. Any 
increases in incentive quantum offered above this limit would be 
contingent on the Company receiving shareholder approval for an 
amendment to its approved policy at its next General Meeting.
Current entitlements (benefits, bonus, share schemes) may be bought 
out on terms that are no more favourable than a like-for-like basis (with 
a comparable time horizon, fair value and subject to performance 
conditions). Existing incentive arrangements will be used to the fullest 
extent possible, although awards may also be granted outside of these 
schemes if necessary and as permitted under the Listing Rules. In the 
case of an internal hire, any outstanding variable pay awarded in relation 
to the previous role will be allowed to pay out according to its terms of 
grant (adjusted as relevant to take into account the Board appointment). 
RATIONALE BEHIND PERFORMANCE METRICS AND TARGETS
The performance-related elements take into account the Company’s risk 
policies and systems and are designed to align the Directors’ interests 
with those of shareholders. Variable pay elements aim to reward 
executive Directors for performance at the highest levels and as such, 
the Committee aims to set targets that are both stretching and 
achievable. All targets are set on a sliding scale. The Committee 
reviews the annual bonus measures set for all of the Company’s senior 
executives (not only the executive Directors) every year in order to 
ensure that they are aligned with the Company’s strategy and annual 
goals and to ensure that bonus arrangements amongst the Company’s 
senior executive team are consistent. 
The annual bonus may include a mix of financial and non-financial 
measures reflecting the key annual priorities of the Group. The financial 
metrics currently include two of the Company’s KPIs: cash flow which 
is a key measure of the business’s ability to fund future acquisitions; and 
EPS which will reflect the Group’s ability to expand into new regions and 
product markets and increase the profitability of the existing operations. 
If non-financial measures are selected these may include reference to 
the Group’s environmental, safety and organisational goals.
The measures currently used in the LTIP are EPS and relative TSR. 
EPS is a measure of the Company’s overall financial success and TSR 
provides an external assessment of the Company’s performance against 
its competitors. It also aligns the rewards received by executives with 
the returns received by shareholders. The Committee will review the 
choice of performance measures and the appropriateness of the 
performance targets prior to each LTIP grant. In particular, the EPS 
targets are reviewed prior to each grant by taking account of internal 
and external expectations of future EPS growth for the business. The 
Committee reserves the discretion to set different targets for future 
awards, without consulting with shareholders, providing that, in the 
opinion of the Committee, the new targets are no less challenging in 
light of the circumstances at the time than those used previously. The 
targets for awards granted under this Remuneration Policy are set out 
in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND  
EMPLOYEE PAY
The remuneration policy for the executive Directors is designed 
with regard to the policy for employees across the Group as a whole. 
There are some differences in the structure of the remuneration policy 
for the executive Directors and other senior employees, which the 
Remuneration Committee believes are necessary to reflect the different 
levels of responsibility of employees across the Company and reflect 
different market norms for different roles. The key differences in 
remuneration policy between the executive Directors and employees 
across the Group are the increased emphasis on performance-related 
pay and the inclusion of a share-based long-term incentive plan for 
executive Directors.
Executive Directors are provided with a competitive package of benefits 
that includes (depending on role) participation in the Group’s occupational 
pension arrangements, provision of a fully expensed car or car allowance, 
private medical insurance, life insurance and income protection.
The majority of Senior’s managers are eligible to participate in annual 
bonus arrangements with challenging targets tied to the performance 
of their employing entity and Division.
Long-term incentives are provided to the most senior executives and 
those anticipated as having the greatest potential to influence 
performance levels within the Company. Lower aggregate incentive 
quantum operates at below executive level with levels driven by the 
impact of the role and market comparatives.
In order to encourage wider employee share ownership, the Company 
operates a Sharesave Plan in which employees in the UK, North America 
and continental Europe, including executive Directors, may participate.
HOW EMPLOYEES’ PAY IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN SETTING 
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR REMUNERATION
The Committee also reviews the salaries of corporate, divisional and 
senior operational managers and therefore is fully cognisant of pay levels 
in the Group when determining the pay of the executive Directors.
In addition, the Committee’s policy is that salary increases for the 
executive Directors and senior executives should not normally be 
greater than the general level of increases awarded to other senior 
managers in Europe and North America, other than when an executive 
changes role or when it is necessary in order to ensure levels of 
remuneration remain market competitive. Increases for the general 
workforce in Europe and North America for 2016 were approximately 
2.4% (2015 – approximately 2.7%).
The Company did not consult with employees when drawing up 
the Directors’ Remuneration Policy set out in this part of the 
Remuneration report.

Group is described below and is designed to support a smooth transition from the Company taking into account the interests of shareholders:
Component 
of pay
Voluntary resignation 
or termination for cause
Death, ill health, disability, retirement
excluding redundancy
Departure on
agreed terms
Base salary, 
pension and 
benefits
Paid for the proportion of 
the notice period worked 
and any untaken holidays 
prorated to the leaving date
Paid up to the date of death or leaving, including any untaken 
holidays prorated to such date. In the case of ill health, a payment in 
lieu of notice may be made and, according to circumstances, may 
be subject to mitigation. In such circumstances some benefits such 
as company car or medical insurance may be retained until the end 
of the notice period
Treatment will 
normally fall 
between the two 
treatments 
described in the 
previous columns, 
subject to the 
discretion of the 
Committee and 
the terms of any 
termination 
agreement
Annual  
bonus cash
Cessation of employment 
during a bonus year will 
normally result in no cash 
bonus being paid
Cessation of employment during a bonus year or after the year end 
but prior to the normal bonus payment date will result in cash and 
deferred bonus being paid and prorated for the relevant portion of 
the financial year worked and performance achieved
Annual bonus 
deferred shares
Unvested deferred share 
awards will lapse
In the case of the death of an executive Director, all deferred shares 
will be transferred to the estate as soon as possible after death. In 
all other cases, subject to the discretion of the Committee, unvested 
deferred shares will be transferred to the individual on a date 
determined by the Committee
LTIP share 
awards
Unvested LTIP share 
awards will lapse
Subject to the discretion of the Committee, unvested LTIP share 
awards will remain subject to the relevant performance conditions 
and normally be measured at the original vesting date. The awards 
will normally be prorated for the relevant proportion of the 
performance period worked. However, in the case of the death of 
an executive Director, the Committee will determine the extent of 
vesting within 12 months of the date of death
Options under 
Sharesave
As per HMRC regulations As per HMRC regulations
Other None Statutory payments and disbursements such as any legal costs and 
outplacement fees
Notes 
a) The Committee will have the authority to settle any legal claims against the Company e.g. for unfair dismissal etc, that might arise on termination.
b) There are no enhanced provisions in relation to a change of control.

agreed to extend their appointments, in accordance with their original letters of

HOW SHAREHOLDER VIEWS ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT
The Remuneration Committee considers shareholder feedback received 
in relation to the AGM each year and guidance from shareholder 
representative bodies more generally. Shareholders were consulted in 
2013 when formulating the Remuneration Policy. Consultation with 
shareholders was constructive and did not result in any significant 
changes being made to the Remuneration Policy or to the 2014 LTIP. 
The Committee consults proactively with its major shareholders and 
intends to continue working closely with shareholders in future. 
LEGACY ARRANGEMENTS
For the avoidance of doubt, having received shareholder approval at the 
2014 AGM of this Policy Report, authority is given to the Company to 
honour any commitments entered into with current or former Directors 
(such as the payment of a pension or the unwinding of legacy share 
schemes) that have been disclosed to shareholders in previous 
remuneration reports and the recruitment arrangements entered into 
with Derek Harding. Details of any payments to former Directors will 
be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise.
DISCRETIONS OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Committee operates the Group’s various incentive plans according 
to their respective rules and in accordance with HMRC rules where 
relevant. To ensure the efficient administration of these plans, the 
Committee may apply certain operational discretions. These include 
the following:
• selecting the participants for the annual bonus plan and LTIP awards;
• determining the timing of grants and/or payments;
• determining the quantum of grants and/or payments (within the limits 
set out in the policy table on page 55);
• adjusting the constituents of the TSR comparator group;
• determining the extent of vesting based on the assessment of 
performance;
• determining “good leaver” status and extent of vesting in the case 
of the LTIP and deferred shares;
• determining the extent of vesting in the case of the LTIP in the event 
of a change of control;
• making the appropriate adjustments required in certain circumstances 
(e.g. rights issues, corporate restructuring events, variation of capital 
and special dividends); and
• undertaking the annual review of weighting of performance 
measures, and setting targets for the annual bonus plan and LTIP 
from year to year.
The Committee may vary the performance conditions to apply to LTIP 
awards if an event occurs which causes the Committee to consider that 
it would be appropriate to amend the performance conditions, provided 
the Committee considers the varied conditions are fair and reasonable 
and not materially less challenging than the original conditions would 
have been but for the event in question.
Senior plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015  59 SUMMARY OF THE COMMITTEE’S TERMS OF REFERENCE
The Terms of Reference of the Remuneration Committee, available in 
full on the Company’s website, are summarised below:
• determine and agree with the Board the framework or broad policy 
for the remuneration of the Chairman of the Board, the executive 
Directors and other members of the executive management as it is 
designated to consider;
• within the terms of the agreed policy and in consultation with the 
Chairman and/or Group Chief Executive, as appropriate, determine 
the total individual remuneration package of the Chairman, each 
executive Director, and other designated senior executives including 
bonuses, incentive payments and share options or other share awards;
• approve the design of, and determine targets for, any performance-
related pay plans operated by the Company and approve the total 
annual payments made under such plans;
• review the design of all share incentive plans for approval by the 
Board and shareholders. For any such plans, determine each year 
whether awards will be made and if so, the overall amount of such 
awards, the individual awards to executive Directors, and other 
designated senior executives and the performance targets to be used;
• determine the policy for, and scope of, pension arrangements for 
each executive Director and other designated senior executives;
• ensure that contractual terms on termination, and any payments 
made, are fair to the individual and the Company, that failure is not 
rewarded and that the duty to mitigate loss is recognised; and
• oversee any major changes in employee benefits structures 
throughout the Group.

OTHER ATTENDEES AT REMUNERATION COMMITTEE MEETINGS
The Group Chief Executive attends meetings by invitation and the Group 
Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee but no 
executive Director or other employee is present during discussions 
relating to their own remuneration.
ADVISERS
Before recommending proposals for Board approval, the Remuneration 
Committee may seek advice from external remuneration consultants to 
ensure that it is fully aware of comparative external remuneration 
practice as well as shareholder, legislative and regulatory developments. 
The Committee also considers publicly available sources of information 
relating to executive remuneration.
All advisers to the Remuneration Committee are appointed and 
instructed by the Committee. During the year, the Committee was 
advised by New Bridge Street (an Aon Hewitt company, part of Aon plc) 
in relation to ad hoc remuneration matters, Slaughter & May in relation 
to the updating of the Senior plc 2006 Savings-Related Share Option 
Scheme rules, and Towers Watson in relation to the review of the 
remuneration packages of the executive Directors and senior managers. 
New Bridge Street, Slaughter & May and Towers Watson have no other 
connection with the Company. During 2015, the Company incurred fees 
of £9,883 from New Bridge Street, £14,400 from Towers Watson and 
£1,750 from Slaughter & May and these costs were based on a 
combination of hourly rates and fixed fees for specific items of work.
The Committee does not have a formal policy of subjecting its 
remuneration consultants to a regular fixed-term rotation, although the 
Committee remains cognisant of the need to achieve objective advice 
and good value whilst also benefiting from the consultants’ knowledge 
of the Company. The Committee is satisfied that the advice it has 
received during 2015 has been objective and independent.

(1)  
Mark Rollins’ 2015 total reflects him leaving part way through the year, on 31 May 2015. No compensatory payment was made. His 2015 base salary was £472,000 (2014 – 
£463,000) although he elected to waive £54,000 (2014 – £53,000) of his salary and therefore received a pro-rata salary of £418,000 (2014 – £410,000), representing an 
increase of 1.9%. His bonus for both years was based on salary before waiver. Mark Rollins originally waived part of his salary increase in 2011 so that his percentage increase 
was broadly in line with the average percentage increase awarded to Group employees.
(2)  
David Squires’ 2015 total reflects him joining part way through the year, on 1 May 2015. His single figure remuneration total includes his One-off Award consisting of 4,770 
shares with a value of £14,906 and long-term incentive awards with a face a value of £287,500. Further information on his One-off Award can be found on page 65.
(3)  
Taxable benefits include the provision of a fully expensed company car or car allowance and private medical insurance. The amount in respect of Mark Vernon, a US-based 
Director, relates to the cost of travel to Board Meetings in the UK. Until April 2015, HMRC regulations required Mark Vernon’s flights to attend Board Meetings to be treated by 
the Company as home-to-office travel, which meant these air travel costs were treated as taxable benefits. From April 2015 air travel was no longer deemed to be home-to-
office travel and therefore from that date the only costs recognised in the table included accommodation and travel costs incurred within the UK.
(4)  
Awards under the deferred bonus award, the Enhanced SMIS, in respect of 2015 performance will be granted in March 2016. The deferred bonus element that is to be granted 
in the form of shares to David Squires and Derek Harding in March 2016 is included in the cash bonus figure and will be equivalent in value to 5% of 2015 base salary, namely 
£15,350 and £15,750 respectively.
(5)  
20.6% of the 2013 LTIP Award is due to vest in March 2016 for David Squires and Mark Rollins and in September 2016 for Derek Harding. Mark Rollins’ 2015 LTIP award shall 
be prorated to reflect the period of time served during the relevant LTIP performance period, namely, 29/36ths. As the LTIP awards had not vested at the date this report was 
signed, the average market value of the shares over the last three months of 2015 of 240.8p has been used to determine the value for the purposes of the single total figure. 
Mark Rollins’ 2014 comparator LTIP figure has been re-stated from the figure shown in the Annual Report and Accounts 2014 to reflect the difference in value of the 2012 LTIP 
award on the actual date of vesting on 1 April 2015 of £3.21p and the estimated value of the LTIP award having used the average market value of the shares over the last three 
months of 2014 of 275.0p. Consequently, his 2014 total figure has also been restated to reflect changes in the LTIP valuation. Further details on the performance conditions 
can be found on page 63.
FEES RECEIVED FOR OUTSIDE APPOINTMENTS
Mark Rollins was appointed a non-executive director of The Vitec Group plc on 2 October 2013 and received total fees of £18,000 during the year 
until his retirement from the Board of Senior plc on 31 May 2015 (2014 – £41,000). He was also appointed a non-executive director of Tyman plc on 
1 April 2015 and received total fees of £7,700 during the period until his retirement from the Board of Senior plc.
ANNUAL FEES OF NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The non-executive Directors do not participate in any pension, bonus, share incentive or other share option plans. Their remuneration reflects both 
the time given and the contribution made by them to the Company’s affairs during the year, including membership or chairmanship of the Board or 
its Committees. The remuneration of the non-executive Directors is determined by the Board of Directors. The non-executive Directors do not 
participate in any discussion or decisions relating to their own remuneration. Annual fees for the non-executive Directors were increased on 
1 January 2015 and are shown below:

PERFORMANCE AGAINST PERFORMANCE TARGETS FOR ANNUAL BONUS (AUDITED INFORMATION)
Bonuses are earned by reference to the financial year and paid in March following the end of the financial year. Consistent with recent years, the 
bonuses accruing to the executive Directors in respect of 2015 have been determined by adjusted EPS and cash flow performance as set out in

TOTAL PENSION ENTITLEMENTS (AUDITED INFORMATION)
Executive Directors are able to participate in the Senior plc Group Flexible Retirement Plan (“Senior GFRP”), a contract-based Group personal 
pension arrangement with Standard Life, or receive a pension allowance of up to 20% of unrestricted salary.
Derek Harding joined the Senior GFRP on 2 September 2013. His single figure remuneration for pension benefits in 2015 of £54,750 (2014 – £53,625) 
consisted of: a contribution of £30,000 (2014 – £30,000) made to the Senior GFRP on his behalf, being 20% on £150,000 of his salary received; 
and a cash allowance of £24,750 (2014 – £23,625), being 15% of the remainder of his salary received. No salary cap is applied in the calculation of 
Senior GFRP contribution rates for executive Directors; there is a choice of contribution rates for executive Directors, namely: 3% executive, 15% 
employer; or 5% executive, 20% employer.
David Squires’ single figure remuneration for pension benefits in 2015 consisted of a cash allowance of £61,333 (2014 – N/A) this being 20% of his 
salary received.

SIGN-ON AWARDS
David Squires
David Squires was appointed as a Director on 1 May 2015. In structuring his recruitment package, the Committee sought as much as possible to 
partly compensate him for the loss of certain benefits and share awards with and without performance conditions with his previous employer as a 
result of joining Senior. The basis and terms of his sign-on awards were fully disclosed in the 2014 Remuneration Report. By way of compensation, 
the Company provided him the following awards upon his appointment:
i) a one-off award of 4,770 Senior shares;
ii) a long-term incentive award over 32,000 Senior’s shares. The terms of this share award shall mirror the rules and performance conditions 
attaching to the LTIP award made to other Senior executives on 25 March 2013 under the Senior plc 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan. This award 
will ordinarily vest, subject to the achievement of the associated performance conditions, on or after 25 March 2016; and
iii) a long-term incentive award over 60,000 Senior’s shares. The terms of this share award shall mirror the rules and performance conditions 
attaching to the LTIP award made to other Senior executives on 21 March 2014 under the Senior plc 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan. This award 
will ordinarily vest, subject to the achievement of the associated performance conditions, on or after 21 March 2017.
The value of the vested shares described in paragraph i) above, based on the closing mid-market share price on 1 May 2015 of 312.5p was £14,906 
and the combined value of the long-term incentive awards described in paragraphs ii) and iii) above was £287,500. The long-term incentive awards 
described in paragraphs ii) and iii) above were in addition to the LTIP award described on page 64 above. The long-term incentive award of 32,000 
shares is due to vest on 1 May 2016. 20.6% of this award is due to vest, equivalent to 6,592 shares. The value of this award, based on the average 
market value of the shares over the last three months of 2015 of 240.8p, is £15,874.

The Company complies with the dilution guidelines contained within The Investment Association Principles of Executive Remuneration. 
At 31 December 2015, awards outstanding and shares issued in the previous 10 years under all share plans (the Senior plc 2005 Long-Term Incentive 
Plan (“the 2005 LTIP”), the Senior plc 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“the 2014 LTIP”), and the 2006 Savings-Related Share Option Plan (the 
“Sharesave Plan”)) amounted to 6.45% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company. At 31 December 2015, awards outstanding and shares 
issued in the previous 10 years under executive (discretionary) plans (the LTIP) amounted to 3.26% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company.
Typically, share awards are satisfied by the issue of new shares, except for the Enhanced SMIS deferred bonus award, Derek Harding’s Share 
Award and David Squires’ one-off award and long-term incentive awards granted on his appointment where market purchased shares are used. 
The Remuneration Committee monitors the flow rates of the Company’s share plans, in particular before new share awards are made, to ensure 
the flow rates remain within the Investment Association dilution guidelines.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ SHAREHOLDING AND SHARE INTERESTS (AUDITED INFORMATION)
The Remuneration Committee encourages Directors to own shares in the Company and, in support of this policy, it expects executive Directors to 
retain at least 50% of the shares that vest under the LTIP, after allowing for tax liabilities, until a shareholding equivalent in value to 100% of base 
salary is built up. Based on the executive Directors’ 2015 base salaries, David Squires had a holding of 7.4% of base salary and Derek Harding had a 
holding of 63.1% of base salary in the Company’s shares.
Deferred share awards are not taken into account for these purposes. Shares are valued using the Company’s closing share price on 31 December 2015 
of 229.7p.
The table below shows how each Director complies with this requirement.

  The single total figure of remuneration in relation to 2013 has been restated from the figure shown in 2013 Annual Report & Accounts to reflect the difference in the value of

PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN REMUNERATION OF THE GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE
The table below shows how the percentage change in Mark Rollins’ salary, benefits and bonus between 2014 and 2015 compares with the 
percentage change in the average of each of those components of pay for a group of employees. The Committee has selected the Group’s senior 
managers in Europe and North America, as the operations in these territories deliver approximately 90% of the Group’s revenue, and these senior 
managers have broadly similar structured remuneration packages. Businesses acquired by Senior during the year and leavers and joiners in either 
year have been excluded to prevent distortion.

Mark Rollins retired on 31 May 2015, and David Squires joined the Board 1 May 2015. For the purpose of making a valid comparison, the salary increase is based on the change 
in full basic salary of Mark Rollins from £463,000 in 2014 to £472,000 in 2015. In 2014, Mark Rollins waived £53,000 of his salary and received £410,000; he waived £54,000 
of his salary in 2015 and received a prorated salary of £418,000.

For the purposes of making a more valid comparison, the comparator group for the Taxable benefit figure consisted of UK-based senior managers that had a broadly similar 
benefits structure as Mark Rollins that included the use of a company car and receipt of private healthcare. The percentage change of the Group Chief Executive is based on 
Mark Rollins’ five months of benefits in 2015 plus David Squires’ eight months of 2015 benefits.

By Order of the Board
David Squires Derek Harding
Group Chief Executive  Group Finance Director
26 February 2016 26 February 2016
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the 
Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Financial Statements for 
each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required to prepare 
the Group Financial Statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European 
Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare 
the Parent Company Financial Statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable law), including FRS 101 “Reduced 
Disclosure Framework”. Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss 
of the Company for that period. 
In preparing the Parent Company Financial Statements, the Directors 
are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
• state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the Financial Statements; and
• prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis unless it 
is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
In preparing the Group Financial Statements, International Accounting 
Standard 1 requires that Directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that 
provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information; 
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on 
the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and
• make an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of 
the Company and enable them to ensure that the Financial Statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of Financial Statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.

TO THE MEMBERS OF SENIOR PLC
OPINION ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF SENIOR PLC
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the 
Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2015 and 
of the Group’s and the Parent Company’s profit for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union;
• the Parent Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice, including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure 
Framework”; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise the Group Income Statement, the 
Group Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Group and Parent 
Company Balance Sheets, the Group Cash Flow Statement, the Group 
and Parent Company Statements of Changes in Equity and the related 
Notes 1 to 55. The financial reporting framework that has been applied 
in the preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law and 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Parent 
company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice), including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”.
GOING CONCERN AND THE DIRECTORS’ ASSESSMENT OF THE 
PRINCIPAL RISKS THAT WOULD THREATEN THE SOLVENCY OR 
LIQUIDITY OF THE GROUP
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ 
statement regarding the appropriateness of the going concern basis of 
accounting contained within Note 2 to the financial statements and the 
Directors’ statement on the longer-term viability of the Group contained 
within the strategic report on page 25. 
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
• the Directors’ confirmation on page 25 that they have carried out a 
robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including 
those that would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity;
• the disclosures on pages 30 and 31 describe those risks and explain 
how they are being managed or mitigated;
• the Directors’ statement on page 25 about whether they considered 
it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing them and their identification of any material uncertainties 
to the Group’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least 
12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements;
• the Directors’ explanation on page 25 as to how they have assessed 
the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and 
why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement 
as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will 
be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due 
over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures 
drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We agreed with the Directors’ adoption of the going concern basis of 
accounting and we did not identify any such material uncertainties. However, 
because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement 
is not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
INDEPENDENCE
We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors and we confirm that we are independent of the 
Group and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with those standards. We also confirm we have not provided any of the 
prohibited non-audit services referred to in those standards.
OUR ASSESSMENT OF RISKS OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those 
that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the allocation of 
resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
The risks are consistent with the risks identified in the prior year. We have 
also focused our tax risk solely on the provision for uncertain matters 
rather than also considering the recognition of deferred tax assets.
The Audit Committee has requested that while not currently required 
under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we include in 
our report any significant key observations in respect of these assessed 
risks of material misstatement.
The description of risks opposite should be read in conjunction with the 
significant issues considered by the Audit Committee discussed on page 50.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the 
financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial 
statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a 
reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. 
We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and 
in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £6.1m (2014: £6.8m), 
which is 7.3% (2014: 7.4%) of profit before tax excluding goodwill 
impairment and impairment of assets held for sale. We have determined 
profit before tax excluding exceptional and non-recurring items as our 
benchmark for determining materiality on the basis that profit before tax 
is a key performance indicator used by the market and is comparable 
with the Group’s peers.
Profit before tax has been adjusted to exclude the impact of the 
impairment of goodwill relating to GA CGU and the impairment of 
assets held for sale relating to the Composites business in the current 
year. In the prior year profit before tax excluded the impact of an 
impairment of goodwill relating to the Composites CGU and the write 
down of L85 inventory. These items have been excluded in our 
determination of materiality as they are considered by management 
to be exceptional and non-recurring in nature and not reflective of 
the Group’s underlying performance.
We agreed with the Audit Committee and reported to the Committee 
all audit differences in excess of £120,000 (2014: £136,000), as well as 
differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting 
on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on 
disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall 
presentation of the financial statements.

RISK DESCRIPTION
HOW THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT  
RESPONDED TO THE RISK
KEY 
OBSERVATIONS
GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT
The Group has a material goodwill balance with a carrying 
value of £284.5m which has arisen through past 
acquisitions. In the current year an impairment charge 
of £18.8m was recognised in respect of the GA cash 
generating unit (“CGU”) as a result of adverse market 
circumstances brought on by the slowing GDP growth 
rate in China impacted by commodity prices.
On an annual basis the Directors assess the valuation of 
goodwill which relies on key assumptions and judgements 
made by them concerning the estimated value of future 
cash flows, associated discount rates, and growth rates 
based on their view of future business prospects. 
The extent of the judgement involved presents the risk that 
the carrying value has not been adjusted appropriately for 
underperforming components or components that have been 
impacted by adverse market and/or trading circumstances.
Further details are disclosed in Note 2, where goodwill 
is disclosed as a critical judgement and Note 13 of the 
financial statements.
We challenged management’s key assumptions used in 
the impairment model for goodwill focussing on those 
CGUs with lower headroom and operating in challenging 
markets by, but not limited to:
• considering the cash flow projections through 
assessing the accuracy of historical budgeting process 
by comparing them with historically achieved results 
and benchmarking the consistency of the cash flow 
projections with industry data and trends; 
• engaging our internal valuation specialists to review the 
inputs used to determine the discount rates by 
comparing them against available external market data; 
• benchmarking the perpetuity rates against industry and 
GDP growth rates; and
• reviewing their adopted sensitivities to assess whether 
it reflects a reasonable possible change.
Based on our 
procedures we 
agreed with the 
Directors that the 
goodwill allocated to 
GA should be fully 
impaired and that no 
other goodwill 
impairment should 
be recognised as at 
31 December 2015.
TAX PROVISIONS
As the Group operates in a number of different tax 
jurisdictions, judgement is required over the levels of tax 
provisions held at year end principally in the US and UK 
which are the Group’s most significant trading countries.  
As set out in Note 21 to the financial statements the Group 
is carrying a tax provision of £17.7m. 
The increase of £1.3m in the current year reflects the increased 
uncertainty as a result of the OECD’s BEPS project.
We assessed the tax provisions in conjunction with our 
internal tax experts. Our assessment included a review 
of prior year open computations and the Group’s transfer 
pricing and financing arrangements, correspondence with 
tax authorities and consideration of the general tax 
environment and attitude of tax authorities. 
We considered whether the additional provisions 
recognised during the year are appropriate in light of 
developments in the OECD’s BEPS project.
Based on our 
procedures we 
concur that the 
overall provision 
recognised by 
management is 
appropriate given 
the tax risks faced  
by the Group.
INVENTORY NET REALISABLE VALUE AND PROVISION FOR OBSOLESCENCE
The Group held an inventory balance at the year end  
of £126.9m, as disclosed in Note 17 which relates to the 
Aerospace and Flexonics businesses. It is a material 
balance for the Group which requires management 
judgement in determining an appropriate costing basis  
and assessing if this is lower than the net realisable value  
of the inventory on hand at year end.
There are also judgements required in determining 
inventory excess and obsolescence provisions as these  
are based on forecast inventory usage and assessing if  
the provision level is adequate.
We have tested a sample of inventory items at significant 
components to assess the cost basis and net realisable 
value of inventory. 
We compared the inventory excess and obsolescence 
provision to the Group’s policy and challenged 
management’s judgement of the adequacy of this by 
performing a review of the overall level of provisions on an 
aggregate and by unit basis as well as understanding the 
levels of demand for significant items. We investigated 
manual adjustments made to the mechanical application 
of the inventory obsolescence provisioning policy, and 
assessed whether they were valid and the appropriateness 
of the final excess and obsolescence provision.
Based on our 
procedures, no 
issues were 
identified which 
raised concerns over 
the valuation of 
inventory.

ACQUISITION ACCOUNTING
Group management exercised judgement in determining

Lymington Precision Engineering (“LPE”), a UK based 
company, was acquired on 31 March 2015 for net 
consideration of £43.6m. Management recognised 
intangible assets valued at £27.9m and goodwill of £17.1m. 
On 17 December 2015 the Group acquired Steico Industries 
(“Steico”), based in the United States, for net consideration 
£60.3m. 
At the acquisition date management recognised intangible 
assets valued at £28.4m and goodwill of £21.2m.
The judgements made in recognising the intangible assets 
could have a material impact on the financial statements 
and as such, this is a key audit risk. Further details of the 
above noted acquisitions can be found at Note 31 and Note 
2 where fair value of intangible assets acquired on 
acquisition is disclosed as a critical judgement of the 
financial statements. 
We evaluated and tested the acquisition accounting for 
both acquisitions, which included using valuation experts 
in the consideration of the recognition and valuation of 
intangible assets. 
Our audit procedures included, but were not limited to: 
agreeing the cash flow projections to supporting audit 
evidence on a sample basis; and assessing the 
appropriateness of the valuation methodology and 
discount rate applied by consulting with our internal 
valuations experts who performed benchmarking against 
the Group’s competitors and challenged the sources of its 
inputs along with assessing the fair value attributed to the 
deferred contingent consideration. 
Based on our testing, 
the key judgements 
applied by 
management in 
identifying and 
recognising 
intangible assets 
and recognition 
of goodwill for 
acquisitions made 
during the year were 
appropriate.

AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT
Our Group audit was scoped based on our understanding of the Group 
and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and assessing the 
risks of material misstatement at the Group level. We have considered 
components on the basis of their contribution to Group sales and 
profitability, as well as those that require local statutory audits in their 
jurisdiction. Based on that assessment, we focused our Group audit 
scope primarily on the audit work at 24 locations. 22 of these were 
subject to a full scope or statutory audit, whilst the remaining two were 
subject to an audit of specified audit procedures where the extent of 
our testing was based on our assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement and of the materiality of the Group’s operations at 
those locations. 
These 24 locations represent the principal business units and account 
for 89% (2014: 90%) of the Group’s revenue and 98% (2014: 92%) of 
the Group’s profit before tax. They were also selected to provide an 
appropriate basis for undertaking audit work to address the risks of 
material misstatement identified above. Our audit work at the 24 
locations was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each 
individual entity which were lower than Group materiality and ranged 
from £2.4m to £3.1m (2014: £2.0m to £3.4m). 
At the Parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and 
carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there 
were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated 
financial information of the remaining components not subject to audit 
or audit of specified account balances.

The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits 
that has been designed so that a senior member of the Group audit 
team visits the Group’s components on a rotation basis. In the current 
year we visited a total of 12 locations. 
In years when we do not visit a significant component we include 
the component audit team in our team briefing, discuss their risk 
assessment, and review documentation of the findings from their work.

GOVERNANCE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
OPINION ON OTHER MATTERS PRESCRIBED  
BY THE COMPANIES ACT 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; 
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
• the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared 
in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Company 
and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not 
identified any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report.
MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT  
BY EXCEPTION
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
• the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our 
opinion certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration have not been 
made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited 
is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. We have 
nothing to report arising from these matters.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review part of the 
Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s compliance 
with certain provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have 
nothing to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the annual 
report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial 
statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of 
performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified  
any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the audit 
and the Directors’ statement that they consider the annual report is  
fair, balanced and understandable and whether the annual report 
appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the 
audit committee which we consider should have been disclosed. 
We confirm that we have not identified any such inconsistencies 
or misleading statements.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITOR
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the 
Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). We also comply with 
International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit 
methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality control procedures 
are effective, understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems 
include our dedicated professional standards review team and 
independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them  
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our 
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
SCOPE OF THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that 
the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent 
Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-
financial information in the annual report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any 
information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of 
performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for 
our report.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. GENERAL INFORMATION
Senior plc is a company incorporated in England and Wales under the 
Companies Act. The address of the registered office is given on the 
inside back cover. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal 
activities are set out in Note 4 and on pages 1 to 37.
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities 
are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which the entity operates (the functional currency). These Financial 
Statements are presented in Pounds Sterling, which is the Company’s 
functional and the Group’s presentation currency.
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of accounting
These Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) adopted by the 
European Union and they therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS 
Regulation. They have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except 
for the revaluation of certain properties and financial instruments. They 
have also been prepared on the going concern basis as set out on page 25. 
The Directors have, at the time of approving these Financial Statements, 
a reasonable expectation that the Group and Company have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing these Financial Statements.
Changes in accounting policies
During the year, no new accounting standards or amendments to 
existing standards became effective which had a material impact on 
these Financial Statements. At the date of authorisation of these 
Financial Statements, a number of new standards and amendments 
to existing standards have been issued but are not yet effective and, 
in some cases, have not yet been endorsed by the EU. They have not 
been adopted early in these Financial Statements. Management is in 
the process of reviewing the impact of the following new standards:
 − IFRS 9 Financial instruments. Effective for annual periods beginning 
1 January 2018, subject to EU endorsement.
 − IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Effective for annual 
periods beginning 1 January 2018, subject to EU endorsement.
 − IFRS 16 Leases. Effective for annual periods beginning 1 January 
2019, subject to EU endorsement.
None of the amendments to existing standards are expected to have a 
significant impact on the Financial Statements when they are adopted.
The principal accounting polices under IFRS are set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements incorporate the Financial 
Statements of Senior plc and the entities controlled by it (its subsidiaries) 
made up to 31 December. Control is achieved when Senior plc has the 
power to govern the financial and operating policies of an invested entity 
so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the 
acquisition method. The consideration transferred for each acquisition 
is the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of assets 
transferred, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity interests issued 
by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any 
asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. 
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets 
acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed are measured 
initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. On an acquisition by 
acquisition basis, the Group recognises any non-controlling interest in 
the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s 
proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are 
included in the Consolidated Income Statement from the effective date 
of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
The results of joint ventures are accounted for using the equity 
accounting method.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements 
of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those 
used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are 
eliminated on consolidation.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation is measured as the excess of the 
consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest 
in the acquiree and the acquisition date fair value of any previous equity 
interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Group’s share of the 
identifiable net assets acquired. It is recognised as an asset and 
reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised 
immediately through the Consolidated Income Statement and is not 
subsequently reversed.
If the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling 
interest in the acquiree and the acquisition date fair value of any previous 
equity interest in the acquiree is less than the fair value of the net assets 
acquired (i.e. bargain purchase), the difference is credited to the 
Consolidated Income Statement in the period of acquisition.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, 
to the cash-generating units (“CGUs”) that are expected to benefit from 
that business combination. CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated 
are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an 
indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of 
the CGU is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is 
allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated 
to the CGU and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis 
of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss 
recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the 
attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the 
profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to the date of transition to IFRS has 
been retained at the previous UK GAAP amount subject to being tested 
for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK 
GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in 
determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or 
receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods provided in the 
normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related 
taxes.
Sales of goods are recognised when goods are delivered in accordance 
with the terms and conditions of the sale.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal 
outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the 
shareholders’ legal rights to receive payment have been established. STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Senior plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015  79
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease 
substantially transfer all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the 
Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum 
lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The 
corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the Balance Sheet as 
a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between 
finance charges and a reduction of the lease obligation in order to 
achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the 
liability. Finance charges are charged directly to the Income Statement.
Rentals payable under operating leases are expensed on a straight-line 
basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as incentives to enter into an operating 
lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are 
recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the date of the 
transaction. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities 
that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates 
prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items carried at fair 
value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the 
rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. 
Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign 
currency are not retranslated. Gains and losses arising on retranslation 
are included in net profit or loss for the period, except for exchange 
differences arising on non-monetary assets and liabilities where the 
changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity, subject to meeting 
the requirements under IAS 21.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the 
Group enters into forward contracts (see section below on Derivative 
financial instruments and hedging for details of the Group’s accounting 
policies in respect of such derivative financial instruments).
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas 
operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance 
sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average 
exchange rates for the period. Exchange rate differences arising, if any, 
are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation 
reserve. Such translation differences are recognised as income or 
expense in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a 
foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity 
and translated at the closing rate on the relevant balance sheet date.

Government grants
Government grants received for items of a revenue nature are 
recognised as income over the period necessary to match them with 
the related costs and are deducted in reporting the related expense.
Government grants relating to investment in property, plant and 
equipment are deducted from the initial carrying value of the related 
capital asset.
Operating profit
Operating profit is stated before investment income and finance costs 
relating to external borrowings and retirement benefit obligations.
Retirement benefit costs
Payments to defined contribution retirement plans are charged as an 
expense as they fall due. Payments made to state-managed retirement 
benefit plans are dealt with as payments to defined contribution plans 
where the Group’s obligations under the plans are equivalent to those 
arising in a defined contribution retirement plan.
For defined benefit retirement plans, the cost of providing benefits 
is determined using the Projected Unit Method, with full actuarial 
valuations being carried out on a triennial basis, and updated at each 
balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in 
the period in which they occur. They are recognised outside the Income 
Statement and are presented in the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the 
benefits are already vested. Otherwise, it is amortised on a straight-line 
basis over the period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Balance Sheet 
represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as 
adjusted for unrecognised past service costs, and as reduced by the fair 
value of scheme assets. Any net asset resulting from this calculation is 
limited to the past service cost plus the present value of available 
refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Taxation
Current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit 
differs from profit before tax as reported in the Income Statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or 
deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never 
taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated 
using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
balance sheet date.
Provisions for tax uncertainties are included within current tax liabilities 
on the balance sheet. There are transactions and activities that the 
Group engages in where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain and 
a provision may be made against the tax benefit. For example, the 
Group seeks to price transactions between Group companies as if they 
were unrelated parties in compliance with OECD transfer pricing 
principles and the laws of the relevant jurisdictions and this involves a 
degree of uncertainty. Provisions against uncertainties are established 
based on management judgement of the range of likely tax outcomes in 
open years and in consideration of the strength of technical arguments. 
When making this assessment, we utilise specialist in-house tax 
knowledge and experience and take into consideration specialist tax 
advice by third party advisors on specific items.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on 
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in 
the Financial Statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the 
computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance 
sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for 
all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised 
to the extent it is probable that taxable profits will be available against 
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 80  Senior plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDA TED FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS CONTINUED
which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets 
and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises 
from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business 
combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects 
neither the Group’s taxable profit nor its accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences 
arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in 
joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of 
the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying value of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance 
sheet date and reduced to the extent it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the 
deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in 
the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on 
tax laws and rates that have been enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except 
when it relates to items charged or credited to Other Comprehensive 
Income or directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt 
with in Other Comprehensive Income or equity.
Property, plant and equipment
Land and buildings held for use in the production or supply of goods or 
services, or for administrative purposes, are stated in the Balance Sheet 
at their historical cost, or at modified historical cost, being a revaluation 
undertaken in 1988 which has been taken as the effective cost on 
transition to IFRS. Land and buildings were revalued to fair value at the 
date of revaluation.
The Group does not intend to conduct annual revaluations. 
Fixtures, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any recognised impairment loss. 
Depreciation is charged to write off the cost of an asset on a straight-line 
basis over the estimated useful life of the asset, and is charged from the 
time an asset becomes available for its intended use. Annual rates are 
as follows:
Freehold land Nil
Freehold buildings 2%
Improvements to leasehold buildings according to remaining  
lease term
Plant and equipment 5%–33%
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected 
useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over 
the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is 
determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset at disposal and is recognised in income.
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets include computer software and intangible assets 
acquired as part of a business combination. 
The cost of acquiring computer software (including associated 
implementation and development costs where applicable) is classified 
as an intangible asset. Costs associated with maintaining computer 
software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred. 
Capitalised computer software is amortised over its estimated useful life 
of between three and five years on a straight-line basis, and is stated at 
cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination principally 
comprise customer relationships, contracts and trade names. They 
are shown at fair value at the date of acquisition less accumulated 
amortisation at the rates of between three and five years on a straight-
line basis.
Internally generated intangible assets – research and 
development expenditure
An internally generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s 
development activities is recognised if all of the following conditions 
are met:
i. an asset is created that can be separately identified;
ii.  it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic 
benefits; and
iii. the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Internally generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line 
basis over their useful lives.
Development work is also carried out on a funded basis. In such 
circumstances the costs are accumulated in inventory and are 
recognised when the related billings are made. Any amounts held in 
inventory are subject to normal inventory valuation principles. Otherwise 
expenditure on research and development activities is recognised as an 
expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of 
its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any 
indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any 
such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated 
in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where 
the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other 
assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-
generating unit to which the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less the costs to 
sell and the value in use. In assessing the value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value 
of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of 
future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its 
carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its 
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense 
immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, 
in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount 
of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable 
amount, so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the 
carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment 
loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. A reversal of an 
impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, unless the 
relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal 
of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs 
comprise direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and 
an appropriate allocation of production overheads. Cost is calculated 
using the first-in, first-out method. Net realisable value represents the 
estimated selling price less the estimated costs of completion and the 
costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.

Senior plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015  81
Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes 
a party to the contractual provisions of the relevant instrument and 
derecognised when it ceases to be a party to such provisions.
Financial instruments are classified as cash and cash equivalents, bank 
overdrafts and loans, obligations under finance leases, trade receivables, 
trade payables, deferred consideration receivable, other receivables and 
other payables, as appropriate.
Non-derivative financial assets are categorised as “loans and 
receivables” and non-derivative financial liabilities are categorised as 
“other financial liabilities”. Derivative financial assets and liabilities that 
are not designated and effective as hedging instruments are categorised 
as “financial assets at fair value through profit or loss” and “financial 
liabilities at fair value through profit or loss”, respectively. The 
classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial 
assets and liabilities and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their 
nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts. These are recognised in the Income Statement 
when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. Significant 
financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter 
bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in 
payments are considered indicators that the asset is impaired. The 
carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance 
account. When a trade receivable is considered uncollectible, it is 
written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of 
amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance 
account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account 
are recognised in the Income Statement.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and other short-term 
highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount 
of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Non-derivative financial liabilities
Non-derivative financial liabilities are stated at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method. The effective interest method is a method of 
calculating the amortised financial liability and of allocating interest over 
the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly 
discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of 
the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net 
carrying amount on initial recognition. For borrowings, their carrying 
value includes accrued interest payable, as well as unamortised issue 
costs.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the value of 
the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes 
in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Group uses 
foreign exchange contracts and, on occasion, interest rate swap contracts 
to hedge these exposures. The use of financial derivatives is governed 
by the Group’s Treasury Policies as approved by the Board of Directors, 
which provide written principles on the use of derivatives. The Group 
does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Certain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting. 
These are categorised at “fair value through profit or loss” and are 
stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in the 
Income Statement.
The Group designates certain hedging instruments in respect of foreign 
currency risk as cash flow hedges. At the inception of the hedge 
relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging 
instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management 
objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. 
The Group also documents, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing 
basis, whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging 
relationship is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash 
flows of the hedged item.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are 
designated and are effective as a cash flow hedge are recognised 
directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in 
the Income Statement. If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or 
forecasted transaction results in the recognition of an asset or a liability, 
then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains 
or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity 
are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. For 
hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, 
amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the Income Statement in 
the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit or loss.
For an effective hedge of an exposure to changes in fair value, the 
hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risk 
being hedged with the corresponding entry in the Income Statement. 
Gains or losses from remeasuring the derivative are also recognised in 
the Income Statement. If the hedge is effective, these entries will offset 
in the Income Statement.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not 
qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the Income Statement 
as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires 
or is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted 
transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to 
occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred 
to the Income Statement for the period.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are recognised in the Income 
Statement on disposal of the foreign operation.
Assets and disposal groups held for sale
Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be 
recovered by sale rather than by continuing use in the business. 
Where a group of assets and their directly associated liabilities are to 
be disposed of in a single transaction, such disposal groups are also 
classified as held for sale. For this to be the case, the asset or disposal 
group must be available for immediate sale in its present condition, and 
management must be committed to and have initiated a plan to sell the 
asset or disposal group which, when initiated, was expected to result in 
a completed sale within 12 months. Assets that are classified as held for 
sale are not depreciated. Assets or disposal groups that are classified as 
held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair 
value less costs to sell.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDA TED FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS CONTINUED
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation 
(legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the 
Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate 
can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are measured 
at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the 
obligation at the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and 
uncertainties surrounding the obligation. They are not discounted to 
present value if the effect is not material.
Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group 
has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and the plan has been 
communicated to the affected parties. Provisions for the expected 
cost for warranty obligations under local sale of goods legislation are 
recognised at the date of sale of the relevant products.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based 
payments.
The Group has issued equity-settled and cash-settled share-based 
payments to certain employees. The fair value (excluding the effect 
of non-market-related conditions), as determined at the grant date, is 
expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the 
Group’s estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest and 
adjusted for the effect of non-market-related conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model for the share 
option plans, and a binomial model for the share awards under the 2005 
Long Term Incentive Plan.
The liability in respect of equity-settled amounts is included in equity, 
whereas the liability in respect of cash-settled amounts is included in 
current and non-current liabilities as appropriate.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation 
and uncertainty
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management 
has made a number of judgements. Estimates and assumptions 
concerning the future are also made by the Group. These are continually 
evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors that 
are considered to be relevant. The resulting accounting estimates will, 
by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of 
estimation uncertainty and judgements at the balance sheet date that 
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are 
as follows:
Goodwill
The Group reviews the carrying values of its goodwill balances by 
carrying out impairment tests at least on an annual basis. These tests 
require estimates to be made of the value in use of its CGUs which are 
dependent on estimates of future cash flows and long-term growth 
rates of the CGUs. The carrying amount of goodwill at 31 December 
2015 was £284.5m (2014 – £262.5m). Further details on these 
estimates are set out in Note 13.
Fair value of intangible assets acquired on acquisition
On acquisition of a business, the Group reviews the potential for 
recognising intangible assets and to date has recognised amounts in 
respect of customer relationships, contracts, trade names acquired, 
order backlog and non-compete agreements. The fair values of these 
intangible assets are dependent on estimates of attributable future 
revenues, profitability and cash flows. The carrying amount at 
31 December 2015 from acquisitions was £67.9m (2014 – £25.1m).
Income taxes
In determining the Group provisions for income tax and deferred tax 
it is necessary to consider transactions in a small number of key tax 
jurisdictions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. 
To the extent that the final outcome differs from the tax that has been 
provided, adjustments will be made to income tax and deferred tax 
provisions held in the period the determination is made. The carrying 
amount of net current tax liability and deferred tax liability at 
31 December 2015 was £15.4m (2014 – £12.7m) and £40.2m  
(2014 – £18.3m), respectively. Further details on these estimates  
are set out in Notes 10 and 21.
Retirement benefit obligations
The asset or liability recognised in respect of retirement benefit 
obligations is dependent on a number of estimates including those 
relating to mortality, inflation, salary increases, expected return on 
plan assets and the rate at which liabilities are discounted. Any change 
in these assumptions would impact the retirement benefit obligation 
recognised. The carrying amount of retirement benefit obligations at 
31 December 2015 was a liability of £12.6m (2014 – £19.8m). Further 
details on these estimates are set out in Note 35.

4. SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Group reports its segment information as two operating Divisions 
according to the market segments they serve, Aerospace and Flexonics. 
For management purposes, the Aerospace Division is managed as two 
sub-divisions, Aerostructures and Fluid Systems, in order to enhance 
management oversight; however, these are aggregated as one reporting 
segment as they service similar markets and customers in accordance 
with IFRS 8. The Flexonics Division is managed as a single division.
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the 
Group’s accounting policies described in Note 2 and the sales between 
segments are carried out at arm’s length. Adjusted operating profit, 
as described in Note 9, is the key measure reported to the Group’s 
Executive Committee for the purpose of resource allocation and 
assessment of segment performance. Investment income, finance 
costs and tax are not allocated to segments, as this type of activity 
is driven by the central tax and treasury function.
Segment assets include directly attributable computer software assets, 
property, plant and equipment, and working capital assets. Goodwill, 
intangible assets from acquisitions, cash, deferred and current tax and 
other financial assets (except for working capital) are not allocated to 
segments for the purposes of reporting financial performance to the 
Group’s Executive Committee.
Segment liabilities include directly attributable working capital liabilities. 
Debt, finance leases, retirement benefit obligations, deferred and 
current tax and other financial liabilities (except for working capital) 
are not allocated to segments for the purposes of reporting financial 
performance to the Group’s Executive Committee.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination. 
As noted in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 37 the Aerospace Division consists of 19 operations and the Flexonics Division consists of 
14 operations. Each of these operations is considered to be a separate CGU. Goodwill had been allocated to 21 of these individual CGUs – 14 in 
Aerospace and 7 in Flexonics. The table below highlights the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the CGUs that are considered significant 
in comparison with the total carrying amount of goodwill. Where the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to a CGU is individually not considered 
significant, it is aggregated in the table below. The carrying amount of goodwill of the aggregated Aerospace CGUs is considered significant and 
the recoverable amounts for these units are based principally on the same key assumptions.

13. GOODWILL CONTINUED
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. The 2015 goodwill 
impairment review was undertaken on 31 December 2015. The recoverable amounts of each individual CGU are determined from value in use 
calculations. The key assumptions on which the value in use calculations are based relate to business performance over the next five years, 
long-term growth rates beyond 2020 and the discount rates applied. The key judgements for each individual CGU are the level of revenue and 
operating margins anticipated and the proportion of operating profit converted into cash flow in each year. The forecast compound annual growth 
rate in revenue to 2020 for significant CGUs excluding those businesses that have been recently acquired, is in the range from 0% to 8%.
Forecasts are based on the most recent financial budgets and visions per individual unit, as approved by management for the next three years and 
supplemented by forecasts of performance for a further two years. These estimates, where appropriate, take account of the current economic 
environment as set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 37. Cash flows thereafter have been extrapolated based on estimated long term 
growth rates. For CGUs in the Aerospace segment, cash flows extrapolated beyond 2020 are based on growth rates of 3.0% per annum which  
do not exceed the long-term average growth rate forecasts for the aerospace market as included in market outlooks from Boeing, Airbus and 
Bombardier. For CGUs in the Flexonics segment, cash flows extrapolated beyond 2020 are based on geographical long term forecast GDP  
growth of around 2.0% per annum, except for Malaysia and India where 5.0% and 7.7% per annum have been respectively assumed. 
The cash flow forecasts for each CGU have also been adjusted to reflect risks specific to each CGU and discounted to present value using the 
Group’s pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of 9.7% (2014 – 10.1%) which is the measurement used by management in assessing investment 
appraisals. Sensitivities of possible change have also been considered for each CGU in relation to the value in use calculations: the long-term 
growth rate assumption was reduced to 1% point and the discount rate was increased by 1% point.
In the case of the Thermal CGU, its recoverable amount exceeded its carrying value by £9.5m. However, whilst the business has been trading in 
line with the expectation set out in the Senior plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014, the Directors acknowledge that a reasonable possible change 
in the current assumptions of a further 24% reduction in the risk adjusted cash flow projections would result in the recoverable amount of this CGU 
reducing to a level comparable with its carrying value. Factors that could lead to lower cash flows than currently estimated over the initial five-year 
period include: not meeting customers’ expectations for quality and on-time delivery performance which would result in additional rework and 
inspection costs to be incurred; not securing sufficient new business with existing customers; and not introducing sufficient new growth 
customers.
In the case of the LPE and Senior Flexonics Upeca CGUs, their respective recoverable amounts exceeded their carrying values by £15.9m and 
£16.0m. However, during the year and in particular in the second half of 2015, lower activity levels than previously anticipated have been 
experienced in the Industrial Process Control market due to the down-trend in oil and commodity prices. While this has adversely affected trading 
levels for LPE and Senior Flexonics Upeca in 2015, their mid-term expectations over the initial five-year period indicate a reversal to the current 
cyclical slow-down for their markets and prospects. The Directors acknowledge that a reasonable possible change in the current assumptions of a 
further 27% and 32% reduction in their respective risk adjusted cash flow projections would result in the recoverable amounts of these CGUs to 
reduce to a level comparable with their carrying values.
The Directors believe that any reasonable possible change in the key assumptions would not cause the carrying amount of all other significant 
CGUs shown in the table above to exceed their recoverable amount. 
An impairment loss of £18.8m has been recognised in relation to the full carrying value of goodwill allocated to the GA CGU, the Group’s high 
precision machined component operation based in Wisconsin, USA. As noted in the Annual Report & Accounts 2014, visibility of “off-highway” 
land vehicles for use in agricultural markets and mining operations was less clear as the slowing GDP growth rate in China impacted commodity 
prices. During 2015 this has led to lower activity levels than had previously been anticipated at GA which intensified in the second half of the year 
and significantly reduced visibility of a possible reversal to the current cyclical down trend. Hence, the value in use assessment indicated that, as at 
31 December 2015, the GA CGU no longer had sufficient headroom over its carrying value of goodwill. 92  Senior plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015

Current tax receivables was previously included within trade and other receivables but has now been presented separately on the face of the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. The balance at 31 December 2015 was £5.1m (2014 – £0.6m).
Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash and trade receivables. The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial 
instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the Balance Sheet are net of allowances for 
doubtful receivables. There are no other credit or impairment losses for other classes of financial assets.
Further disclosures on credit risk are included in Note 20.
The average credit period taken on sales of goods is 58 days (2014 – 60 days). An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts 
from the sale of goods of £1.4m (2014 – £1.4m). In determining the recoverability of trade receivables, the Group considers any change in the 
credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. Of the trade receivables balance at the end 
of the year, £8.7m (2014 – £6.0m) is due from the Group’s largest customer and £15.2m (2014 – £15.5m) is due from the Group’s second largest 
customer. The Group has no other significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and 
customers. Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision risk in excess of the allowance for doubtful receivables.

Bank loans and overdrafts of £67.8m (2014 – £21.4m) are arranged at floating rates, thus exposing the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. Other 
borrowings are mainly arranged at fixed interest rates and expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. No interest rate swaps were taken out in 
2014 or 2015.

A committed £60m five-year syndicated multi-currency facility was entered into in November 2014, which amended and restated a facility of the 
same amount which was entered into during 2011. As at 31 December 2015, £3m was drawn under the facility. At 31 December 2014, £8m was 
drawn under this facility.
A committed $40m single bank (£27.2m) loans and letter of credit facility was amended in April 2015 and matures in June 2017. This facility was 
increased from $25m to $40m in April 2015. There were $23.8m (£16.2m) loans drawn under the facility on 31 December 2015 and $8.2m (£5.3m) 
loans drawn on 31 December 2014 and there were letters of outstanding credit of $4.7m (£3.2m) (2014 – £6.6m).
A committed £20m two year syndicated sterling facility was entered into in March 2015. As at 31 December 2015, £20m was drawn under 
this facility.
The Group also has two term loans which were taken out in March 2015, a £20m one year term loan and a £5m one year term loan. Both these 
term loans have an option to extend the maturity of the loans to March 2017.
As at 31 December 2015, the Group had available £64.8m (2014 – £56.2m) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all 
conditions precedent had been met.
20. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital structure to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern whilst maximising the return to stakeholders through 
the optimisation of the balance between debt and equity. In considering the appropriate level of net debt the Group pays close attention to its level 
as compared to the cash generation potential of the Group, measured by adjusted profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation 
(“EBITDA”). The Group also monitors capital on the basis of a gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital. Net debt is 
calculated as the total of bank and other loans, obligations under finance leases, forward exchange contract losses less cash and cash equivalents 
and forward exchange contract gains. Total capital is the equity shown in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
All of the Group’s external borrowing facilities have a requirement for the ratio of net debt to EBITDA to be less than 3.0x. Internally the Group aims 
for this ratio to be between 0.5x and 1.5x. At 31 December 2015 net debt was 1.4x the Group’s level of EBITDA (31 December 2014 – 0.8x). In 
addition, all borrowing facilities contain the requirement for EBITDA interest cover (the number of times net interest is covered by the Group’s 
EBITDA) to be in excess of 3.5x. At 31 December 2015 EBITDA was 16.7x the level of net interest (31 December 2014 – 16.2x). Therefore, the 
Group currently has considerable funding headroom. 
The Group’s strategy in respect of gearing is to target a long-term gearing ratio within the range of 50% to 70%. Ratios outside this range may still 
be considered to be acceptable, in certain circumstances. The gearing ratio for the Group at the end of 2015 was 45% (2014 – 26%). The increase 
in 2015 is attributable mainly to the acquisitions in the period. The cash generated by the Group in recent years has led to the gearing ratio being 
lower than the targeted range. 
Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The 
Group’s overall treasury risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse 
effects on the Group’s financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s 
policies approved by the Board, which provide written principles on foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of financial 
derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity. Compliance with policies and exposure limits is 
reviewed by the Group’s Treasury Committee on a regular basis. The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative 
financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
Foreign exchange risk management
The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange risk arising on the operations’ trading activities in foreign 
currencies. Where commented on below, the sensitivity analysis of the Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk at the reporting date has 
been determined based on the change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and left unchanged throughout the reporting period, 
with all other variables held constant (such as interest rates). The sensitivity assumptions are based on analysis reviewed by the Group’s 
Treasury Committee.

20. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED
Translation risk
The Group derived 84% of its revenue from businesses outside the United Kingdom, with 63% relating to operations in North America. 
Fluctuations in the value of the US dollar and other currencies in relation to Pound Sterling have had, and may continue to have, a significant impact 
on the results of the Group’s operations when reported in Pound Sterling. The Group decided not to hedge this translation risk. In addition, the 
majority of assets are denominated in foreign currency, particularly in US dollars. In order to provide a hedge against volatility in the value of these 
assets compared to the Group’s earnings, and hence provide a natural hedge against the Group’s principal lending covenant (the ratio of net debt 
to EBITDA), the Group aims to borrow in foreign currencies in similar proportions to its generation of foreign currency EBITDA, where practical and 
economic. A 10% appreciation (or depreciation) of all other currencies against Pound Sterling would have increased (or decreased) 2015 Group 
operating profit by £9.5m (£7.1m of which would have been due to the US dollar movement) and would have increased (or decreased) net equity 
by £34.6m (£20.7m of which would have been due to the US dollar movement).
Transaction risk
The Group has a number of transaction-related foreign currency exposures, particularly between the Euro and the South African Rand, and 
between the US dollar and the Pound Sterling. The Group seeks to hedge transaction-related exposures mainly on a rolling 15- to 18-month forward 
basis, but in some cases for periods of up to 60 months and applies hedge accounting where the forwards can be designated in a qualifying cash 
flow hedge relationship. Based on the net of the annual sales and purchase-related exposures, all transaction-related foreign currency exposures to 
Group profit after hedging in existence at 31 December 2015 are immaterial. The impact on net equity is determined by the unrecognised portion of 
open forward contracts at the year-end. A 10% appreciation (or depreciation) of the Euro against the Rand and of the US dollar against Pound 
Sterling would have decreased (or increased) net equity by £0.4m and £1.5m, respectively.
Interest rate risk management
The Group has a policy of maintaining approximately 60% of its borrowing costs at fixed interest rates. The Group generally borrows long term in 
fixed rates but at times may borrow at floating rates and swap into fixed depending on credit market conditions. Occasionally a portion of fixed debt 
interest is swapped into floating rates. The combination of maintaining an acceptable balance of fixed and floating rate debt, and the Group’s policy 
of borrowing in foreign currency in proportion to its generation of foreign currency earnings, provides an effective hedge against the impact of 
interest rate and foreign currency volatility on total interest costs. As at year end 2015 the percentage of debt at fixed interest was 68% (2014 – 75%).
The following sensitivity analysis of the Group’s exposure to interest rate risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the exposure to 
interest rates at the beginning of the financial year, and held constant throughout the reporting period with all other variables held constant (such as 
foreign exchange rates). The sensitivity assumptions are based on analysis reviewed by the Group’s Treasury Committee. If variable interest rates 
had been 0.5% lower (or higher), the Group’s net profit would have increased (or decreased) by £0.2m. Any fixed interest debt is held to maturity 
and not fair value adjusted through the profit and loss. An increase (or decrease) of 0.5% in the US dollar market interest rate for the fixed rate debt 
held up to maturity would have decreased (or increased) the fair value of the Group’s borrowings by £3.3m. The Group’s sensitivity to interest rates 
has remained broadly consistent with prior period due to the high proportion of fixed debt.
Credit risk management
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The credit quality of customers is assessed taking into account their financial 
position, past experience and other factors. Further details on determining the recoverability of trade receivables is provided in Note 18. The Group 
is guarantor under the lease of one building in the UK, which arose on the disposal of a former Group-owned subsidiary in 2001.
Credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are financial institutions with high credit ratings 
assigned by international credit rating agencies. The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the Financial Statements, which is net of 
impairment losses, represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk.
Liquidity risk management
Liquidity risk reflects the risk that the Group will have insufficient resources to meet its financial liabilities as they fall due. The Group manages 
liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual 
cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. Cash flow forecasts are produced monthly, together with 
appropriate capacity planning and scenario analysis, to ensure that bank covenant and liquidity targets will be met. The Directors also regularly 
assess the balance of capital and debt funding of the Group, as part of a process to satisfy the Group’s long-term strategic funding requirements.
As noted in the Financial Review on pages 22 to 25, the Group is currently in a well-funded position, with significant headroom under its committed 
borrowing facilities. It is considered unlikely that the Group will face any significant funding issues in the foreseeable future. 98  Senior plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015

Fair values
The following table presents an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into 
Levels 1–3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:
Level 1  those fair values derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2  those fair values derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, 
either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
Level 3  those fair values derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable 
market data (unobservable inputs).
There has not been any transfer of assets or liabilities between levels. There are no non-recurring fair value measurements. Level 2 fair values are 
derived from future cash flows, of open forward contracts at 31 December, translated by the difference between contractual rates and observable 
forward exchange rates.

21. TAX BALANCE SHEET
Current tax
The current tax receivable of £5.1m (2014 – £0.6m) includes excess tax paid to tax authorities that is expected to be recovered within 12 months 
by way of offset against future tax liabilities or refund as well as research and development tax credits receivable. 
The majority of the Group’s taxable profits arise in countries, including the US, where the estimated tax liabilities are paid in on account instalments 
during the year to which they relate and are largely paid at the balance sheet date. The current tax liability of £20.5m (2014 – £13.3m) represents £2.8m 
(2014 – £0.5m) tax due on profits of the current and prior years as well as £17.7m (2014 – £16.4m) provisions for tax uncertainties that could by their 
nature fall due within twelve months. The current tax liability for the prior year also included a receivable of £3.6m relating to overpayments in the US. 
The Group recognises provisions in respect of tax for items which are considered to have a range of possible tax outcomes. These uncertainties 
exist due to a number of factors including differing interpretations of local tax laws, uncertainties arising from the OECD’s BEPS project actions and 
the determination of appropriate arm’s length pricing in accordance with OECD transfer pricing principles on internal transactions and financing 
arrangements. The nature of the assumptions made by management when calculating the carrying amounts relate to the estimated tax which 
could be payable as a result of differing interpretations and decisions by tax authorities in respect of transactions and events whose treatment for 
tax purposes is uncertain. Provisions at the balance sheet date are held in respect of multiple years.

in The Netherlands and £1.4m of tax losses recognised on the acquisition of Steico Industries Inc. Due to the unpredictability of future taxable profit 
streams, no deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining tax losses £6.5m (2014 – £2.7m), that may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred 
tax liabilities have not been recognised was £18.6m (2014 – £15.9m). No liability has been recognised in respect of this difference because the 
Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
In addition, at the balance sheet date the Group has deductible temporary differences in respect of share-based payments of £0.2m (2014 – £1.0m) 
for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these differences due to the 
unpredictability of future profit streams in the entities concerned.
At the balance sheet date, the Group has £5.0m (2014 – £5.0m) of surplus ACT previously written off, for which no deferred tax asset has been 
recognised as it is unlikely to be recovered in the foreseeable future due to the UK earnings profile. The Group also has £16.1m (2014 – £15.9m) of 
unused capital losses, as reduced by gains rolled over, available to offset future capital gains for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised 
as no such capital gains are anticipated to arise in the foreseeable future. 102  Senior plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015

It is the Group’s policy to lease certain of its buildings and fixtures and equipment under finance leases. Approximately 78% of the outstanding 
obligations represent leases which were acquired as part of the acquisition of Lymington, which expire between 2017 and 2020. The most 
significant lease, representing approximately 26% (2014 – 23%) of the Group’s obligations, expires in 2020. For the year ended 31 December 2015, 
the average effective borrowing rate was 3.8% (2014 – 3.7%). Interest rates are fixed at the contract date. All leases are on a fixed repayment basis 
and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments.
The fair value of the Group’s lease obligations approximates their carrying amount.
The Group’s obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors’ charges over the leased assets.
An analysis of the present value of lease obligations by currency is as follows: Sterling £1.4m (2014 – £nil), US dollars £0.2m (2014 – £0.2m) and 
Others £0.2m (2014 – £0.5m).

31. ACQUISITIONS
Lymington Precision Engineering (LPE) Limited
On 31 March 2015, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Lymington Precision Engineering (LPE) Limited, and its 100%-owned 
subsidiary Lymington Precision Engineers Co. Limited (collectively “LPE”) through a business combination. LPE is based in Lymington, Hampshire, 
UK and manufactures precision-machined components, fabrications, assemblies and kit sets for the oil and gas, telecommunications, aerospace, 
defence, land and sea systems, nuclear and marine industries. LPE strengthens the Group’s precision machining capabilities and provides access 
to LPE’s strong customer relationships and adjacent markets.
The consideration was £44.6m comprising a net consideration of £45.8m after taking account of £2.7m of net debt in the business at acquisition 
date and a payment of £1.5m for working capital. The acquisition was funded using the Group’s existing borrowing facilities, a new two-year 
£20.0m revolving credit facility and new one-year term loans totalling £25.0m.

The goodwill of £17.1m represents the premium paid in anticipation of future profitability from assets that are not capable of being separately 
identified and separately recognised such as the assembled workforce as well as the expectation that the Group will be able to leverage its wider 
market access and strong financial position to generate sustainable financial growth beyond what LPE would have potentially achieved as a 
stand-alone company. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
The intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition relate mainly to customer contracts and relationships, the fair value of which is dependent 
on estimates of attributable future revenues, profitability and cash flows, and are being amortised over five years. Fair value has also been assigned 
to the order book and trade name which are both being amortised over five years.
The financial assets acquired include trade receivables with a provisional fair value of £5.8m and a gross contractual value of £5.8m, all of which 
is currently expected to be collectible.
Acquisition-related costs of £0.9m are included in administrative expenses within trading profit in the Group’s Consolidated Income Statement for 
the year ended 31 December 2015.
The fair value of the acquired identifiable assets and liabilities is provisional pending finalisation of the fair value exercise.
From the date of acquisition to 31 December 2015, LPE contributed £16.9m of external revenue and £0.8m to the Group’s operating profit before 
amortisation of intangible assets from the acquisition of £4.2m. If the acquisition had been completed on 1 January 2015, Group revenue for the 
year ended 31 December 2015 would have been £862.9m, Group adjusted operating profit would have been £109.8m and Group operating profit 
would have been £72.9m. 106  Senior plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015

Steico Industries, Inc.
On 17 December 2015, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Steico Industries, Inc. and its trading facilities (collectively “Steico”) 
through a business combination. Steico is a leading manufacturer of precision tube and duct assemblies for the commercial and defence aerospace 
industries, located in Oceanside, California, USA. Steico brings new and adjacent capabilities to the Group and enables Senior’s Aerospace Fluid 
Systems Division to offer the full range of tube and duct assemblies covering a wider scope of aerospace fluid systems. The consideration was 
£50.2m, after taking account of £0.1m working capital adjustment, for the issued share capital and £10.1m for the trading facility. There is no contingent 
consideration related to the acquisition. The acquisition was funded using the Group’s existing borrowing facilities and $80.0m private placements.

market access and strong financial position to generate sustainable financial growth beyond what Steico would have potentially achieved as a 
stand-alone company. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
The intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition relate mainly to customer contracts and relationships, the fair value of which is dependent 
on estimates of attributable future revenues, profitability and cash flows, and are being amortised over five years. Fair value has also been assigned 
to the order backlog, long-term customer contracts, Steico’s tradename and non-compete agreements, all of which are being amortised over 
five years.
The financial assets acquired include trade receivables with a provisional fair value of £2.1m and a gross contractual value of £2.1m, all of which 
is currently expected to be collectible.
Acquisition-related costs of £0.3m are included in administrative expenses within trading profit in the Group’s Consolidated Income Statement 
for the 12 months ended 31 December 2015.
The fair value of the acquired identifiable assets and liabilities is provisional pending finalisation of the fair value exercise.
From the date of acquisition to 31 December 2015, Steico contributed £0.9m of external revenue and £nil to the Group’s operating profit before 
amortisation of intangible assets from the acquisition of £0.2m. If the acquisition had been completed on 1 January 2015, Group revenue for the 
12 months ended 31 December 2015 would have been £871.7m, Group adjusted operating profit would have been £109.2m and Group operating 
profit would have been £68.4m.

34. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The Group recognised total expenses of £2.3m (2014 – £2.5m) related to share-based payments, of which £2.2m (2014 – £2.3m) related to 
equity-settled share-based payments, and £0.1m (2014 – £0.2m) related to social security costs on share-based payments. As at 31 December 
2015, the Group had a liability of £0.1m (2014 – £0.4m) arising from share-based payments relating to social security costs.
a) 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan
Equity-Settled Long Term Incentive Plans
On 2 April 2015 816,646 shares were awarded under the 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan. In addition, a further 241,576 shares were awarded on 
1 May 2015. Awards under this plan have a three-year vesting period, subject to earnings per share (“EPS”) and total shareholder return (“TSR”) 
performance conditions being met. Half the awards have an attaching performance target for EPS growth over the three-year performance 
period of at least 4% per annum above RPI. The other half of the awards begin to vest if the Group’s TSR falls in the top half of a comparator 
group at the end of the three-year performance period. Vesting levels increase with higher performance. The awards are settled by delivering 
shares to the participants.
The estimated fair value for the awards granted in the year with EPS conditions is 327.4p, which is the share price at the date of grant. The 
estimated fair value for the awards granted in the year with TSR conditions is 154.1p per share reflecting an adjustment of 53% to the fair value 
of the awards with EPS conditions due to the stringent TSR condition.
These fair values were calculated by applying a binomial option pricing model. This model incorporates a technique called “bootstrapping”, which 
models the impact of the TSR condition. The model inputs at the date of grant were the share price of 327.4p, expected volatility of 25% per 
annum, and the performance conditions as noted above. Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s 
share price over the previous three years.

35. RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEMES
The Group operates a number of pension plans in the UK, North America and Europe. These include both defined contribution arrangements and 
defined benefit arrangements. The largest defined benefit arrangement for the Group and Company, the Senior plc Pension Plan, is a funded 
scheme in the UK, providing benefits based on final pensionable emoluments for the employees of the Group and Company. This plan was closed 
to future accrual at the end of 6 April 2014. The latest full actuarial valuation was carried out as at 5 April 2013 and, for the purposes of accounting 
under IAS19, this valuation has been rolled forward to 31 December 2015.
In addition, the Group operates two defined benefit plans in the USA, one of which was closed to future accrual from October 2009. The second 
plan was closed to future participants from September 2013, and the Executive section was also closed to future accruals from December 2013. 
Separate disclosure is made for the funded UK and US defined benefit arrangements. In both the UK and the USA the assets of funded plans are 
held in separate trustee administered funds managed by independent financial institutions and have pension costs assessed by consulting 
actuaries using the Projected Unit Method. The Trustees are required to act in the best interests of the plans’ beneficiaries.
The Group also has a small number of unfunded post-retirement plans, including a closed healthcare scheme in the US. Separate disclosure is 
provided for these arrangements.
The bulk of the pension obligations relate to the UK Plan and we provide more detail on that arrangement below.
For the Senior plc Pension Plan in the UK, the Trustee is Senior Trustee Limited. The appointment of the Directors to the Board is determined by 
the plan’s Trust documentation. There is a policy that at least one-third of all Directors should be nominated by members of the plan. Currently there 
are two member-nominated Directors and four Directors who have been nominated by the Company, of which the Chairman and one other 
Director are viewed as independent. The investment strategy for the plan is decided locally by the Trustees. The primary investment objective is for 
the plan to be able to meet benefit payments as they fall due. This objective is implemented by setting strategic asset allocations using a “horizon-
based” approach. Under this approach, all benefit cash flows expected to fall in the next 17 years (the horizon period) are met by investment in 
low-risk assets such as fixed interest and index-linked bonds. Cash flows after the horizon period are met by investment in more volatile assets 
which are expected to deliver a higher return (than bonds) in the longer term. Benefits are expected to be paid over the next 60 to 70 years. The UK 
Plan’s average duration is around 17 years. In setting this strategy, the Trustees consider a wide range of asset classes, the risk and rewards of a 
number of possible asset allocation options, the sustainability of each asset class within each strategy, and the need for appropriate diversification 
between different asset classes. The Trustees continue to review their investment strategy and have also implemented a switching mechanism to 
secure any outperformances of equities relative to bonds, by selling equities to buy bonds.
The Group is ultimately responsible for making up any shortfall in the UK defined benefit Plan over a period agreed with the trustees. To the extent 
that actual experience is different to that assumed the funding position will be better or worse than anticipated. As such, the contributions required 
by the Group could vary in the future. The two key risks faced by pension schemes are longevity (i.e. members living longer than expected) and 
investment risk (i.e. the scheme’s assets perform poorly relative to the liabilities).
The Group has agreed with the Trustees of the UK plan to fund the plan deficit over an eight-year period from April 2013 to March 2021. The 
estimated amounts of contributions expected to be paid during 2016 to the UK plan is £8.7m (£8.1m of which is to fund the past service deficit and 
£0.6m in respect of administrative expenses) and to the US funded plans is £nil.
Contributions payable to the Plan do not affect the measurement of the defined benefit liability or asset recognised on the Company balance sheet 
on the grounds that the Company has an unconditional right to a refund, assuming the gradual settlement of Plan liabilities over time until all 
members have left. In considering this the Company has taken into account that the trustees do not have unilateral powers to wind up the Plan or 
modify benefits. Amendments to the current version of IFRIC14 are currently being considered. At this stage, the Company believes that the above 
accounting treatment will not be affected by the current exposure draft of the revised IFRIC14.

0.5% decrease in the discount rate 21.0 
One-year increase in life expectancy 8.0

These sensitivities have been calculated to show the movement in the defined benefit obligation in isolation, and assuming no other changes in 
market conditions at the accounting date. This is unlikely in practice – for example, a change in discount rate is unlikely to occur without any 
movement in the value of the assets held by the Plan.

h) Other post-retirement liabilities
This balance comprises an unfunded German pension plan £3.0m (2014 – £3.3m), unfunded closed pension and post-retirement healthcare plans 
in the USA £0.4m (2014 – £0.4m) and provision for post-retirement payments in France of £2.1m (2014 – £2.0m). 
The closed pension and post-retirement healthcare plans in the US have been valued on a Projected Unit Method using a discount rate of 4.1%. 
As at 31 December 2015 no more participants were eligible for medical benefits under the plan. The German plan has been subject to formal 
actuarial valuation on a Projected Unit Method with the following assumptions: discount rate 2.1%, salary growth 0.0% and inflation 1.75%. 
In France, the provision arises from a legal obligation to make payments to retirees in the first two years post-retirement. Hence, it is not subject 
to discounting to the same extent as the other longer-term post-retirement liabilities. 
36. ASSETS HELD FOR SALE
On 21 December 2015, the Group entered into a sale agreement to dispose of its Senior Aerospace Composites business which is based in 
Wichita, Kansas, USA and is included in the Aerospace Division. The sale, which was completed on 16 February 2016, enables management to 
place greater focus on opportunities in its core activities in the Aerospace and Flexonics Divisions.
This business has been classified as held for sale and presented separately in the balance sheet. An impairment loss of £1.8m has been recognised 
after taking into account the proceeds from the disposal and associated exit costs. The previously recorded foreign exchange differences on 
translation will be recycled to the income statement on the date of disposal.
The major categories of assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are as follows:

Property, plant and equipment 0.6

Trade and other receivables 0.6 
Total assets classified as held for sale 1.8
Trade and other payables 1.1 
Total liabilities classified as held for sale 1.1
Net assets classified as held for sale 0.7 
37. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Contingent liabilities exist in respect of guarantees provided by the Group in the ordinary course of business for product delivery, performance and 
reliability. Various Group undertakings are parties to legal actions or claims which arise in the ordinary course of business, some of which could be 
for substantial amounts. In May 2015 Senior Aerospace Ketema was named as co-defendant in a class action lawsuit filed against Ametek, Inc. in 
the US. The lawsuit claims that Ametek had polluted the groundwater during its tenure as owners of the site where Senior Aerospace Ketema is 
currently located. While the outcome of some of these matters cannot precisely be foreseen, based on the information currently held by the 
Directors, the Directors do not believe any of these arrangements, legal actions or claims, after allowing for provisions already made, are likely to 
result in significant loss to the Group. 114  Senior plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015

Bank loans and overdrafts of £57.6m (2014 – £16.1m) are arranged at floating rates, thus exposing the Company to cash flow interest rate risk. 
Other borrowings are mainly arranged at fixed interest rates and expose the Company to fair value interest rate risk. No interest rate swaps were 
taken out in 2014 or 2015.

Share Registrars
All shareholder records are maintained by Equinti and all correspondence should be addressed to the Registrar, Senior plc at the Equniti address 
shown on the inside back cover, quoting the reference number starting with 0228 detailed on your dividend vouchers. The registrar should be 
notified regarding changes to name or address, loss of share certificate, or request for, or change to, a dividend mandate.
Equiniti provides a range of shareholder information on-line. Shareholders can check their holdings, update details and obtain practical help on 
transferring shares at: www.shareview.co.uk.
Instead of payment by post to your registered address, dividends can be paid through the BACS system direct into a UK bank or building society 
account, with the dividend voucher still sent to your registered address. If you wish to use this facility and have not previously applied, then please 
apply direct to Equiniti and request a dividend mandate form. Shareholders who are currently receiving duplicate sets of Company mailings, as 
a result of any inconsistency in name or address details, should write direct to Equiniti so holdings can be combined, if appropriate.

Chairman’s Statement
Paul Davies
Non-executive Chairman
The past year has been one full of challenges
for MSB and it is a reflection on the quality of
its management and staff that the Company
continues to be a leading provider of human
capital solutions.
inflow of £11 million (2002: £8.3 million) resulted in a net cash
balance of £6.2 million (2002: £3.4 million net borrowings).
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 1.4p (2002:
1.4p), bringing the total dividend for the year to 2.1p 
(2002: 2.8p).
Management and Organisation
There have been a number of changes to the Board in 
the period.
In August John Bateman stood down as Chief Executive
and Andrew Zielinski was promoted to the post after four
years as Finance Director. As a result of this, Douglas
Adshead-Grant was appointed Finance Director in November,
joining us from the Frozen Food division of Albert Fisher
Group plc where he was the interim Finance Director. 
In October, Charles G Toner stood down as senior Non-
executive after three years’ loyal service.
The Board would like to register their thanks to both John
and Charles for their commitment and guidance during
what was a time of exceptional change for MSB.
This was a year of considerable change for MSB. Market
conditions continued to be extremely difficult with demand
for our traditional services declining. Increased focus on
internal controls and strict financial management has re-
aligned our cost base to reflect reduced levels of revenue
and has considerably improved our cash position.
Several changes at both main Board and operational level
have resulted in a substantially new management team
prepared to respond to the challenges and opportunities
which now present themselves.
This team continues to develop the existing business and
has commenced investigation into strategic initiatives
aimed at enabling the Company to respond to the new
circumstances which it, along with the rest of the industry,
now faces.
Results and Dividend
Turnover for the year was £84 million (2002: £146 million) with
profit before taxation and exceptional item at breakeven
(2002: £3 million profit). Basic loss per share before
exceptional item was 0.16p (2002: 10.4p profit) and after
exceptional item 2.32p (2002: 6.4p profit). Operating cash 3
Also in November, and following the resignation of John
Bateman as Executive Chairman, the Board invited me to
join them as Non-executive Chairman to oversee the
changes in strategy and business focus which would be
needed for the next phase of MSB’s development. 
At the beginning of the year MSB concentrated primarily on
the provision of IT and telecommunications contractors
which historically had been a key driver in the business
model. In response to declining activity in this traditional
market, the Company instigated a sector-focused sales
structure supported by a technical skills-based resourcing
division.
In parallel to this restructuring programme, several new
self-funding initiatives were launched in the second half
including MSB Finance (a division specialising in delivering
finance, banking and accounts personnel) and MSB Sales
(a division providing permanent sales personnel to the IT
and related sectors). Both divisions were founded around
the recruitment of individuals with a proven track record in
their respective sectors and, although in their infancy, both
are showing solid potential.
MSB People
The past year has been one full of challenges within MSB
and it is a reflection on the quality of both its management
MSB International Plc Annual Report 2003 4
Chairman’s Statement continued
and staff that the Company has continued to maintain its
position as a leading provider of human capital solutions.
We have retained and secured many new customers by
demonstrating continued commitment to both clients and
candidates in the professional manner which has become
expected of them. The Board would like to express their
thanks and appreciation to them all.
Current Trading and Prospects
The IT staffing sector has proven itself over many years to
be a barometer of the health of the IT market in general.
When industries invest in latest technologies to support
growth in their own businesses so demand for IT skills
increases and the sector prospers. Similarly, when companies
respond to tougher conditions so they seek to reduce costs
and IT investment is frequently an early casualty.
Following the massive IT spends during the late 1990’s
most sectors have steadily reduced IT budgets to match
tougher economic conditions in their own markets. Most of
the IT industry has suffered the effects of this downturn
and MSB, along with its peers in IT skills resourcing, has
been no exception.
The challenge we face in MSB at present, therefore, is to
balance the need for cost reductions in line with reduced 5
revenues, whilst retaining the capacity to respond to and
seek out growth opportunities. Overly aggressive cost
control may well maximise short term earnings but would
undoubtedly restrict our ability to benefit from any upturn in
the IT investment cycle, thereby damaging our longer term
prospects. 
Recent stringent cost cutting and re-organising exercises
have been aimed at achieving this balance. Overheads are
now more appropriate for current trading conditions but we
have retained some capacity to support a strategy of
widening our service offerings. We are also mindful that at
times such as these, opportunities can present themselves
for consolidation and whilst currently we are not involved in
any such activity, we will consider any suitable acquisition
prospect which could enhance shareholder value.
Trading in the first two months has been in line with
management’s expectations and whilst market conditions
continue to be tough, the Board believes that the
necessary actions have been taken for a return to positive
earnings and remains confident in the long-term prospects
for the Company.
Nicholas Parker
After 12 years of service on the Board of MSB, Nicholas
Parker will be resigning from his current role as Non-
executive Director at the announcement of the interim
results, having completed two consecutive periods in this
position since flotation. With the appointment of a new
Chairman, Chief Executive and Finance Director, Mr Parker
believes that a new stability has been reached within the
Company and wishes to facilitate the ongoing restructuring
of the Board, having been a member of the team who has
overseen the Company develop into a secure and strong
business. He will be retaining his position as a significant
shareholder, understanding that the results of recent
management actions will reap significant benefits within the
coming years. He will also remain available to the Board for
advice and consultation, as required.

Chief Executive’s Report
MSB has focused on enhancing core business
activities and launching new recruitment market
initiatives, during challenging market conditions.
Andrew M Zielinski
Chief Executive
before tax and exceptional items has been achieved in line
with market expectations.
Decisive expense reductions were made and tight cost
control measures over discretionary spend introduced.
Restructuring led to a downsizing in the support
departments and also affected a number of senior sales
and non-sales management positions. Surplus office space
has been re-let at our head office in Bromley and vigilant
cost management and efficient credit management have
resulted in significant cash generation. Strong cash
management generated an inflow of £11 million which was
utilised in the repayment of a £5 million fixed term loan,
leaving net cash balances of £6.2 million compared to net
borrowings of £3.4 million last year. As a result, we finish
this financial year with a long-term debt free, solid 
balance sheet.
Market Overview
It is impossible to disguise the fact that the markets in
which we have been operating have been unforgiving.
Pockets of demand exist for specialist skills which
command premium rates and our increased focus on client
relationships enables us to capitalise on this. However, in
Having held the position of Finance Director for nearly four
years, I was pleased to have been appointed Chief Executive
Officer by the Board in August 2002.
When announcing the interim results on 1st October 2002,
I stated that for the remaining part of the financial year we
needed to establish a period of stability, focus on our
strengths, support the core IT recruitment business and
invest in new recruitment services.
Since then, I can report that we have made real progress.
Both the Operating Board and management team have
been strengthened; the remaining element in the restructuring
programme to streamline the organisational structure has
been concluded; and we have diversified into two new
recruitment sectors, Finance and Sales. 
Finally, I very much welcome the appointment of Paul
Davies as Non-executive Chairman, who brings with him a
wealth of IT services industry experience and contacts.
Results and Performance
Despite very challenging market conditions resulting in a
42% decline in revenues year on year, a breakeven result 7
MSB International Plc Annual Report 2003
the overall marketplace, lower demand for recruitment
services has seen continued pressure being exercised on
chargeable rates and margins have consequently suffered.
The excess supply of contractor labour over job demand
continues to soften the market.
Traditional and Core Business
During the year, the Company successfully concluded the
programme to re-engineer its traditional IT core sales
model. At the same time, the Resource Delivery Division
was established as a separate operating unit to continue to
exploit MSB’s traditional strengths in technical skills
resourcing. Adopting a sector focused sales model ensures
that we build long-term client relationships.
New Initiatives
The Company has acted swiftly in reducing the risk
associated with its dependency on the IT recruitment sector
and responded through the introduction of new initiatives.
Firstly, new recruitment services through a low risk and low
cost organic route were established. In August, two new
divisions were opened: MSB Finance was launched to
recruit qualified accountants across a range of sectors; and
MSB Sales was formed to recruit sales executives. Today,
both new recruitment divisions have teams of highly
experienced and skilled recruiters, based at the Bromley
Head Office, Central London, Manchester and Windsor.
Although the new divisions are operating in intensely
competitive markets, they are performing well.
Secondly, to complement the recruitment services, the
Company has introduced other products and services
including, AudIT and HR Express. These services and
products are specifically designed to address clients’
needs in human capital management over and above the
provision of labour.
Restructuring
Whilst we have reduced our cost base to reflect declining
revenues, we have retained sufficient resource to invest in
new business initiatives and support future growth. The
headcount reduction during the year was principally in the
back office and administrative areas.
The restructuring programme was implemented to
maximise our focus on sales activities and was uppermost
in our planning. Inevitably, some sales personnel decided
to leave as a result of the restructuring in the first half but
since then we have attracted new and experienced sales
professionals and we continue to invest in this area.
Business Development
The marketplace in which the Company operates is
constantly changing in what is currently a very sensitive
economic climate and, as a result, we are regularly
monitoring and updating the Company strategy.  Following
a recently concluded strategic review, the Company will
retain its focus on the maintenance and development of
the IT recruitment business; continued examination of
additional recruitment sectors to broaden its base
(reducing further risks associated with its historical
exposure to IT); and expand related recruitment services
beyond the provision of labour.
In conclusion, I believe this indicates the broad range of
organic and potential corporate growth opportunities
available to MSB, ensuring that the Company is well
positioned with the right management team and model to
move the Company forward. Financial Review

average number of shares held and not vested by the
Group’s Employee Benefit Trust during the year.
Taxation
The taxation charge is £32,000 on profit before taxation
and exceptional item at breakeven. This primarily reflects
an adjustment arising from prior years and disallowable
losses from overseas subsidiaries, offset by the movement
on deferred tax. There is no tax impact in respect of the
exceptional item.
Cash flow
There has been a determined and focused drive to
maximise cash generation. This has resulted in a cash inflow
of £11 million (2002: £8.3 million) arising from operating
activities and an overall increase in cash flow of £4.6 million
(2002: £5.6 million). Capital expenditure for the year was
£0.1 million (2002: £0.6 million) and the total dividends paid
during the year totalled £0.4 million (2002: £1.1 million).

Operating results
Despite a significant decline in revenue, tight financial cost
control has enabled the Group to report an operating profit
of £143,000 (2002: £2,423,000).
Turnover for the year was £84.1 million against £146.0 million
last year, with results before tax and exceptional item, at
breakeven (2002: £3.0 million profit). 
The Group generated a gross profit of £12.8 million (2002:
£24.3 million) in a highly competitive and demanding
market, with average margins at 15.2% (2002: 16.6%).
Exceptional Item
The exceptional item relates to amounts written off
investments (£0.4 million). Further details are set out in
Note 6, page 28.
Earnings per share
The adjusted loss/earnings per share before exceptional
item was (0.16p), compared to 10.4p in the previous year.
The basic and diluted (loss) per share after exceptional
item was 2.32p (2002: 6.4p profit). The total number of
shares in issue was 20,501,979 at 31 January 2003, with 9

management of working capital. Investment of surplus cash
on short-term deposit generated interest income of £98,000.
The year also saw a significant reduction in total trade debt,
which decreased by over £11 million (61%), to £7.5 million
at 31 January 2003 from £19.2 million at 31 January 2002.
Borrowings
The term loan of £5 million was repaid in September 2002,
leaving the Balance Sheet free from long-term debt at 31
January 2003. There was a positive net cash position of £6.2
million at the year-end, comprising of £0.9 million of debt
relating to overdraft facilities and £7.1 million cash in bank.
Treasury
The Group finances its operations through invoice
discounting, bank borrowings, retained profits and working
capital balances such as trade debtors and creditors. No
other financial instruments are used. In the absence of any
long-term debt and with the Group’s positive cash position,
the Directors consider that the levels of interest rate and
exchange rate risk are acceptable.

ways in which the service to clients can be enhanced. This
has allowed the Group to focus on what is important 
to clients.

the year (2002: £10,043). 
European Monetary Union
The Group supplies approximately 90% of its personnel to
client sites in the UK with the remainder mostly to client sites
in other countries, within the rest of Europe.
European Monetary Union and the use of the Euro are
important issues, as the Group continues to develop and
expand its business further into Europe. It has developed,
and will continue to develop, its systems to meet any
associated trading requirements.
Auditors
Following the conversion of our auditors
PricewaterhouseCoopers to a Limited Liability Partnership
(LLP) from 1 January 2003, PricewaterhouseCoopers resigned
on 26 March 2003 and the directors appointed its successor,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , as auditors. A resolution to
reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors to the
company will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
Corporate Governance
Compliance with the Combined Code
The Group is committed to applying the standards of
corporate governance and has complied with the principles
of the Combined Code throughout the year, except where
disclosed below. The Board is accountable to the
Company’s shareholders for good governance and this
statement describes how the relevant principles of
governance are applied to the Group.
The Board and its committees
At the year-end the Board consisted of three Executive
Directors and three Non-executive Directors, which the
Board considers to be a reasonable balance. For part of
the year the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive were
both held by John A Bateman. This was a transitional
situation which came to an end on 20 August 2002 when
Andrew M Zielinski was appointed Chief Executive. Of the
Non-executive Directors, Robert H Gunlack and Paul
Davies are considered to be independent.
Nicholas J A Parker is not considered to be an
independent Non-executive Director due to the level of his
shareholding in the Company. 
The Directors meet regularly throughout the year. The
Board sets the Groups’s policy on matters such as overall
strategy, financial performance, capital projects, investment
and financing decisions, budget approval and treasury and
risk management.
All Directors are equally accountable under the law for the
proper stewardship of the Company’s affairs. The Non-
executive Directors have a particular responsibility to
ensure that the strategies proposed by the Executive
Directors are fully discussed and critically examined, not
only to protect the long-term interests of shareholders, but
also to ensure that they take proper account of the
interests of employees, customers and suppliers.
Charles G Toner was the senior Non-executive Director until
his resignation from the Board on 31 October 2002. Since
that time the Board has not had a senior Non-executive
Director. The Board considers that the Non-executive
Directors fulfil a vital role in corporate accountability
through the review and challenge of executive policy and
decision-making. Certain responsibilities are delegated to
separate Board Committees. The remit and membership of
the relevant Board committees are set out below.
Where considered necessary, in pursuit of their duties, all
Directors may seek independent professional advice. Any
costs arising from this will be met by the Company.
The Remuneration Committee
The role of the Committee is to review the Group’s
Remuneration Policy so as to ensure that it is appropriate
to motivate and retain high quality employees and
Executive Directors.
For much of the year the members of the Remuneration
Committee were Charles G Toner, Robert H Gunlack and
Nicholas J A Parker. Between 31 October, when Charles G
Toner resigned from the Board and 28 November when Paul
Davies was appointed, the Remuneration Committee did not
comprise of three independent Non-executive Directors.
Although Nicholas J A Parker is not considered to be
independent, the Board is satisfied that the overall structure
of the Committee is such that independent decisions are
reached.
Remuneration of the Non-executive Directors is discussed
annually by the Executive Directors, and the levels are
based on market comparisons. Any recommendations are Directors’ Report continued
14
laid before the full Board. Contracts of service for the Non-
executive Directors have not been renewed every twelve
months as the Directors are of the opinion that this is not
necessary. All Directors are subject to re-election at least
every three years.
The Remuneration Report on pages 16 to 18 includes
details on remuneration policy and procedures, and on the
remuneration of the Directors.
Potential appointments to Executive Director are
interviewed by all Directors before the proposal is formally
made to the Board by the Chairman of the Committee.
Possible new Non-executive Directors are suggested by all
members of the Board to take into consideration the
requirement of the Group’s business and the need to have
a balanced Board. In appropriate cases recruitment
consultants are used to assist in the process. Possible
candidates are discussed with all Directors before any
approach is made to them.
Executive Directors are entitled to receive a bonus based
on the performance of the Group during the year. The
Remuneration Committee believes that the award of any
bonuses should be tied to the interest of shareholders and
that the principal measure of those interests is shareholder
value. It establishes the objectives, which must be met for
the bonus to be paid, which are dependent on the Group
achieving profit targets for the relevant year. There are no
annual bonuses to be paid to Executive Directors in respect
of the year ended 31 January 2003.
The Group also has a Share Option Scheme, details of
which are set out in the Remuneration Report.
The Audit Committee
Until 31 October 2002, the Audit Committee comprised of
Robert H Gunlack and Charles G Toner. Between the dates
of Charles G Toner resigning from the Board and Paul Davies
being appointed, Robert H Gunlack was the sole representative
of the Committee. However, no Audit Committee meetings
were scheduled to have taken place during this period.
Throughout the year, the Committee did not comprise of
three Non-executive Directors.
The Committee meets at least twice a year and receives
reports from the external auditors. It follows up outstanding
matters contained in those reports, where appropriate. The
Committee reviews the Company’s interim and annual
reports before they are submitted to the Board for approval
and monitors the extent of the Group’s compliance with the
recommendation of the Combined Code of Best Practice,
including the provisions of the Turnbull Report.
The Group monitors the effectiveness of the system of
internal controls by a process of completing quality and
operational audits. The Committee is satisfied that due to
the size of the Group, this function is currently adequately
performed by the Group’s Finance Department, although the
requirement for a separate internal audit function is under
regular review.
The Committee also recommends the appointment and
reviews the independence and fees of the external auditors.
Following the reorganisation of the Board during the latter
part of this year the Directors have considered the
composition of the Remuneration and Audit Committees and
believe these to be appropriate at this time.
Internal Control
As required by the Combined Code, during the year the
Directors have conducted a review of the effectiveness of the
Group’s system of internal financial and operating controls.
Based on this review, the Board is satisfied that the
provisions of the Turnbull Report have been fully complied
with at 31 January 2003.
The Directors acknowledge their ultimate responsibility for
ensuring that the Group has in place a comprehensive
system of controls, financial and otherwise, appropriate to
its business. Such controls are designed to give reasonable
assurance with respect to the:
• reliability of financial information used within the
business or for publication;
• maintenance of proper accounting records;
• safeguarding of assets against unauthorised use or
disposition;
• business being operated efficiently and effectively.
The Group’s internal control and monitoring procedures
include:
• clearly laid down systems and procedures, both
financial and operational, including maintenance of
good financial controls and the production of accurate
and timely financial management information; MSB International Plc Annual Report 2003
• the control of key financial risks through clearly laid
down authorisation levels and proper segregation of
accounting duties;
• detailed budgeting and reporting of trading results,
balance sheets and cashflows, with regular review by
management of variances from budgets.
The systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can
only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance
against material misstatement or loss. During the year, the
procedures necessary for identifying, evaluating and
managing the significant risks faced by the Group were
strengthened. Improvements include raising the profile of
risk management and control issues, documentation of
policies and procedures and review of disaster recovery
procedures.
The executive members of the Board have close day-to-
day contact with the business and are actively involved in
monitoring risks and the control activities. All of the Board
members receive copies of management and audit reports
and are involved in agreeing the actions that are required
to maintain the level of risk at an acceptable level.
Relations with Shareholders
The Directors encourage dialogue with Institutional
Shareholders and use the Annual General Meeting to
encourage participation by private investors. The Group
has regular contact with Institutional Shareholders where it
believes this to be in the interests of shareholders
generally.
Going Concern
The Directors, having made appropriate enquiries, are
satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern
basis in preparing the financial statements.
Directors’ Responsibilities
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial
statements for each financial year, which give a true and
fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the
Group as at the end of the financial year and of the profit
or loss of the Group for the year. In preparing those
financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable
and prudent;
• follow applicable accounting standards, subject to any
material departures disclosed and explained in the
financial statements;
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
Group will continue in business.
The Directors confirm that they have complied with the
above requirements in preparing the financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper
accounting records which disclose, with reasonable
accuracy at any time, the financial position of the Group
and to enable the Directors to ensure that the financial
statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are also responsible for the maintenance and
integrity of the Group’s website, however, information
published on the internet is accessible in many different
countries where legislation governing the preparation and
dissemination of financial statements may differ from that
applicable in the United Kingdom.

Remuneration Report
for the year ended 31 January 2003
Constitution of Remuneration Committee
The constitution of the Remuneration Committee is set out in the Directors’ Report.
Remuneration Policy
Levels of pay and benefits have been set which reflect the performance of the Group against pre-determined budgets, as
well as the individual contribution of each Director. Awards have taken into consideration both market and competitive
conditions. Salaries are set at a level believed to be one at which the Group will be able to continue to motivate and retain
its management. This policy is expected to remain unchanged.
There are three main elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors and Senior Management:
• basic annual salary and benefits in kind;
• annual bonus payments based on meeting specific performance criteria;
• share option incentives based on meeting specific performance criteria.
The bonuses for Group Executive Directors’ are calculated on formulae which are determined each year by the Remuneration
Committee. The formulae measure the Group’s performance against specified targets relating to achievement of profit
objectives. No bonuses were paid to Executive Directors in relation to the year ended 31 January 2003.
The targeted composition of the Board’s remuneration is as follows:
Executive Directors 67% Non performance-related
33% Performance-related
Non-executive Directors 100% Non performance-related
All aspects of the Executive Directors’ packages are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee. During the year,
the Remuneration Committee consulted the Chief Executive about its proposals relating to the remuneration of Executive
Directors, other than his own. The Committee has access to professional advice where appropriate. 
The Share Option Scheme relating to the Directors, introduced at the time of the flotation in April 1996, seeks to link
individual reward with the longer-term success of the business. Options are awarded to Directors following an assessment
of individual performance and are based on a multiple of the Director’s salary for the year. It is the Group’s policy that no
Director or employee should hold options with exercisable value of more than four times salary. The right to exercise these
share options is subject to the requirement that the Group outperforms the FTSE index of quoted companies within the
Support Services sector, based on total shareholder return from the date of the grant of the option. In the event that a
Director resigns, any outstanding options that have not been exercised will lapse.

Interests in Share Options-this part is auditable information
The Group operates the MSB International Plc Executive Option Scheme (the Executive Scheme). It has two parts: Part A
designed for Inland Revenue approval and Part B an unapproved Share Option Scheme. Part A of the Executive Scheme
was approved by the Inland Revenue under Schedule 9 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 on 17 July 1998.
The Executive Scheme was approved by shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company held on 16
January 1998. The Executive Scheme was then amended and approved by shareholders at an Extraordinary General
Meeting of the Company held on 19 November 1999.
An analysis of options over the Company’s shares, none of which have been exercised, held by Directors as at 31 January
2003 in the Executive Scheme is set out below:

shares of the Company. None of the terms and conditions of the share options have varied during the year. There have
been no departures from the Group’s policy on granting share options during the year. All options were granted in respect
of qualifying services and were granted at nil cost. The performance criteria for all the above share options were consistent
with the remuneration policy above. The market price of the Company’s shares at the end of the financial year was 50.5p
and the range of market prices during the year was between 82p and 25p. There were no gains made by any Director from
the exercise of share options during the year.

On behalf of the Board
Paul Davies, Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
1 April 2003 We have audited the financial statements which comprise the consolidated profit and loss account, the balance sheets, the consolidated cash flow
statement, statement of group total recognised gains and losses, reconciliation of movements in group shareholders’ funds and related notes,
which have been prepared under the historical cost convention and the accounting policies set out in the statement of accounting policies. We
have also audited the disclosures required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 contained in the directors’ remuneration report
(“the auditable part”).
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and
accounting standards are set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities. The Directors are also responsible for preparing the Directors’
Remuneration Report.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the auditable part of the directors’ remuneration report in accordance with relevant legal
and regulatory requirements and United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board.  This report, including the opinion,
has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no
other purpose.  We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report
is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the
auditable part of the directors’ remuneration report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to
you if, in our opinion, the directors’ report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the company has not kept proper accounting records, if
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’
remuneration and transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the annual report and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. The other information comprises only the directors’ report, the unaudited part
of the directors’ remuneration report, the chairman’s statement, the chief executive’s report, the financial review and other information for shareholders.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the company’s compliance with the seven provisions of the Combined Code
specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider
whether the board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or to form an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures. 
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test
basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the auditable part of the directors’ remuneration report.
It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements,
and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us
with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the auditable part of the directors’ remuneration report are
free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and the group at 31 January 2003 and of the loss and
cash flows of the group as for the year then ended;
• the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
• those parts of the directors’ remuneration report required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Notes to the Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 January 2003
1. Accounting Policies
Accounting Convention
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and have been prepared in accordance
with applicable Accounting Standards. The principal accounting policies, which have been applied consistently, are
outlined below. In accordance with FRS 18, the Directors have reviewed the Group’s accounting policies and consider
them to be the most appropriate. 
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings,
and exclude all intra-Group transactions. The results and the net assets of the subsidiary undertakings acquired are
consolidated from the date of acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting. Unless specifically stated in the
notes to the accounts, all amounts presented relate to the consolidated results of the Group.
Tangible Fixed Assets and Depreciation
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, as set out in note 10. Depreciation is provided in
order to write off the cost of tangible fixed assets, less estimated residual value, over their estimated useful lives at the
following rates:
Leasehold improvements 25% per annum of cost on a straight-line basis
Furniture, fittings and equipment 25% per annum of cost on a straight-line basis
Motor vehicles 25% per annum on a reducing balance basis
Software costs 50% per annum of cost on a straight-line basis
Investments
The value of investments in subsidiary undertakings is stated at historic cost less any provision for impairment. Other
investments are stated at historical cost less provision for any impairment.
Deferred Taxation
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance
sheet date, and where these transactions or events result in an obligation to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax in the
future. Timing differences arise because the Group’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements are
not the same.
Deferred taxation assets are only recognised when the recoverability of those assets can be determined with a degree of
certainty.
Deferred taxation is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing
differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the
balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Foreign Currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the rates ruling at that
date. Translation differences thus arising are dealt with in the profit and loss account.
The financial statements of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance
sheet date. The exchange differences arising on re-translation of opening net assets is taken directly to reserves. 25
Leased Assets
Assets acquired under finance lease arrangements are capitalised and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter
of the term of the lease and the economic life of the relevant asset. The interest element of the rental obligation is charged
to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease in proportion to the balance of the outstanding obligations.
Other leases are treated as operating leases and the rental charges are taken to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Turnover and Revenue Recognition
Turnover represents fees invoiced net of Value Added Tax, derived from the principal activity of the Group. Contract
revenue is recognised as work is carried out in the period in which a contract is in place. Where timesheets are not
received in time, an estimate is made as to the value of the work done. This estimate is based on the standard terms of
the contracts to which the outstanding timesheets relate. This estimate is then incorporated within turnover, with the
corresponding cost being recognised within cost of sales. Permanent placement fees are recognised in the period in
which the candidate commences in their new employment.
Financial Instruments
The Group’s financial instruments comprise: invoice discounting facility, overdrafts, loans, cash and liquid resources, trade
debtors and creditors. Financial assets and liabilities are recorded at historical cost. The main purpose of these financial
instruments is to provide finance for the Group’s operations. The Group has taken advantage of the exemption available
for short-term debtors and creditors.
The Group does not use derivative instruments as a matter of course and specific Board approval is required for the
Group to adopt the use of derivative instruments. On the basis that the potential benefits do not outweigh the associated
costs, the Group continues to adopt the policy that it does not trade in financial instruments and this has been applied
throughout the financial year. The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate, liquidity and
foreign exchange risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and these policies, which
have remained unchanged throughout the year, are summarised below:
i) The function of the Group treasury is to reduce or eliminate foreign exchange and financial risk, to ensure sufficient
liquidity is available to meet foreseeable requirements and to invest cash securely and profitably.
ii) The policy followed in managing credit risk minimises exposure with banks and other institutions. Transactions are
authorised only with the Group’s bankers and banks with which dealing mandates have been agreed.
iii) The Group uses a mixture of floating rate facilities and fixed rate asset finance agreements to manage the interest risk
on borrowings.
The Group does not undertake any formal hedging activities as the Directors are of the opinion that, as the quantum of
assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies are not sufficiently material, the likely additional benefits arising would not
outweigh the associated costs. Details of the interest rate risk profile of financial instruments are shown in Note 24.
Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP)
The “ESOP” is a separately administered discretionary trust for the benefit of employees, the assets of which comprise
shares in the Company. Consistent with the treatment outlined in UITF 13 “Accounting for ESOP trusts”, the material
assets, liabilities, income and costs of the ESOP are consolidated within these financial statements.
Related Party Transactions
The Group has taken advantage of the exception under FRS 8 “Related Party Disclosures” not to disclose transactions
between Group companies.

Interests in own shares represents 985,000 5p ordinary shares in the Company at 31 January 2003 (2002: 985,000). The
MSB Incentive Scheme Trust (the ‘Trust’) acquired 700,000 of the Company’s ordinary shares in the open market during the
year ended 31 January 2001, for the purpose of meeting obligations under the Employee Share Option Scheme. The
remaining shares held at the beginning of the year had been donated at nil cost to the Trust by certain shareholders at
flotation. The option scheme does not allow the executives to purchase shares at discount to the market value of the
shares at the date on which the shares are granted, therefore no charge to the profit and loss account arises. The costs of
funding and administering the Scheme are charged to the profit and loss account of the Company in the year to which they
relate. The market value of the shares at 31 January 2003 was £497,425.

£1,400,000, Euro’s £900,000, other currency £250,010 and short-term sterling deposits of £4,500,000 (2002: Sterling

MSB International Plc Annual Report 2003 36
24. Borrowings and Financial Instruments continued
The floating rate liabilities consist of Sterling bank borrowings and overdrafts which bear interest at rates based on UK
base rate. The Company and Group do not use formal hedging methods in respect of their interest rate risk. Cash at bank
earns interest at a floating rate based on the UK base rate or foreign equivalents appropriate to the country in which the
cash is held.
Currency Profile
The main functional currencies of the Group are Sterling and the Euro. The following analysis of net monetary assets and
liabilities shows the Group’s currency exposures. The amounts shown represent the transactional exposures that give rise
to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account. Such exposures comprise the monetary
assets and monetary liabilities of the Group which are not denominated in the functional currency of the operating unit involved.

Fair Values of Financial Assets and Liabilities

£000 £000 £000 £000
Term borrowings -- 5,000 5,101
The fair value of other financial assets and liabilities are equal to their book values. The method of calculating the fair value
has been to discount back payment of interest and capital at the perceived market rate for a similar nature of borrowing.
25. Borrowing Facilities 
The Group has undrawn committed floating borrowing facilities which are renewed annually. The maximum undrawn
facilities available (subject to sufficient qualifying trade debtors) were as follows:

Resolutions as indicated below:
Ordinary Resolution
10) That the Directors be and are hereby generally and unconditionally authorised and empowered, for the purposes of
section 80 of the Companies Act 1985, to exercise all powers of the Company to allot relevant securities (as defined in
the said section 80) up to an aggregate nominal amount of £341,212 provided that this authority shall expire on the
earlier of 15 months from the date of this resolution and the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the
Company, save that the Company may, before such expiry, make other offers or agreements which would or might
require relevant securities to be allotted after such expiry and the Directors may allot relevant securities in pursuance of
such offers or agreements as if the authority conferred hereby had not expired.
Special Resolution
11) That, subject to the passing of resolution 9 set out in the Notice of this Meeting, the Directors be and are hereby
empowered pursuant to section 95 (1) of the Companies Act 1985 to allot equity securities (within the meaning of
section 94 of the Companies Act 1985) for cash pursuant to the authority conferred by the said resolution 9 as if
section 89 (1) of the Companies Act 1985 did not apply to any such allotment provided that this power shall be limited:-
i) to the allotment of equity securities in connection with a rights issue in favour of ordinary shareholders where the
equity securities respectively attributable to the interests of all ordinary shareholders are proportionate (as nearly as
may be) to the respective numbers of ordinary shares held by them (but subject to such exclusions or other
arrangements as the Directors may deem necessary or expedient to deal with problems under the laws of any
territory or the requirements of any regulatory body or any stock exchange in any territory or in connection with
fractional entitlements or shares represented by depository receipts or otherwise howsoever): and
ii) to the allotment (otherwise than pursuant to sub-paragraph (i) above) of equity securities up to an aggregate
nominal value of £51,181 and shall expire on the earlier of fifteen months from the date of this resolution and the
conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company, save that the Company may, before such expiry,
make offers or agreements which would or might require equity securities to be allotted after such expiry and the
Directors may allot equity securities in pursuance of such offers or agreements as if the power conferred hereby had
not expired.
Notice of Annual General Meeting 39
12) That pursuant to Article 9 of the Company’s Articles of Association and Section 166 of the Companies Act 1985, the
Company be and is hereby generally and unconditionally authorised to make one or more market purchases (as defined
in Section 163(3) of the Companies Act 1985) of its ordinary share of 5 pence each on such terms and in such manner
as the Directors may determine provided that:-
i) The maximum aggregate number of ordinary shares which may be purchased is 2,000,000 being approximately
10% of the issued share capital of the Company;
ii) The minimum price which may be paid for each ordinary share is 5p per share (exclusive of expenses);
iii) The maximum price which may be paid for each ordinary share is not more than 5 per cent above the average of
the middle market quotations for an ordinary share as derived from The London Stock Exchange Daily Official List
for the five business days immediately preceding the day on which the ordinary share is purchased (exclusive of
expenses); and
iv) The authority hereby granted shall expire on the earlier of fifteen months from the date of the resolution or the
conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held in the year 2004 unless renewed before that
time, provided that a contract of purchase may be made before such expiry which will or may be executed wholly
or partly after the expiry of this authority and the purchase of ordinary shares may be made in pursuance of any
such contract as if the authority conferred hereby had not expired.
Notes
1) A member entitled to attend and vote at the meeting convened by this notice is entitled to appoint one or more proxies
to attend, and on a poll, to vote in his stead. A proxy need not be a member of the Company.
2) Forms of proxy are provided and to be valid must be lodged with the Company’s registrars, Capita IRG Plc, not less
than 48 hours before the time appointed for the holding of the meeting.
3) There will be available for inspection at the registered office of the Company during usual business hours on any
weekday (Saturdays and public holidays excepted) from the date of this notice until the date of the Annual General
Meeting, and at the place of the meeting for 15 minutes prior to and during the meeting:
(a) the register of Directors’ interests in shares of the Company kept in accordance with Section 325 of the
Companies Act 1985; and 
(b) copies of the contracts of service between the Directors and the Company or any of its subsidiaries (other than
contracts expiring or determinable by the Company without compensation within one year).
Explanatory Notes
a) Section 80 of the Companies Act 1985 (“The Act”) requires Shareholders’ authority for the Directors to allot the
unissued share capital of the company or convertible securities other than shares which may be allotted under the
employee share option schemes previously approved by Shareholders. Such authority may be granted for a period of
no more than five years. The existing authority under Section 80, given by Shareholders to the Directors at the Annual
General Meeting held on 26 June 2002 is in respect of unissued Ordinary shares having a nominal value of £340,174
representing one third of the nominal amount of the issued share capital at that time, and is due for renewal at the
Annual General Meeting. The Directors consider that this authority should be renewed in respect of unissued Ordinary
shares. The corresponding figure for this resolution is £341,212.
b) In the case of a new allotment of shares or convertible securities for cash, section 89 of the Act grants pre-emption
rights to existing Shareholders. The London Stock Exchange does not require the consent of Shareholders to each
specific allotment (made other than to existing Shareholders on a proportional basis) provided that the authority of
Shareholders, which may be given under section 95 of the Act, to disapply generally the provisions of section 89 is
obtained. Accordingly, the Directors consider that it is in the best interest of the Company for the existing section 95
authority granted by Shareholders on 26 June 2002 to be renewed for a period expiring at the next Annual General
Meeting or on 20 August 2004 whichever is earlier. It is proposed that the waiver will be limited by value to 5% of the
issued ordinary share capital and will apply to equity securities having a nominal value of £51,181. This proposal is
consistent with the guidelines approved in October 1987 by the Investment Committees of the Association of British
Insurers and the National Association of Pension Funds. If this approval is granted your Directors would, in
implementing it, have regard to the additional guidelines which indicate that issues of equity securities for cash (other
than by way of rights) should not, in any rolling three-year period, exceed 7.5% of the issued ordinary share capital.

for investors continued
Well-invested assets generating significant 
free cash flows.
Since IPO in 2004, Vedanta has grown production across 
its portfolio supported by its well-invested expansion 
programme and continued focus on increasing R&R over 
production each year.
Vedanta is reaping benefits of its expansion programme  
as project ramp ups are driving free cash flow generation,  
which exceeded capex by US$1.6 billion this year.

Strategic Report
Chairman’ s statement
Diversified portfolio delivering consistent 
performance in a challenging market.
I have always believed that the ability to produce robust results  
in volatile markets is the hallmark of a strong and agile company. 
I am therefore pleased to announce another set of commendable 
operating and financial results delivered by our management 
team and employees, as we mark a decade at Vedanta.
Ten years ago we had a vision to create a 
large global diversified natural resources 
major that unlocks the remarkable resource 
potential of India, meets the growing 
demand of a nation of a billion people, and 
gives investors an opportunity to participate 
in the journey with the comfort of a premium 
listing on the London Stock Exchange.
We believe the benefits have been felt 
all-round: since our IPO at 390 pence in 
December 2003, shareholders have seen 
a Total Shareholder Return of over 200% 
and we have paid a progressive dividend 
that was increased in nine out of 10 
years and held constant for one year.
We now stand as one of the world’s 
largest diversified resources company with 
operations in India, Zambia, Namibia, 
South Africa, Ireland, Liberia, Australia and 
Sri Lanka, which directly and indirectly, 
enhances the lives of at least 4.1 million 
people across the world. As we look back 
over this first decade I am proud of the 
contribution that we have made, both 
fiscally and socially, to the exchequer, our 
employees and the numerous communities 
in and around our operations.
Highlights of the year
Vedanta has again shown that the 
fundamentals of our business remain 
strong. We have a diversified portfolio 
of assets that have cost-efficient 
operations, are highly productive, and 
have generated strong free cash flows of 
US$1.6 billion after capital expenditure 
on sustaining and expansion projects.
In particular we were delighted with the 
performance of the Oil & Gas division, 
Cairn India, which passed two notable 
milestones during the year. The onshore, 
prolific, Rajasthan block achieved the 
landmark of 200 million barrels of 
cumulative oil production over its life, 
and also reached a production rate of 
200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day 
in March 2014, against a production rate 
of 125,000 barrels of oil equivalent per 
day, when we acquired this business.
I warmly congratulate the team on this fine 
achievement, and I also thank the Indian 
government whose partnership has been 
crucial. Cairn now produces 27% of India’s 
oil production and with the Government’s 
focus on increasing India’s oil production, 
it can contribute further to helping reduce 
India’s dependence on imported oil & gas 
which still accounts for 75% of its needs.
Zinc India is the second largest integrated 
zinc producer globally with a mine life 
of more than 25 years and costs in the 
lowest quartile of the global cost curve. 
It delivered an excellent performance 
with a record production of mined 
and integrated refined metal.
Financial performance
The year saw revenues of US$12.9 
billion and an EBITDA of US$4.5 billion 
despite lower commodity prices.
EBITDA reflected weaker global commodity 
and oil prices, increased rate of share of profit 
on petroleum to the Government of India, 
although these were partly offset by lower 
costs in aluminium, increased volumes at 
Zinc India and our record oil production.
We also experienced lower volumes at 
Konkola Copper Mine (‘KCM’) and Zinc 
International and Iron Ore, where the 
state-wide bans on mining in Karnataka 
and Goa were lifted in December 2013 
and April 2014 respectively, albeit with 
conditions. We resumed mining in Karnataka 
in December, and are currently working with 
the State Government and the Environment 
Ministry to restart operations in Goa. Strategic Report Directors’ Report Financial Statements Additional Information

Delivering against our strategy
As well as producing satisfactory results, we 
remained focused on our core strategy.
It was a year when we eased back on 
capital expenditure and concentrated on 
production. Despite inflationary pressures, 
we succeeded in controlling our costs; in 
aluminium, for example, we rank in the 
second quartile, even ahead of many others 
who enjoy the advantage of captive bauxite.
We continued to reduce net debt 
which now stands 8% down at 
US$7 .9 billion, and generated strong 
free cash flow of US$3.0 billion.
I was also pleased to see further progress on 
our goal to discover more than we mine out. 
During the year we delivered a 100% reserve 
replacement at Oil & Gas and Zinc India.
In addition, we responded to an often-
received feedback from shareholders for 
a simpler group structure by completing 
the Sesa Sterlite merger during the year, 
which has eliminated cross-holdings, 
better aligns cash flow generation 
and debt across the Group structure 
and delivers valuable synergies.

Sustainability
I have always felt deeply that it is our 
employees who drive our success. It has 
therefore been a priority that they have 
been able to grow with us, both financially 
and personally, and that we contribute to 
their well-being and development. We’ve 
developed incentive plans to broaden 
share ownership among our middle 
and senior management, so they also 
become shareholders of our Company.
However, even growth is a secondary 
consideration compared to the need to work 
safely and to minimise our impact on the 
environment. We were deeply saddened 
by the 19 fatalities that occurred during 
the year and both our incoming CEO and I 
are determined to address this as we make 
personal safety an absolute priority. 
It was good to see a reduction of 37% in lost 
time incidents over the last four years, and 
74% of non-hazardous waste being recycled 
during the year which shows an encouraging 
progress. Over the past year, I have been 
particularly pleased with the success our 
businesses’ have had in implementing our 
Sustainability Framework underpinned by 
our successful Scott Wilson audit and the 
insights we have gained from this exercise.
Out in our communities, we continued 
to expand our support programmes. 
We have seven discrete focus areas: 
health, education, sustainable livelihoods, 
women empowerment, community 
asset creation, bio-investment and 
integrated village development. During 
the year we spent US$49 million, 
benefiting over 4.1 million people.

Governance
At the close of the year our CEO of five years 
MS Mehta took well-earned retirement. I 
wish to place on record my thanks to him; 
he joined us around 14 years ago and led 
various operations across the Group. His 
insight and leadership have been pivotal 
to our success over this first decade and 
he departs with our warmest wishes.
We are also delighted to have secured a 
replacement of the calibre of Tom Albanese, 
who took up the reins as our new CEO on 1 
April 2014. Tom brings with him a lifetime’s 
experience in resource mining and operations 
and will add considerable value as we meet 
the opportunities and challenges ahead.
During the year, Deepak Parekh, the 
non-executive Chairman of the Housing 
Development Finance Corporation (‘HDFC’) 
Limited, India’s premier housing finance 
company, joined the Vedanta Board as an 
independent Non-Executive Director. I would 
also like to thank Naresh Chandra who retired 
from the Board following the conclusion of 
the 2013 Annual General Meeting having 
served nearly nine years on the Board.

Outlook
India’s per capita consumption of 
commodities is expected to rise consistently 
and strongly over the next two–three 
decades with favourable demographics 
and growing urbanisation, and as a large 
and responsible corporation, Vedanta is 
well positioned to supply India’s need for 
commodities while operating at international 
standards of sustainable development. 
FY2013–14 has been a year of building 
momentum in the right direction, and I 
see it as a powerful springboard for the 
year ahead as we build on the significant 
headway achieved in production ramp-
ups, cost controls, regulatory clearances 
and sustainability. We remain focused on 
our stated strategic priorities of ramping 
up production across our portfolio and 
to deleverage the balance sheet.

Strategic Report
Incoming Chief Executive 
Officer’ s statement
T om Albanese became our new Chief Executive Officer 
on 1 April 201 4. Here he gives his initial impressions of 
the Company and outlines his first priorities.
Taking the helm of a world class 
business is an honour, and I am 
especially excited to be leading a 
diversified resources company like 
Vedanta with a large presence in 
India, a country where I see the 
potential for significant demand 
growth and the opportunity to 
develop and harness natural 
resources to meet this surge 
in demand.
India has long held a fascination for me. It is 
endowed with a vast and largely untapped 
potential in natural resources, and it is also 
a country of fast-growing aspirations. It is 
home to over a billion people driving demand 
for consumer durables, transportation, 
telecommunications and new infrastructure.
Just prior to taking up the role, I spent six 
months as Chairman of Vedanta Resources 
Holdings Limited, that operates as a 
subsidiary of Vedanta Resources plc and 
the holding company for the operating 
companies, which gave me an opportunity to 
know the Company well, visit the operations 
and chair several monthly Executive 
Committee meetings going through detailed 
reviews of business performance. I visited 
almost every asset and spent a lot of time 
underground which left me as energised 
as my first mining job more than 30 years 
ago. I wanted the opportunity to look and 
learn, engage with the workforce and gain 
a well-informed first-hand impression.
Our people
What I have found is a very effective 
management team and a professional and 
committed workforce, and I express my 
thanks to the outgoing CEO of the Group, 
Mr MS Mehta and the outgoing CEOs of the 
Iron Ore division, Mr PK Mukherjee, and Oil 
& Gas division, Mr P Elango, whose efforts to 
build these teams have been commendable.
There are some gaps which we need 
to fill, such as boosting underground 
mining expertise, but the organisation 
is staffed by highly capable teams. It is 
clear to me we have commercial acumen 
in depth, as well as a proven process 
engineering capability and a tremendous 
culture of leadership development.
We will be building on our teams in the 
coming year, benefiting from strong internal 
talent and complementing it with fresh 
perspectives from external hires. On that 
note I am delighted that we have hired a new 
CEO at our KCM business and a new head of 
Corporate Communications and Corporate 
Social Responsibility who is taking up this 
role with a strong emphasis on CSR; an area 
where I think we can present ourselves better.

Our assets
My tour of the assets confirmed to me 
that we have much to be proud about. 
The Company’s ethos of keeping a firm 
control on costs is clearly translated into 
action on the ground, with our largest 
businesses ranking in the lowest cost 
quartile of the global cost curve.
I have also been struck by the world class 
quality of resources and resource potential. 
In particular, four assets come to mind. Our 
prolific onshore Rajasthan oil and gas block; 
the Zinc India assets, also in Rajasthan, with 
the largest zinc-lead mine in the world; our 
low-cost iron ore mines in Goa; and, with 
some operational improvements, the long 
life potential of the high-grade copper assets 
at Konkola Copper Mines (‘KCM’) in Zambia.
These are just four examples in a very 
exciting landscape. As a resources 
explorer, I know that this sector and 
our organisation can play a vital role 
in India’s growth and prosperity.  Strategic Report Directors’ Report Financial Statements Additional Information
15 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report and accounts FY2014
It will be part of my remit to engage 
with policymakers to help in harnessing 
India’s resource potential and thereby 
create growth and employment.
Immediate operating priorities
In the near term, I see a number of 
key operating priorities and these will 
receive immediate focus. They are:
• To ramp up aluminium production and 
obtain access to bauxite.
• To resume iron ore mining operations 
at Goa.
• To improve the business at KCM.
I will also focus on driving further the already 
successful businesses, and this will include 
maximising exploration and optimising 
production at the Rajasthan oil & gas block 
and a proper transition of the Rampura 
Agucha mine at Zinc India from open-cast 
to underground in the next few years.
Safety: zero harm
Having spent my professional life 
involved with the mining industry 
across different countries, I know first-
hand the absolute necessity to strive 
for a zero harm environment.
So although there have been some 
improvements in the Company’s lost 
time injury frequency rate metrics, I 
have communicated to the Board, the 
management team and the entire 
workforce that the fatality rates at our 
operations are wholly unacceptable.
I am therefore conducting a personal 
and thorough appraisal of our safety 
management processes, contractor 
management and compliance, and internal 
safety leadership with the clear target of 
moving towards a zero harm record.
This is not only the right thing to do by 
the workforce, but in my experience, 
the safest businesses are also the 
most capably led and efficient, with all 
the benefits that flow to employees, 
communities and shareholders alike.
Protecting our licence to operate
The most successful businesses in our sector 
have not merely gained a licence to operate; 
every day, they work to protect and maintain 
that licence. In turn, they have assets that 
don’t just last a decade but have productive 
lives that can span generations of workers.
At the heart of this longevity is Corporate 
Social Responsibility in its fullest sense: 
a commitment to engage with local 
communities; to safeguard the wellbeing 
of the workforce; and to minimise 
wherever possible the impact made on the 
environment. Indeed, legislation is raising 
the bar on these issues, not just in India but 
around the world. While Vedanta meets 
or exceeds regulatory requirements, I am 
focused on raising standards further.
One of the first locations I visited was 
Lanjigarh, where we have ambitions to 
ramp-up the refinery to a capacity of 5mt of 
alumina. However, the bauxite for this is to be 
supplied by the State Government as per our 
existing Memorandum of Understanding. On 
behalf of Vedanta, I reiterate that we will not 
consider developing any bauxite resources 
including the Niyamgiri mines, without 
the consent of the local communities.
Regarding our employees, we are conducting 
a gap analysis to ensure our compliance 
with the UN Principles of Human Rights. 
I am also introducing two non-negotiables: 
the radical improvement in safety I 
mentioned above, and a reinforcement of 
the strong principles already in place here 
surrounding compliance, integrity and 
ethics. Our performance in both these areas 
will be led by a strong tone from the top.
So as I set to work in my first year as CEO, 
I’m very excited about the potential ahead. 
We have the people and the assets and 
I look forward to setting a stage that will 
enable even greater performances ahead.
We are all here for the purpose of adding 
value, for our shareholders, our employees, 
and all stakeholders. Over the past 10 years 
the Company has created tremendous value 
for all three, and I am committed to continue 
to do this in the future, and take Vedanta to 
the next level of performance in all aspects.

Strategic Report
Open forum
Anil Agarwal and T om Albanese 
answer some frequently asked questions 
concerning the vision and future 
ambitions of the Company.
Q How will the executive 
management of the Group 
change with the introduction of 
a new Chief Executive Officer?
Anil Agarwal: I am delighted to welcome 
Tom Albanese to the Vedanta Group, who 
brings extensive experience in the resources 
sector. I’m proud to say that Tom has built up 
an excellent understanding of our businesses 
over the last half year when he visited 
them and reviewed the monthly business 
performance of all businesses, and was 
actively involved in the Executive Committee.
We will work closely together to drive the 
Company forward. The Board and I will retain 
responsibility for strategic development, 
including M&A, and Tom will lead the 
businesses, driving operational excellence, 
further developing our stakeholder 
engagement and taking forward corporate 
initiatives to simplify the Group structure.
Q At Vedanta, you have two main 
subsidiaries – the publicly listed India-
based Sesa Sterlite Ltd. and Copper 
Zambia. Let’s discuss Copper Zambia 
first: You have faced some issues at 
Copper Zambia recently. What are 
your plans to address these issues 
and realise the potential of this asset?
Tom Albanese: Since joining the Vedanta 
Group six months ago, I have visited 
Zambia around six times and spent a lot 
of time on the ground, working with the 
business units, talking with our employees 
and stakeholders, including our equity 
partners, the Zambian government.
We’ve taken up several initiatives to 
improve the environment and well-being 
of local communities and more than 
half a million people are benefited by 
the various community programmes 
currently undertaken by Copper 
Zambia. We’ve improved the quality of 
water that gets pumped out from the 
underground mine, which is critical for 
irrigation and caters to the water needs 
of at least half a million Zambians.
We are the largest private sector 
employer in Zambia though our 
productivity per employee is lower 
than local and global peers.
Our focus is ramping up mined metal 
production, which is in everyone’s interest, 
including Vedanta, our employees and the 
Zambian government, though this has 
taken more time than was anticipated 
when Vedanta embarked on sinking the 
new 1.5km deep shaft at the Konkola 
Deeps mine. With shaft sinking complete 
and facilities for loading and hoisting 
finished, we are currently working on 
primary development of the underground 
mine. We have an able team on the 
ground and have recently added several 
underground mining experts to the team.
Then there are commercial challenges 
faced by the mining industry in Zambia, 
with Value Added Taxes on inputs that 
are yet to be recovered from the Zambian 
Government and we are engaged with 
the Government for a solution.
I’m also glad to share that Steven Din 
has joined as CEO of Copper Zambia in 
May 2014. He has nearly two decades of 
experience in Africa. Steven has already 
been actively engaged in meetings with 
the Government, and I look forward to 
working closely with him as we deliver an 
operational turnaround at KCM. With these 
necessary steps to improve the business, I 
can foresee 50 years of successful copper 
mining ahead of Vedanta at Copper Zambia.
Anil Agarwal: Copper Zambia is one of 
Vedanta’s most important assets and we 
are completely focused on the turnaround 
of this business as it has one of the largest 
high-grade copper mines in the world 
and has a long life ahead of it. We are 
committed to developing our resources 
in Zambia and I think we can continue 
to make a significant positive impact on 
the social and economic development of 
the region as the largest private sector 
employer in the country and one of the 
largest contributors to the economy 
through our tax and royalty payments. Strategic Report Directors’ Report Financial Statements Additional Information

Q Vedanta has made a large 
investment in Aluminium  
but you don’t have a captive  
source of bauxite yet and have  
faced criticism about this –  
so what are your plans now?
Anil Agarwal: The state of Odisha in 
India is a natural destination for producing 
Aluminium. India has the eighth largest 
bauxite deposits in the world and 50% 
of these are in Odisha, and nearly half 
of Odisha’s bauxite is within a radius of 
100–150km from the refinery that we 
have built. We have a Memorandum of 
Understanding with the Odisha State 
Government, through which we are assured 
supply of 150 million tonnes of bauxite for 
our processing facility, and we will continue 
to work closely with the State Government. 
From our perspective, we have made it 
clear that Vedanta will not source bauxite 
from Niyamgiri bauxite deposit without 
the consent of the local community.
Tom Albanese: One of the first operations 
I visited was the Lanjigarh alumina refinery. 
I must say that I was pleasantly surprised 
by the level of care on the ground and I 
think that the reality is much better than 
it is widely perceived. While Vedanta has 
done a commendable job in terms of 
community development near and around 
the Lanjigarh refinery, these good deeds 
have unfortunately been overshadowed by 
the controversy at Niyamgiri. We will now 
focus our attention to other resources on 
a regional basis which can be developed 
in a manner consistent with global norms 
and expectations. Even though we do not 
have sufficient captive feed currently, we 
continue to operate our Aluminium smelters 
at Jharsuguda, in Odisha, and Korba, in the 
adjoining state of Chhattisgarh, efficiently, 
producing aluminium in the lower half 
of the cost curve, despite the higher cost 
of purchased bauxite and alumina.
Q Court Orders to restart iron ore 
mining in the states of Karnataka 
and Goa have been issued after 
long periods of mining bans 
in both these states of India. 
However, it seems that not all 
issues have been resolved. What is 
the latest and will you get back to 
production levels before the bans?
Tom Albanese: We restarted our operations 
at Karnataka in end December, and have 
been selling ore through government 
sponsored e-auctions. I see the authorisation 
to restart mining in Karnataka and 
the Supreme Court order in Goa as an 
encouraging sign, confirming that we are 
gaining momentum in the right direction. 
Our iron ore mining division has operated 
sustainably for nearly six decades, and we 
have had a strong focus on sustainable 
mining and adding more to reserves and 
resources through exploration, than what 
we mine out. We are currently working 
with the State Government of Goa and 
the Ministry of Environment and Forests 
to obtain necessary approvals to restart 
mining in Goa, and hope to start production 
after the monsoon season this year.
Overall, India has the seventh largest 
reserves of iron ore in the world and Goa as 
a region is not constrained by geology. We 
have seen geological features at our Sonshi 
mine in Goa which resemble those in the 
Pilbara in Western Australia. Besides, with 
proximity to inland waterways and port, the 
mines in Goa have a strong cost positioning.
Anil Agarwal: The issues in the State of 
Goa were driven by environmental concerns 
as mining activity increased significantly 
in response to record iron ore prices and 
access to port through inland waterways. 
As many small unorganised miners sprang 
up, the Government restricted mining 
activity across the State with an intention to 
ensure responsible mining, and this affected 
large, organised miners such as our iron 
ore operations, which has a track record of 
responsible mining for over six decades in 
the area. If you take a look at the work done 
on returning the depleted Sanquelim mine 
in Goa to its natural state, you will see a 
fully reclaimed environment where we have 
planted over 600,000 trees, and open pits 
have been converted to ponds and fisheries.
Q So, the merger of Sesa Goa and 
Sterlite Industries and consolidation 
are now complete, what are your 
plans on the Group structure
Anil Agarwal: The merger of Sesa Goa 
and Sterlite is a major step forward on 
our journey to unlock value and we are 
already seeing the benefits of that. Our key 
priority now is the purchase of the shares 
in HZL and BALCO that are held by the 
Government of India. The Government 
has taken a decision to sell their stakes 
through the auction route and the process 
is under way. An offer has been made and 
is under consideration, but the timetable 
for this is not something we can control.
Q What are your strategic priorities 
going forward and do you envisage 
any changes to strategy?
Anil Agarwal: My vision and strategy 
for the Company remains the same: to 
build and grow a diversified global natural 
resources major and Tom shares that 
vision. However, right now our primary 
objective is to deleverage from the cash 
flows that the business is generating as 
our capital intensive projects are nearing 
completion and ramping up production.
Currently, we are working on the low-risk 
projects at the high-margin businesses of 
oil & gas and zinc, which have significant 
cash generation from existing operations, 
and cash balances. As we consider future 
investment opportunities, these decisions 
will be based on rigorous capital allocation 
and we will continue to evaluate all available 
options for capital deployment. I am proud 
to reiterate that we have maintained a 
progressive dividend through the global 
financial crisis, and have delivered a total 
shareholder return of 200% since our IPO.
Tom Albanese: From my point of view, India 
will have a strong demand for commodities 
with growing urbanisation and favourable 
demographics over the next 20–30 years, 
current low levels of per capita consumption, 
and a robust democracy. India has abundant 
geological resources and the potential 
to build a world class natural resources 
industry that not only provides energy and 
raw material security to the country, but 
also creates considerable employment and 
economic activity. As the largest diversified 
natural resources company in India, Vedanta 
is at the forefront of this opportunity.
“My vision and strategy for the Company 
remains the same: to build and grow a 
diversified global natural resources major 
and Tom shares that vision.” 18 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report and accounts FY2014
Strategic Report
Against this backdrop, the GoI realises the 
importance of boosting domestic production 
of crude oil to bridge the widening gap 
between demand and domestic supply, 
and has recently announced policy 
decisions such as the Integrated Block 
Development approach, and the permission 
to undertake exploration in areas that 
have started development or operations 
under Production Sharing Contracts.
India has abundant natural resources 
that are yet to be sufficiently explored, 
developed and tapped. India’s reserves of 
iron ore, bauxite, zinc and coal rank among 
the largest in the world. The introduction of 
new regulations, including the new Mining 
and Minerals bill, and a general focus on 
regulatory policies to support economic 
activity is expected to encourage and 
accelerate private sector investment and 
drive the development of the industry.
Commodities
Over the last year, slowing emerging 
market growth dampened demand for 
base metals and depressed prices, while 
crude oil prices remained relatively resilient. 
Mining companies have responded by 
focusing on cost improvements and 
productivity initiatives rather than growth, 
to bring supply in line with demand.
Market overview
Emerging markets continue to 
be the key drivers of growth.
Overview
In an environment of volatile commodity 
prices, as one of the largest diversified 
resource producers globally and with 
a portfolio of Tier-1 assets, Vedanta 
is well-positioned to navigate the 
prevailing economic conditions.
Global economy
In 2013, worldwide economic growth 
was stable at 3.0%, just slightly lower 
than the 3.1 % recorded in 2012. The 
slow-down in China during the early 
part of the year contributed to a lower 
emerging markets growth rate of 4.7%, 
while developed economies recorded a 
1.3% rise. There were more encouraging 
signs in the second half of the year as 
global economic growth rebounded.
The world economy is expected to 
strengthen in 2014, with growth expected 
to rise to 3.7%, closer to its historical 
average. Despite concerns about the 
Federal Reserve tapering its asset purchase 
programme, monetary policies across the 
world continue to be expansionary and 
are expected to drive growth in advanced 
economies up to 2.2%, increasing demand 
that in turn could support a higher 
emerging market growth rate of 5.1 %.
Indian economy
India’s growth is still one of the highest in the 
world, although it slowed to 4.6% in 2013, its 
second lowest in a decade averaging around 
7 .5% annual growth. With general elections 
in May 2014, and a rising awareness 
across the country for the need to improve 
governance and align regulatory policies to 
support economic activity, India’s growth is 
expected to pick up in the coming years.
Strong global growth, improving export 
competitiveness with a weaker rupee and 
a confidence boost from recent policy 
actions are expected to contribute to a 
modest rise in India’s economic growth 
to 5.4% in 2014, with the potential to 
recover to 6.8% in the medium term if 
structural reforms are implemented to 
accelerate investment projects that improve 
infrastructure and to bring persistent 
high inflation levels under control.
Investment in infrastructure for 
transportation, housing and power will 
continue to drive demand for aluminium, 
zinc, copper and iron ore in India fuelled by 
a rising working age population, increasing 
per capita income, and a growing middle 
class, combined with ongoing urbanisation.
While India has large refining facilities, 
it is highly dependent on imports of 
crude oil with an inevitable impact on 
the country’s trade balance and current 
account. In addition, increased oil prices 
are not passed on to the consumers, 
resulting in an increasing subsidy burden 
to the Government of India (‘GoI’) and 
a negative impact on the fiscal deficit.

Zinc
Although prices were under pressure in 
2013, a declining global supply is likely to 
fall short of demand in the medium term 
and prices are expected to strengthen as 
inventories reduce. End demand in India 
remains strong with the galvanizing sector, 
which is the largest consumer, delivering 
strong growth and this momentum is likely 
to continue as the country’s investment 
in infrastructure drives demand.
Lead
Tougher environmental regulation and 
supply shortages characterised the global 
lead market even as demand was affected 
by a slow recovery in vehicle production 
and the emergence of alternative battery 
technologies. Overall, the global lead market 
is expected to continue to grow driven by 
developing economies, including India 
where domestic demand has been strong.
Copper
Global supply marginally exceeded 
consumption in the year, with the ramp 
up in production from the new mines in 
Africa and Mongolia and good production 
in Chile and Peru. Whilst demand for 
copper in India was stable during the 
year, demand is expected to rise driven 
by investment in infrastructure projects, 
the development of power generation 
capacity and continued urbanisation.
Aluminium
Prices declined during the year as stocks 
were high and supply growth matched 
consumption with the exception of China 
where growth was exceptionally strong 
at 12%. However, lower LME prices were 
offset by higher physical premiums as large 
inventories remain blocked in warehouses 
driven by financing deals. Looking forward, 
primary aluminium demand is expected to 
rise, supported by the transport sector and 
metal substitutions in favour of aluminium. 
Lack of demand in the electrical sector 
in India led to a fall in consumption but 
both supply and demand are forecast to 
recover in 2015 as demand in the electrical 
sector recovers, boosted by investment 
in infrastructure and transport.
Iron Ore
Consumption of steel in China continued 
to drive growth in world steel demand with 
prices rising during the year, despite credit 
restrictions in China dampening demand 
in the latter half of the year. The increased 
availability of supply from new mines in 
2015 is expected to curtail further price rises. 
Indian steel consumption is also forecast 
to rise as a result of government spending 
on infrastructure and higher consumption 
of consumer durables. However, iron ore 
prices in the domestic market are expected 
to remain soft due to the impact of export 
restrictions and duties on domestic pricing.
Oil & Gas
Whilst demand for oil increased, led by 
China, global prices remained moderate as 
the US shale revolution boosted production 
in North America. Prices are expected to 
stabilise going forward as global economic 
growth recovers. Demand in India 
continued to rise, with imports continuing 
to meet more than 70% of demand even 
as Cairn India‘s contribution to India’s 
domestic crude oil production increased 
from 26% in FY2013 to 28% in FY2014.
Long-term outlook
The long-term outlook for the sector remains 
positive as the structural economic trends 
of population growth and urbanisation 
in emerging economies are expected to 
continue driving demand for commodities 
for construction and infrastructure, and for 
consumer goods as the income of growing 
middle classes in these economies rises. 
Consequently, power sale prices are also 
expected to increase in the coming year.
Vedanta’s market position
As the leading natural resources provider 
in India, Vedanta is well-positioned to 
respond to the growing demand for raw 
materials with strategically located, high 
quality assets, and scalable capacities.
Close proximity to growing Asian markets 
and cost positions in the lowest quartile 
or lower half of the global cost curve, put 
Vedanta in a strong competitive position to 
take advantage of the opportunities in both 
India as well as other emerging markets. 20 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report and accounts FY2014

High value outputs
Natural resources
Our diversified portfolio produces high 
quality metals and minerals, LME-
branded refined metals, and Oil & Gas, 
delivering industry leading EBITDA 
margins of over 40% (excluding custom 
smelting). Our business activities are 
underpinned by a well-established 
sustainability framework to minimise 
our environmental footprint. 
People and skills
We invest in developing our workforce 
delivering over 1.1 million hours of 
training, including over 81,000 hours of 
health and safety training. We attract 
and retain talented employees through 
management training and development 
programmes supported by specific 
initiatives to encourage gender diversity.
Governments
We are a substantial contributor to the 
economies where we operate, both as 
an employer and a tax payer. We paid a 
total of US$5.3 billion in taxes and levies 
across the Group in the FY2013–14.
Society
We make an economic and social 
contribution to the communities 
where we operate, investing US$49.0 
million in FY2013–14 in building 
hospitals, schools and infrastructure 
and providing community programmes 
for around 4.1 million people. 
Customers
We deliver high quality raw materials for 
our customers in line with international 
standards for quality, settlement terms 
and delivery dates. We operate more 
than 25% of India’s oil production and 
contribute to the nation’s energy security. 
India has a deficit power market and we 
are a large generator of power in India.
Shareholders
We have a progressive dividend policy 
and have returned US$1.4 billion in 
dividends to shareholders since the 
IPO in 2004. We delivered a total 
shareholder return of 200% since the 
Vedanta listing in London in FY2004.
Value chain
Exploration
We focus on extending the life of our mines 
and oilfields through focused exploration, 
aimed at increasing our Reserve and 
Resources (‘R&R’) base over and above 
what we extract each year. We prefer to 
explore brown field opportunities across 
our current asset base, and a few select, 
large scale, low-cost, green field sites.
Asset development
We develop our resource base to optimise 
both production and the life of the resource. 
We also develop processing facilities that are 
strategically located close to our resources to 
optimise our costs and access to markets. As 
mines reach the end of their lives, we work 
to remediate and rehabilitate them back 
to their original natural characteristics.
Extraction
Our operations are focused on mining 
metals and bulks and extracting. We 
operate mines in India, Africa, Australia 
and Ireland, extracting zinc, lead, silver, iron 
ore, bauxite and copper. We produce oil & 
gas from three operating blocks in India.
Processing
In line with our integrated value chain, we 
produce refined metals by processing and 
smelting the ore that we extract out. We 
have smelters and other processing facilities 
in India and Africa. We generate our own 
power for most of our operations, selling any 
surplus. We also sell power generated by our 
independent power plants and wind farms.
Value addition
While we are primarily upstream, we 
selectively add value by converting some 
of our primary metal products into higher 
margin products such as sheets, rods, bars 
rolled products at our zinc, aluminium 
and copper businesses, depending on 
the profitability of adding value and the 
customer demand for these products.

organically by growing our resource 
base and investing to expand our 
capacity and increase our production 
volumes, complemented with selective 
acquisitions where we can use our 
strategic capabilities to add significant 
value to large, proven assets.
Long-term value 
We aim to be a low-cost operator across 
all our businesses, optimising our cost 
and operational performance through 
a culture of continuous improvement. 
We maintain a continuous focus on 
exploration to ensure we are adding to 
our reserves and resources at a faster 
rate than we are depleting them. We 
seek to drive synergies from integrating 
the Group and consolidating and 
simplifying our group structure.
Sustainability 
We are committed to providing a 
safe, secure and healthy workplace 
for our employees by optimising our 
consumption and minimising our 
environmental footprint. We aim to 
forge strong relationships with all our 
key stakeholders and to contribute to

Strategic Report
Sustainability report 
Sustainability is an ongoing journey for any business. 
This anniversary provides us an opportunity to reflect 
the journey of growth and delivery we have been on 
and how we have integrated sustainable working 
across our businesses.
Over the past decade, Vedanta  
has been on a journey to deliver 
high-quality assets and low-cost 
operations, with sustainable 
development underpinning all our 
activities. The development of our 
Sustainability Framework over the 
last few years provides us with a 
robust structure to deliver this 
supported by our three sustainability 
pillars – Responsible Stewardship, 
Building Strong Relationships and 
Adding and Sharing Value. This 
approach also enables us to drive 
consistency across all our subsidiary 
companies and during the year  
we have further embedded the 
standards and processes required 
to achieve this.
Key highlights
• All Scott Wilson recommendations 
implemented
• 37% reduction in LTIFR in last  
four years
• 59% of employees received  
Code of Conduct and Human 
Rights training
• US$49.0 million contributed to 
community development, 
benefiting 4.1 million people
• Reduction in Category four  
and five environment spillages
• US$5.3 billion paid in taxes

Responsible stewardship
This encapsulates our approach to managing 
our risks and how we conduct our business 
ethically. It also guides us in ensuring the 
health and safety of our workforce and how 
we minimise our environmental footprint.
Building strong relationships
We work hard to engage with our 
stakeholders to understand their key 
concerns and expectations of our business. 
Proactive engagement also enables us 
to identify opportunities and mitigate 
risks by understanding and responding 
to issues rather than reacting to them.
Adding and sharing value
We believe our role is to create value for 
all our stakeholders; not just through 
the financial value we create for our 
shareholders but the non-financial value 
we add to society. As a business we make 
a considerable economic impact through 
employment, payment of taxes and royalties 
and building local infrastructure such as 
roads, schools and healthcare centres.
Implementing our sustainability 
framework
Our Framework provides clear, structured 
guidance to all of our subsidiary businesses 
to manage their business sustainably. 
It is comprised of a full set of policies, 
technical and management standards 
and supporting guidance notes aligned 
to international standards including 
International Finance Corporation 
(‘IFC’), ICMM and OECD guidelines.
Over the last two years we have further 
embedded the Sustainability Framework and 
implemented its practices and standards. To 
date more than 9,000 employees have been 
trained on our Sustainability Framework. 
This year, we continued providing training 
to our management teams to ensure 
there was a solid understanding of the 
Framework’s requirements. We cascaded 
information down to our businesses, 
providing on-site training to managers to 
ensure compliance by their teams. Now all 
our new projects are implemented as per 
our Sustainability Framework guidelines.
Vedanta sustainability assurance 
program (‘VSAP’)
We are using our Sustainability Assurance 
Program – VSAP – as our assurance tool to 
assess the compliance of all our businesses 
with the Framework and identify where 
gaps exist and how to bridge those gaps. 
The assurance model has 16 modules, 
which cover environment, health, safety etc, 
human rights and community elements. The 
assurance system works on the premise of 
tracking corrective and preventive action by 
our subsidiaries and undertaking periodic 
formal audits by the corporate sustainability 
team, supported by external experts.
Materiality
This year we undertook a more rigorous 
materiality exercise in which external 
stakeholders and the Vedanta Management 
team (internal stakeholders) were invited, 
through a variety of engagements, to 
discuss the issues which were of more 
material concern to them. This has focused 
our reporting on what matters most to 
the people concerned with Vedanta and 
is a key element in the development 
of our approach to sustainability.
These engagements enabled us to identify 
the priorities and expectations of our 
stakeholders and our management. We 
have translated these priorities into material 
business issues and mapped them onto 
the materiality matrix published in our 
Sustainable Development Report 2013–14.
“Our success is bound to 
ensuring that we operate  
in the safest manner, 
protecting our workforce 
and surrounding 
communities, and engaging 
with these communities in  
a way that builds trust and 
delivers sustainable benefits.”

to embed a zero harm culture, with targeted 
programmes for our high-risk operations. Our 
approach begins with hazard identification 
and risk assessment. Management systems 
are designed to identify and remove 
unsafe conditions, train our people in safe 
practices and ensure correct behaviour 
through management leadership.
We have identified six Key Focus Safety 
Areas (these are covered in detail in our 
Sustainable Development report) and 
have rolled out targeted programmes to 
directly address those risks. The areas were 
identified on the basis that approximately 
75% of incidents causing lost time due 
to injury or fatalities fell within them.
We are guided by internationally recognised 
standards on health and safety. All our 
subsidiary businesses are obliged to ensure 
that their safety management programmes 
meet the requirements of the Sustainability 
Framework which incorporates guidance 
from the International Finance Corporation’s 
Performance Standards (‘IFC’) and other 
relevant international standards. In addition, 
44 out of 52 sites are OHSAS 18001 certified.
Environment
Environmental management forms a key 
component of our Sustainability Framework 
and is applied to the entire lifecycle of all 
our operations with processes mapped 
against international standards, such as 
the ISO 14001 and ISO 50001. We disclose 
our environmental performance to the 
Carbon Disclosure Project, and our score 
again improved this year to achieve 82 
points and a performance grade B. This 
saw Vedanta ranked ninth among 31 FTSE 
350 companies in the materials category.
Our continuous improvement projects 
in air, water and energy management 
have made good progress, but the 
business has much more to do to 
meet our own challenging targets.
Environment management
We understand that the nature of our 
operations has implications for the 
environment in different ways – through the 
emission of particulates, wastes generated 
in mining, refining and smelting processes, 
water consumption and changes in land use.
As part of continual improvement, we plan 
to obtain ISO 14001 certifications at all 
our sites, as of now 45 of our 52 operations 
are certified, with three additional sites 
obtaining certification in 2013–14. This 
year, in total we spent US$60 million 
on environmental management.

(operation and projects) both.
Health and safety
The health and safety of our people remains 
a key focus and, while we have made many 
improvements in how we run our business, 
our rate of fatalities and serious injuries 
remains completely unacceptable and we 
are saddened to report 19 fatalities this 
year. Work has been done to address this 
and we will continue to improve through 
more rigorous training, forensic risk 
mitigation and constant reinforcement of 
our expectations, particularly by working 
closely with our contractors. Across our 
businesses 81,000 man hours of safety 
training have been delivered this year and 
we have seen a reduction in the injury rates 
during the year in line with the trend over 
the past five years where our Lost Time 
Injury Frequency Rate (operations and 
projects) has reduced from 0.86 to 0.54. 
Whilst working in the extractive industry 
inevitably brings with it an element of risk, 
Vedanta is committed to mitigating this 
through a careful, diligent approach to 
safety. This year we continued our journey  Strategic Report Directors’ Report Financial Statements Additional Information
27 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report and accounts FY2014
Our Energy and Carbon policy commits 
our operations to adopt and maintain 
global best practices in carbon and energy 
management and to minimise greenhouse 
gas (‘GHG’) emissions. Although reducing 
our GHG emissions is a challenge as the 
majority of our operating sites are in 
developing countries where sources of 
renewable energy are limited however 
we fully support the global campaign to 
reduce GHG emissions. The management 
plans and improvement projects are 
in place to address this challenge. We 
calculate and report Green House Gas 
Inventory i.e. Scope 1 (Process emissions 
and other direct emissions) and Scope 2 
(purchased electricity data) as defined under 
World Business Council for Sustainable 
Development (‘WBCSD’s’) and World 
Resource Institute (‘WRI’s’) GHG protocol.
Environment incidents
We strive for zero environmental incidents 
and have a robust internal process for 
managing any incident that does occur. 
During the reporting period, there was 
only one higher category (Category 4) 
environmental incident reported at HZL 
operations. The details are provided in 
the Sustainable Development Report.
Water and energy savings
Due to disruption in production at our 
Tuticorin copper smelter, CMT, Lanjigarh 
and Goa iron ore operations and further 
delay in the commencement of some 
scheduled initiatives, we could not achieved 
our targeted water and energy savings 
during the year. Further, our KCM mines 
have had to withdraw large amounts 
of underground water due to the high 
water table in the region. Excluding 
KCM, the absolute water and energy 
savings were 2.53 MCM and 1.33 GJ.
Biodiversity management plans
Progress has been made across all our 
businesses to engage experts and establish 
Biodiversity management plans (‘BMP’s’) to 
meet our FY2015-16 deadline. All our high 
priority sites like HZL, Skorpion Zinc, KCM 
and Black Mountain have either initiated the 
process or already have the BMP’s in place.
Waste management
Our mining, smelting and refinery operations 
generate significant amounts of non-
hazardous wastes and some hazardous 
wastes. The bulk is mineral waste, generated 
by the mining of ore and its processing 
and the smelting of metals. Our main 
priority is to reduce both the quantity 
and toxicity of our waste, followed by 
recovery, reuse and recycling, with disposal 
in landfill or by incineration. More detail 
on our performance in this area is covered 
in our Sustainable Development Report. 
During the year, we reused 71 % of non-
hazardous waste into various use and 
achieved our target of a 5% increase in 
overall non-hazardous waste recycling rate.

such as Gergarub, Namibia and Western 
Clusters, Liberia, an extensive SEP process 
was followed. This included commissioning 
baseline studies, holding public consultation 
meetings and meetings with authorities.
Community engagement
The long-term success of our business is 
dependent upon building trust with our 
host communities. All our businesses have 
implemented local community engagement 
plans, with grievance procedures in place 
so that any issues can be raised locally. 
All community incidents and grievances 
are recorded and closed appropriately.
Human rights
Our policy is aligned to the UN Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights, 
and includes a ban on child or forced 
labour – either directly or through contract 
labour. Additionally, our Code of Conduct 
commits us to comply with all relevant 
laws and regulations, underpinning our 
approach to protect the fundamental rights 
of our employees and contract workforce. 
Particular attention is paid to the rights of 
indigenous people and vulnerable tribes 
and a specific management standard 
and guidance note has been rolled out to 
control how projects should address this 
issue. Human rights training is an integral 
part of our Sustainability Framework 
implementation, with around 20,000 man 
hours of training on human rights and 
Code of Conduct was given in FY2013–14. 
Further, led by the Sustainability Committee, 
we undertook internal reviews related to 
human rights and risk assessment. The 
human rights audit and risk assessment 
review was commissioned to ensure that all 
our subsidiaries have a clear understanding 
of the areas of possible risk pertaining to 
human rights. Following the assessment, it 
was recognised that whilst robust control 
systems were in place, greater visual displays 
of our Code of Conduct, policies and control 
procedures should be in place at more 
remote locations, where the risk is highest.
Stakeholder engagement
We engage with seven stakeholder groups 
including employees, communities, 
industry, host governments, civil societies, 
shareholders and investors. Throughout the 
year around 3,800 stakeholder engagement 
meetings took place, with community 
leaders, non-governmental organisations 
(‘NGOs’), governments and government 
bodies, academic institutions and around 
250 partnerships are now in place.

Employees
Our growth and success is dependent 
on our employees. We create a high 
performance work culture, investing in 1.1 
million training hours for all staff, averaging 
40 man hours per employee to enable 
employees to develop their potential. This 
year, we continued our spotlight on bringing 
more women in to our business, with the 
proportion of women in the business 
rising to 8.4%. Further, we have taken an 
objective of 25% women representation 
at the Vedanta Board level by 2015 
with no appointment made to date.
We also focus on recruiting from the 
communities that surround our operations to 
encourage local employment opportunities. 
Over the reporting period, the total 
percentage of senior management who 
are locally hired is: India (91 %), Australia 
(100%), Zambia (59%), Namibia (Nil), 
Ireland (100%) and South Africa (40%).
We also continued with our programmes 
to recruit graduates; an essential element 
in building a strong talent pipeline for the 
future. This is augmented with our ACT-UP 
50 stars of business programme which 
identifies ‘future ready’ leaders to effectively 
transition into senior leadership positions.
Our attrition rate for the period stands at 
4.92%.
Our subsidiaries companies namely BALCO, 
HZL, SSL-Iron, KCM & Zinc International sites 
have recognised unions while other locations 
have adequate systems and processes 
for employee development, appraisal, 
remuneration and grievance redressals.
Communities
We have seven discrete focus areas in 
our community programmes: health, 
education, sustainable livelihoods, women 
empowerment, community asset creation, 
bio-investment and integrated village 
development. During FY2013–14 we 
invested approximately US$49 million in 
community programmes, benefiting some 
4.1 million people. One particular campaign, 
‘Vedanta Khushi’, has focused on raising 
awareness of the needs of underprivileged 
children in India and as part of this, we have 
twinned with 112 schools in Rajasthan to 
support their renovation and 75 childcare 
centres in rural Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu,

Host Governments
We contribute to the economies where 
we operate through payments to the 
Exchequer and salary payments to our 
substantial workforce, in particular in India 
and Zambia. This year, we contributed 
US$5.3 billion to host governments by way 
of taxes and royalties. Direct economic 
benefits are also generated through the 
employment of around 90,000 permanent 
employees and contractor employees, and 
through the estimated 500,000 indirect 
employment our operations generate.

Strategic Report
Key performance indicators
Vedanta has identified the key 
performance indicators that it 
believes are useful in assessing 
how well the Group is performing 
against its strategic aims.
They encompass both financial 
and non-financial measures.
Growth 
Long-term value 
Description
Revenue represents the value of goods and 
services provided to third parties during the year.
Commentary
Revenue was lower due to weaker commodity 
and oil prices along with the temporary forced 
business closures at our iron ore operations 
and copper Tuticorin smelter. Further, lower 
volumes at our Copper Zambia and Zinc 
International businesses also reduced revenue. 
This has been partially offset by improved 
operating performance along with volume 
increases at Cairn India and Zinc India. This 
resulted in revenues for the year of US$12,945.0 
million, 11.6% lower than the previous year.
Description
This is calculated on the basis of operating profit 
before special items and net of tax as a ratio of 
capital invested in operations as at the balance 
sheet date, and excludes investment in project 
capital work in progress and exploration assets. 
The objective is to consistently earn a post-tax 
return above the weighted average cost of capital.
Commentary
ROCE without project capital work in progress 
and exploration assets in FY2013–14 was 14.9% 
as compared to 17.5% in the previous year.
1 Excluding work in progress and exploration assets.
Description
This represents net profit attributable to equity 
shareholders and is stated before special 
items and their attributable tax and minority 
interest impacts. By producing a stream 
of profits and EPS we will be able to pay a 
progressive dividend to our shareholders.
Commentary
Underlying EPS at 34.2 US cents per share was 
lower compared to the previous year of 134.8 
US cents per share. This was impacted due to 
reduced prices, one-off items in interest cost such 
as Jharsuguda Plant 2 interest non-capitalisation, 
accelerated interest amortisation on a convertible 
bond with put option due in May 2014 and its 
associated tax provision, and a higher effective tax 
rate in FY2013–14 as compared to previous year.
Description
Dividend per share is the total of final dividend 
recommended by the Board in relation to the year 
and interim dividend paid out during the year.
Commentary
We have been able to maintain our commitment 
to a progressive dividend policy, raising the total 
dividend to 61 US cents per share this year, up 5%.

Sustainability 
Description
The Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (‘LTIFR’) is 
the number of lost-time injuries per million man-
hours worked. This includes our employees and 
contractors working in our operations and projects.
Commentary
We have been able to sustain reduction in 
LTIFR with a 37% fall over the last three years. 
Additionally, we have initiated structured 
programmes to review and remove any 
unsafe conditions at our plants. More focus 
is being given to incident reporting.
2 Starting from this year we are reporting combined LTIFR 
for operations and projects and previous year numbers 
have been restated accordingly.
Description
The percentage of women in the total permanent 
employee workforce.
Commentary
We nurture passionate talent and provide 
equal opportunities to men and women. During 
FY2013–14, women employees comprised 
8.4% of our employees. We initiated special 
recruitment drives for providing career 
advancement to women, including planned 
rotation through corporate functions.
Description
Total number of beneficiaries through our 
community development programmes 
across all our operations.
Commentary
We benefited over 4 million people this 
year through our continuous efforts in the 
community development projects comprising 
community health, nutrition, education, 
water and sanitation, sustainable livelihood, 
women empowerment and bio-investment.
Description
Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and 
Amortisation (‘EBITDA’) is a factor of volumes, 
prices and cost of production. This measure is 
calculated by adjusting operating profit for special 
items, and adding depreciation and amortisation.
Commentary
EBITDA for FY2013–14 was lower by 8.5% at 
US$4,491.2 million as compared to US$4,908.9 
million in FY2012–13 primarily due to lower 
commodity prices, a higher profit petroleum share 
to Government of India, partly offset by better 
operating volumes at Cairn India, Zinc India and 
Aluminium business despite the temporary forced 
business closures referred to above. These impacts 
were partially mitigated by cost control measures 
and currency fluctuations during the period.
Description
This represents net cash flows before investing 
in expansion projects and dividends paid out 
by Vedanta. This measure ensures that the 
profit generated by our assets is reflected by 
cash flow in order to fund future growth.
Commentary
Free cash flow was US$3,016.5 million in 
FY2013–14 as compared to US$3,534.7 
million in FY2012–13. EBITDA conversion to 
free cash flow was 67.2% as compared to 
EBITDA conversion to free cash flow of 72.0% 
in FY2012–13 mainly due to increased interest 
charges due to non-capitalisation of interest 
of Jharsuguda Plant 2 and higher special 
items in FY2013–14 as compared to previous 
year. Cash flow generation after expansion 
capital expenditure was US$1,591.9 million, 
marginally higher than the previous year.
Description
This represents the amount invested in our 
organic growth programme during the year.
Commentary
Expansion capital expenditure during the 
year was US$1,424.6 million as compared to 
US$2,019.1 million, down by US$594.5 million. 
The capital expenditure reflects the Company’s 
disciplined approach to capital allocation.

Strategic Report
Principal risks and uncertainties
Our multi-layered risk management framework is 
aimed at effectively mitigating various risks which 
our businesses are exposed to in the course of their 
operations as well as in their strategic actions.
Our businesses are exposed to variety of 
risks which are inherent to an international 
mining and resources organisation. 
Resource companies carry with it a 
significant element of constantly evolving 
risks, making it essential for them to 
develop necessary systems to manage 
the risks, while simultaneously balancing 
the relative risk/reward equations 
demanded by its stakeholders. In addition, 
the nature of our business operations 
is long term, resulting in several of the 
identified risks being enduring in nature.
Our risk management framework is 
designed to be a simple, consistent and 
clear for managing and reporting risks from 
the Group’s businesses to the Board. Risk 
management is embedded in our critical 
business activities, functions and processes. 
Materiality and tolerance for risk are key 
considerations in our decision-making.
Our management systems, organisational 
structures, processes, standards, code 
of conduct together form the system 
of internal control that govern how 
we conduct the Group’s business and 
manage the associated risks.
We have a multi-layered risk management 
framework aimed at effectively mitigating 
the various risks which our businesses are 
exposed to in the course of their operations 
as well as in their strategic actions. We 
identify risk at the individual business level 
for existing operations as well as for ongoing 
projects through a consistently applied 
methodology, using the Turnbull matrix.
Formal discussion on risk management 
happens in business level review meetings 
at least once in a quarter. The respective 
businesses review the risks, change in the 
nature and extent of the major risks since 
the last assessment, control measures 
established for the risk and further action 
plans. The control measures stated 
in the risk matrix are also periodically 
reviewed by the business management 
teams to verify their effectiveness.
These meetings are chaired by business CEOs 
and attended by CXOs, senior management 
and concern functional heads. Risk officers 
have been formally nominated at all 
operating businesses as well as Group level 
whose role is to create awareness on risks 
at senior management level and to develop 
and nurture a risk management culture 
within the businesses. Risk mitigation plans 
form an integral part of KRA/KPI process 
of process owners. Structured discussion 
on risk management also happens at 
SBU levels on their respective risk matrix 
and mitigation plans. Governance of risk 
management framework in the businesses 
is anchored with their leadership team.
As mentioned in the last years report, formal 
discussion on risk management happens 
at Group level once in a quarter. The Group 
level Risk Management Committee meeting 
is attended by Group senior management, 
entity CXOs, risk officers and other members.
The Board of Directors has the ultimate 
responsibility for management of risks 
and for ensuring the effectiveness of 
internal control systems. The Audit 
Committee aids the Board in this process 
by identification and assessment of any 
changes in risk exposure, review of risk 
control measures and by approval of 
remedial actions, where appropriate.
The Audit Committee is in turn supported 
by the Group Level Risk Management 
Committee (‘GRMC’), which helps the Audit 
Committee in evaluating the design and 
operating effectiveness of the risk mitigation 
programme and the control systems.
In addition to the above structure, 
other key risk governance and oversight 
committees include the following:
• Group Treasury Risk Management 
Committee has an oversight on the 
treasury related risks. This committee 
comprises of Group CFO, business CFOs 
and Treasury Heads at respective 
businesses.
• Group Capex Sub-Committee which 
evaluates the risks while reviewing any 
capital investment decisions as well as 
institutes a risk management framework in 
expansion projects.
• Vedanta Board Level Sustainability 
Committee which looks at sustainability 
related risks. This committee is headed  
by a Non-Executive Director and has 
Group CEO and other business leaders  
as its members.
As stated above, every business division 
in the Group has developed its own risk 
matrix of Top 20 risks which gets reviewed 
at Business Management Committee 
level. In addition, business divisions have 
also developed their own risk registers 
(comprising of 75–100 risks or at times 
even more) depending on size of operations 
and number of SBUs/locations. These 
risks get reviewed in SBU level meetings.
Our principal risks, which have been assessed 
according to impact and likelihood, are 
described on the following pages. The 
order in which these risks appear does not 
necessarily reflect the likelihood of their 
occurrence or the relative magnitude of 
their impact on our business. While our risk 
management framework is designed to 
help the organisation meet its objectives, 
there can be no guarantee that our risk 
management activities will mitigate or 
prevent these or other risks from occurring.

Delay in commencement of production facilities in aluminium business
Some of our projects have been completed (pending commissioning) 
or nearing completion. The timing, implementation and cost of these 
expansion projects are subject to a number of risks, including delay in 
obtaining necessary approvals which may delay or prevent us from 
commencing commercial operations at some of these projects.
We are in the process of securing key raw material linkages for our 
alumina/aluminium business. In order to meet our bauxite 
requirements, continuous dialogue is happening with the State 
Government for allocation of new mining leases. Sourcing of bauxite 
from mines in neighbouring states is also being pursued.
Various infrastructures related challenges have been/are being 
addressed. Requisite approvals for the commencement of our 
production facilities are being pursued.
A strong management team is in place to work towards sustainable 
low cost of production, operational excellence and securing key raw 
material linkages. With Sesa Sterlite merger process completed, we 
have progressed one step further in this direction. Further details in 
this connection are included in the Aluminium business section.
Extension of Production Sharing Contract of Cairn beyond 2020 or extension at less favourable terms
Cairn India has 70% participating interest in Rajasthan Block. The 
production sharing contract (‘PSC’) of Rajasthan Block runs till 2020. 
Challenges in extension of production sharing contract of Cairn 
(beyond 2020) or extension at less favourable terms may have 
implications.
PSC has certain enabling provisions for extension of the terms. During 
the year, we continued to engage effectively with all Government 
stakeholders for an informed policy discourse.
FY2013–14 saw increased engagement between Ministry of 
Petroleum & Natural Gas and industry associations to improvise 
regulatory and operational environment.
Formal application for extension of the licence term as provided in the 
Production Sharing Contract has been submitted to the Ministry of 
Petroleum and Natural Gas.
Reliability and predictability in operational performance
Our operations are subject to conditions and events beyond our 
control that could, among other matters, increase our mining, 
transportation or production costs, disrupt or halt operations at our 
mines, smelters and power plants and production facilities for varying 
lengths of time or even permanently. These conditions and events 
include disruptions in mining and production due to equipment 
failures, unexpected maintenance problems and other interruptions, 
non-availability of raw materials of appropriate quantity and quality 
for our energy requirements, disruptions to or increased cost of 
transport services or strikes and industrial actions or disputes.
Also challenges at KCM in terms of volume ramp up and cost can 
impact its profitability. 
Asset utilisation and cost of production (‘CoP’) continues to be a 
priority area. We carry out periodic benchmarking of cost of 
production and other operational efficiencies with the objective of 
being in the top decile in all the businesses on CoP . A structured asset 
optimisation programme has been launched in the Group with help of 
reputed consulting firms to improve overall awareness and 
operational efficiencies.
The role of asset optimisation function in the businesses has been 
enlarged and elevated in the organisation structure. Cost reduction 
projects with specific targets are taken up periodically along with 
leading international consultants.
We continue to invest in new technology to improve CoP . While some 
of these risks can be beyond our control, we have adequate and 
competent experience in these areas and have consistently 
demonstrated our ability to manage these problems proactively.
At KCM, an appropriate organisation is already in place and our focus 
is on stabilising production. Cost reduction initiatives have been taken 
up at Nchanga. Our priority today at KCM is cash conservation. 34 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report and accounts FY2014

Challenges in resumption, continuation of Iron Ore business
The Honourable Supreme Court (‘The Court’) through its order dated 
21 April 2014 has lifted the ban on mining in the State of Goa, subject 
to certain conditions. The Court has imposed an interim restriction on 
the maximum annual excavation from the mining leases in the State 
of Goa of 20 million tonnes subject to determination of final capacity 
by Expert Committee appointed by the Supreme Court.
The Court has also decreed that all mining leases in the State of Goa, 
including those of Sesa Sterlite, have expired in 2007 . Consequently, 
no mining operations can be carried out until renewal/execution of 
mining lease deeds by the State Government. We are working towards 
securing the necessary permissions for commencement of operations. 
Community relations
The continued success of our existing operations and future projects 
are in part dependent upon broad support and a healthy relationship 
with the respective local communities. Failure to identify and manage 
local concerns and expectations can have a negative impact on 
relations with local communities and therefore affect the 
organisation’s reputation and social licence to operate and grow.
Our business leadership teams have periodic engagements with the 
local communities to establish relations based on trust and mutual 
benefit. Our businesses seeks to identify and minimise any potentially 
negative operational impacts and risks through responsible behaviour 
– acting transparently and ethically, promoting dialogue and 
complying with commitments to stakeholders.
Our approach to community development is holistic, long-term, 
integrated and sustainable and is governed by two key considerations 
– needs of the local people and the development plan in line with the 
UN Millennium Development Goals. Our endeavour is to integrate our 
sustainability objectives into long-term planning.
The organisation endeavours to ensure transparent communication 
with local communities, including through the use of a grievance 
management process, local perception surveys, local media and 
community meetings.
We help communities identify their priorities through need 
assessment programmes and then work closely with them to design 
programmes that seek to make progress towards improvement in 
quality of life of the local communities.
Our community programmes reach extends to all our operations and 
are benefiting over 4.1 million people from over 2,200 villages. Our 
community activity is delivered at local, regional and national level to 
ensure businesses are able to effectively maximise impact in 
facilitating socio-economic development. Further details of the 
Group’s CSR activities are included in the Sustainability section.

Health, safety and environment (‘HSE’)
The resources sector is subject to extensive health, safety, and 
environmental laws, regulations and standards. Evolving regulations, 
standards and stakeholder expectations could result in increased cost, 
litigation or threaten the viability of operations in extreme cases.
Health, Safety and Environment (‘HSE’) is a high priority area for the 
organisation. Compliance with international and local regulations and 
standards, protecting our people, communities and the environment 
from harm and our operations from business interruptions are our key 
focus areas. Vedanta Board level Sustainability Committee is chaired 
by a Non-Executive Director and includes the CEO as its members 
meet periodically to discuss HSE performance.
We have appropriate policies and standards in place to mitigate and 
minimise any HSE related occurrences. Structured monitoring and a 
review mechanism and system of positive compliance reporting is 
in place.
The Company has recently implemented a fresh set of standards to 
align its sustainability framework in line with international practices. A 
structured sustainability assurance program has been launched in the 
business divisions covering environment, health, safety, community 
relations and human rights aspects and to embed our commitment 
at the operational level. A system of independent audits of HSE 
practices by leading international consultants is in place. HSE experts 
are also inducted from reputed Indian and global organisations to 
bring in best-in-class practices.
The businesses have an appropriate policy in place for occupational 
health related matters supported by structured processes, controls 
and technology. Our operations ensure the issue of operational health 
and consequential potential risk/obligations are carefully handled. 
Depending on the nature of the exposure and surrounding risk, our 
operations have different levels of processes, controls and monitoring 
mechanisms. There is a strong focus on safety during project 
planning/execution with adequate thrust on contract workmen safety.

Transitioning of zinc and lead mining operations from open pit to underground mining
Our zinc and lead mining operations in India are transitioning from  
an open pit mining operation to underground mining operation. 
Difficulties in managing this transition may result in challenges  
in achieving stated business milestones.
A strong separate empowered organisation is working towards 
ensuring a smooth transition from open pit to underground mining. 
We are working with internationally renowned engineering and 
technology partners on this project.
Technical audits are being carried out by independent agencies.
Reputed contractors have been engaged to ensure completion of the 
project on indicated time lines. These mines will be developed using 
best in class technology and equipment and ensuring the highest 
level of productivity and safety.
We are inducting employees/contractors in our system having 
underground mining expertise. We are also sending our employees to 
overseas underground mines for skill development.
Stage gate process is being implemented to review risk from time to 
time and remedy at multiple stages on the way. Progress reports 
projects are regularly reviewed, including assessments of the progress 
against the key project milestones, as well as actual performance 
against budget. Robust quality control procedures have also been 
implemented to check safety and quality of services/design/actual 
physical work. 
Political, legal and regulatory risk
We have operations in many countries around the globe, which have 
varying degrees of political and commercial stability.
The political, legal and regulatory regimes in the countries we operate 
in may result in higher operating costs, restrictions such as the

Risks & Impact  Mitigation Plan
Fluctuation in commodity prices
Commodity prices and demand are volatile and strongly influenced 
by global economic conditions. Volatility in commodity prices and 
demand may adversely affect our earnings, cash flow and reserves.
The diversified nature of the commodities including sizeable exposure 
to oil provides some protection from the fluctuation in commodity 
prices. The Group’s policy is to sell its products at prevailing market 
prices and not to enter into price hedging arrangements other than 
for businesses which are on a tolling basis where back to back hedging 
is used to mitigate pricing risks. In exceptional circumstances we may 
enter into strategic hedging but only with prior approval of the 
Executive Committee.
The businesses have developed robust controls around this area.  
The Treasury Risk Management Committee reviews the commodity 
related risks and suggests a necessary course of action as may  
be needed by business divisions.
Currency exchange rate fluctuations
Our assets, earnings and cash flows are influenced by a variety of 
currencies due to the diversity of the countries in which we operate. 
Fluctuations in exchange rates of those currencies may have an 
impact on our financials.
Although the majority of the Group’s revenue is tied to commodity 
prices that are typically priced by reference to the US dollar, a 
significant part of its expenses are incurred and paid in local currency. 
Moreover Group borrowings are significantly denominated in US 
dollars while a large percentage of cash and liquid investments are 
held in other currencies, mainly in the Indian rupee. Any material 
fluctuations of these currencies against the US dollar could result in 
lower profitability or in higher cash outflows towards debt obligations.
Philosophy of the organisation is not to speculate in forex. As in 
commodities, we have developed robust controls in forex 
management as well to hedge currency risk on a back to back basis.
The Treasury Risk Management Committee reviews our forex related 
matters periodically and suggests a necessary course of action as 
may be needed by businesses, from time to time, within the overall 
frame work of our forex policy.
We seek to mitigate the impact of short-term movements in currency 
on the businesses by hedging short-term exposures progressively 
based on their maturity. However, large or prolonged movements in 
exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on the Group’s 
businesses, operating results, financial condition and/or prospects. 
Discovery risk
The increased production rates from our growth oriented operations, 
places demand on exploration and prospecting initiatives to replace 
reserve and resources at a pace faster than depletion. A failure in our 
ability to discover new reserves, enhance existing reserves or develop 
new operations in sufficient quantities to maintain or grow the current 
level of our reserves could negatively affect our prospects. There are 
numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating ore and oil & gas 
reserves, and geological, technical and economic assumptions that 
are valid at the time of estimation. These may change significantly 
when new information becomes available.
As per our strategic priority to add to our reserves and resources by 
extending resources at a faster rate than we deplete them through 
continuous focus on drilling and exploration programmes.
In order to achieve this we have developed an appropriate 
organisation and allocated adequate financial resources for 
exploration. International technical experts/agencies are working 
closely with our exploration team.
We also have a system of periodic independent technical audits by 
leading international firms. We also continue to work towards 
long-term supply contracts with mines. 38 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report and accounts FY2014

Risks & Impact  Mitigation Plan
Breaches in Information/IT security
Like many other global organisations, our reliance on computers and 
network technology is increasing. These systems could be subject to 
security breaches resulting in theft, disclosure or corruption of key/
strategic information. Security breaches could also result in 
misappropriation of funds or disruptions to our business operations. 
A cyber security breach could have an impact on business operations.
Appropriate organisation in place at respective businesses for 
information/IT security. IT security policies and procedures are 
defined at individual businesses.
We seek to manage the cyber security risk through standards, 
ongoing monitoring of threats and awareness initiatives throughout 
the organisation. An IT system is in place to monitor logical  
access controls.
Talent/skill shortage risk
The Company’s efforts to continue its growth and efficient operations 
will place significant demand on its management resources. Our 
highly skilled workforce and experienced management team is critical 
to maintaining its current operations, implementing its development 
projects and achieving longer-term growth. Any significant loss or 
diminution in the collective pool of Vedanta’s executive management 
or other key team members could have a material effect on its 
businesses, operating results and future prospects.
We continue to invest in initiatives which seek to widen our talent 
pool. We have a talent management system in place to identify and 
develop internal candidates for critical management positions, as well 
as processes to identify suitable external candidates, wherever 
appropriate.
Our performance management system is designed to provide reward 
and remuneration structures and personal development opportunities 
appropriate to attract and retain key employees. A structured 
programme is in place to map critical positions and ensure that all 
such positions are filled with competent resources.
Our progressive HR policies along with strong HR leadership have 
ensured that career progression, job rotation and job enrichment 
continue be focus areas for our businesses. 
Liquidity risk
The Group may not be able to meet its payment obligations when 
due or unable to borrow funds in the market at an acceptable price to 
fund actual or proposed commitments. A sustained adverse economic 
downturn and/or suspension of its operation in any business, effecting 
revenue and free cash flow generation, may cause some stress on the 
Company’s financing and covenant compliance and its ability to raise 
financing at competitive terms. Any constraints on upstreaming of 
funds from the subsidiaries to the Group may affect the liquidity 
position at the Group level.
The Group generates sufficient cash flows from its current operations 
which, together with the available cash and cash equivalents and 
liquid financial asset investments, provide liquidity both in the short 
term as well as in the long term. Anticipated future cash flows and 
undrawn committed facilities of US$2,370.6 million, together with 
cash and liquid investments of US$8,937 .9 million as at 31 March 
2014, are expected to be sufficient to meet the ongoing capital 
investment program and liquidity requirement of the Group in the 
foreseeable future.
The Group has a strong Balance Sheet that gives sufficient headroom 
to raise further debt should the need arise. The Group’s current ratings 
from Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch are BB, Ba1 and BB+ 
respectively. These ratings support the necessary financial leverage 
and access to debt or equity markets at competitive terms, taking into 
consideration current market conditions. The Group generally 
maintains a healthy gearing ratio and retains flexibility in the 
financing structure to alter the ratio when the need arises. As a matter 
of course, funding for upcoming refinancing is secured well ahead of 
its maturity date.

As a consequence, the Directors believe 
that the Group is well placed to manage 
its business risks successfully despite the 
current uncertain economic outlook.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company 
and the Group have adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.

whereas Cairn India’s reduced from 49.8% 
to 34.3%. The equity and non-controlling 
interest have been adjusted to reflect these 
changes in the economic shareholding.
Volumes
Operations excluding plant closures
Volume growth generated a positive 
contribution of US$424.6 million, mainly 
due to record oil and gas production 
and increased volume of refined zinc, 
lead and silver at Zinc India. This was 
partially offset by lower volumes at 
Konkola Copper Mines (‘KCM’) and Zinc 
International resulting in a US$117 .8 
million reduction in operating profit, net 
positive impact of US$306.8 million.
Plant closures due to regulatory matters
Lack of sales at our Iron Ore business due 
to the continued iron ore mining ban in 
Goa, combined with only marginal sales in 
Karnataka in Q4, contributed to a negative 
variance of US$123.7 million to the operating 
profits compared with FY2012–13. Due to 
regulatory issues, the Tuticorin Smelter was 
closed temporarily in Q1, which impacted 
operating profit by US$32.9 million.  
Finance review
Robust performance with subdued prices
Vedanta delivered US$4.5 billion EBITDA 
with a backdrop of a challenging economic 
environment, volatile markets and generally 
low global growth rate. EBITDA was down 
by 8.5% compared with FY2012–13 driven 
by lower commodity prices, reduced volumes 
at Copper Zambia and Zinc International, 
lack of sales from our Iron Ore business and 
temporary closure of the Sterlite copper 
smelter in Q1 FY2013–14. However improved 
operational performance with volume 
increase in Cairn, Zinc India and effective 
cost control measures across our businesses 
partially mitigated the downside. EBITDA 
margin excluding custom smelting of 44.9%, 
continued to be healthy at similar levels to 
last year as a result of a continued track 
record of stable operating performance.
The metals businesses are well placed 
on the cost front with a majority of our 
businesses in the lowest quartiles of the 
global cost curve. At Zinc India, we are 
placed in the first quartile, at Jharsuguda 
aluminium smelter, we are in lowest quartile 
of the cost curve. Zinc International is in 
second quartile while the BALCO operations 
maintained second quartile cost positioning 
despite the lack of captive alumina. Copper 
India’s smelter also maintained its second 
quartile cost positioning achieving 
best in class operational standards.
The Group structure consolidation and 
simplification exercise, announced in 
February 2012, was concluded and took 
effect in two phases on 17 August 2013 
and 19 August 2013. As part of the 
reorganisation Sterlite Industries India 
Limited (‘SIIL ’), Vedanta Aluminium Limited 
(‘VAL ’), Madras Aluminium Company Limited 
(‘MALCO’) and Sterlite Energy Limited (‘SEL ’) 
were merged with Sesa Goa Limited and 
renamed Sesa Sterlite Limited (‘SSL ’). On 26 
August 2013, Vedanta also transferred the 
shareholding of one of its subsidiaries which 
held a 38.7% stake in Cairn India Limited 
(‘Cairn’), to SSL, along with the associated 
debt of US$5.9 billion. On 19 August 2013, 
the Power business was transferred from 
VAL to SSL at its carrying value through a 
sale and purchase agreement on a going 
concern basis. The Power business consists 
of the 1,215MW thermal power facility at 
Jharsuguda and the 300MW co-generation 
facility (90MW operational and 210MW 
under development) at Lanjigarh. These 
transactions are within the subsidiaries of the 
Company and will not have any acquisition 
accounting impact other than a change 
in the economic shareholding percentage. 
The simplification exercise has resulted in 
a change in economic holding percentage 
mainly in VAL and Cairn India. VAL ’s effective 
holding has decreased from 87 .6% to 58.3%

In addition the closure of our Australian 
mine in Q4 following a mud rush incident, 
meant operating profit was down by 
US$30.9 million. In total, operating profit was 
adversely impacted by US$187 .5 million due 
to plant closures following regulatory issues.
Prices
The prices of many commodities 
declined during the financial year 
resulting in lower operating profits.
Average aluminium prices declined 
by 10.2% due to extraordinarily 
high levels of legacy inventories.
Average copper prices were also lower by 
9.5% as base metals have come under 
pressure due to concerns about a less 
commodity-intensive expansion in China. 
However new LME warehousing rules in 
2014 could alleviate storage bottlenecks 
and raise supply going forward.
Average Brent crude prices dropped by 
2.3% in the year. Sluggish demand and 
a strong supply in the US market led the 
decline in prices in first half. This was 
followed by several supply disruptions in 
the rest of the world in the second half of 
2013, mitigated by the reduction in imports 
in the US, leading to more stable prices.
Average zinc prices reduced by 2.0% as the 
global refined market moved into deficit 
and the concentrate market moved into

Strategic Report
Cash costs of production
The cost-inflationary environment prevailing 
in the sector was largely mitigated by higher 
production volumes at Cairn India, Zinc 
India, the Jharsuguda aluminium smelter, 
operational efficiencies of our plants and 
the depreciation of the Indian rupee against 
the US dollar in which most of our costs are 
denominated. The cost of production had a 
favourable impact on operating profit at our 
Aluminium business, Cairn India and Copper 
Zambia by US$181.0 million compared 
with an increase in the previous year in 
Zinc India and International and Copper 
India/Australia of around US$105.5 million. 
Our overall operating profits increased 
by US$75.5 million due to the improved 
costs compared with the previous year.
Depreciation
The depreciation was almost flat during 
FY2013–14 with a US$19.5 million increase 
in depreciation charge mainly at Cairn 
India driven by the capitalisation of wells, 
whereas in other businesses it reduced 
due to currency translation impacts.
Amortisation
The reserves related to our acquisitions 
mainly of Cairn India, Zinc International 
and Sesa Goa are being amortised on 
a unit of production basis over the total 
estimated remaining commercial reserves.
The reduction in amortisation charges in 
FY2013–14 as compared to the previous 
year was US$153.6 million, mainly due 
to lower production volumes in Zinc 
International and our Iron Ore business.
Revenue
Revenue was down 11.6% at US$12,945.0 
million primarily driven by weaker 
commodity and oil price environment, 
and temporary business closures due to 
regulatory issues though partly offset by 
improved volumes at Cairn India, Zinc India.
EBITDA for FY2013–14 was lower 
by 8.5% at US$4,491.2 million as 
compared to US$4,908.9 million in 
FY2012–13 as explained in the initial 
part of this financial review section.

EBITDA margin
Despite lower EBITDA, our EBITDA 
margin remained strong at 34.7% 
(FY2012–13 at 33.5%) and improved 
marginally. EBITDA margin excluding 
custom smelting operations, remained 
stable at 44.9% (FY2012–13 at 45.1 %). 
The diversified portfolio helped us 
improve overall margins despite the 
weak commodity price environment.
In our Zinc India business, margin was largely 
maintained despite reductions in zinc, lead 
and silver prices. This was a result of higher 
mined metal, silver production and robust 
cost management. At Zinc International, 
margins were lower by 4.6% as a result of 
lower volumes and slightly higher costs.
EBITDA margin in our Copper businesses 
in India/Australia improved marginally due 
to lower conversion cost backed by better 
operating performance of the smelter 
in the second half supported by higher 
Treatment and Refining charges (‘TCs 
and RCs’) though offset by Australian 
operations temporary closure impact in Q4 
and lower by-products credits at Tuticorin. 
At Zambia though the margins drifted lower 
following the impact of lower volumes.
Aluminium business delivered an 
increase in EBITDA margin due to an 
improvement in operating performance 
with a reduction in the cost of production 
which was partially offset by a significant 
decrease in aluminium prices.
The Power business EBITDA margin 
decreased significantly this year as a result 
of the lower tariff currently being recognised 
from the power supply company Grid 
Corporation of Odisha Limited (‘Gridco’) 
in Odisha. Other factors like lower PLF 
as a result of lower demand, but better 
variable costs largely offset each other.
Oil & Gas EBITDA margin continued to 
be stable during the year at 75.9%.
Special items
US$138.0 million has been charged to our 
Income Statement as a result of special 
items. An impairment charge of US$81.6 
million being recorded against the value of 
reserves in our Lisheen mine for US$47 .5 
million with impairment of idle mining assets 
worth US$11.0 million and US$23.1 million 
towards open pit mining assets of Copper 
Zambia at Nchanga. It also includes a one 
time charge towards Land tax of previous 
years paid to Sesa Goa State Government 
of US$16.6 million for regularising mining 
dumps on Government and private land 
and US$15.1 million relating to voluntary 
redundancy charges at Zinc India. US$22.1 
million has been provided in Copper Zambia 
as a settlement agreement with a mining 
contractor. Finally, Group simplification and 
restructuring related costs of US$2.6 million 
have been accounted as special items.
Depreciation and amortisation
The depreciation was up marginally by 
around US$19.5 million as explained 
earlier. Amortisation charges of our 
acquisition related expenses were 
lower by US$153.6 million mainly due 
to reduced production volumes.
Net interest
The finance costs charged to the income 
statement were higher by US$165.8 
million at US$1,355.7 million in FY2013–14 
(FY2012–13: US$1,189.9 million). This was 
primarily due to non-capitalisation of interest 
at Jharsuguda Plant 2 of around US$116.0 
million due to the delay in commissioning. 
During the year we have also accelerated 
the fair value amortisation by US$71.0 
million on convertible bonds where the put 
option is likely to be exercised in May 2014.
Investment revenues were marginally 
higher at US$687 .7 million as compared 
to US$669.0 million in the previous year 
despite mark to market (‘MTM’) losses 
of US$17 .0 million on certain investment 
in duration funds and bonds.
As a result net interest expenses 
increased to US$668.0 million from 
US$520.9 million in FY2012–13.
Other gains and losses
Other gains and losses include the 
impact of MTM changes on foreign 
currency borrowings, primarily at our 
Indian businesses. The other gains and 
losses in FY2013–14 were US$364.0 
million, as compared with a loss of 
US$285.2 million in FY2012–13.
Taxation
The effective tax rate has gone up during 
the year from 2.7% to 11.5% largely 
due to the credit of US$290.0 million in 
Cairn India following a reorganisation in 
previous year. The impact of a tax reversal 
of US$257 .0 million during the year as a 
result of the Sesa Sterlite merger is largely 
offset by the creation of a deferred tax 
liability on the fair valuation of Cairn 
India following an increase in surcharges 
by 5% and other one time provisions.
Attributable (loss)/profit
The attributable loss in FY2013–14 was 
US$196.0 million, significantly lower 
than the US$162.0 million attributable 
profit in FY2012–13. This was primarily 
due to a decrease in EBITDA of 
US$417 .7 million, with higher special 
items and one-offs like accelerated 
amortisation on a large convertible 
bond series in the current year, interest 
charged to income statement instead of 
capitalisation at Jharsuguda Plant 2.
Apart from lower EBITDA, special and 
one-off items as explained above, profit 
mix i.e. better performance at partly 
owned subsidiaries as compared to 
wholly owned subsidiaries resulted in 
higher economic interest of minorities, 
leading to an attributable loss.
Underlying attributable profit
Underlying profit for the year, excluding 
the impact of MTM losses and special 
items was lower at US$93.4 million as 
compared with US$367 .9 million in 
FY2012–13. This follows from the above.

EBITDA margin excluding 
custom smelting operations 
remained strong at 44.9 %.” 44 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report and accounts FY2014
Strategic Report
Earnings per share
Basic loss per share in FY2013–14 was 
at 71.7 US cents per share (FY2012–13: 
59.4 US cents profit per share).
However, if we exclude special items and 
other gains and losses, the underlying 
EPS for the year was 34.2 US cents per 
share (FY2012–13: 134.8 US cents).
The Board has declared final dividend of 
39 US cents per share an increase of 5% 
as compared to 37 US cents in FY2012–13.
Shareholder’s equity was US$4,010.4 
million at 31 March 2014 compared 
to US$4,401.3 million at 31 March 
2013 reflecting the impact of currency 
depreciation against US dollar (mainly, 
the Indian rupee) by US$1,239.6 million, 
attributable losses of US$196.0 million 
due to equity holders during the period, 
dividend payment and movement of 
convertible bond reserves. These negative 
effects were partially offset by an increase 
in equity attributable to shareholders 
of US$626.8 million due to changes in 
economic holding percentages as result of 
group simplification and consolidation.
Non-controlling interests decreased to 
US$13,964.4 million at 31 March 2014 
from US$14,467 .7 million as at 31 March 
2013, due to share of losses, change in 
economic holding percentages as well 
as foreign currency movements.
Tangible fixed assets
During the year, we added US$1,745.3 million 
to property, plant and equipment comprising 
of US$1,424.6 million on our expansion and 
improvement projects and US$320.7 million 
spent on sustaining capital expenditure. 
Expansion project expenses were US$649.0 
million in our Oil & Gas business at Cairn 
India, US$283.0 million in Power business 
mainly at Talwandi Sabo , US$147 .0 million 
in our Aluminium business, US$243.0 
million at Zinc India and the balance in 
other projects at Liberia, KCM, Sterlite 
Copper. The decline in capital expenditure 
shows our commitment to generate higher 
cash and deleverage balance sheet.
Net debt
Net debt reduced by US$696.1 million to 
US$7 ,919.5 million at 31 March 2014, (31 
March 2013: US$8,615.6 million). Our net 
debt has consistently reduced since FY2011–
12, when it reached US$10,064.4 million. 
Cash and liquid investments were US$8,937 .9 
million as at 31 March 2014 with the increase 
mainly at Zinc India and Cairn India.
Gross debt as at 31 March 2014 was 
US$16,871.2 million (31 March 2013: 
US$16,592.8 million) increasing marginally 
for project payments at Talwandi Sabo 
Power plant, debt and interest servicing 
at Vedanta Resources plc and fund 
requirements for Copper Zambia.
The average debt in FY2013–14 was 
US$16,850.0 million, which was in line with 
the previous year (FY2012–13: US$16,791.9 
million). The average debt maturity at 31 
March 2014 increased to 3.5 years from 
3.3 years as at 31 March 2013, excluding 
working capital loans at operating 
subsidiaries. As on 31 March 2014, the Group 
had available unutilised fund-based credit 
lines amounting to US$1,539.0 million.

Zinc-Lead-Silver key metrics
“I’m pleased to report that not only did 
we accomplish record integrated 
production of zinc and lead, but we 
achieved it with a firm grip on unit costs.
In 2013–14 we recorded:
• Our highest-ever mined zinc and lead 
production of 880kt.
• Record integrated silver metal 
production of 9.66moz.
• Improved operational efficiencies 
driving strong volumes.
• Stable unit costs, maintaining our 
place in the lowest quartile of the 
global cost curve.
• Commissioning of Rampura Agucha 
underground and Kayad mines in Q2 
and Q3 respectively.
Over the last 10 years we have 
increased our reserves & resources as 
well as our production capacity by a 
factor of 2.5x. 
Our mine expansion projects continue 
to progress well and we are on track 
to increase mined metal capacity to 
1.2mt over the next five–six years.”
Akhilesh Joshi, CEO, Zinc India
“This was a relatively stable year in 
which we focused on maintaining 
production across all three of our assets, 
even though two of them are nearing 
the end of their lives. Production 
was 15% lower as we had a few 
unplanned stoppages during the year.
Our focus is on seeking opportunities 
to extend mine life at existing mines; 
evaluating options to supply feed to 
the Skorpion refinery; and controlling 
costs, which rank in the second 
quartile of the global cost curve.”

Operations
We were pleased with our mining 
performance during the year with each 
key area showing record output.
At 880,000 tonnes, mined metal production 
showed an increase of 1.1 %. Production 
in the second half of FY2014 was lower 
than what we had planned initially due 
to slower than expected ramp up of 
underground mining projects and changes 
in mining sequence, wherein preference 
was given to primary mine development.
The integrated production of refined 
zinc was 743,000 tonnes. This 12.6% 
increase over the previous year was driven 
by three main factors: higher mined 
metal production, improved operational 
efficiencies and higher roaster availability.
There were no sales of Zinc MIC whereas 
61,000 tonnes were sold in FY2012–13. 
Integrated production of refined lead 
was up 10.3% at 118,000 tonnes due to 
better utilisation of smelter capacity.
Integrated production of silver achieved 
a record 9.66moz for the financial year. 
This was up 4.3%, driven by higher output 
from the Zawar mine, partially offset by 
lower silver grade in ore from other mines.
During the year we started the transition 
from open-pit to underground mining 
with higher production from underground 
mines more than making up for the 
tapering of open-cast mines. We have 
gained momentum in terms of primary 
mine development and are optimising 
the eventual transition. This includes 
significant improvements in infrastructure 
development such as production shaft, 
ventilation, communication networking, 
paste fill plant and workshops in our 
major underground mining projects.
We are also skilling-up our operators with 
structured training programmes designed 
to strengthen our underground mine 
organisation. Our team is being reinforced 
by recruiting high-level expatriates for critical 
technical roles in underground mines.

short of demand by 2%, even though global 
production recovered from the sharp decline 
witnessed in 2012. Consequently, the refined 
metal market remained in deficit for the year.
The tightness in the physical zinc 
market has firmed up premiums and 
it is anticipated that this upward trend 
will continue in the near future.
We currently hold an 89% share of 
the Indian domestic market, where 
strong growth in 2013 was driven 
mainly by the galvanizing sector. This 
momentum is expected to continue 
in the next few years as investment in 
infrastructure projects underpins demand 
for industrial metals including zinc.
Lead
The global lead metal market was in 
surplus in 2013, driven by higher Chinese 
production. It reached 11.2 million mt 
compared to demand of 11.1 million mt.
The market is anticipated to shift into 
deficit in 2014 as demand growth 
remains robust but lead production is 
hampered by weak mine supply and 
stringent environmental regulations.
India is the second most important 
growth prospect in the Asian region with 
demand growth estimated at close to 
7%. We have approximately 50% of 
primary lead market share in India.
LME zinc prices averaged US$1,909 per 
tonne compared to US$1,948 per tonne in 
the same period in FY2012–13. Lead and 
silver prices also followed the same trend 
and reduced by 1 % and 29.8% respectively.
Unit costs
During FY2013–14, the unit cost of zinc 
production was marginally higher at 
US$985 per tonne. This was due to higher 
volumes and the depreciation of the 
Indian rupee partially offset by despite 
lower by-product sulphuric acid prices 
and higher petroleum prices which were 
partially offset by the depreciation of 
the Indian rupee and higher volumes.
The business remains in the lowest cost 
quartile compared with other global 
producers, backed by high quality 
assets and operational efficiencies.
Financial performance
EBITDA for FY2013–14 decreased to 
US$1,145.0 million, compared with 
US$1,182.5 million during FY2012–13.
Despite enjoying record volumes of zinc, 
lead and silver, and the depreciation 
of the Indian rupee, EBITDA declined 
marginally due to lower metal prices and 
lower by-product credits. The price of zinc 
was down by 2.0% over the year, while 
lead reduced by 1.0% and silver fell by 
29.8%. EBITDA for silver was US$188.0 
million, 31 % lower than FY2012–13.
Projects
The Kayad and Rampura Agucha 
underground mine projects commenced 
commercial production during the year. 
After initial difficulties, both are now 
ramping up well. We are also evaluating 
optimisation of the Rampura Agucha 
open pit, to ensure consistent output 
from the mine. The Sindesar Khurd 
expansion project is on schedule.
During the year, total mine development 
increased by over 75%, marking the 
beginning of the transition from 
open-cast to underground mining.
Capital expenditure for the year was 
US$243.0 million and we expect it to 
remain in the US$250.0 million range 
annually in the coming years.
Exploration
In FY2013–14, there was a gross addition 
to reserves and resources (‘R&R’) of 26.1 
million tonnes, prior to a depletion of 9.3 
million tonnes. Zinc-lead metal increased 
by 1.1 million tonnes, prior to depletion of 
0.9 million tonnes. Total R&R at 31 March 
2014 were 365.1 million tonnes, containing 
35.2 million tonnes of zinc-lead metal and 
926 million ounces of silver. The overall 
mine life continues to be 25+ years.
THE COMING YEAR
Outlook
Rampura Agucha will continue to 
provide the majority of mined metal in 
FY2014–15. Its underground mine is now 
developing in line with expectations. In 
FY2014–15, mined metal, and integrated 
refined metal production including silver, 
is expected to be marginally higher than 
in FY2013–14. The cost of production 
is expected to remain stable.
Our Strategic Priorities
• Brown field expansion of mines to achieve 1.2mtpa 
of mined zinc-lead
• Managing the transition from open-pit to 
underground mining at Rampura Agucha
• Ramping up silver volumes to 16moz
• Asset optimisation and operational efficiencies to 
maintain cost leadership
• Continuing focus on adding reserves and resources 
through exploration

Zinc – International
A stable performance with 
production challenges.
HOW WE PERFORMED
Production performance 
Our total production of zinc, lead MIC and 
zinc refined metal stood at 364,000 tonnes, 
15.0% lower than the 426,000 tonnes 
produced in FY2012–13. This was caused by 
an unplanned maintenance shut down at 
Skorpion after a tank failure in Q3 FY2013–
14. Accidents at Lisheen and BMM in Q1 
FY2013–14 also impacted the production.
Markets
As stated earlier the global market including 
the south African market is seeing a rise in 
demand due to higher consumption and 
thereby leading to higher premiums.
Unit costs
We saw an increase in the unit cost of 
production to US$1,167 per tonne, up from 
US$1,092 per tonne in FY2012–13. This 
was mainly driven by lower production 
due to lower ore grades and increasing 
treatment and refining charges.

Financial performance
EBITDA for FY2013–14 was US$213.4 
million, 27 .5% lower than the previous 
year. Operating profit was US$76.1 
million, down by 31.2%. This was the 
result of lower volumes, lower zinc 
and lead prices, and higher costs.
THE COMING YEAR
Outlook
The Lisheen mine is scheduled for closure 
in FY2014–15 and we are looking at further 
exploration opportunities. At Skorpion 
and BMM, we are conducting studies to 
extend mine life. We are also evaluating 
the installation of a roaster at the Skorpion 
refinery to treat sulphide ores from 
BMM and other neighbouring mines.
We expect volumes for FY2014–15 at 
Zinc International to remain in line with 
FY2013–14, with a drop in Lisheen’s 
production expected to be compensated 
by Skorpion and BMM. However, in the 
coming fiscal, all the three operations 
are experiencing declining ore grades 
and Skorpion, in particular, would 
witness a major increase in strip ratio to 
expose the ore for future production.

“With its significance not just to 
our business but to India as a 
whole, it is a pleasure to report 
the excellent contribution of the 
Rajasthan block during FY2013–14. 
During the year we achieved: 
• record full year gross production up 
by 6.5%, driven by 7% higher 
output at the Rajasthan block
• the major milestone of 200mmbbls 
of cumulative oil production at 
Rajasthan
• a gross targeted production rate  
of 200,000boepd in March 2014  
at Rajasthan
We were also pleased to take 
advantage of the revised regulation 
which allows further exploration 
of a producing asset. We therefore 
re-commenced exploration drilling 
in the Rajasthan block establishing 
six discoveries and adding over 1 
billion barrels of oil & gas in-place 
resources. Going forward, we continue 
to remain focused on executing 
multiple projects especially in 
Barmer Basin, by deploying talent 
and technology to achieve world 
class recovery and discovery rates.
In all, a satisfying year and one 
that augurs well for continuing 
productivity in FY2014–15.”

Operations
Cairn India achieved average gross 
production of 218,651 barrels of oil 
equivalent per day (boepd) during 
FY2013–14, 6.5% higher than the previous 
year. During the year, the Company’s 
operations helped reduce the nation’s 
dependence on oil imports to the tune 
of US$7 .5 billion, and contributed over 
US$4.0 billion to the exchequer.
In Rajasthan, the Company successfully 
achieved its target for FY2013–14 of 
production of 200,000boepd, in March. 
During the quarter, the block produced 
17 .2mmboe of oil equivalent, achieving 
record total production for the year of 
66.3mmboe. In the process, the block 
also reached a landmark cumulative 
crude oil production milestone of 
200mmbbls for the year. As at 31 March, 
the cumulative total production from 
Rajasthan stood at ~ 216mmboe.
A total of 129 new wells were brought 
into production during the year, with 
45 wells added in Q4 FY2013–14. This 
has led to the block achieving gross 
average production of 181,530boepd for 
FY2013–14, up 7% Year-on-Year (‘YoY’).
In FY2013–14, Development Area (‘DA’) 
1, comprising the Mangala, Aishwariya, 
Saraswati and Raageshwari oil and gas fields, 
produced a gross average 156,662boepd, up 
6% YoY. The Mangala field was the largest 
contributor, with the Aishwariya field adding 
to volume growth. During the year, DA 2, 
comprising the Bhagyam field, produced a 
gross average of 24,867boepd, up 15% YoY 
as a result of the infill drilling programme.
Our Strategic Priorities
• Rajasthan development:
– Sustaining production at MBA 
fields through EOR, drilling 
campaign and facilities upgrade
– Application of North American 
model to target world class 
recovery at Barmer Hill 
– Leverage gas potential through 
step-wise development ramp-up
• Increase recovery from mature 
assets through infill drilling and 
technology adoption
• Continue exploration and appraisal 
programme across the portfolio, 
with a sharper focus on Rajasthan
• Pursue for extension of Production 
Sharing Contracts

In FY2013–14, production at Cambay was 
44% higher YoY at 9,735boepd, due to the 
infill drilling campaign that was completed in 
FY2012–13. Production at Ravva was lower 
in FY2013–14 at 27 ,386boepd, although 
recovery rates continue to exceed 47%.
At Rajasthan, we are focused on 
infrastructure development for the early 
monetisation of exploration success and 
improved reservoir recovery through EOR, 
infill drilling and facilities upgrades.
Market
The year saw a rise in the global demand 
for oil, driven mainly by increasing 
demand in non-OECD countries and by 
the general economic recovery in the 
developed world in the second half of 
2013 (source: IEA report, February 2014).
Demand increased to 91.3mb/d, a rise of 
1.4% over 2012. However, global supply 
reached 91.5mb/d, an increase of 0.7% 
YoY. The US shale revolution dominated 
production growth in North America, 
while production in OPEC countries was 
lower by 2.1 % due to several disruptions 
in the second half of the year.
Average Brent prices for the year were lower 
by 2.3% at US$107 .6/bbl as compared to 
FY2012–13. It reached a high of ~US$118/
bbl and a low of ~97/bbl during the fiscal. 
In 2014, oil prices are expected to be 
stable. Consumption is expected to grow 
but it is the balance of supply between 
OPEC and non-OPEC producers that will 
be the key driver of oil price movement.
Financial performance
Despite the positive impact of higher 
volumes, Revenue was offset by higher 
profit sharing with the Government 
of India (‘GoI’) in DA 1 as a result of 
tranche change and lower realisations. 
This led to a lower EBITDA of US$2,347 .0 
million, and a reduced operating profit 
for the period of US$933.6 million. 
Direct operating expenses (including 
transportation) relating to the Rajasthan 
field increased to US$3.9/bbl for the year, 
compared with US$3.3/bbl last year.
Exploration
Rajasthan
During the year, Cairn India has added 
significant oil-in-place resources of over 1 
billion boe to the existing 4.2 billion boe. Out 
of the 17 wells drilled since the resumption 
of exploration in 2013, over 80% have 
shown hydrocarbons and the Company has 
established six discoveries (2 in Q4 FY2013–
14 and 1 in April 2014). In addition, 266km
2
 
(14%) of the planned 1,900km
2
 of 3D 
seismic data acquisition has been completed.
Ravva
The drilling of this ‘high temperature, high 
pressure’ prospect reached a depth of 
2,720m as at 31 March, 2014. Although 
the campaign has witnessed some weather 
and operational challenges, the Company 
expects to complete the drilling activity 
before the onset of the monsoons.
KG Onshore
The extended flow test on the Nagayalanka-
1z-ST appraisal well was completed in 
March 2014 and the maximum combined 
flow rate achieved was ~850bopd.
Other Indian assets
In KG Offshore, 1,050km
2
 of 3D seismic 
data is expected to be acquired over the 
course of FY2014–15. The tender has been 
awarded for acquisition of ~ 2,000 line km of 
2D seismic in the Mumbai Offshore block.
International assets
In Sri Lanka, discussions are ongoing 
with the Sri Lankan Government 
regarding commercial terms to 
monetise the discovered In-place gas 
resources of 73mmboe on the block. 
In South Africa, acquisition of 1,981km
2
 
of 3D seismic and 3,000 line km of 
2D seismic data has been completed 
and processing is under way.
Development
The ongoing capex programme is focused 
on exploration and development activities 
across all the assets, with 87% of the 
budget to be invested in the Rajasthan 
block over the next three years. 
As part of this programme, plans for the 
redevelopment of the Raageshwari Deep 
Gas field, implementation of the full field 
polymer flood EOR in the Bhagyam field, 
and better reservoir performance of the 
Aishwariya field have all contributed 
to a net addition of ~50mmboe to 2P 
reserves. This has resulted in a 2P Reserve 
Replacement Ratio of ~ 100% for FY2014.
The Company is embarking on the 
implementation of three major 
development projects in the Rajasthan 
block with a net capex of US$2.4 
billion over the next three years:
• Enhanced Oil Recovery (‘EOR’) project 
including a drilling campaign and facilities 
upgrade: Net Capex – US$1.6 billion
 – We are targeting the first polymer 
injection in the Mangala field EOR 
project within FY2014–15 and have 
awarded all contracts for the execution
 – The polymer flood EOR plan is in place 
for the Bhagyam field and JV alignment 
is under way. Plans are being prepared 
to extend the polymer flood EOR to the 
Aishwariya field
 – The Alkaline Surfactant Polymer pilot at 
Mangala has commenced
• Barmer Hill development: Net Capex–
US$0.6 billion
 – Exploration results confirm BH potential 
across the block
 – We are replicating the North American 
development model to scale up the 
development
 – Satellite fields are to be put into 
production through the Integrated Block 
Development Policy (‘IDP’). Raag-S-1, 
the 26th discovery in DA 1, was brought 
into test production within a year of 
discovery
• Gas development: Net Capex –  
US$0.2 billion
 – Development of the Raageshwari Deep 
Gas field is under way
 – Upgrading the RDG terminal to higher 
capacity and plans to create higher 
capacity pipeline infrastructure are 
ongoing in order to monetise the 
additional gas potential in the block
THE COMING YEAR
Outlook
The Company will continue to focus 
on key development projects aimed at 
enhancing recovery rates, supported 
by an overall planned net capex 
of US$3.0 billion by FY2017 . 
We are targeting a reserve-replacement 
ratio of 150% in the next three years, 
subject to a PSC extension. We are also 
looking to deliver a three-year production 
CAGR of 7–10% from known discoveries 
with flat production in FY2014–15. 
Further exploration activity across 
the portfolio will provide additional 
upside value and momentum, and 
adopting technology will support low-
cost operations and development.
The industry is looking forward to future 
growth opportunities in India, from the 
PSC extension policy, the fiscal model for 
the next round of auctions and the shale 
gas policy for pre-NELP and NELP blocks.  58 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report and accounts FY2014

Operations – Goa
Through its order dated 21 April 2014, the 
Honourable Supreme Court (‘The Court’) 
lifted the ban on mining in the State of 
Goa, subject to certain conditions.
The ruling imposed an interim restriction 
on the maximum annual excavation from 
the mining leases in the State of Goa. This 
restriction (of 20 million tonnes) was subject 
to a determination of final capacity by the 
Expert Committee appointed by the court.
The Court also ruled that all mining leases 
in the State of Goa, including those of Sesa 
Sterlite, expired in 2007 . Consequently, 
no mining operations can be carried out 
until the renewal and execution of mining 
lease deeds by the State Government. 
At the close of the reporting year the 
Company was working towards securing 
the necessary permissions to resume 
operations at the earliest opportunity.
The Court further directed that the entire 
sale value arising out of the e-auction of 
inventories should be appropriated for 
various purposes specified in the order, with 
only the average cost of excavation of iron 
ores to be paid to the mining lessees.
Further, all sales of iron ore will attract 
a payment of 10% of the sale price 
to be made by all lessees to the 
Goa Iron Ore Permanent Fund.
In Goa, we participated in e-auctions 
of inventory and sold 0.3 million 
tonnes during the quarter; however, 
these were not accounted for in this 
reporting year as sales since delivery 
did not take place during the quarter.
Our Strategic Priorities
• Resuming mining in Goa
• Continuing to add to reserves and 
resources by active exploration in 
existing brown field areas
• Infrastructure options for the 
Liberia mining project

Following the clearance from the Court 
to resume operations at Karnataka, we 
optimised our approved capped annual 
capacity of mining at the site. Operations 
restarted on 28 December 2013 and 
resulted in production of 1.5 million tonnes 
in this reporting year. However, only 
27 ,000 tonnes were sold during the year.
Market
World steel production in 2013 was 4.2% 
higher than in 2012, standing at a total of 
1.6 billion tonnes. This significant growth 
was driven mainly by a 66 million tonne 
increase in China’s steel production.
World steel consumption in 2013 is 
estimated to have increased by 2.9% to a 
total of 1.59 billion tonnes. The chief driver 
of this growth was a 6% increase in China’s 
consumption as the country continued to 
be the world’s largest consumer of steel.
In 2014, India’s steel consumption is 
also forecast to grow; a 5% increase 
is projected as a result of government 
spending on infrastructure and a higher 
demand for consumer durables.
Iron ore spot prices averaged US$126 
(FOB) a tonne, an increase of 3.4% over 
the previous year. Spot prices have been 
declining through the last quarter of 
FY2013–14 and are not expected to recover 
to their previously high levels. This is due 
to the increased availability of supplies 
from new mines starting up in 2015.
Financial performance
EBITDA in FY2013–14 was US$(24.2) 
million, compared with US$84.9 million in 
the previous year. This negative EBITDA was 
mainly due to the continued mining ban in 
Goa, and the ban in Karnataka prior to the 
Court lifting it in December 2013. Operating 
profit was US$(70.0) million in FY2013–14.

Liberia project
We are currently working with the 
government of Liberia on infrastructure 
solutions for evacuation of the ore 
once mining operations starts.
Reserves & resources
We have identified significant and 
potentially low cost ‘start-up’ ores at all 
three Liberian projects, with tailings at Bomi 
and soft weathered cap ore at Bea and 
Mano. Initial studies indicate that these 
are resources that are easy to process. 
These resources have potential for further 
enhancement with more exploration.
THE COMING YEAR
Outlook
We are engaging with the State 
Government and MoEF to gain approvals 
for starting mining on our leases in Goa, 
and we expect production to start in 
the second half of the financial year.

“Looking back over the reporting 
year, we experienced a mixture 
of progress and challenges.
We underwent a temporary closure at 
the Tuticorin smelter and also had to 
suspend operations at our Australian 
mine due to a mud rush. However, we 
were pleased to restart the Tuticorin 
smelter at the end June 2013 and 
see it ramped up to full capacity and 
to commission the second unit of 
the captive power plant in Tuticorin. 
These positive developments 
augur well for the current year.”

“The Konkola underground mine has 
one of the largest high-grade ore 
bodies in the world, and Vedanta 
has been channelling resources, 
experience and talent into realising 
its considerable potential.
During the year, production was 
affected by unscheduled stoppages. 
As a team we are focusing on 
measures to improve productivity 
and operational efficiencies in order 
to deliver increased volumes. With 
my 20 years of experience in African

Operations
Production during the year was affected 
by two main events. In January 2014 
operations at our Australian mine 
were suspended following a mud rush 
incident. We are working with Work Safe 
Tasmania to resume once operating 
practices have been modified.
Our Tuticorin smelter also had to be 
temporarily suspended, post favourable 
order of National Green Tribunal, the smelter 
restarted in end June 2013. As a result, our 
copper cathode production was reduced 
by 16.6% to 294,000 tonnes. However, 
when operations were restarted the smelter 
operated at its full rated capacity.
In March 2014, the Company received 
the long-awaited regulatory approval 
for the second unit of the 2 x 80MW 
power plant in Tuticorin. We duly 
commissioned the unit which generated 
25 million units over the year.
Market
The year saw the average LME copper 
price fall by 9.6% while treatment and 
refining charges (TCs/RCs) increased 
by 30% compared to 2012.
Global refined copper production 
in 2013 was 21 million tonnes, an 
increase of 3.2% over 2012, with global 
consumption growing by 5.6%.
Global copper mine production improved 
considerably from the third quarter of 
FY2013–14 as stable operations continued. 
This led to an increase in availability of 
copper concentrates with attendant 
higher TCs/RCs. Annual market settlement 
of TCs/RCs for supplies in the calendar 
year 2014 saw an increase of around 
31 % over the market terms in 2013.
The premiums also rose significantly in 
the international markets in Q3 and Q4 
due to supply disruptions and increased 
demand from customers in China. 
The annual premiums for 2014 have 
risen over 50% compared to 2013.
India and Australia
1 Strategic Report Directors’ Report Financial Statements Additional Information
65 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report and accounts FY2014
Consumption in the Indian primary copper 
market increased slightly in 2013, although 
our share of the refined copper market fell 
due to production disruption experienced 
in Q1. We currently hold a 29% share of the 
refined domestic market. The demand for 
refined copper in India is expected to grow 
to 2 million tonnes by 2030, representing a 
Compounded Annual Growth Rate (‘CAGR’) 
of approximately 7%. Indian copper demand 
will be driven by investments in infrastructure 
projects, development of power generation 
capacities and continued urbanisation.
Unit costs
In the Tuticorin smelter, cost of 
production (‘CoP’) increased from 8.7 
US cents per/lb to 9.7 US cents per/
lb, mainly due to lower volumes and 
significantly lower by-product credits.
TCs/RCs have improved significantly 
– by 30% – compared to last year.
In FY2013–14, the unit cost of production 
at our Australian operations, including 
TCs/RCs and freight, was 240 US cents 
per lb; this was up from 220 US cents in 
the previous year, due to lower volumes 
and lower by-product credits.
Financial performance
EBITDA for FY2013–14 was US$197 .9 
million compared with US$219.1 million 
in the previous year. This reduction was 
mainly driven by lower profit from our 
Australian operations due to the suspension 
of operations in Q4 FY2013–14. Higher CoP 
at our Indian operations, lower volumes 
partially offset by higher TCs/RCs.
Operating profit was US$155.7 
million in FY2013–14, down from 
US$175.9 million the previous year.

Our Strategic Priorities
• Sustaining operating efficiencies and cost leadership at 
copper smelting operations
• Implementing a safe way to resume mining and 
production in the Mt. Lyell district in Australia
Outlook
At Copper India, the Tuticorin smelter 
underwent a planned 22-day maintenance 
shutdown, starting on 26 April 2014. 
This came after a record campaign life 
of 45 months and we are now targeting 
improved plant availability and reliability. 
Mine production at our Australian 
mine is expected to start in a staged 
manner and at lower volumes, once 
regulatory approvals are received.

Operations
The year saw mined metal production 
fall by 19.2% in FY2013–14 
compared to the previous year.
This was mainly due to the suspension 
of mining operations in January 2013 at 
the Chingola open pit mine (‘COP F&D’). 
Konkola production was also affected by 
the temporary closure of shafts 1 & 4 due 
to safety and the integrity and availability 
of equipment. Mined metal production 
also included tailings leach plant primary 
copper production of 56,000 tonnes.
Copper custom production was lower 
by 5.8%, constrained by blending 
challenges and by an ongoing issue 
regarding the recovery of VAT credits. 
On this latter point we are in discussions 
with the Zambian Government on 
this pressing industry-wide matter.
Markets
KCMs traditional markets in Asia and 
the Middle East experienced improved 
demand in the latter half of the year, 
leading to improvement in premium in 
the annual negotiations for CY2014.
Strategic priorities
• Ramping up mine development at 
Konkola to realise its ore production 
potential
• Optimising the blend and 
throughput of feed to the Tailings 
Leach Plant for higher production
• Realising cost efficiency, driven by 
volume growth and other measures
• Improving productivity

Unit costs (integrated production)
The unit cost of production without royalty, 
logistics, depreciation, interest and sustaining 
capex decreased to 238.4 US cents per lb in 
FY2013–14, 6.5% lower than the previous 
year. This was due to the suspension of 
operations at the high-cost COP F&D 
mine, partially offset by lower volumes.
Financial performance
EBITDA in FY2013–14 was US$156.3 million 
compared with US$257 .3 million in the 
previous year, impacted by lower volumes 
and lower metal prices. These factors also 
contributed to a loss of US$89.0 million after 
tax at Copper Zambia during FY2013–14.
THE COMING YEAR
Outlook
At Konkola, we are working to improve 
the trackless equipment’s availability 
and utilisation rates, as well as recruiting 
key underground specialists and trainers. 
Several improvement initiatives and 
technical interventions have been planned 
to bring about a gradual improvement 
in production from current levels. Safety, 
management of underground contractors 
and productivity are the key focus areas.
We are working to secure custom 
concentrates which, when blended with 
integrated production, will enable us to 
run the smelter at the minimum optimum 
level that is technically possible.

Our Copper Zambia operations have made 
significant strides in recent years to 
improve the environmental impact. The 
Konkola Mine is one of the wettest in the 
world so the primary focus has been on 
water: improving quality, reducing 
discharges and increasing recycling.
Over US$5 million has been invested in 
underground water rehabilitation with new 
pumps to handle slurry and desilting, 
decreasing the total suspended solids 
(‘TSS’) in discharged water by an 
impressive 75% in four years. The Pollution 
Control dam has been desilted and 
effluent from the Nkana refinery is being 
treated with the recycled effluent reused 
to wash copper cathodes and water 
vegetation around the mine site, reducing 
monthly domestic water consumption 
significantly by over 50%.
Now, the Kafue River upstream and 
downstream is once again a reliable  
water resource for irrigation, fishing and 
transportation for the communities  
that live along its banks and KCM is 
looking to improve further, targeting  
global best-in-class global environmental 
sustainability standards.

Operations
Following the resumption of operations 
at our Lanjigarh refinery in July 2013, the 
facility ramped up well and delivered 524kt 
production through to March 2014. In Q4, 
the refinery had a capacity utilisation of 
91 %. This resulted in a steady increase of 
alumina feed from Lanjigarh to our smelters, 
contributing to 28% of the smelters’ alumina 
requirements in FY2013–14 and 49% in Q4.
The MoEF rejected the grant of stage II 
forest clearance for the Niyamgiri mining 
project of Odisha Mining Corporation 
Limited (‘OMC’). The area is one of the 
sources in Odisha for the supply of bauxite 
to the alumina refinery at Lanjigarh. As we 
have stated, the Company will not consider 
developing any bauxite resources, including 
the Niyamgiri mines, without the invitation 
and consent of the local communities. 
Certain mining assets (amounting to US$11 
million) which relate to the Niyamgiri 
mines have been charged to the income 
statement as a special item during the year.
A Memorandum of Understanding (‘MoU’) 
with the Government of Odisha (through 
OMC) states that we require 150 million 
tonnes of bauxite. We are actively working 
with the Odisha State Government to agree 
the allocation of other bauxite mines. The 
Company is also considering sourcing bauxite 
from alternative sources to support the 
existing and expanded refinery operations.
With regard to the expansion project 
at Lanjigarh, the Company’s fresh 
application for environmental clearance 
is under consideration. In the meantime 
the expansion plans are on hold.
Production of aluminium in FY2013–14 
was a record 794,000 tonnes, an increase 
of 2.6% compared to the previous 
year. During the year the Jharsuguda-I 
and Korba-II smelters were both 
operating above their rated capacity.

Alumina CoP was US$358 per tonne in 
FY2013–2014. The CoP of hot metal 
at Jharsuguda was US$1,602 per 
tonne compared with US$1,869 per 
tonne in the previous year, a 14.3% 
decrease. This was due mainly to the 
decrease in our power costs, driven by 
operational efficiencies, better coal 
mix, reduced specific coal consumption 
and specific power consumption.
At the Korba smelter, the CoP decreased 
to US$1,781 as a result of the depreciation 
of the Indian rupee, although in Indian 
rupee terms the CoP actually increased. 
This was due to increased power costs 
when the agreed coal quota allowances 
tapered by another 25% this year. However, 
this was partially offset by the improved 
operational efficiency of the plant.
Even without captive bauxite, and despite 
having to rely on imported alumina, our 
aluminium operations at Jharsuguda and 
Korba were ranked in the first and second 
quartile of the global cost curve respectively.
Market
Average LME prices for aluminium 
for the year were US$1,773, a decline 
of 10.2% on the previous year’s 
average price level of US$1,974.
Global primary aluminium consumption 
recorded growth of 5.3% to 49 million 
tonnes in 2013 over 2012 (47 million tonnes).
Primary aluminium demand is expected to 
grow by 6% per year during the period 2013 
– 2017 , supported by the transport sector 
worldwide and substitutions in favour of 
aluminium. We also anticipate a near-term 
increase in demand from the transport sector 
in 2015. Domestically, investments in the 
infrastructure and transport segments are 
also expected to boost demand. We currently 
have a market share of 48% in India.
Financial performance
EBITDA for FY2013–14 was up by 41.8% 
at US$287 .3 million, compared with 
US$202.6 million in the previous year. This 
increase was due to lower CoP , Indian 
rupee depreciation and higher volumes, 
but was also partially offset by lower 
LME prices which dropped by 10%.
Strategic priorities
• Securing captive refinery feed to realise the full potential 
of cost efficiencies and increase capacity utilisation
• Securing regulatory approvals for refinery expansion
• Commissioning the unused smelter capacities at BALCO 
and Jharsuguda
• Expediting development of the captive coal block at 
BALCO
Further MTM foreign exchange losses 
on operational payables were decreased 
by ~US$27 .4 million as a result of the 
prudent step of taking forward cover 
on US dollars. This helped to increase 
EBITDA and operating profit was 
also higher at US$112.5 million.
Projects
We commenced operation of the Korba-
III 325kt smelter, achieving first metal 
tapping in Q4. We produced around 900 
tonnes of aluminium with power sourced 
from the BALCO 810MW power plants. 
Of the first 84 pots, 36 pots had been 
started as at 31 March 2014. We can 
support up to 84 pots with the existing 
power plants at BALCO. We expect to ramp 
up the 325ktpa BALCO-III Aluminium 
smelter in Q2 FY2014–15 once the Korba 
1,200MW power plant is operational. The 
first unit of this power plant is expected 
to be synchronized in Q1 FY2014–15.
The Company expects to commence 
mining coal from its Durgapur coal 
block in Chattisgarh once we receive the 
mining lease and lease deed as well as 
the requisite permission from the DGMS/
Coal Controller of Mines, expected by the 
end of Q2. Mining operations are likely to 
commence in Q3 FY2014–15 and excavation 
of coal is expected by Q4 FY2014–15.
THE COMING YEAR
Outlook
We are optimistic that our existing facilities 
will continue to operate at above their 
rated capacities in the coming year. We are 
focused on putting the new capacities and 
the associated power plants into operation. 
We are also working on feedstock security in 
terms of bauxite sourcing, alumina sourcing 
and the coal block start-up at BALCO.
We also expect a progressive start-up of new 
pot lines at our Jharsuguda smelter, once 
we have permission from the authorities to 
use power from our 2,400MW power plant.
The resulting increase in volumes, combined 
with operational efficiencies and an 
expected higher proportion of value-added 
products, should provide improved returns.
We are working on securing captive feed 
for the Alumina refinery, but will not 
access Niyamgiri or other deposits without 
the prior consent of local communities. 
We will also work with OMC to help 
them meet their MoU commitment to 
us from other regional resources. 72 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report and accounts FY2014

Power key metrics
“We experienced a period of 
distribution challenges and low 
customer demand that led to 
lower sales even though there was 
unmet end-user demand. Despite 
this, we were generally pleased 
with progress during the year.
We recorded:
• Increased sales of 7 ,625 million 
units, up 1 % from the previous year, 
from the Jharsuguda 2,400MW 
power plant
• Synchronisation of the first 660MW 
unit of the 1,980MW Talwandi Sabo 
power plant
Although the near-term outlook for 
sales remains weak, the completion 
of several steps being taken by 
the Government should enhance 
grid connectivity and the market 
environment for power generators.”
SK Roongta, CEO, Power
We are one of the 
largest independent 
power generators in 
India, with a major 
new plant in Talwandi 
Sabo coming on 
stream this year. Pwr

Operations
Overall power sales declined over the year 
to 9,374 million units, a fall of 7 .5% on 
the previous year. This was mainly due to 
lower sales by the BALCO 270MW power 
plant, resulting from lower power tariffs 
and weak demand. This was partially 
offset by marginal higher volumes 
from the Jharsuguda 2,400MW power 
plant. It operated at a 40% plant load 
factor (‘PLF’) but was affected by weak 
demand and transmission constraints.
Market
Capacity of more than 23,000MW has 
been added in India over the last five years 
by independent power producers (‘IPPs’). 
This is derived from mainly thermal sources 
at around 68% and renewables at around 
13%. Although this has not exceeded the 
Government’s target, more capacity has 
been added than in the preceding 15 years.
Per capita consumption of electricity in the 
country was about 917 .18kwh in 2013.
Unit costs
We saw an improvement in average power 
generation costs in FY2013–14, falling to 
3.7 US cents per unit compared with 4.1 US 
cents per unit in the previous year. This was 
driven by the Indian rupee’s depreciation 
translating into lower costs in US dollar terms.
Average power sales prices were lower in 
FY2013–14 at US cents 5.9 per unit 
compared with US cents 6.5 per unit in the 
previous year.
Financial performance
EBITDA decreased significantly in FY2013–
14 at US$168.4 million compared with the 
previous year’s US$228.5 million, primarily 
as a result of the lower tariff currently being 
recognised from the power supply company 
Gridco in Odisha where the interpretation 
of the tariff agreement is subject to 
ongoing dispute. Other factors like lower 
PLF as a result of lower demand, but better 
variable costs largely offset each other.
Strategic priorities
• Enhancing access to power 
transmission facilities
• Working with the Government on 
coal sourcing
• Completing the 1,980MW Talwandi 
Sabo power project
1 Strategic Report Directors’ Report Financial Statements Additional Information

As a result operating profit was also reduced 
by 48.1 % to US$68.9 million coupled with 
higher depreciation of the Indian rupee.
THE COMING YEAR
Projects
The boiler light-up of the first 660MW 
unit of the 1,980MW Talwandi Sabo 
power plant was achieved in Q3, followed 
by the synchronisation. Coal logistics 
were established in Q4 and we expect 
to commence trial runs in Q1 FY2015.
Outlook
We are focused on commissioning and 
ramping-up the Talwandi Sabo power plant.
Our exposure to third party sales will 
reduce as we gradually ramp up our 
Aluminium smelter production at 
Jharsuguda. We also anticipate that with 
the improvement in the economic climate 
and industrial performance generally, 
the demand and hence the open market 
price for power is expected to recover 
significantly in the next few years.

Port Business
We commissioned the Vizag General 
Cargo Berth (‘VGCB’) in Q4 FY2013. There 
has been a continuous increase in the 
tonnage handled at VGCB, and during 
FY2014 we handled 4.7 million tonnes and 
generated an EBITDA of US$4 million.
VGCB is one of the deepest coal terminals 
on the eastern coast of India, which 
enables docking of large Capesize vessels.

Anil Agarwal Chairman
Dear Shareholder,
As Chairman, I am responsible for ensuring that the Board operates 
effectively. Throughout the year we have continued to develop our 
practices to reflect the evolution of the Group’s business 
transformation and Board composition. 
In my statement last year, I outlined that we had undertaken a review 
of the composition needs of the Board in the light of the Group’s 
changing strategy and the length of tenure of our Directors.
The Board
In March 2014, Mr MS Mehta stepped down as Chief Executive 
Officer after serving on the Board since October 2008. The Board 
thanks Mr Mehta for his vision and leadership in that role over the 
past six years and for his outstanding contribution to the success and 
development of the Group since 2000, and I wish him well in the 
future. Replacing Mr Mehta, I am delighted to announce the 
appointment of Mr Tom Albanese as Chief Executive Officer with 
effect from 1 April 2014. As the former chief executive officer of Rio 
Tinto, Mr Albanese brings the vital experience necessary to drive 
growth and innovation throughout the Group. 
In August 2013, following the conclusion of the Company’s Annual 
General Meeting, Mr Naresh Chandra also stepped down from the 
Board having served nearly nine years with the Group. On behalf of 
the Board, I would like to thank Mr Chandra for his significant 
commitment, financial expertise and enthusiasm which he brought to 
the Group during his tenure. 
Following a review by the Board and Nominations Committee the 
search for two new Non-Executive Directors culminated with the 
appointment of Mr Geoffrey Green in 2012 and Mr Deepak Parekh in 
2013. In the light of these new appointments, I am very pleased that 
we have been able to attract strong and diverse talent to the Board 
over the past 18 months.
The new appointments to the Board ensure a new perspective and 
fresh outlook while the longer serving members of the Board provide 
stability, and the knowledge and experience of the Group. I believe 
that taking time to ensure that a new Non-Executive understands his 
duties and responsibilities as a Director is a prudent step. Together 
with the Board and the Nominations Committee, I continue to review 
the composition of the Board to ensure that there is an appropriate 
balance of skills, experience, independence and diversity represented 
on the Board, together with the length of tenure of Mr Aman Mehta 
and Mr Euan Macdonald, as Non-Executive Directors. Strategic Report Directors’ Report Financial Statements Additional Information
81 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report and accounts FY2014
Diversity and inclusion
Following the publication of Lord Davies’ Report on diversity, we set 
ourselves an aspirational target to achieve a minimum of 25% female 
representation on the Board by 2015. As we do not have any women 
on the Board at present, this remains a key priority of the Board. 
Historically, the gender balance in leadership roles has been a 
challenge for the natural resources sector and Vedanta is no different. 
However, we are determined to make serious efforts to move in a 
positive direction and the Group has recently appointed a female 
independent Non-Executive Director to the Board of Sesa Sterlite. 
Further information on our progress is given in the Nominations 
Committee report on pages 98 and 99.
Board effectiveness and evaluation
Having undertaken an internally-facilitated review of Board 
effectiveness in 2013, I led the review process again this year with the 
engagement of an external facilitator. Further information on the 
process and outcome of the evaluation exercise is provided within this 
report on pages 88 to 89. The priorities identified provide very useful 
feedback to strengthen our Board processes.
The governance year ahead
During the year it is the intention to carry out a detailed review of 
our policies and procedures to ensure they are relevant, align with 
recent changes and reflect best practice.
Annual General Meeting
This year our Annual General Meeting will be held at 3.00pm on 
1 August 2014 at The Lincoln Centre and I would encourage you 
to attend and participate in the meeting.
Yours sincerely,
Anil Agarwal

14 May 2014 Directors’ Report
82 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report and accounts FY2014
Corporate Governance report continued
The UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’)
As a company with a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange, 
Vedanta is subject to and seeks to comply with the Code which is 
available on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at www.frc.org.uk. 
The Company is required to report on how it has applied the main 
principles of good governance in relation to leadership and 
effectiveness of the Board, remuneration, accountability and relations 
with shareholders as set out in the Code. This Corporate Governance 
Report provides details of our approach to governance, our policies, 
processes and structures and explains how we have complied with the 
main principles of the Code. Further details of how the Company has 
applied the provisions of the Code are also contained in the reports of 
each Board Committee and the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
Disclosures on share capital and related matters as required by the 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules (DTR 7 .2.6) may be found in the 
Directors’ Report. 
Statement of compliance with the Code
It is the Board’s view that the Company has, throughout the year 
ended 31 March 2014, fully complied with all the provisions of the 
Code, with the exception of the following: 
Code Provision A.3.1
Mr Anil Agarwal was appointed as Executive Chairman in 2005. Mr 
Agarwal was the founder of the businesses of Vedanta Resources and 
steered the growth of the Group since its inception in 1976 including 
the flotation of Vedanta Resources Plc on the London Stock Exchange. 
This meant that Mr Agarwal did not meet the independence criteria 
as defined in the Code on his appointment in 2005 because he was 
previously the Chief Executive and, through Volcan Investments 
Limited (‘Volcan’), members of his family have a controlling interest in 
the Company. Mr Agarwal is pivotal in helping to achieve the strategic 
objectives of Vedanta through his skills in seeking out value creating 
acquisitions and projects. In addition, the fact that he dedicates 
himself full time to his role of Executive Chairman enables him to 
balance his executive duties with providing leadership to the Board. As 
Chairman Mr Agarwal encourages debate and challenge and sets 
high ethical standards. For these reasons the Board is unanimously of 
the opinion that his continued involvement in an executive capacity is 
important to the success of the Group.
Code Provision B.2.1
Under the Relationship Agreement put in place at the time of Listing 
Volcan, having a controlling interest in the Company, will be consulted 
on all appointments to the Board. The Nominations Committee 
therefore works collaboratively with Volcan when making 
appointments to the Board and, to this extent, differs from the 
process set out in Code Provision B.2.1 which stipulates that the 
Nominations Committee should lead the process for Board 
appointments.
The role of the Board
The Board of Directors is ultimately accountable to shareholders for 
promoting the long-term success of the Group through the creation 
and delivery of sustainable shareholder value. As part of their decision 
making processes the Directors have a responsibility to consider the 
long-term consequences of their decisions, the interests of the 
Company’s employees, the need to foster relationships with other 
stakeholders, the impact of the Company’s operations on the 
environment and the need to maintain high standards of business. 
This is achieved by ensuring its governance processes, as described 
below, are comprehensive and robust. 
The duties of the Board are set out in its terms of reference 
including those matters specifically reserved for decision by the 
Board:
• Setting the strategic objectives of the Group;
• Ensuring that adequate resources are provided to enable the 
Group to meet the objectives; 
• Monitoring the progress made by management against the 
Group’s objectives; 
• Setting the Group’s risk appetite and ensuring risk is effectively 
managed and robust internal controls and risk management 
systems are in place;
• Approval of the Group’s annual and half year reports and 
financial statements;
• Declaration of the interim dividend and the recommendation 
of the final dividend;
• Approval of the business plan and capital expenditure budget 
of the Group;
• Approval of major capital projects in excess of defined 
thresholds; and
• Approval of major acquisitions and disposals of assets in 
excess of defined thresholds.
The Board’s terms of reference also set out those matters which 
must be reported to the Board such as details of fatalities and 
the adoption or material amendment to the Group policies 
relating to business conduct, environment and health and safety.
How the Board operates
The Board meets on a regular basis and met formally on seven 
occasions during the year. As well as formal meetings, written 
resolutions are passed with the approval of the whole Board on 
routine matters as required in order to facilitate efficient decision 
making. In addition ad hoc discussions take place between the 
Directors on a variety of topics throughout the year. During the year, 
the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors met without the 
Executive Directors present.

All of the Committees are authorised to obtain legal or other 
professional advice as necessary, to secure the attendance of external 
advisers at their meetings and to seek information from any 
employee of the Company in order to perform their duties. Under the

The Executive Committee
The Executive Committee acts as a conduit between management 
and the Board and during the year ended 31 March 2014 comprised 
of the Executive Directors and members of senior management 
whose biographies are given on pages 76 to 79. The Executive 
Committee meets monthly and is responsible for implementing 
strategic plans formulated by the Board, allocating resources in line 
with delegated authorities and monitoring the operational and 
financial performance of the Group. The Executive Committee 
therefore has a key role in putting the Board’s plans and policies into 
action. The Chief Executive Officer, Mr Albanese, keeps the Board 
informed of the Executive Committee’s activities through his standing 
reports to the Board.
The Finance Standing Committee
The Finance Standing Committee is an ad-hoc sub-Committee to 
which authority is delegated by the Board for approval of certain 
matters such as routine bank and financing issues. It comprises five 
members; Executive Chairman, Deputy Executive Chairman, Chief 
Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Director of Finance. The 
Company Secretary provides an update on the Finance Standing 
Committee meetings to the Board at the subsequent Board meeting 
and the minutes of all Finance Standing Committee meetings are 
reviewed by the Board.
Details of the membership, terms of reference and attendance at 
meetings of the Audit, Nominations, Remuneration, and 
Sustainability Committees are given in their respective reports on 
pages 93 to 102.
Effectiveness
The Board and its Committees have the appropriate balance of 
skills, experience and knowledge of the Company to enable them 
to discharge their respective duties and responsibilities 
effectively.
The Board of Directors
As at the date of this report, the Board, chaired by Mr Anil Agarwal, 
comprises the Executive Chairman, two Executive Directors and four 
independent Non-Executive Directors. The composition of the Board 
is reviewed regularly by the Nominations Committee. There is a 
variety of experience and skills represented on the Board including 
operational, mining, financial and governance as can be seen from 
the Directors’ biographies on pages 76 and 77 .
Board independence
In accordance with the Code, the Board is committed to ensuring that 
at least half the Board, excluding the Chairman comprise of 
independent Non-Executive Directors. It undertakes an evaluation of 
each Director’s independence both on appointment, annually prior to 
recommending their re-election by shareholders and when any 
Director’s circumstances change and warrant a re-evaluation.
Prior to his appointment in June 2013 the independence of Deepak 
Parekh was considered by the Board. As Mr Parekh has had no prior 
connections with the Group the Board concluded that he is an 
independent Non-Executive Director.

87 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report and accounts FY2014
The Board has considered the independence of Mr Geoffrey Green 
who was appointed to the Board in August 2012. Mr Green was a 
partner at Ashurst LLP , a leading international law firm that is 
engaged by the Group to provide legal advice on various matters, 
until his retirement from the firm in 2013. Mr Green was Senior Partner 
of Ashurst and then head of the firm’s practice in Asia, based in Hong 
Kong. As such he had no involvement in advising the Group over the 
last five years. Other than occasional consultancy work Mr Green has 
no further business relationship with Ashurst LLP . The Board has 
concluded that he was independent of character and judgement on 
appointment and remains so. Furthermore, he brings to the Board a 
vital perspective of the UK legal and regulatory environment and 
corporate governance that serve to strengthen the Board.
Two of the Company’s Non-Executive Directors, Messrs Aman Mehta 
and Euan Macdonald will have served on the Board for nine years at 
the date of the 2014 Annual General Meeting and they were 
therefore subject to a particularly rigorous review of their 
independence. Mr Aman Mehta also serves as Non-Executive Director 
on the Board of Cairn India Limited. The Board considered the 
potential conflicts and that each of the Non-Executive Directors in 
question actively contributed to Board deliberations and provided 
robust challenge to management during the year. Furthermore, Mr 
Aman Mehta absents himself in the event of any conflict arising from 
their directorships at Cairn India Limited. In the opinion of the Board, 
Mr Macdonald does not have any business relationship and he is not 
involved in any transaction or circumstance that would interfere with 
the exercise of independent judgement in carrying out the 
responsibilities of a director. Accordingly, the Board concluded that 
the tenure of Mr Mehta and Mr Macdonald does not materially affect 
their ability to exercise independent judgement or act in the best 
interests of the Group. Furthermore, the renewal of Non-Executive 
Director service agreements is subject to rigorous review and based 
on annual reappointment. For these reasons, and following a 
consideration of any other factors that may impair independent 
judgement, the Board is unanimously of the opinion that Messrs 
Mehta and Macdonald are considered to be independent and 
impartial. While their total length of appointment would not normally 
exceed nine-years, in the light of the continuing search for additional 
non-executive directors and to ensure the smooth transition of any 
new and incoming Non-Executive Director, the Board has invited 
Messrs Mehta and Macdonald to serve on the Board for a further year 
following the nine-year anniversary of their appointment, subject to 
the proposed resolution to reappoint them at the 2014 Annual 
General Meeting.
Finally, the Board once again reviewed whether any conflicts of 
interest arose from Messrs Mehta and Macdonald having previously 
held senior management positions within subsidiary companies of 
HSBC Holdings Plc which acted as the joint global bookrunner and 
co-ordinator for the Company’s listing in 2003. As they retired from 
their respective roles over a decade ago and had no involvement with 
the Company prior to their appointment, the Board remains of the 
view that they are independent and have no conflicts of interest.
Following careful consideration, the Board has determined that all of 
the current Non-Executive Directors are independent and free from 
any relationship or circumstance that could affect or appear to affect 
their independent judgement.
Directors’ conflicts of interest
The Board has an established procedure for the disclosure of interests 
and other related matters in line with published guidance and the 
Companies Act 2006. Each Director must promptly disclose actual or 
potential conflicts and any changes to the Board which are noted at 
each Board meeting. The Board considers and authorises potential or 
actual conflicts as appropriate. Directors with a conflict do not 
participate in the discussion or vote on the matter in question. These 
procedures have proved to be effective during the year under review. 
Related party transactions, which include those in respect of any 
Director, are disclosed in Note 38 on pages 182 to 184.
The Board reviewed any potential conflict of interest for Mr Geoffrey 
Green from his previous role at Ashurst LLP . The fees paid to Ashurst 
LLP during the year amounted to US$195,037 (2013: US$0.7 million) 
and, as the value of the expenditure incurred was determined to be 
immaterial and Mr Green was not directly involved in advising the 
Group, the Board authorised the potential conflict of interest in 
accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association.
Relationship agreement
At the time of the Company’s Listing in 2003, it entered into a 
relationship agreement with Volcan (the ‘Relationship Agreement’), 
its majority shareholder, to regulate the ongoing relationship between 
them. A new Relationship Agreement was entered into in December 
2011 the terms of which are the same as that entered into on Listing 
but updated for legal and regulatory requirements where appropriate. 
The principal purpose of the Relationship Agreement is to ensure that 
the Group is able to carry on business independently of Volcan, the 
Agarwal family and their associates. Under the terms of the 
Relationship Agreement, the Board, and Nominations Committee will 
at all times consist of a majority of Directors who are independent of 
Volcan and the Agarwal family. Whilst the Remuneration and Audit 
Committees shall at all times comprise solely of Non-Executive 
Directors, Volcan is entitled to nominate for appointment as Director 
such number of persons as is one less than the number of Directors 
who are independent of Volcan, the Agarwal family and their 
associates. The Board considers these to be adequate safeguards in 
that Directors who are independent of Volcan make up at least half of 
the Board in accordance with Provision B.1.2 of the Code and 
Vedanta’s ability to operate independently of Volcan is protected by 
the Relationship Agreement. 
The Financial Conduct Authority has recently introduced a number of 
measures in the Listing Rules to enhance the protection for minority 
shareholders. One of the most important changes will be the 
requirement for listed companies with a controlling shareholder to 
have in place a Relationship Agreement. The existing Relationship 
Agreement will be reviewed during the year ahead to ensure 
compliance with the new requirements. 
The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing matters arising in 
relation to the Relationship Agreement and related party transactions 
on behalf of the Board. There were no such matters considered during 
the year. Directors’ Report
88 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report and accounts FY2014
Commitment
All Directors allocate sufficient time to the Company to discharge 
their responsibilities effectively.
All Directors are required to disclose their other time commitments 
and seek the agreement of the Executive Chairman prior to accepting 
any additional appointments in order to ensure that they have 
sufficient time to fulfil their role as a Director. The expected time 
commitment of the Company’s Non-Executive Directors is set out in 
their letters of appointment. Non-Executive Directors are expected to 
spend at least 20 days per year on the Company’s business with 
greater time commitment during periods of heightened strategic and 
commercial activity. The Non-Executive Directors letters of 
appointment are available on request to the Company Secretary.
Development, information and support
All Directors receive an induction on joining the Board and 
regularly update and refresh their skills and knowledge. The 
Board receives in a timely manner information in a form and of a 
quality appropriate to enable it to discharge its duties.
The Board is committed to the ongoing professional development of 
all of the Directors. On appointment to the Board, each Director 
undergoes a comprehensive induction programme which is tailored to 
their individual needs but is intended to provide an introduction to the 
Group’s operations and the challenges and risks faced. During the 
year, Mr Parekh attended the induction and orientation programme 
consisting of meetings with and presentations from senior 
management, and meetings with the Non-Executive Directors. He 
also received induction materials including the Company’s Articles of 
Association, Board terms of reference, Share Dealing Code, Cairn 
India Prospectus, Code of Business Conduct, Vedanta Values and an 
update on the implementation of the Anti-Bribery policy across the 
Group. In addition, in 2013, Mr Green attended INSEAD’s 
International Directors Programme to further develop the essential 
skills required of a Director. 
The Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary, who is responsible to the Board for ensuring that Board 
procedures are followed. The Company Secretary is also responsible 
for advising the Board through the Chairman on governance matters. 
The Directors also have access to the Company’s professional advisers 
whom they can consult where necessary for the discharge of their 
duties. During the year, the Directors received legal and regulatory 
updates on corporate governance developments and presentations 
from the senior management of Konkola Copper Mines, Zambia, and 
Cairn India. 
In September 2013, Mr Albanese joined the Group as Chairman of 
Vedanta Resources Holdings Limited before being appointed Chief 
Executive Officer effective April 2014. This structured appointment 
process provided Mr Albanese with the opportunity to participate in a 
comprehensive and tailored orientation programme essentially to 
familiarise him with the Group’s operations, the business environment 
and the markets in which we operate, as well as to build a link with our 
employees and an understanding of the Group’s main relationships. 
The orientation includes meetings with other Board members, the 
executive team, senior management and visits to the operating sites 
of the Group:
• Alumina refinery at Lanjigarh, India;
• Aluminium smelters in India (operated by Bharat Aluminium 
Company and Vedanta Aluminium);
• Rampura Agucha Zinc mine in Rajasthan, India (operated by 
Hindustan Zinc);
• Black Mountain Zinc mine, South Africa;
• Skorpion Zinc mine in Karas, Namibia;
• Iron ore mine in Goa, India (operated by Sesa Sterlite);
• Iron ore mine, Western Cluster, Liberia (operated by Sesa Sterlite);
• Copper smelter in Tuticorin, India (operated by Sesa Sterlite);
• Konkola Copper mine, Zambia;
• Copper mines, Tasmania (in 2014), Australia;
• Oil fields in Rajasthan (in 2013) and Andhra Pradesh (in 2014), India 
(operated by Cairn India); and
• Coal based thermal power plant in Punjab, India (operated by a 
subsidiary of Sesa Sterlite).
The objectives of the programme are also to maximise Mr Albanese’s 
contributions to Board deliberations, to enable him to make informed 
decisions with regard to matters of the Group, and to give him a 
greater insight into the legal and ethical framework in which he must 
conduct himself. 
The orientation and training programme for Mr Albanese has 
continued following his appointment to the Board with a focus on 
internal management meeting attendance to provide him with 
opportunities to meet key talent within the Group, as well as 
additional operational site visits to deepen his understanding of key 
business risks and issues.
Evaluation
The Board undertakes a formal and rigorous annual evaluation 
of its own performance and that of its Committees and 
individual Directors.
The Board undertakes regular evaluations of its own performance as 
well as that of the various Board Committees. In previous years the 
performance evaluations were led by the Executive Chairman 
supported by the Company Secretary. The review consisted of a 
detailed questionnaire tailored to the Board and each Committee 
with a subsequent discussion of results and agreement of relevant 
actions. As required by the Code, an externally facilitated evaluation 
was conducted in 2014 and is reported on below.
Corporate Governance report continued Strategic Report Directors’ Report Financial Statements Additional Information
89 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report and accounts FY2014
Choice of evaluator
The choice of external evaluator was a key consideration for the 
Nominations Committee. The brief was to find a company used to 
dealing with Board members who would provide a bespoke service to 
address the specific requirements of the evaluation. Prism Cosec 
(‘Prism’) was chosen to conduct the process due to their ability to 
engage meaningfully with the Directors. Prism also provided 
occasional corporate governance advice to the Company on an ad 
hoc basis (the fees for such work have not been material). Prism’s 
knowledge of the background and development of Vedanta was also 
an important factor enabling them to carry out an effective and 
targeted process.
Evaluation process 
A series of discussion topics on which to base individual interviews 
with the Directors was agreed. These covered questions on: 
• The external environment for resources companies;
• The Board’s strategic response;
• Strategy and risk;
• Key priorities for the Board;
• Committee structure and operation of the Committees;
• Sustainability and CSR; and
• Any other business.
The findings from the evaluation exercise were discussed with the 
Chairman and reviewed by the whole Board before a set of actions 
were agreed.
Main recommendations
Summary 
The Board evaluation exercise was undertaken shortly after the 
appointment of Mr Albanese, the newly appointed Chief Executive 
Officer, and therefore a number of the recommendations were 
aligned to significant changes which were already in progress 
concerning the way in which the Company is managed.
The underlying processes of the Board and its Committees were 
generally considered to be working well, although there were areas 
where further improvements could be made. 
The Board’s strengths
A number of strengths emerged from the evaluation exercise  
which were:
• The current Board and Committee processes work effectively with 
agenda preparation and information flows operating well;
• Dialogue within Board meetings is encouraged and debate is 
managed well;
• Financial information is comprehensive and the Board has an 
effective grasp on financial matters;
• The positive performance evaluation of the Chairman of the Board 
and the collaborative relationship with the Board; and 
• Good progress has been made on certain key priorities over the 
past year e.g. Group structure.
A series of actions will be identified in response to the 
recommendations of the review, as follows:
Theme
Strategic discussion: Broader consideration of strategic issues 
outside India was encouraged, particularly 
within Asia and Africa. 
Risk: Further work on the strategic oversight of risk 
was encouraged.
Board process: The format, structure and process for Board 
papers and the timetable and locations 
of Board meetings should be reviewed. 
The induction and ongoing development 
programme should be restructured and 
developed for Directors. 
Audit Committee: The Audit Committee should consider 
increasing the number of meetings to 
allocate more time to (a) the Committee 
obligations as set out in its terms of reference, 
and (b) the increasing accountability that it 
has to report on its own activities.
Nomination 
Committee:
The Committee should continue to identify 
the optimum balance of skills, background 
and experience to develop and inform 
the Board recruitment process over the 
coming months. Board diversity should be 
strengthened. 
Remuneration 
Committee:
The Board as a whole should continue to 
monitor the effectiveness of communication 
with analysts and shareholders concerning 
the Board’s Remuneration Policy.
Sustainability: The governance of sustainability should 
be revisited. The membership of the 
Sustainability Committee should be reviewed 
to create greater accountability from 
management in this area.
Committee evaluation
The independently facilitated evaluation of the Board has embraced 
certain aspects of the role of the Board Committees and, as a result of 
this, a number of the recommendations from the Board evaluation 
process are being considered for each Committee. Consequently, the 
Committees will evaluate their own performance later in 2014, in 
order to consider how those recommendations from the main 
evaluation exercise have been implemented and identify further steps 
that they consider need to be taken to ensure their continued 
effectiveness as Committees.
Chairman’s performance
Every year the Chairman’s performance is evaluated by the Non-
Executive Directors. The process is led by the Senior Independent 
Director and the conclusions of the evaluation are fed back to  
the Chairman with a number of actions to be completed over the  
year ahead.  Directors’ Report

Re-election
All Directors are submitted for re-election at regular intervals, 
subject to continued satisfactory performance.
In accordance with the Code which requires that the Directors of FTSE 
350 companies should be subject to annual election by shareholders, 
all of the Company’s Directors will stand for re-election at the 
Company’s 2014 Annual General Meeting.
Accountability 
Financial and business reporting
The Directors present a fair, balanced and understandable 
assessment of the Company’s position and prospects.
The Group has a comprehensive financial reporting system, which is 
reviewed and modified in line with Accounting Standards to ensure 
that all published financial information is accurate. Vedanta’s financial 
reporting procedures are based on five main elements:
• Financial information supplied by subsidiary companies and 
consolidated at central level:
 – Management accounts are prepared on a monthly basis and 
reviewed by the Executive Committee; 
 – Management accounts are reviewed by the Board at least 
quarterly; 
 – Performance is monitored against key performance indicators 
throughout the financial year and forecasts are updated as 
appropriate; and
 – Annual operational budgets are prepared by each operating 
subsidiary and consolidated into a Group Budget which is 
reviewed and approved by the Board. 
• The Internal Audit function provides assurance in respect of 
processes, physical verification and management information 
system accuracy for each operating company. 
• External auditor assurance: 
 – Full year audit and interim review are carried out on the 
published financial statements. 
• Review by the Audit Committee of: 
 – Year-end reporting plans; 
 – Legal, tax and accounting issues;
 – Consideration of the financial statements and disclosures in 
accordance with financial reporting standards; and
 – Going concern statements with supporting cash flow, liquidity 
and funding forecasts. 
• Review by the Audit Committee and the Board of the preliminary 
and half-year announcements, the Annual Report and Accounts 
and any other announcements including financial information.

Risk management and internal control
The Board is responsible for determining the nature and extent 
of the significant risks it is willing to take in achieving its strategic 
objectives. The Board maintains a sound risk management and 
internal control system.
The Board is responsible for setting the Group’s risk appetite and 
determining the nature and extent of the risks it is willing to take to 
achieve its strategic objectives. The Directors also have ultimate 
responsibility for ensuring that the Group maintains a robust system 
of internal control to provide them with reasonable assurance that all 
information within the business and for external publication is 
adequate. Authority for detailed monitoring of the internal control 
and risk management framework is delegated to the Audit 
Committee which reports to the Board regularly within the remit of its 
role.
The Group’s risk management framework plays a key role in the 
identification, analysis, mitigation and continual monitoring of the 
various risks that could impact the delivery of the strategic objectives 
set by the Board. Full details of principal risks and uncertainties are 
contained in the Strategic report on pages 32 to 38.
The Risk Management Committee comprising of the Chief Executive 
Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and Director, Management 
Assurance and Information Technology periodically reviews the 
changes in the nature and extent of major risks. The Company’s Chief 
Risk Officer and the risk officers at operating subsidiaries are 
responsible for creating heightened awareness of the risk 
management framework both at Group level and at operating 
subsidiary level. They play an important role in ensuring that the 
organisation sustains its risk management initiatives and that the 
Group’s risk management framework matures and grows with the 
organisation.
A consistently applied methodology is used to identify risks to 
operations and projects at the operating subsidiary level. This includes 
financial, operational and compliance control and risk management, 
to ensure shareholders’ interests and the Company’s assets are 
safeguarded. The process also covers significant risks that may arise 
from environmental, social and governance matters. At the 
operational level specialists are brought in where appropriate to 
review working practices and recommendations are implemented 
with the purpose of creating safe working environments. MAS also 
review the quarterly accounts of the Group subsidiary boards. 
MAS have arrangements with leading international accounting and 
audit firms excluding the Group’s external auditor for carrying out 
internal audits within the Group.
This element has been an important component of the overall 
process by which the Board obtains the assurance it requires to ensure 
that risks are properly identified, evaluated and managed. The scope 
of work, authority and resources of MAS are regularly reviewed by the 
Audit Committee. The responsibilities of MAS include recommending 
improvements in the control environment and reviewing compliance 
with the Group’s philosophy, policies and procedures. The planning of 
internal audit is approached from a risk perspective. In preparing the 
internal audit plan, reference is made to the Group’s risk matrix, inputs 
are sought from senior management, project managers and Audit 
Committee members and reference is made to past audit experience, 
financial analysis and the current economic and business 
environment.
Each of the Group’s principal subsidiaries has in place procedures to 
ensure that sufficient internal controls are maintained. These 
procedures include a monthly meeting of the relevant management 
committee and quarterly meeting of the Audit Committee of that 
subsidiary. Any adverse findings are reported to the Audit Committee. 
The Audit Committee Chairman may request MAS and/ or the 
external auditor to focus their audit work and report to him on specific 
areas of risk identified by the risk management and internal control 
framework. At a Group level, the findings by MAS are presented 
monthly to the Executive Committee and to the Audit Committee on 
a half yearly basis.
The Executive Committee and Audit Committee regularly review 
reports related to the Group’s internal control framework in order to 
satisfy the internal control requirements of the Code (Internal Control: 
Revised Guidance for Directors) and section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act 2002. Due to the limitations inherent in any system of 
internal control, this system is designed to meet the Group’s particular 
needs and the risks to which it is exposed rather than eliminate risk 
altogether. Consequently it can only provide reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
In line with best practice, the Board has reviewed the internal control 
system in place during the year and up to the date of the approval of 
this report. The Board’s review includes the Audit Committee’s report 
on the risk matrix, significant risks and actions put in place to mitigate 
these risks. This review ensures that the internal control system 
remains effective. Where weaknesses are identified as a result of the 
review, new procedures are put in place to strengthen controls and 
these are in turn reviewed at regular intervals. Every risk has an owner 
who is responsible for ensuring that controls are put in place to 
mitigate the risk. During the course of its review of the system of 
internal control, the Board has not identified nor been advised of any 
weaknesses or control failure that is significant. Directors’ Report

Dialogue with shareholders
There is a dialogue with shareholders based on the mutual 
understanding of objectives. The Board as a whole is responsible 
for ensuring that a satisfactory dialogue with shareholders takes

Company’s shareholders at the Annual General Meeting, leading to 
full and frank discussions on a variety of topics of interest to 
shareholders. All of the Directors, including the Chairmen of the Audit,

Committee to report on issues and facilitate discussions with the 
external auditor. The Committee meets with representatives from the 
external auditor without management being present bi-annually. The 
Chairman of the Audit Committee regularly reports to the Board on 
the Committee’s activities. The Committee’s agenda is based on its 
remit outlined on the previous page as appropriate to the stage in the 
reporting cycle. The external auditor attends meetings of the Audit 
Committee to ensure effective communication of matters relating to 
the audit.

Annual Report review
At the request of the Board, the Audit Committee considered whether 
the 2014 Annual Report and Accounts was fair, balanced and 
understandable and whether it provided the necessary information 
for shareholders and stakeholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy. Such assessments are 
provided in the Chairman’s and Chief Executive Officer’s statement 
and the Strategic report of this Annual Report. The Audit Committee 
and the Board are satisfied that the Annual Report and Accounts 
meet this requirement as both positive and negative developments in 
the year were considered at length. In justifying this statement the 
Audit Committee has considered the robust process which operates in 
creating the Annual Report and Accounts, including:
• Evaluation and verification of the inputs from the business 
functions, to include the well-established financial reporting system 
within Vedanta to ensure accuracy and consistency;
• Progress through various levels of review, including review by the 
Executive Committee and senior management across the Group; 
• Consideration is given to the completeness of the information and 
to ensuring that there are no significant omissions to enable 
shareholders to assess the Company’s performance; 
• Management Assurance Services conduct internal audit reviews 
with conclusions and recommendations presented to the Audit 
Committee; 
• Revisions to regulatory requirements are considered and 
incorporated to include the UK Corporate Governance Code;
• Advice is also received by the Audit Committee from external 
advisers in order to make the recommendation to the Board that 
the Annual Report and Accounts as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable;
• Members of the Audit Committee receive an advance draft of the 
Annual Report enabling them to assess and challenge whether the 
various reports within the Annual Report are consistent and in line 
with their understanding of the business;
• A meeting of the Audit Committee is held to formally review and 
sign-off the draft Annual Report; and
• A meeting of the Board is held to review and provide final sign-off.
Whistleblowing procedure
The Group has in place a whistleblowing procedure that is regularly 
reviewed by the Audit Committee. This is a standalone policy which is 
summarised in the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and supports 
the Group’s aim of working to the highest ethical standards. The 
policy allows employees of the Company, its subsidiaries and all 
external stakeholders to raise any issues of concern in confidence and 
forms part of the Group’s internal control monitoring process. The 
Audit Committee reviews any reports made under the whistleblowing 
policy and ensures appropriate actions are taken if required. 
Whistleblowing procedures have proved to be robust in that reported 
cases are thoroughly investigated and appropriate actions taken.
Fraud and Bribery Act
The Company is committed to the elimination of fraud, with each 
suspected case thoroughly investigated and concluded. The Audit 
Committee reviews the actions taken by management in the elimination 
of fraudulent practices and to promote ethical working practices.
External auditor
The Audit Committee is pivotal in monitoring the performance of the 
external auditor and the Group’s relationship with the external 
auditor. Details of how this is achieved are set out below.
The audit process
A detailed Audit Plan is prepared by the external auditor, Deloitte LLP , 
(‘Deloitte’) which is reviewed by the Audit Committee. The Audit Plan 
sets out the audit scope, key audit risks identified, materiality issues, 
the client team working on the audit and the audit timetable. The 
audit scope covers the significant components of the audit and audit 
plans for each component and geographical location. Each of the key 
audit risks and the external auditor’s response on how it will 
investigate these risks is considered by the Committee. 
Significant issues 
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions, that affect the application of 
accounting policies and the reported amount of assets, liabilities, 
income, expenses and disclosures of contingent liabilities at the date of 
these financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and 
expenses for the years presented. The Committee reviews whether the 
Group’s accounting policies are appropriate, and management’s 
estimate and judgements applied in the financial statements are 
reasonable. The Committee also focused on the disclosures made in the 
financial statements. Views of statutory auditors on these significant 
issues were also considered by the Committee.  Directors’ Report
96 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report and accounts FY2014
The Audit Committee Report continued
The significant issues that were considered by the Audit Committee emerging from the audit process are outlined below:
Significant issues How these issues were addressed
Impairment assessment of alumina refinery assets at Lanjigarh  
and iron ore business at Goa and Karnataka.
More information is provided in Note 2(b) to the financial statements.
Impairment assessment of alumina refinery assets at Lanjigarh is 
considered as a significant issue due to the challenges in obtaining 
regulatory approvals for the refinery expansion and delays in 
obtaining bauxite mining approvals. The significant assumptions of 
timing of approvals was put through a stress test by the Committee 
and other assumptions of discount rates and commodity prices were 
reviewed by the Committee. 
The mining ban at Karnataka was lifted and production commenced 
in December 2013. The Supreme Court lifted the mining ban at Goa 
and business is currently awaiting issue of renewed mining leases for 
the commencement of mining operations at Goa. The timing of 
start-up of operations post regulatory approvals which was the key 
consideration was reviewed by the Committee. 
The Committee was also informed that the impairment assessment 
approach and assumptions are consistent across all business 
segments. With the existence of sufficient headroom over carrying 
value of assets it was concluded that no impairment is required.
Revenue recognition across the business:
– provisional pricing sale of goods;
– oil and gas revenue;  and
– power tariff with GRIDCO.
The Committee reviewed the process and compliance around the 
Group revenue recognition policy and its consistent application. The 
Committee also sought management’s view on revenue recognition 
principles. The Committee was satisfied that the cut off procedures, 
transfer of risks and process followed for the pricing of goods were 
consistent and it concluded that these risks have been mitigated. 
Further receivables from GRIDCO, (which are being appealed 
following a tariff determination assessment by the Orissa Electricity 
Regulatory Commission) was assessed by the Committee together 
with revenue recognition in terms of the requirements of IAS 18. The 
tariff determination basis was also supported by an opinion from 
external legal counsel.
Litigation, environmental and regulatory risks. Refer to Note 37 to the 
financial statements.
A comprehensive legal paper was placed before the Committee for its 
consideration. The mitigating factors were discussed by the 
Committee with senior management. The Committee also reviewed 
the probable, possible and remote analysis carried out by 
management and disclosure of contingent liabilities in the financial 
statements. In all significant disputes the management assessment 
was supported by legal opinions from external legal counsel.
Taxation. Additional information on these matters are disclosed in 
Note 37 to the financial statements 
A comprehensive tax paper outlining taxation disputes in respect of 
withholding taxes following past acquisitions, eligibility of tax 
incentives and output taxes and other matters was placed before the 
committee for its consideration. The Committee discussed these tax 
issues and reviewed the assessment of probable, possible and remote 
analysis and the process followed by management. The contingent 
liability disclosure was also reviewed by the Committee. In certain 
cases, views of tax experts supporting the managements assessment 
was also provided to the Committee. Strategic Report Directors’ Report Financial Statements Additional Information
97 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report and accounts FY2014
Auditor independence
The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing the external 
auditor’s independence and assessing their continued effectiveness. 
The Audit Committee and the Board place great emphasis on the 
objectivity of the external auditor. The current external auditor, 
Deloitte LLP , has been the Company’s auditor since its listing in 2003. 
The rotation of the audit partner’s responsibilities within Deloitte is 
required by their profession’s ethical standards and there is also 
rotation of key members within the audit team. Deloitte are required 
to rotate the audit partner responsible for the Group’s audit every five 
years and the last audit partner rotation was in 2010. The audit 
partner responsible for the audit of Indian subsidiaries was rotated in 
2012, and the next rotation will take place in 2017 . 
A key part of ensuring the independence of the external auditor is to 
have in place robust policies concerning matters that may affect their 
independence. The Company has in place policies on:
• The independence and objectivity of the external auditor.
• Employment of former employees of the external auditor.
• Appointment of the external auditor for non-audit services.
These policies are based on the APB Ethical Standards for Auditors 
and are regularly reviewed to ensure they are in line with best practice. 
These controls provide the Audit Committee with confidence that the 
independence of Deloitte in their audit function will be maintained. 
New requirements introduced by the Code expect companies to put 
their external audit contract out to tender at least once every 10 
years. Similarly, the Companies Act 2013, enacted in India provides 
that companies put their external audit contract out to tender on 
completion of two terms of five years. Accordingly, the Audit 
Committee are of the view that it will be less disruptive and potentially 
more effective if the Company align the tender of the UK external 
audit contract with the requirements on auditor rotation of Indian 
subsidiaries, which is due to occur in 2017 .
The Audit Committee, with the assistance of the Chief Financial 
Officer and the Company Secretary, has considered at length its 
position on retendering the audit contract and agreed to put the audit 
contract out to tender no later than 2017 , in line with Financial 
Reporting Council recommended transitional arrangements and the 
Companies Act enacted in India. This situation will be kept under 
strict review and if circumstances change consideration will be given 
to bringing forward the date of the tender process.
Provision of non-audit services by the external auditor 
The Group’s policy on the provision of non-audit services by the 
external auditor specifies certain services which the external auditor is 
prohibited from undertaking in order to safeguard their objectivity 
and independence. This includes work relating to the financial 
statements that will ultimately be subject to audit and the provision 
of internal audit services. The policy also identifies those services 
which the external auditor is permitted to deliver to the Group. These 
include tax advisory services, and work on mergers, acquisitions and 
disposals. Of the permitted services, any assignment in excess of 
US$100,000 may only be awarded to the external auditor with the 
prior approval of the Audit Committee.
All other permitted non-audit services and the fees paid to the 
external auditor for non-audit work are reported to the Audit 
Committee on a six-monthly basis. This report includes safeguards 
put into place to ensure that any threats to the independence of the 
external auditor are mitigated. The majority of non-audit services 
provided by the external auditor are tax advisory services, corporate 
finance matters or transaction related work. A separate team within 
Deloitte LLP is used to carry out non-audit work and overseen by a 
separate partner. An analysis of non-audit fees can be found in Note 
10 (on page 147) to the financial statements.
Performance and reappointment of the external auditor
Vedanta recognises the current requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the ‘Code’) and transitional guidance in relation to 
audit tendering, and also notes the proposed European Union text on 
Audit Regulation and Directive and the UK Competition Commission 
response to conduct further consultation on auditor tendering.
During the year, the Audit Committee reviewed the effectiveness of 
current auditors using a survey comprising a range of questions 
covering objectivity, quality and efficiency. The Committee concluded 
that the results of the survey were positive; it was considered that the 
current auditors continue to provide a high quality audit. The 
Committee was satisfied with the external audit process and that the 
independence of the external auditors was not compromised after 
taking into account the assessment by the Audit Committee that the 
current auditors continue to be objective, independent and effective, 
and the proposed resolution to reappoint them at the 2014 Annual 
General Meeting. For these reasons, the Committee recommended to 
the Board that a resolution to reappoint them be considered at the 
2014 Annual General Meeting. 
The year ahead
It is expected that the Financial Reporting Council will introduce 
changes to the Code and guidance in respect of risk management, 
internal controls and going concern reporting following the Sharman 
report. In addition it is anticipated that EU regulation and proposals 
from the Competition Commission on audit tendering will be coming 
into force during 2014. The Audit Committee will be keeping these 
developments under review to ensure compliance within required 
timescales.
In addition, the Audit Committee’s objectives for the forthcoming 
year include:
• Implement findings from Board Evaluation process.
• Continued review of cyber security risks and controls.
• Focus on oversight of Anti-Bribery Act policies and procedures.

Other Executive Directors and members of the senior management 
team may attend meetings at the invitation of the Committee as 
appropriate. The Chairman of the Nominations Committee provides 
an update to the Board in respect of the Committee’s activities.
Nominations Committee activities during the year
The focus this year has continued to be on issues of diversity, 
succession planning and Board composition due to the Committee’s 
awareness of the tenure of its Non-Executive Directors. Both the 
Committee and Board have discussed at length the need for 
refreshing of the Board and at the recommendation of the 
Committee, one new Non-Executive Director was appointed to the 
Board in 2012 and a further Non-Executive Director in 2013. 
Recruitment process
When considering new appointments to the Board, the Nominations 
Committee oversees the preparation of a criteria specification that is 
provided to an independent specialist search agency retained to 
conduct a global search. In 2013, Spencer Stuart, a specialist search 
agency was instructed to consider a wide range of candidates taking 
into account geographical location, nationality, gender, specific skills, 
knowledge and experience, and the process culminated in the 
appointment of Mr Deepak Parekh to the Board. Strategic Report Directors’ Report Financial Statements Additional Information
99 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report and accounts FY2014
As part of the continual cycle to refresh the Board and to address the 
issue of gender diversity, the Committee is leading the 2014 process 
to recruit new independent Non-Executive Directors to succeed 
Mr Aman Mehta and Mr Euan Macdonald who plan to step down 
from the Board when suitable candidates have been identified*. 
The Committee has considered comprehensive search briefs with 
an emphasis on recruiting female members with UK listed company 
experience to the Board.
Spencer Stuart has no other connection with the Group other 
than to provide recruitment consultancy services to the 
Nominations Committee. 
Succession planning
Succession planning during the year turned to a focus on executive 
management. The Nominations Committee had been considering for 
some time the recruitment of a new Chief Executive Officer to replace 
Mr MS Mehta when he retired as part of the succession planning 
process. Tom Albanese was identified as a potential candidate after 
an extensive search. Mr Albanese joined Vedanta Resources Holdings 
Limited, the holding company of Sesa Sterlite Limited and Konkola 
Copper Mines, as its Chairman on 16 September 2013. This gave the 
Committee a further opportunity to review his skills and suitability 
before recommending his appointment as Chief Executive Officer to 
the Board. The Board confirmed his appointment with effect from  
1 April 2014.
Diversity
The Board supports the importance of having diversity of thought 
and representation on its Board and it is one of the Nominations 
Committee’s tasks to ensure this is achieved. Board diversity has been 
considered from a number of aspects, including but not limited to 
age, gender, race and ethnic origin, cultural and educational 
background. In terms of skill sets, Board members have a wide range 
of knowledge and expertise ranging from corporate finance and 
banking to diplomacy and law. In terms of gender, the Company’s 
diversity policy has an aspirational target of achieving a minimum of 
25% women on the Board by 2015. We acknowledge that at present 
there are no women on our Board and addressing the gender balance 
to meet the target on the Board has been and will continue to remain 
a top priority for the Committee. It is essential to overcome the 
reasons for lack of female representation to date. These have 
included the fact that Vedanta operates within a traditionally male 
dominated industry. Furthermore, due to cultural constraints and the 
remote geographical location of some of our operations, we face a 
number of challenges in addressing the gender balance within the 
Group. Women currently comprise 8.4% of the overall employee 
population within the Group whereas the percentage of female 
representation across the Group’s professional population is 12.4%. 
In order to achieve our target for women on the Board, we ensure 
that women candidates are considered routinely as part of the 
recruitment process. 
We also actively encourage and monitor the progress of women in 
senior positions throughout the Group. Initiatives this year included 
reviewing the barriers to women with children in returning to work. By 
supporting equal opportunities we will ensure that the pool of women 
from which management can be drawn will increase. In April 2014, 
Ms Lalita Gupte was appointed to the board of Sesa Sterlite Limited 
as an independent Non-Executive Director of that company, and 
Ms Roma Balwani joined the Group as Head of Communications 
and Corporate Social Responsibility. 
The year ahead
The Nominations Committee objectives for the coming year are:
• Review plans for nurturing talent and improving the gender balance 
within the Group.
• Continued focus on succession planning for the Board in order to 
ensure a balance of skills, experience and diversity.
• A commitment to increasing the participation of women across all 
levels of the business, not least the Board of Directors.

Sustainability Committee report 
Euan Macdonald, Chairman, Sustainability Committee
This Report provides details of the role and responsibilities of the 
Sustainability Committee and the work it has undertaken during 
the year.
“This year I was pleased to assume the Chairmanship of Vedanta’s 
Sustainability Committee. In overseeing my responsibilities as laid 
down by the Board and in managing Vedanta’s business sustainably, 
I will be guided by the three pillars of Responsible Stewardship, 
Building Strong Relationships and Adding and Sharing Value, which 
together have proven to be a valuable model for the Company’s 
sustainable growth. 
Over the course of the year, the Committee was particularly 
concerned to focus on the unacceptably high number of fatalities 
suffered across our business; to understand their root causes and to 
monitor the business response through the ‘Key Safety Focus Areas’ 
programme, launched to strengthen our mitigation of safety risks. 
The Committee also recognised that subsidiary businesses needed to 
improve their stakeholder engagement and change management 
processes. We recommended that with regards to human rights and 
child labour compliance subsidiaries businesses need to be extra 
vigilant at the loading and unloading operations in remote areas. 
Water, energy and waste consumption targets were also reviewed by 
the Committee and we emphasised the importance of having robust 
plans to ensure these targets are met. The Committee further 
recommended the hiring of a Group safety adviser to help and 
support Group companies on the safety related issue. 
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank management across 
our subsidiary businesses for their commitment to VSAP , which has 
been a demanding exercise.”

Remuneration Committee letter
Euan Macdonald, Chairman, Remuneration Committee
Dear Shareholder,
During the course of the year, the Remuneration Committee (the 
‘Committee’) has undertaken a full review of our remuneration 
structures and practices. In previous years, we received feedback from 
a number of investors and proxy advisers that our remuneration 
structures were not fully aligned with usual practice for a UK-listed 
company. Many of our practices have evolved to meet the needs of 
an executive population based largely in India and we are conscious 
of the need to balance this with the expectations of our investors. We 
are therefore grateful for this input and have taken it into account 
when developing new arrangements. 
The proposed key changes to the remuneration policy are as follows:
• Formalising the structure of the annual bonus and introducing 
bonus deferral for half of any bonus earned. 
• Replacing the existing Employee Share Ownership Plan (‘ESOP’) 
with the Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) for Executive Directors. PSP 
awards will have a three-year performance period and an 
additional two-year holding period on all vested shares.
• A clawback provision will apply to both the annual bonus plan and 
PSP.
• Introducing shareholding guidelines of 200% of base 
compensation for all Executive Directors.
The Committee members and I believe that the changes set out 
above represent a significant step forward for our remuneration 
policies – both in terms of driving sustained long-term performance, 
and in alignment with good governance practices. I hope that you will 
share this view and support our proposals.
During the year conditions have remained challenging, due to a 
mining ban on iron ore, the temporary shutdown of the Tuticorin 
smelter and Lanjigarh refinery, volatile commodity prices and 
industry-wide inflationary trends and various other short-term issues. 
These factors have been reflected in the profit performance for 
the year.
In spite of this, the Company was able to deliver solid operational 
performance, the completion of the Group simplification project and 
strong cost management performance. All of these factors were 
considered and reflected in the incentives for the year. Accordingly, 
the 2013–14 annual bonus outcome for the Executive Directors was 
determined at 44% of base compensation, while the threshold 
performance targets in respect of the ESOP awards granted on 
16 May 2013 were not met and the awards lapsed in full. 
During the year, Mr MS Mehta retired as Chief Executive Officer and 
following an extensive search process, we are delighted that he was 
succeeded by Mr Tom Albanese on 1 April 2014. Mr Albanese’s 
remuneration package is structured to deliver a market competitive 
level of base compensation combined with significant performance 
related incentives. As part of his employment contract his annual 
bonus opportunity will be limited to 50% of base compensation for 
2014–15. From 2015–16 onwards his annual bonus opportunity will 
be increased in line with that of the other Executive Directors. Details 
of the remuneration paid to Mr MS Mehta on his departure are set out 
on page 109.
This is the first year in which we are formally required to report on 
remuneration under the new format required by the Department of 
Business, Innovation and Skills legislation. This year’s report on 
remuneration therefore comprises two parts: the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy Report which sets out our policy on Directors’ 
pay and which will be subject to a binding shareholder vote; and the 
Annual Report on Remuneration, which provides details of the 
remuneration earned by Directors in the past financial year as well as 
the way in which we propose to operate in the coming year, and will 
be subject to an advisory vote.
We hope that we will receive your support on both parts of the 
Remuneration Report at the forthcoming AGM.
Yours sincerely,
Euan Macdonald
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Strategic Report Directors’ Report Financial Statements Additional Information

Directors’ Remuneration Policy report
This part of the report sets out the remuneration policy for the 
Company and has been prepared in accordance with the Large and 
Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2013. The policy has been developed 
taking into account the principles of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code 2012 and the views of our major shareholders and describes the 
policy to be applied from 2014–15 onwards. The policy report will be 
put to a binding shareholder vote at the 2014 AGM and the policy will 
take formal effect from 1 April 2014.
Policy overview
The key objective of the Group’s broad remuneration policy is to 
ensure that competitive and fair awards are linked to key deliverables 
and are also aligned with market practice and shareholders’ 
expectations.
The Committee ensures that remuneration policies and practices are 
designed to attract, retain and motivate the Executive Directors and 
the senior management group, while focusing on the delivery of the 
Group’s strategic and business objectives. The Committee is also 
focused on aligning the interests of the Executive Directors and the 
senior management group with those of shareholders, to build a 
sustainable performance culture.
When setting remuneration for the Executive Directors, the 
Committee takes into account the business performance, 
developments in the natural resources sector and, considering that 
the majority of the Group’s operations are based in India, similar 
information for high-performing Indian companies.
The Committee has set remuneration taking into consideration both 
UK and Indian market practice to ensure it is globally competitive as 
the Executive Directors are based in India (with the exception of Mr 
Anil Agarwal, who is UK-based), along with the majority of the Group’s 
professional management team. The Committee also considers the 
inflation rates prevalent in the UK and India in the setting of 
remuneration.
The Committee recognises that financial performance of the 
Company is heavily influenced by macro-economic considerations 
such as commodity prices and exchange rate movements. These 
factors are therefore taken into consideration when setting executive 
remuneration.
How the views of shareholders are taken into account
The Committee considers the AGM to be an opportunity to meet and 
communicate with investors and considers shareholder feedback 
received in relation to the AGM each year and guidance from 
shareholder representative bodies more generally. This feedback, plus 
any additional feedback received during any meetings from time to 
time, is then considered as part of the Company’s annual review of 
the remuneration policy. 
In addition, the Committee will seek to engage directly with major 
shareholders and their representative bodies should any material 
changes be proposed to the remuneration policy. Details of votes cast 
for and against the resolution to approve last year’s remuneration 
report and any matters discussed with shareholders during the year 
are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
How the views of employees are taken into account
In setting the policy for Executive Directors’ remuneration, the 
Committee considers the pay and employment conditions across the 
Group, including annual base compensation increases across the 
general employee population and the overall spend on annual 
bonuses. Employees may be eligible to participate in the annual 
bonus arrangement and receive awards under the ESOP or PSP . 
Opportunities and performance metrics may vary by employee level 
with specific business metrics incorporated where possible. 
The Committee does not formally consult with employees in respect 
of the design of the Executive Directors’ remuneration policy, 
although the Committee will keep this under review. Directors’ Report

of responsibilities, the 
individual’s experience 
and performance.
Changes are 
implemented with effect 
from 1 April each year.
Base compensation 
is paid in cash on a 
monthly basis.
Base compensation 
is typically set with

of comparable status, 
skill and responsibility in 
the metals and mining 
industries globally, and in 
the manufacturing and 
engineering industries 
more generally.
There is no prescribed 
maximum annual 
increase. Base 
compensation increases 
are applied in line with 
the annual review and are 
competitive within the 
UK and Indian market 
and internationally for 
comparable companies. 
The Committee is also 
guided by the general 
increase for the employee 
population but on 
occasions may need to 
recognise, for example, 
development in role and/
or change in responsibility.
Business and individual 
performance are 
considered when setting 
base compensation.
Taxable benefits To provide market 
competitive benefits.

performance and the 
remainder of the bonus 
potential will be based on

The Committee has the 
ability to adjust the bonus 
outturn if it believes 
that the outturn is not

the risk profile of the 
Company and market 
practice for similar

Selection of performance metrics
The annual bonus is based against a balanced scorecard of financial, 
operational, sustainability and strategic metrics. The mix of targets 
will be reviewed each year by the Committee to ensure that they 
remain appropriate to reflect the priorities for the Group in the year 
ahead. A sliding scale of targets is set to encourage continuous 
improvement and challenge the delivery of stretch performance.
The PSP is based on relative TSR performance, which provides an 
external assessment of the Company’s performance against the 
market. It also aligns the rewards received by executives with the 
returns received by shareholders. A sliding scale of challenging 
performance targets is set. The Committee will review the choice of 
performance measures and the appropriateness of the performance 
targets prior to each PSP grant. The Committee reserves the discretion 
to set different targets for future awards, without consulting with 
shareholders, providing that, in the opinion of the Committee, the 
new targets are no less challenging in light of the circumstances at the 
time than those used previously. The targets for awards granted 
under this remuneration policy are set out for shareholder approval in 
the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Remuneration scenarios for Executive Directors
The charts below illustrate how the Executive Directors’ remuneration 
packages vary at different levels of performance under the ongoing 
policy, which will apply from 1 April 2014, subject to shareholder 
approval. Two years’ illustrations have been included for the Chief 
Executive Officer to show the impact of the maximum annual bonus 
opportunity for 2014–15 and 2015–16. 
Notes
1 Base compensation levels are based on those applying on 1 April 2014 (converted at a rate 
of INR99.029% : £1).
2 The value of taxable benefits is based on the cost of supplying those benefits (as disclosed) 
for the year ending 31 March 2014 in the case of Messrs Anil Agarwal and Navin Agarwal. 
Mr Tom Albanese’s benefits have been estimated at 5% of base compensation.
3 The value of pension receivable by the Deputy Executive Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer in 2014–15 is taken to be 15% and 20% of base compensation respectively.
4 The on-target level of bonus assumed to be 60% of the maximum annual bonus 
opportunity.
5 The on-target level of the PSP assumed to be 50% of the face value of the award at grant.
6 Share price movement and dividend accrual have not been incorporated into the values 
shown above.
Approach to recruitment and promotions
The remuneration package for a new Executive Director i.e. base 
compensation, taxable benefits, pension, annual bonus and long-
term incentive awards, would be set in accordance with the terms of 
the Company’s prevailing approved remuneration policy at the time 
of appointment and would reflect the experience of the individual. 
The base compensation for a new executive may be set below the 
normal market rate, with phased increases over the first few years, as 
the executive gains experience in their new role. Annual bonus 
potential will be limited to 150% of base compensation and 
long-term incentives will be limited to 150% of base compensation 
per annum. 
In addition the Committee may offer additional cash and/or 
share-based elements when it considers these to be in the best 
interests of the Company (and therefore shareholders) to take 
account of remuneration relinquished when leaving the former 
employer and would reflect the nature, time horizons and 
performance requirements attaching to that remuneration. 
For an internal Executive Director appointment, any variable pay 
element awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay 
out according to its terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account 
the appointment. In addition, any other ongoing remuneration 
obligations existing prior to appointment may continue, provided that 
they are put to shareholders for approval at the earliest opportunity.  Strategic Report Directors’ Report Financial Statements Additional Information
107 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report and accounts FY2014
For external and internal appointments, the Committee may agree 
that the Company will meet certain relocation expenses and 
continuing allowances as appropriate.
For the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director, 
the fee arrangement would be set in accordance with the approved 
remuneration policy at that time.
Service contracts for Executive Directors
The Committee reviews the contractual terms for new Executive 
Directors to ensure these reflect best practice.
Mr Anil Agarwal is employed under a contract of employment with 
the Company for a rolling term but which may be terminated by not 
less than six months’ notice. Provision is made in Mr Anil Agarwal’s 
contract for payment to be made in lieu of notice on termination 
which is equal to base compensation.
Mr Navin Agarwal has a letter of appointment with the Company 
which is a rolling contract and may be terminated by giving six 
months’ notice. Mr Navin Agarwal has a service agreement with Sesa 
Sterlite Limited which expires on 31 July 2018, with a notice period of 
three months or base compensation in lieu thereof.
Mr Tom Albanese has a separate letter of appointment with the 
Company and Sesa Sterlite Limited on a fixed three-year term which 
expires on 31 March 2017 , but which may be terminated by not less 
than three months’ notice. Provision is made in Mr Tom Albanese’s 
contract for payment to be made in lieu of notice on termination 
which is equal to three months’ base compensation and benefits.
It is the Group’s policy that the notice period in the Directors’ service 
contracts does not exceed 12 months.
Copies of all Executive Directors’ service contracts and the letters 
of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors are available for 
inspection during normal business hours at the registered office of 
the Company, and available for inspection at the AGM.
Payments for loss of office
The Executive Directors’ service contracts provide for pay in lieu of 
notice in respect of base compensation, as set out above.
The annual bonus may be payable with respect to the period of the 
financial year served although it will be pro-rated for time and paid at 
the normal payout date. Any share-based entitlements granted to an 
Executive Director under the Company’s share plans will be 
determined based on the relevant plan rules. 
The default treatment under the PSP is that any outstanding awards 
lapse on cessation of employment. However, in certain prescribed 
circumstances, such as death, ill-health, disability, retirement or other 
circumstances at the discretion of the Committee, ‘good leaver’ 
status may be applied. For good leavers, awards will normally vest on 
the original vesting date, subject to the satisfaction of the relevant 
performance conditions at that time and reduced pro rata to reflect 
the proportion of the performance period actually served. However, 
the Committee has discretion to determine that awards vest at an 
earlier date and/or to disapply time pro-rating, although it is 
envisaged that this would only be applied in exceptional 
circumstances. Any such incidents, where discretion is applied by the 
Committee, will be disclosed in the next year’s Annual Report on 
Remuneration.
The default treatment for deferred annual bonus awards is that any 
outstanding awards lapse on cessation of employment. However, in 
certain ‘good leaver’ circumstances (as described under the PSP 
above) awards will normally vest in full on the original vesting date.
In determining whether an executive should be treated as a good 
leaver or not, the Committee will take into account the performance 
of the individual and the reasons for their departure.
In the event of a change of control all unvested awards under the 
deferred annual bonus and long-term incentive arrangements would 
vest, to the extent that any performance conditions attached to the 
relevant awards have been achieved. The award will, other than in 
exceptional circumstances, be pro-rated for the period of the financial 
year served. 
Letters of appointment for Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment which may 
be terminated by either party by giving three months’ notice. The 
Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment set out the time 
requirements expected of them in the performance of their duties. 
Non-Executive Directors are normally expected to spend at least 
20 days per year in the performance of their duties for the Company. 
There is no provision in the letters of appointment of the Non-
Executive Directors for compensation to be paid in the event of 
early termination. 
Legacy arrangements
For avoidance of doubt, in approving this Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy Report, authority is given to the Company to honour any 
commitments entered into with current or former Directors (such as 
the vesting of past share awards) that have been disclosed to and 
approved by shareholders in this and previous Remuneration Reports. 
Details of any payments to former Directors will be set out in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise.  Directors’ Report

The Committee’s responsibilities are set out in its terms of  
reference, which are available on the Company’s website at  
www.vedantaresources.com or on request from the Company 
Secretary. The Committee’s terms of reference were reviewed and 
amended during the year. Amendments made included clarifying 
that the Committee is exclusively responsible for the selection criteria 
and appointment of any remuneration consultants and that the 
Committee may commission any reports or surveys necessary for 
carrying out its work.
The Committee’s responsibilities primarily include:
• setting the Group’s overall policy on executive and senior 
management remuneration;
• determining the remuneration packages for individual Executive 
Directors, including base compensation, performance-based 
short- and long-term incentives, pensions and other benefits;
• approving the design and operation of the Company’s share 
incentive schemes; and
• reviewing and determining the terms of the service agreements of 
the Executive Directors.
Advisers to the Committee
The Committee retained New Bridge Street (‘NBS’), a trading name of 
Aon plc, to provide independent advice on remuneration matters. NBS 
is a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants Group’s Code of 
Conduct, which requires its advice to be objective and impartial. 
Neither NBS nor any part of Aon plc provided other services to the 
Company during the year. The Committee has reviewed the 
operating processes in place at NBS and is satisfied that the advice it 
receives is objective and independent. The Committee considers 
various external reports from NBS on remuneration in the UK as well 
as India to provide detailed insights that aid remuneration decisions. 
The fees paid to NBS in respect of work carried out in 2013–14 were 
£81,659. In addition, advisers to the Committee during the year and 
their roles are set out below.
• Mr A Thirunavukkarasu (President – Group HR) advises the 
Committee on general remuneration policies and practices 
followed in India and the global market, Executive Directors’ 
remuneration and benefits and remuneration policy applicable to 
the wider employee population within the Group.
• The Executive Directors provide input on remuneration packages 
for the senior management group to ensure parity amongst senior 
management in different businesses but at similar roles. Executive 
Directors may attend meetings at the invitation of the Committee 
but no Director is present during discussions of their own 
remuneration.
• Ernst & Young LLP review and confirm the Company’s TSR 
performance in respect of the Long-Term Incentive Plan. Ernst & 
Young also provide tax and internal audit services to the Group.
Statement of shareholder voting
At the 2013 Annual General Meeting, a resolution was proposed to 
shareholders to approve the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the 
year ended 31 March 2013. This resolution received the following 
votes from shareholders: 
2013 AGM
Votes cast in favour 168,599,957 77.49%
Votes cast against 48,980,191 22.51%
Total votes cast 217,580,148 100%
Abstentions 187,876
During the year, the Committee consulted the Company’s major 
shareholders on the decision to make amendments to the structure of 
the short- and long-term incentive arrangements. Based on the 
feedback from the 2013 AGM a new policy was developed, which 
sought to address investor concerns and this was shared informally 
with major shareholders and governance bodies in early 2014. The 
majority of those consulted indicated their support and several 
investors reverted with suggestions for further revisions and the 
Committee incorporated the majority of these suggestions into the 
final policy which is set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
Report.  Strategic Report Directors’ Report Financial Statements Additional Information

1 Mr Anil Agarwal’s taxable benefits in kind include provision of a car and fuel in the UK and India for business purposes, housing benefit (in India) and club membership.
2 For the financial year ended 31 March 2014, Mr Navin Agarwal received a Sterlite salary of INR79,835,046 excluding medical and leave travel allowances, Vedanta fees of £85,000 and Cairn 
India Limited fees of INR140,000. Mr MS Mehta received a Sterlite salary of INR28,651,081 excluding medical and leave travel allowances and Vedanta fees of £85,000.
3 The value of the remuneration paid to Messrs Navin Agarwal and MS Mehta during the year differs from the base compensation levels on page 114 due to fluctuations in the INR/sterling 
exchange rates during the year.
4 Mr Navin Agarwal’s taxable benefits in kind include housing and related benefits, club membership, and use of a car and driver.
5 Mr MS Mehta’s taxable benefits in kind include use of a car and driver.
6 The fees paid to Mr Aman Mehta includes the salary of £2,494 paid by Cairn India Limited and its subsidiaries after it became a subsidiary of the Group.
7 Non-Executive Directors are reimbursed for expenses incurred while on Company business. No other benefits are provided to Non-Executive Directors.
8 All of the Group’s pension schemes are based on cash contribution and do not confirm an entitlement to a defined benefit. Pension contributions are made into the Deputy Executive Chairman 
and Chief Executive Officer’s personal pension schemes (or local provident fund) and will become payable on the retirement, normally at age 58. The Executive Chairman does not receive 
pension benefits.
9 Amounts shown for 2013–14 relate to the payment of the annual bonus for the year ended 31 March 2014. Further details of this payment are set out below.
10 Amounts shown for 2013–14 relate to the vesting of the 2013 ESOP award. The performance period for this award ended on 31 March 2014 and the performance conditions did not meet the 
threshold targets resulting in nil vesting.

1 Sustainability scorecard measures include resource use and management, stakeholder engagement and management, compliance and training, incident investigation and change 
management. 
2 For each element of the annual bonus, zero bonus is paid for nil performance increasing to full payment at stretch performance. 
The bonus payment in relation to performance in the 2013–14 financial year will be payable wholly in cash. Achievement of performance levels 
envisaged in the business plan proved to be more challenging than expected in view of the continuing mining ban, and the closure of the 
Tuticorin smelter and Lanjigarh refinery. The Remuneration Committee analysed the factors affecting the current year performance and also 
considered the initiatives put in place to address disruptions to production as well as the completion of Group simplification in August 2013.
Based on these factors the Committee awarded a bonus of 44% to each of the Executive Directors.

1 The vesting of LTIP awards is subject to measurement of the Company’s performance in terms of TSR, being the movement in the Company’s share price (plus reinvested dividends), compared 
over a three-year period from the date of grant with the performance of a specific list of companies, selected as being the Group’s main peers and competitors. The full list of companies against 
whose performance Vedanta’s TSR is measured (the ‘Comparator Group’) is as follows: 
• Anglo American
• BHP Billiton
• Rio Tinto
• GlencoreXstrata
• Vale
• Antofagasta
• Grupo Mexico
• Hindalco
• Alcoa
• Teck
 The extent to which an award vests will depend on the Company’s TSR ranking against the Comparator Group at the end of the three-year performance period. 40% of an award will vest for 
the achievement of median TSR, increasing on a straight-line basis to full vesting for the achievement of upper quartile TSR.
2 In respect of the ESOP awards made on 24 September 2012 the performance targets were partially met therefore only 36% of the grant vested as a result 50% of the shares vested on 24 
September 2013. 30% and 20% of the shares will vest on 24 September 2014 and 24 September 2015 respectively, subject to continued employment.

External appointments
The Board’s policy on external appointments is that an Executive Director may, only with the prior approval of the Board, accept an 
appointment external to the Group (other than any appointment as a Non-Executive Director to related parties or Volcan Investments Limited 
(‘Volcan’) in the case of Messrs Anil Agarwal and Navin Agarwal) of a publicly listed company anywhere and that the fees for any such 
appointment may be retained by the individual.
From 1 April 2014 Mr Tom Albanese has undertaken the role of Chief Executive Officer and is a non-executive director at Franco-Nevada 
Corporation where he will retain any remuneration paid to him. None of the other Executive Directors currently receive fees for non-executive 
appointments with other companies.

Base compensation
In setting base compensation for 2014–15, the Committee considered external market data and the increase in base compensation for the 
senior management group and the workforce generally, where the average increase across the Group will be 10%. This increase will not apply to 
the Executive Directors and accordingly base compensation will be as follows:

1 Mr Navin Agarwal’s salary increased in Indian currency terms by 9%, although currency movements have led to a reduction in the sterling equivalent versus last year. The value of the base 
compensation paid to Mr Navin Agarwal during the coming year may also differ in sterling terms to that stated here if there are fluctuations in the INR/sterling exchange rates.
2 Mr Tom Albanese has undertaken the role of Chief Executive Officer since 1 April 2014.
Annual bonus awards to be granted in 2014–15
For the 2014–15, the annual bonus opportunity will be increased to 150% of base compensation for Messrs Anil Agarwal and Navin Agarwal. 
Under the terms of his employment contract, Mr Tom Albanese’s annual bonus opportunity will be limited to 50% of base compensation for 
2014–15. The annual bonus will be based on a balanced scorecard of financial, strategic and sustainability measures and in the case of Messrs 
Anil Agarwal and Navin Agarwal will be weighted 50%, 30% and 20% respectively and in the case of Mr Tom Albanese, 60%, 20% and 20%. 
An underpin will operate where the bonus outturn may be scaled back at the discretion of the Committee if the outturn is not reflective of the 
Group’s underlying performance or warranted based on the HSE record. The Committee has chosen not to disclose, in advance, the performance 
targets for the forthcoming year as these include items which the Committee considers commercially sensitive. Full retrospective disclosure of 
the targets and performance against them will be seen in next year’s Annual Remuneration on Report.
PSP awards to be granted in 2014–15
Subject to shareholder approval of the new PSP plan, the Executive Directors’ 2014 PSP opportunity will be 150% of base compensation. The

An underpin will operate where the PSP award may be scaled back at the discretion of the Committee if vesting is not reflective of the Group’s 
underlying performance or warranted based on the HSE record. 
In order to improve the alignment of interest between the Executive Directors and shareholders, a holding period will be attached to vested PSP 
awards, requiring the vested shares to be held (net of tax) for a further two years.

The Directors’ report
Purpose of the Directors’ report
The Directors are pleased to present their Annual Report on the 
business of the Group, together with the financial statements and 
auditor’s report, for the year ended 31 March 2014. 
The purpose of the Directors’ Report is to provide shareholders with 
certain statutory information about the Company, its Directors and 
operations. The Strategic Report, informs shareholders and helps 
them assess how the Directors have performed their duty to promote 
the success of the Company. In addition, as a company listed on the 
London Stock Exchange, it is required to provide information which 
includes amongst other things, details of the Company’s share capital, 
voting rights, rules on Directors’ appointments and significant 
agreements that alter on change of control.
Strategic Report
The Strategic Report has been prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006 which requires the Company to set out a fair 
review of the business of the Group during the financial year, including 
an analysis of the position of the Group at the end of the financial 
year and the trends and factors likely to affect the future 
development, performance and position of the business. The 
Strategic Report can be found on pages 2 to 75.
Corporate Governance
In accordance with the Financial Conduct Authority’s Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules (‘DTR’) 7 .2.1 the disclosures required by DTR7 .2.2R 
to DTR7 .2.5 and DTR7 .2.7 may be found in the Corporate Governance 
Report on pages 80 to 92. The Corporate Governance Report is 
incorporated into this Directors’ report by reference. Information 
referred to in DTR7 .2.6 is located in this Directors’ Report. 
The Strategic Report and other sections of this Annual Report contain 
forward looking statements. By their nature, forward looking 
statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to 
events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in 
the future and may be beyond the Company’s ability to control or 
predict. Forward looking statements and past performance are 
therefore not guarantees of future performance. The information 
contained in the Strategic Report has been prepared on the basis of 
information and knowledge available to the Directors at the date of 
preparation and the Company does not undertake to update or revise 
the content during the year ahead.
Important events subsequent to the year end
Events since the balance sheet date are summarised in Note 42 on 
page 186 of the financial statements.
Greenhouse gas emissions reporting
Disclosures required in respect carbon dioxide emissions may be 
found in the Strategic Report on page 27 .
Dividends
The Directors recommend a final dividend for the year ended 31 
March 2014 of 39 US cents per ordinary share (2013: 37 US cents per 
ordinary share). Subject to shareholders approving this 
recommendation at the Annual General Meeting on 1 August 2014, 
the final dividend will be paid on 8 August 2014 to shareholders on 
the register of members as at 11 July 2014.
Taken together with the interim dividend of 21 US cents per ordinary 
share paid to shareholders on 19 December 2013, the total dividend 
for the year is 61 US cents per ordinary share (2013: 58 US cents per 
ordinary share).
Directors
The names, specific responsibilities and biographical details of the 
Company’s current Board of Directors are shown on pages 76 to 77 
and details of the Directors who held office during the year ended 31 
March 2014 are shown in the Corporate Governance Report on page 
80. Details of the remuneration of the Directors, their interests in the 
shares of the Company and service contracts are contained in the 
Directors’ remuneration report on pages 103 to 115.
Appointment and replacement of Directors
The Company’s Articles of Association (the ‘Articles’) specify that the 
minimum number of Directors of the Company, unless determined by 
ordinary resolution, shall be two. There is no limit on the maximum 
number of Directors. The Company or the Board may appoint any 
person to be a Director. Any Director appointed by the Board shall 
hold office only until the next general meeting and is then eligible for 
election by the shareholders. The Articles specify that at least 
one-third of the Directors, or if their number is not three or multiple of 
three, the number nearest to one-third, shall retire from office. The 
Directors to retire by rotation are those who have been longest in 
office since appointment or reappointment. However, in accordance 
with the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code all of 
the Directors will retire at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting 
and being eligible will offer themselves for re-election.
Powers of the Directors
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and the 
Company’s Articles and to any directions given by special resolution, 
the business of the Company is to be managed by the Board which 
may exercise all the powers of the Company.
Directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and indemnities
The Company purchases and maintains liability insurance for its 
Directors and officers and those of the subsidiaries of the Group, as 
permitted by the Companies Act 2006. The insurance policy does not 
provide cover where the Director has acted fraudulently or 
dishonestly. The Company believes that it is appropriate to provide 
such cover to protect Directors from innocent error as the Directors 
carry significant liability under criminal and civil law and under the UK 
Listing, Prospectus and Disclosure and Transparency Rules, and face a 
range of penalties.
In addition the Company’s Articles contain an indemnity provision in 
favour of the Directors against proceedings brought by third parties, 
subject to the Companies Act 2006, to allow the Company to pay 
legal defence costs for the Director where the Director is exonerated.
Employees
Information on the Group’s employees and its policies with respect to 
employees can be found in the Sustainable Development Report.
Political donations
It is the Board’s policy that neither Vedanta nor any of its subsidiary 
companies may, under any circumstances, make donations or  Strategic Report Directors’ Report Financial Statements Additional Information
117 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report and accounts FY2014
contributions to political organisations within the United Kingdom or 
European Union. In exceptional circumstances, where such political 
donations or contributions are to be paid in the United Kingdom and 
European Union, and if deemed necessary for legitimate business 
reasons, they will not be made without the approval of the Board and 
shareholders at the general meeting.
However in accordance with the normal accepted practice in India of 
making political donations in respect of elections, the Group made 
political donations of US$3.7 million (2013: US$0.97 million) either 
through a trust or directly in respect of the Indian general election. 
The Board believes that supporting the political process in India will 
encourage and strengthen the democratic process.
Research and development
The Group’s business units carry out research and development 
activities necessary to further their operations.

Company’s current Articles are available for inspection at the 
Company’s registered office.
Amendments to the Articles of Association
The Company’s Articles of Association may be amended only by 
special resolution passed by the Company’s shareholders.
Share capital
As at 31 March 2014 the issued share capital of the Company was 
comprised of 298,182,135 ordinary shares of US$0.10 each and 
50,000 deferred shares of £1 each.
Rights and obligations attaching to shares
The rights and obligations attaching to the ordinary and deferred shares 
are set out in the Articles. Details of the authorised and issued share 
capital together with movements in the Company’s issued share capital 
during the year are shown in Note 34 of the financial statements.
6,904,995 ordinary shares of US$0.10 each were issued on the 
conversion of certain convertible bonds issued by one of the 
Company’s subsidiaries. These 6,904,995 ordinary shares are held 
through a global depository receipt and carry no voting rights. Apart 
from the above, each ordinary share carries the right to one vote at 
general meetings of the Company. Holders of deferred shares are not 
entitled to attend, speak or vote at any general meeting of the 
Company, nor are they entitled to the payment of any dividend or to 
receive notice of general meetings.
Further details of the rights attaching to the deferred shares are set 
out in the Articles and summarised in Note 34 of the financial 
statements.
Variation of rights
Subject to the provisions of the Act, the rights attached to any class 
may be varied with the consent of the holders of three-quarters in 
nominal value of the issued shares of the class or with the sanction of 
an extraordinary resolution passed at a separate general meeting of 
the holders of the shares of the class.
Deadlines for exercising voting rights
Votes may be exercised at general meetings in relation to the business 
being transacted either in person, by proxy or, in relation to corporate 
members, by corporate representative. The Articles provide that forms 
of proxy shall be submitted not less than 48 hours before the time 
appointed for holding the meeting or adjourned meeting.
Restrictions on voting and the transfer of shares
No member shall be entitled to vote at a general meeting or at a 
separate meeting of the holders of any class of shares in the capital of 
the Company, either in person or by proxy, in respect of any share held 
by him unless all monies payable by him in respect of that share have 
been fully paid. Furthermore, no shareholder shall be entitled to 
attend or vote either personally or by proxy at a general meeting or at 
a separate meeting of the holders of that class of shares or on a poll if 
he has been served with a notice after failing to provide the Company 
with information concerning interests in his shares that is required to 
be provided under the Act.
Issue of shares
Under the Articles, the Company has authority to allot new shares in 
the Company. Such authority would be exercised having regard to the 
Statement of Principles published by the Pre-emption Group.
Shares held in uncertificated form
Subject to the provisions of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 
2001, the Board may permit the holding of shares in any class of 
shares in uncertificated form and the transfer of title to shares in that 
class by means of a relevant system and may determine that any 
class of shares shall cease to be a participating security.
Dividends and distributions
Subject to the provisions of the Act, the Company may by ordinary 
resolution declare dividends in accordance with the respective rights 
of the members, but no dividend shall exceed the amount 
recommended by the Board. The Board may pay interim dividends if 
it appears to the Board that they are justified by the profits of the 
Company available for distribution. The treasury shares directly held 
by the Company are not entitled to receive a dividend. Directors’ Report
118 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report and accounts FY2014
Dividends may be declared and paid in any currency or currencies 
that the Board shall determine. The Board may also determine the 
exchange rate and the relevant date for determining the value of the 
dividend in any currency.
Purchase of the Company’s own shares
At the end of the year, the Directors had authority, under a 
shareholders’ resolution dated 1 August 2013, to make market 
purchases of up to approximately 10% of the Company’s ordinary 
shares.
The authority expires at the conclusion of the Company’s 2014 
Annual General Meeting or on 1 October 2014, whichever is the 
earlier. A resolution to obtain a further authority will be proposed at 
the 2014 Annual General Meeting.
During the year the Company did not purchase any shares under its 
previously announced share buyback programme.
As at 31 March 2014, the Company held a total of 24,206,816 
ordinary shares in treasury equal to 8.12% (FY2013: 8.13%) of the 
issued share capital.
Agreements: Change of control
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or terminate 
upon a change of control of the Company such as commercial 
contracts, bank loan agreements, and capital market borrowing. The 
following are considered to be significant in terms of their likely impact 
on the business of the Group as a whole:
1 The US$1.25 billion 5.50% guaranteed convertible bonds issued in 
July 2009 and the US$883 million 4.0% guaranteed convertible 
bonds (current outstanding US$73 million) issued in March 2010, 
where a change of control gives investors the option to require the 
issuer to redeem their bonds at the principal amount, together with 
any accrued and unpaid interest, or convert their bonds at an 
adjusted exchange price for a certain period following the relevant 
event. 
2 The US$750 million 6.75% bonds due in 2016, US$750 million 
9.5% bonds due 2018, US$1,200 million 6% bonds due in 2019, 
US$900 million 8.25% bonds due in 2021, US$500 million 7 .125% 
bonds due in 2023 where a change of control requires the 
Company to make an offer to purchase all of the outstanding 
bonds at 101 % of the principal amount together with any accrued 
and unpaid interest with a rating decline. 
3 In the financing arrangements for the acquisition of Cairn India 
Limited and various other financing facilities entered into by the 
Group where a change of control gives the majority lenders the 
right to declare the loans immediately payable.
All of the Company’s share plans contain provisions relating to a 
change of control. Outstanding awards and options would normally 
vest and become exercisable on a change of control, subject to the 
satisfaction of any performance conditions.
There is no contract between the Company and its Directors or 
employees that provide for compensation for loss of office or 
employment that occurs because of a takeover bid.
Disclosure of information to auditors
In accordance with section 418 of the Companies Act 2006, each 
Director who held office at the date of approval of this Directors’ 
Report confirms that:
• so far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit information of 
which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and 
• he has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a Director 
to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of that information. 
Reappointment of auditors
A resolution to reappoint the auditor, Deloitte LLP , will be proposed at 
the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. The reappointment of 
Deloitte LLP has been approved by the Audit Committee, which will 
also be responsible for determining the auditors’ remuneration on 
behalf of the Board, subject to the approval of shareholders at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Policy on derivatives and financial instruments
An explanation of the Group’s financial management objectives and 
policies together with details of the Group’s exposure to price risk, 
credit risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk appears in Note 28  
to the financial statements.
Going concern
The Group has a strong Balance Sheet that gives sufficient headroom 
to raise further debt should the need arise. The Group’s current ratings 
from Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch are BB, Ba1 and BB+ 
respectively, with Negative outlook from Standard and poor’s and 
Stable outlook from both Moody’s and Fitch. These ratings support 
the necessary financial leverage and access to debt or equity markets 
at competitive terms, taking into consideration current market 
conditions. The Group generally maintains a healthy liquidity, gearing 
ratio and retains flexibility in the financing structure to alter the ratio 
when the need arises. As a consequence, the Directors believe that 
the Group is well placed to manage its financing risks.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.
Annual General Meeting
The eleventh Annual General Meeting of the Company will be held on 
1 August 2014 at 3pm. The Notice convening the Annual General 
Meeting accompanies this Annual Report and sets out details of the 
business to be considered thereof.

Directors’ responsibilities statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report  
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law  
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required to 
prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by 
the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have 
elected to prepare the parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the accounts 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for 
that period. 
In preparing the parent Company financial statements, the Directors 
are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
• state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless 
it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in 
business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International 
Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that 
provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; 
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions 
on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and
• make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant 
financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken 
as a whole;
• the strategic report includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Company and 
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face; and
• the annual report and financial statements, taken as a whole, are 
fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy.

Opinion on financial statements of Vedanta Resources plc 
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the 
Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 March 2014 
and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise the Consolidated Income 
Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, 
the Consolidated and Parent Company Balance Sheets, the 
Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the Consolidated Statement of 
Changes in Equity, and the related notes 1 to 58. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the 
Group financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in the preparation of the parent company financial 
statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Going concern
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the directors’ 
statement contained within the Strategic Report that the Group is a 
going concern. We confirm that:
• we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern 
basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is 
appropriate; and
• we have not identified any material uncertainties that may cast 
significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, 
this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue 
as a going concern.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are 
those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the 
allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the 
engagement team:
Risk 
Impairments
There is a risk associated with the assessment of the recoverable 
amount of certain operating assets and development projects, 
specifically the Lanjigarh expansionary program within the Aluminium 
business unit which remains on hold pending environmental 
clearances being obtained and the operations in Goa and Karnataka 
within the Iron Ore business unit subject during the year to state-wide 
bans on iron ore mining. 
For more information see note 2b in the financial statements that 
provide further details and disclosures to this matter.
How the scope of our audit responded to the risk 
We have:
• reviewed management’s assessment as to whether indicators of 
impairment exist for operating assets and development projects, 
specifically, in relation to the Lanjigarh expansionary project and 
the iron ore operations in Goa and Karnataka;
• obtained and assessed the valuation models used to determine the 
value in use or fair value less costs to sell of the relevant asset by 
challenging the key assumptions made by management in relation 
to these models, including the expected timings of approvals and 
renewal of licences, commodity prices, discount rate applied, source 
of reserve and production estimates, potential resources to reserves 
conversion ratios, exchange rates, and operating and capital 
expenditure estimates, by reference to independent third party 
evidence and consultation with operational management. 
• assessed whether assumptions had been determined and applied 
on a consistent basis across the Group; and
• assessed the procedures performed by management during the 
year to progress the approval of environmental clearances.
Revenue recognition
IAS 18 Revenue and the Group’s revenue recognition policy permits 
revenue to be recognised only when the risks and rewards of 
ownership have transferred from the seller to the buyer. 
The risk is related to:
• inappropriate recognition of sales made on a bill and hold or 
consignment basis; 
• incorrect valuation of provisionally priced sales (where the pricing is 
only finalised based on market prices subsequent to the balance 
sheet date);
• the value of regulated sales made to the Grid Corporation of 
Odisha Limited (“Gridco”) where a dispute regarding the 
interpretation of the tariff agreement is pending appelate tribunal 
resolution; and 
• the calculation of Cairn’s oil and gas sales on an entitlement basis.
We have reviewed the application of the Group’s revenue recognition 
policy and:
• reviewed the terms of bill and hold agreements to conclude on the 
point at which risk and reward transfer takes place;
• recalculated the value of provisional pricing adjustments and 
validating the assumptions used to third party data where possible;
• challenged management in respect of whether the Gridco trade 
receivables are recoverable through the review of state regulatory 
commission and the appellate tribunal rulings, review of the 
underlying power purchase agreements and the external legal 
opinions received and the involvement of Deloitte power specialists 
to re-assess the tariff calculations; and
• reviewed the terms of Cairn’s profit sharing agreement and tested 
the underlying entitlement calculations.
Litigation, environmental and regulatory risk
Given the significant number of legal claims a risk exists that the 
Group may not have adequately provided for liabilities. There is also a 
risk of the Group’s reputation being brought into disrepute resulting in 
financial and reputational damage. The Group continues to be 
involved in a high number of legal claims. As it is not unusual for 
claims to remain outstanding for a number of years, there has been a 
resultant steady increase in the number of cases over time with the 
regulatory environment becoming increasingly complex and 
regulators focusing on the environmental and social impacts. These 
ongoing claims, environmental and regulatory enquiries are a threat 
to the future operations as well as the Group’s current financial 
performance and reputation. Strategic Report Directors’ Report Financial Statements Additional Information

For more information see notes 37 and 41 in the financial statements 
that provide further details and disclosures to this matter.
We have: 
• challenged management regarding their assessment of the 
probability of success in these cases, and the magnitude of any 
potential loss;
• focused our procedures on the terms and conditions of mining 
licenses and performed procedures to gain assurance over the 
compliance and validity of all mining licences and environmental 
clearances; and 
• inspected external legal opinions and other evidence that supports 
factual information in management’s responses. 
We have considered the impact of these procedures on the financial 
statements and whether the disclosures therein are in accordance 
with IAS 37 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets.
Taxation
There is a risk the Group’s aggregated taxation exposure in all 
jurisdictions, including the exposure to withholding taxes following 
past acquisitions, financing and transfer pricing arrangements, sales 
taxes and recognition of deferred taxation assets and liabilities, may 
not have been adequately valued and disclosed in the financial 
statements due to the complexities, timescales for resolution and the 
need to negotiate with various tax authorities.
For more information see notes 12, 30 and 37 in the financial 
statements that provide further details and disclosures to this matter.
We reviewed all potential taxation exposures within the Group and, 
through discussions with the Group’s taxation department, the tax 
specialists within the audit team and review of relevant 
documentation, including external legal advice, we evaluated the 
appropriateness of the provisions raised and contingent liability 
disclosures. 
We considered, in the context of our tax specialists’ prior experience 
of similar issues, the Group‘s exposure to withholding taxes following 
past acquisitions, the current tax exposure following the Group’s 
internal restructuring, transfer pricing arrangements and deferred 
taxation assets and liabilities recognised to assess whether these 
matters were appropriately reflected and disclosed in the financial 
statements.
The Audit Committee’s consideration of these risks is set out on pages 
93 to 97 .
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the 
context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and not to 
express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion 
on the financial statements is not modified with respect to any of the 
risks described above, and we do not express an opinion on these 
individual matters.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the 
financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or 
influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit 
work and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the Group to be US$75 million, which is 
approximately 5% of normalised pre-tax profit and below 1 % of 
equity. Pre-tax profit has been normalised by adjusting for specific 
one-off items: an estimated pre-tax profit for the suspended 
operations impacted by the mining bans in Goa and Karnataka and 
the interest expense associated with the expansionary programs on 
hold which would ordinarily be capitalised. Normalised pre-tax profit is 
considered a more appropriate and less volatile measure reflecting 
the underlying scale of the Group.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the 
Committee all audit differences in excess of US$1.5 million, as well as 
differences below that threshold which, in our view, warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit 
Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing 
the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
An overview of the scope of our audit
  Financial Statements
122 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report and accounts FY2014
Independent Auditor’ s Report continued 
T o the Members of Vedanta Resources plc
Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the 
Group and its environment, including group-wide controls, and 
assessing the risks of material misstatement at the group level. Based 
on that assessment, we focused our group audit scope primarily on 
the audit work at 15 locations. Eleven of these were subject to a full 
audit, whilst the remaining four were subject to an audit of specified 
account balances where the extent of our testing was based on our 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement and of the 
materiality of the Group’s operations at those locations. These 15 
locations represent the principal business units and account for 100% 
of the Group’s net assets, revenue and profit before tax offset on 
consolidation by losses elsewhere in the Group. They were also 
selected to provide an appropriate basis for undertaking audit work to 
address the risks of material misstatement identified above. Our audit 
work at the 15 locations was executed at levels of materiality 
applicable to each individual entity which were lower than Group 
materiality. 
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and 
carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there 
were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated 
financial information not subject to audit or audit of specified account 
balances.
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned 
visits that has been designed so that the Senior Statutory Auditor or a 
senior member of the Group audit team visits each of the locations 
where the group audit scope was focused at least once every five 
years. At each six month reporting date we include the component 
audit partners and teams in our team briefing, discuss their risk 
assessment, and review documentation of the findings from their 
work.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 
2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in 
our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our 
opinion certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration have not been 
made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited 
is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. We have 
nothing to report arising from these matters.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of the 
Corporate Governance Statement relating to the company’s 
compliance with nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the annual 
report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial 
statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of 
performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified 
any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the audit 
and the directors’ statement that they consider the annual report is 
fair, balanced and understandable and whether the annual report 
appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the 
audit committee which we consider should have been disclosed. We 
confirm that we have not identified any such inconsistencies or 
misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, 
the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for 
Auditors. We also comply with International Standard on Quality 
Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to 
ensure that our quality control procedures are effective, understood 
and applied. Our quality controls and systems include our dedicated 
professional standards review team, strategically focused second 
partner reviews and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a 
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have 
formed. Strategic Report Directors’ Report Financial Statements Additional Information
123 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report and accounts FY2014
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the 
Group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of 
significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the 
overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read 
all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to 
identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements 
and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect 
based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by 
us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.

2 Under Indian law, a general reserve is created through an annual transfer of net income to general reserves at a specified percentage in accordance with applicable regulations. The purpose of 
these transfers is to ensure that the total dividend distribution is less than the total distributable results for that year. Transfer to General reserves also includes US$2.5 million of debenture 
redemption reserve and remeasurement reserve related to net defined benefit liability of US$1.1 million.
3 In December 2012, the Group acquired remaining 49% stake in Western Cluster Limited (‘WCL ’) at a consideration of US$33.5 million. This resulted in increase in Group’s stake in WCL from 51 % 
to 100%. The increase has been accounted in the financial statements as an equity transaction. The carrying amount of the non-controlling interest has been adjusted to reflect the change in 
Group’s interest in the Net assets of WCL.
4 The merger reserve arose on incorporation of the Company during the year ended 31 March 2004. The investment in Twin Star had a carrying amount value of US$20.0 million in the accounts 
of Volcan. As required by the Companies act 1985, Section 132, upon issue of 156,000,000 ordinary shares to Volcan, Twin Star’s issued share capital and share premium account have been 
eliminated and a merger reserve of US$4.4 million arose, being the difference between the carrying value of the investment in Twin Star in Volcan’s accounts and the nominal value of the 
shares issued to Volcan.

This amendment to IAS 1, requires entities to separate items presented in other comprehensive income that can be recycled in income 
statements at a future period separately from items that will not be recycled in future periods together with their tax effect. These amendments 
have been applied retrospectively and affected the presentation of items of comprehensive income and had no impact on the financial 
performance of the Group.
IAS 19: Employee benefits – (revised)
The revised IAS 19 standard on employee benefits has introduced amendments to the accounting for defined benefits plans. It requires all 
actuarial gains and losses arising on defined benefits plans to be recognised immediately in other comprehensive income and requires the 
expected return on plan assets which is recognised in the income statement to be calculated based on the rate used to discount the defined 
benefit obligation. This differs from the Group’s previous policy which was to charge any actuarial gain/losses in the income statement. Hence 
the Group has recognised all actuarial gains and losses arising on defined benefits plans to other comprehensive income. 
The Group has applied the standard retrospectively in accordance with the transitional provisions. As a result, the adoption of the amendment in 
IAS 19 has not materially impacted the financial statement. Impact on the Group financial statement is set out in Note 40.
IFRS 7: Disclosure – Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities
IFRS 7 requires additional disclosures in connection with assets and liabilities which are offset under a master netting agreement. The 
amendments to IFRS 7 have not impacted the Group’s financial statements.
IFRS 13: Fair value measurement
IFRS 13 provides for a framework for measuring fair value when such measurements are required or permitted by other standards. IFRS 13 also 
requires specific disclosures on fair values. These disclosures replace some of the existing disclosure requirements in other standards, including 
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures. The application of IFRS 13 has not materially affected the fair value measurements carried out by the 
Group. The adoption of IFRS 13 resulted in additional disclosure in the financial statements. The impact and disclosures are set out in Note 28 to 
the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2014. Financial Statements

1. Presentation of financial statements continued
IFRIC 20: Stripping costs in the production phase of a surface mine
IFRIC 20 specifies the accounting for costs associated with waste removal (stripping) during the production phase of a surface mine. When the 
benefit from the stripping activity is realised in the current period, the stripping costs are accounted for as the cost of inventory. When the 
benefit is the improved access to ore in future periods, the costs are recognised as a non-current asset, if certain criteria are met. After initial 
recognition, the stripping activity asset is depreciated on a systematic basis (unit of production method) over the expected useful life of the 
identified component of the ore body that becomes more accessible as a result of the stripping activity.
As a result of adoption of IFRIC 20, the two key changes to the Group’s existing accounting policy is upon initial recognition of the stripping 
assets and its depreciation based on a unit of production basis compared to recognising it in the income statement. Accordingly, the application 
of IFRIC 20 has resulted in increased capitalisation of stripping costs and depreciation and consequential adjustment to cost of sales and 
inventories. Comparatives numbers have been restated to give the retrospective impact of adopting IFRIC 20. The impact is given in Note 40.
The Group has early adopted the following accounting standards and amendments which are endorsed by EU but is effective for the 
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014:
IFRS 10: Consolidated financial statements
IFRS 10 establishes the principal for the preparation and presentation of consolidated financial statements with a new definition of control. The 
investor controls an investee when it is exposed to, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has ability to 
affect those returns through its power over the investee. This definition replaces the pervious guidance on control and consolidation under IAS 
27 (Separate Financial Statements) and SIC 12 (Consolidation-Special Purpose Entities). IFRS 10 does not have any impact on the financial 
statements of the Group.
IFRS 11: Joint arrangements
IFRS 11 (Joint Arrangements) replaced IAS 31 (Interest in Joint Ventures) and requires investments in joint arrangements classified as either joint 
ventures or joint operations based on the rights and obligations of the parties to the arrangement. Under IFRS 11, investments in joint 
arrangements are classified as either joint ventures or joint operations based on the rights and obligations of the parties to the arrangement. In 
a joint venture, the parties sharing joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets and must account for their interests in the 
arrangement using the equity method. In a joint operation, the parties have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities and must 
account for the assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses for which they have rights or obligations including their share of such items held or 
incurred jointly. The standard removes the option to account for joint ventures using proportionate consolidation and instead joint 
arrangements that meet the definition of a joint venture under IFRS 11 must be accounted for using the equity method. IFRS 11 does not have 
any impact on the financial statements of the Group.
IFRS 12: Disclosure of interest in other entities 
IFRS 12 applies to entities that have an interest in a subsidiary, a joint arrangement, an associate or unconsolidated structured entities. IFRS 12 
requires an entity to disclose information that enables users of financial statements to evaluate the nature and risk associated with the interest 
in other entities. These disclosures are set out within the relevant notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2014.
Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the going concern basis of accounting. The use of this basis of accounting 
takes into consideration the Group’s current and forecast financing position, additional details of which are provided in the Going Concern 
section of the Strategic Report. 
Parent Company financial statements
The financial statements of the parent Company, Vedanta Resources plc, incorporated in the United Kingdom, have been prepared in 
accordance with UK GAAP , UK accounting presentation and UK company law. The Company Balance Sheet is presented in Note 46.
2(a) Accounting policies
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
The consolidated financial information incorporates the results of the Company and all its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’), being the companies that it 
controls. Control is evidenced where the Company is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has 
the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Power is demonstrated through existing rights that give the ability to direct 
relevant activities, which significantly affect the entity returns. 
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent Company. Where necessary, adjustments are 
made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with accounting policies used by the Group.
For non-wholly owned subsidiaries, a share of the profit for the financial year and net assets is attributed to the non-controlling interests as 
shown in the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income and consolidated balance sheet. 
Notes to the Financial Statements
continued Strategic Report Directors’ Report Financial Statements Additional Information
133 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report and accounts FY2014
2(a) Accounting policies continued
For acquisitions of additional interests in subsidiaries, where there is no change in control, the Group recognises a reduction to the non-
controlling interest of the respective subsidiary with the difference between this figure and the cash paid, inclusive of transaction fees, being 
recognised in equity. In addition, upon dilution of controlling interests the difference between the cash received from sale or listing of the 
subsidiary shares and the increase to non-controlling interest is also recognised in equity. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of 
during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, 
as appropriate. 
All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-Group transactions, have been eliminated in full. 
Unrealised losses are eliminated unless costs cannot be recovered. 
Joint arrangements
A joint arrangement is an arrangement of which two or more parties have joint control. Joint control is considered when there is contractually 
agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of 
the parties sharing control.
The Group has joint operations within its oil & gas segment, the Group participates in several unincorporated joint operations which involve the 
joint control of assets used in oil & gas exploration and producing activities. The Group accounts for its share of assets, liabilities, income and 
expenditure of joint ventures in which the Group holds an interest, classified in the appropriate balance sheet and income statement headings. 
In addition, where the Group acts as operator to the joint venture, the gross liabilities and receivables (including amounts due to or from 
non-operating partners) of the joint operations are included in the Group balance sheet.
Restatement 
The Group has restated the financial performance and position for the year ended 31 March 2013 to give effect of the new accounting 
pronouncements that became applicable with effect from the accounting period beginning from 1 April 2013 (Note 40). 
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents the net invoice value of goods and services provided to third parties after deducting discounts, volume rebates, outgoing 
sales taxes and duties, and are recognised when all significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset sold are transferred to the customer or 
services have been provided. 
Certain of the Group’s sales contracts provide for provisional pricing based on the price on the London Metal Exchange Limited (‘LME’), as 
specified in the contract, when shipped. Final settlement of the prices is based on the applicable price for a specified future period. The 
Company’s provisionally priced sales are marked to market using the relevant forward prices for the future period specified in the contract with a 
corresponding adjustment to revenue.
Revenue from oil, gas and condensate sales represent the Group’s share of oil, gas and condensate production, recognised on a direct 
entitlement basis, and tariff income received for third party use of operating facilities and pipelines in accordance with agreements.
• Revenue from holding certificate contracts is recognised when goods have been delivered to a distribution warehouse or has been identified 
and kept separately, have been inspected by a nominee of the buyer and cash has been received. Under these arrangements, revenue is 
recognised once legal title has passed and all significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset sold are transferred to the customer.
• Revenue from the sale of power is recognised when the electricity is delivered and measured based on contractually agreed tariff rates as 
approved by the electricity regulatory authorities.
• Revenues from sale of material by-products are recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods sold are 
transferred to the customer.
• Dividend income is recognised when the shareholders’ right to receive payment is established.
• Interest income is recognised on an accrual basis in the income statement.
Special items
Special items are those items that management considers, by virtue of their size or incidence (including but not limited to voluntary retirement 
schemes and acquisition and restructuring related costs), should be disclosed separately to ensure that the financial information allows an 
understanding of the underlying performance of the business in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods. Such items are 
material by nature or amount to the year’s result and require separate disclosure in accordance with IAS 1 paragraph 97 . The determination as 
to which items should be disclosed separately requires a degree of judgement.
Business combinations
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold during the year are consolidated for the periods from, or to, the date on which control passed. 
Acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method. The acquirer’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the 
conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 (revised 2008) Business Combinations are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
To the extent that such excess purchase consideration relates to the acquisition of mining properties and leases, that amount is capitalised 
within property, plant and equipment as ‘mining properties and leases’. To the extent that such excess purchase consideration relates to the 
acquisition of oil & gas properties, that amount is capitalised within property, plant and equipment as ‘exploratory and evaluation assets’. Other 
excess purchase consideration relating to the acquisition of subsidiaries is capitalised as goodwill. Goodwill arising on acquisitions is reviewed for 
impairment at least annually.  Financial Statements
134 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report and accounts FY2014
2(a) Accounting policies continued
Where the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities exceed the cost of acquisition, the surplus is credited to the income statement in the 
period of acquisition.
Where it is not possible to complete the determination of fair values by the date on which the first post-acquisition financial statements are 
approved, a provisional assessment of fair values is made and any adjustments required to those provisional fair values, and the corresponding 
adjustments to purchased goodwill, are finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date. 
The interest of non-controlling shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the non-controlling shareholder’s proportion of the net assets 
or proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. This accounting choice is made on a transaction-
by-transaction basis.
Acquisition expenses are charged to the income statement in line with IFRS 3 Business Combinations (revised 2008).
If the Group acquires a group of assets or equity in a company that does not constitute a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3 
Business Combinations (2008 revised), the cost of the acquired group of assets or equity is allocated to the individual identifiable assets 
acquired based on their relative fair value.
Intangible assets
Intangibles assets are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. The Group determines the 
amortisation period as the period over which the future economic benefits will flow to Group after taking into account all relevant facts and 
circumstance. Amortisation method, residual values and estimated useful life of intangible assets are reviewed annually and more frequently if 
events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The Group don’t have any intangible assets for which useful life is indefinite.
Intangible assets arising out of service concession arrangements are accounted for as intangible assets where the Company has a contractual 
right to charge users of services when the projects are completed and is measured at the cost of such construction services completed. Such 
assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the balance of licence period, usually between 3 to 30 years.
Property, plant and equipment
Relating to mineral assets – mining properties and leases
The costs of mining properties and leases, which include the costs of acquiring and developing mining properties and mineral rights, are 
capitalised as property, plant and equipment under the heading ‘Mining properties and leases’ in the year in which they are incurred.
When a decision is taken that a mining property is viable for commercial production (i.e. when the Group determines that the mining property 
will provide sufficient and sustainable returns relative to the risk and decides to proceed with the development), all further pre-production 
primary development expenditure other than land, buildings, plant and equipment is capitalised as part of the cost of the mining property until 
the mining property is capable of commercial production. From that point, capitalised mining properties and lease costs are amortised on a 
unit-of-production basis over the total estimated remaining commercial reserves of each property or group of properties.
Exploration and evaluation assets acquired are recognised as assets at their cost of acquisition subject to meeting the commercial production 
criteria mentioned above and are subject to impairment review on an annual basis.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure incurred after obtaining the right to mine or the legal right to explore, is capitalised as property, plant 
and equipment and stated at cost less the impairment. Exploration and evaluation assets are transferred to property, plant and equipment 
when the technical feasibility and commercial viability has been determined. Exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment 
and impairment loss, if any, is recognised prior to reclassification. Exploration and evaluation expenditure incurred prior to obtaining the mining 
right or the legal right to explore are expensed as incurred.
The stripping cost incurred during the production phase of a surface mine is deferred to the extent the current period stripping cost exceeds the 
average period stripping cost over the life of the mine and recognised as an asset if such cost provides a benefit in terms of improved access to 
ore in future periods and certain criteria are met. Deferred stripping costs are included in mining properties within property, plant and equipment 
and disclosed as a part of mining properties. After initial recognition, the stripping activity asset is depreciated on a unit of production method 
over the expected useful life of the identified component of the ore body.
In circumstances where a mining property is abandoned, the cumulative capitalised costs relating to the property are written-off in the period in 
which it occurs i.e. when the Group determines that the mining property will provide sufficient and sustainable returns relative to the risks and 
the Group decides to proceed with the mine development.
Commercial reserves are proved and probable reserves as defined by the ‘JORC’ Code and ‘SAMREC’ Code. Changes in the commercial reserves 
affecting unit of production calculations are dealt with prospectively over the revised remaining reserves.

135 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report and accounts FY2014
2(a) Accounting policies continued
Relating to oil & gas assets – Exploration & evaluation assets and developing/producing assets
For oil & gas assets a successful efforts-based accounting policy is followed. Costs incurred prior to obtaining the legal rights to explore an area 
are expensed immediately to the income statement. Expenditure incurred on the acquisition of a licence interest is initially capitalised on a 
licence-by-licence basis. Costs are held, are not amortised or depreciated, within exploration and evaluation assets until such time as the 
exploration phase on the licence area is complete or commercial reserves have been discovered. 
Exploration expenditure incurred in the process of determining oil & gas exploration targets is capitalised initially within property, plant and 
equipment, exploration and evaluation assets and subsequently allocated to drilling activities. Exploration drilling costs are initially capitalised 
on a well-by-well basis until the success or otherwise of the well has been established. The success or failure of each exploration effort is judged 
on a well-by-well basis. Drilling costs are written-off on completion of a well unless the results indicate that hydrocarbon reserves exist and there 
is a reasonable prospect that these reserves are commercial. 
Following appraisal of successful exploration wells, if commercial reserves are established and technical feasibility for extraction demonstrated, 
then the related capitalised exploration costs are transferred into a single field cost centre within property, plant and equipment – development/
producing assets after testing for impairment. Where results of exploration drilling indicate the presence of hydrocarbons which are ultimately 
not considered commercially viable, all related costs are written-off to the income statement. 
All costs incurred after the technical feasibility and commercial viability of producing hydrocarbons has been demonstrated are capitalised 
within property, plant and equipment – development/producing assets on a field-by-field basis. Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only 
where it either enhances the economic benefits of the development/producing asset or replaces part of the existing development/producing 
asset. Any remaining costs associated with the part replaced are expensed.
Net proceeds from any disposal of an exploration asset are initially credited against the previously capitalised costs. Any surplus proceeds are 
credited to the income statement. Net proceeds from any disposal of development/producing assets are credited against the previously 
capitalised cost. A gain or loss on disposal of a development/producing asset is recognised in the income statement to the extent that the net 
proceeds exceed or are less than the appropriate portion of the net capitalised costs of the asset.
Other property, plant and equipment
The initial cost of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, and 
any directly attributable costs of bringing an asset to working condition and location for its intended use, including relevant borrowing costs and 
any expected costs of decommissioning. Expenditure incurred after the property, plant and equipment have been put into operation, such as 
repairs and maintenance, are charged to the income statement in the period in which the costs are incurred. Major shut-down and overhaul 
expenditure is capitalised as the activities undertaken improve the economic benefits expected to arise from the asset. 
Assets in the course of construction
Assets in the course of construction are capitalised in the assets under construction account. At the point when an asset is operating at 
management’s intended use, the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment and 
depreciation commences (see below). Costs associated with the commissioning of an asset and any obligatory decommissioning costs are 
capitalised where the asset is available for use but incapable of operating at normal levels until a period of commissioning has been completed. 
Revenue generated from production during the trial period is capitalised. Borrowing costs and certain foreign exchange gains or losses are in 
certain circumstances capitalised in the cost of the asset under construction. This policy is set out under ‘Borrowing Costs’.
Depreciation and amortisation
Relating to mining properties
Mining properties and other assets in the course of development or construction, freehold land and goodwill are not depreciated or amortised. 
Capitalised mining properties and lease costs are amortised once commercial production commences, as described in ‘Property, plant and 
equipment – mining properties and leases’. Leasehold land and buildings are depreciated over the period of the lease or, if shorter, their useful 
economic life.
Relating to oil & gas assets
All expenditure carried within each field is amortised from the commencement of production on a unit of production basis, which is the ratio of 
oil & gas production in the period to the estimated quantities of commercial reserves at the end of the period plus the production in the period, 
generally on a field-by-field basis or group of fields which are reliant on common infrastructure. 
Commercial reserves are proven and probable oil & gas reserves, which are defined as the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and 
natural gas liquids which geological, geophysical and engineering data demonstrate with a specified degree of certainty to be recoverable in 
future years from known reservoirs and which are considered commercially producible. There should be a 50% statistical probability that the 
actual quantity of recoverable reserves will be more than the amount estimated as proven and probable reserves and a 50% statistical 
probability that it will be less.
Costs used in the unit of production calculation comprise the net book value of capitalised costs plus the estimated future field development 
costs required to access commercial reserves. Changes in the estimates of commercial reserves or future field development costs are dealt with 
prospectively. Financial Statements
136 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report and accounts FY2014
2(a) Accounting policies continued
Others 
Other buildings, plant and equipment, office equipment and fixtures, and motor vehicles are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
any provision for impairment. Depreciation commences when the assets are ready for their intended use. Depreciation is provided at rates 
calculated to write-off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life, as follows:
Buildings operations 30 years
Administration  50 years
Plant and equipment 10–30 years
Office equipment and fixtures 3–20 years
Motor vehicles  9–11 years
Major overhaul costs are depreciated over the estimated life of the economic benefit derived from the overhaul. The carrying amount of the 
remaining previous overhaul cost is charged to the income statement if the next overhaul is undertaken earlier than the previously estimated life 
of the economic benefit. 
Property, plant and equipment held for sale or which is part of a disposal Group held for sale is not depreciated. Property, plant and equipment 
held for sale is carried at the lower of its carrying value and fair value less disposal cost and is presented separately on the face of the balance 
sheet.
Impairment
Financial assets 
A financial asset is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is 
considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows 
of that asset. 
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount, and 
the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate. An impairment loss in respect of an 
available-for-sale financial asset is calculated by reference to its fair value. 
Significant financial assets are tested for impairment on an individual basis. The remaining financial assets are assessed collectively in groups 
that share similar credit risk characteristics. All impairment losses are recognised in the consolidated statements of income. Any cumulative loss 
in respect of an available-for-sale financial asset recognised previously in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income is transferred to 
the consolidated statements of income on recognition of impairment. An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to 
an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised. For financial assets measured at amortised cost and available-for-sale financial 
assets that are debt securities, the reversal is recognised in the consolidated statements of income. For available-for-sale financial assets that are 
equity securities, the change in fair value is recognised directly in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 
The allowance accounts in respect of trade and other receivables are used to record impairment losses unless the Company is satisfied that no 
recovery of the amount owing is possible; at that point the amounts are considered irrecoverable and are written-off against the financial asset 
directly.
Non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable and, as noted above, the carrying amount of goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually. 
When performing an impairment test, an assessment is made to determine whether the asset’s carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount. 
Whenever the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss is charged to the income statement. 
The Group reviews the residual value and useful life of an asset at least at each financial year-end and, if expectations differ from previous 
estimates, the change is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate. 
For mining properties and leases, oil & gas assets, other investments and goodwill, the recoverable amount of an asset is determined on the 
basis of its value in use, being the present value of estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of an asset and from 
its disposal at the end of its useful life, discounted using a market-based, risk-adjusted, discount rate.
For other property, plant and equipment, the recoverable amount of an asset is also considered on the basis of its net selling price, where it is 
possible to assess the amount that could be obtained from the sale of an asset in an arm’s length transaction, less the cost of disposal.
Recoverable amounts are estimated for individual assets or, if this is not possible, for the relevant cash-generating unit.
Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through 
continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when a sale is highly probable from the date of classification, management are 
committed to the sale and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Non-current assets are classified as held for sale 
from the date these conditions are met and are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value (less costs to sell). Any resulting 
impairment loss is recognised in the income statement as a special item. On classification as held for sale the assets are no longer depreciated. 
Notes to the Financial Statements
continued Strategic Report Directors’ Report Financial Statements Additional Information

2(a) Accounting policies continued
Government grants
Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to the income statement over the 
expected useful lives of the assets concerned. Other grants are credited to the income statement as and when the related expenditure is 
incurred.
Inventories
Inventories and work-in-progress are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, less any provision for obsolescence.
Cost is determined on the following bases:
• Purchased copper concentrate is recorded at cost on a first-in, first-out (‘FIFO’) basis; all other materials including stores and spares are valued 
on weighted average basis; except at Cairn where stores and spares are valued at FIFO basis
• Finished products are valued at raw material cost plus costs of conversion, comprising labour costs and an attributable proportion of 
manufacturing overheads based on normal levels of activity; and by-products and scrap are valued at net realisable value
Net realisable value is determined based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
Taxation
Tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided, using the balance sheet method, on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of 
assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Exceptions to this principle are:
• Tax payable on the future remittance of the past earnings of subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be 
controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future
• Deferred income tax is not recognised on the impairment of goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes or on the initial recognition of 
an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination, which at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting 
profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
• Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be recovered
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is 
settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Tax relating to items 
recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and is adjusted to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority upon a specific entity and 
the relevant Group entity intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on acquisitions that are categorised as Business Combinations. Deferred tax is 
recognised at acquisition as part of the assessment of the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired. Any deferred tax is charged or credited in 
the income statement as the underlying temporary difference is reversed.
Retirement benefit schemes
The Group operates or participates in a number of defined benefits and contribution schemes, the assets of which are (where funded) held in 
separately administered funds.
For defined benefit schemes the cost of providing benefits under the plans is determined each year separately for each plan using the projected 
unit credit method by independent qualified actuaries. 
Actuarial gains and losses arising in the year are recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and is not recycled to the income statement.
Net interest is calculated by applying a discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. Defined benefit costs are split into Current 
service cost, past service cost, net interest expense or income and remeasurement.
Current service cost and past service costs is recognised with in cost of sales and administrative expenses. Net interest expense or income is 
recognised within finance costs.
For defined contribution schemes, the amount charged to the income statement in respect of pension costs and other post-retirement benefits 
is the contributions payable in the year. Financial Statements

Share-based payments
Certain employees (including Executive Directors) of the Group receive part of their remuneration in the form of share-based payment 
transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares (‘equity-settled transactions’). 
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured at fair value at the date at which they are granted. The fair value of share 
awards with market-related vesting conditions are determined with the assistance of an external valuer and the fair value at the grant date is 
expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. The estimate of the 
number of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each balance sheet date up to the vesting date at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect 
the current expectations. No adjustment is made to the fair value after the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or not exercised.
Provisions for liabilities and charges
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive), as a result of past events, and it is probable that an 
outflow of resources, that can be reliably estimated, will be required to settle such an obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is 
material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows to net present value using an appropriate pre-tax discount 
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Unwinding of 
the discount is recognised in the income statement as a finance cost. Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and are adjusted to 
reflect the current best estimate.
Restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs
An obligation to incur restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs arises when environmental disturbance is caused by the development 
or ongoing production of a mine or oil fields. Costs arising from the decommissioning of plant and other site preparation work are provided for 
based on their discounted net present value, with a corresponding amount being capitalised at the start of each project. The amount provided 
for is recognised, as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises. These costs are charged to the income statement over the life of the 
operation through the depreciation of the asset and the unwinding of the discount on the provision. The cost estimates are reviewed periodically 
and are adjusted to reflect known developments which may have an impact on the cost estimates or life of operations. The cost of the related 
asset is adjusted for changes in the provision due to factors such as updated cost estimates, new disturbance and revisions to discount rates. The 
adjusted cost of the asset is depreciated prospectively over the lives of the assets to which they relate. The unwinding of the discount is shown as 
a finance cost in the income statement.
Costs for restoration of subsequent site damage which is caused on an ongoing basis during production are provided for at their net present 
values and charged to the income statement as extraction progresses. Where the costs of site restoration are not anticipated to be significant, 
they are expensed as incurred.
Operating leases
Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are not made on such a basis.
Finance leases
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value at the inception of the lease or, if lower, at the present 
value of the minimum lease payments. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the Balance Sheet as a finance lease obligation. 
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on 
the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged to the Income Statement, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying 
assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Group’s policy on borrowing costs.
The Group has reviewed the terms and conditions of the lease arrangements and determined that all risks and rewards of ownership lie with the 
Group and has therefore accounted for the contracts as finance leases.
Foreign currency translation
The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined as the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates. 
For all principal operating subsidiaries, the functional currency is the local currency of the country in which it operates with the exception of KCM 
and Cairn which has a US dollar functional currency as that is the currency of primary economic environment in which it operates. In the 
financial statements of individual Group companies, transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the 
functional currency at the exchange rates ruling at the date of transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are 
translated into the functional currency at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. 
All exchange differences are included in the income statement, except, where the monetary item is designated as an effective hedging 
instrument of the currency risk of designated forecast sales, where exchange differences are recognised in equity and exchange differences on 
foreign currency borrowings relating to asset under construction, and for future productive use, which are included in the cost of those assets 
when they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs on those foreign currency borrowings.
For the purposes of consolidation, the income statement items of those entities for which the US dollar is not the functional currency are 
translated into US dollars at the average rates of exchange during the period. The related balance sheets are translated at the rates ruling at the 
balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on translation of the opening net assets and results of such operations, and on foreign 
currency borrowings to the extent that they hedge the Group’s investment in such operations, are reported in other comprehensive income and 
accumulated in equity.

2(a) Accounting policies continued
On disposal of entities with a different functional currency to the Company’s functional currency, the deferred cumulative exchange differences 
recognised in equity relating to that particular operation would be recognised in the income statement.
Financial asset investments
Financial asset investments are classified as available for sale under IAS 39 and are initially recorded at cost and then remeasured at subsequent 
reporting dates to fair value. Unrealised gains and losses on financial asset investments are recognised directly in equity. On disposal or 
impairment of the investments, the gains and losses in equity are recycled to the income statement. 
Investments in unquoted equity instruments that do not have a market price and whose fair value cannot be reliably measured are measured at 
cost.
Investments in equity instruments are recorded in non-current assets unless they are expected to be sold within one year. 
Liquid investments
Liquid investments represent short-term current asset investments that do not meet the definition of cash and cash equivalents for one or more 
of the following reasons:
• They have a maturity profile greater than 90 days.
• They may be subject to a greater risk of changes in value than cash.
• They are held for investment purposes.
The value of trading investments incorporates any dividend and interest earned on the held for trading investments.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand, short-term deposits with banks and short-term highly liquid 
investments that are readily convertible into cash which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and are held for the purpose of 
meeting short-term cash commitments. 
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. An allowance for 
impairment of trade receivables is made where there is an event, which based on previous experience, is an indication of a reduction in the 
recoverability of the carrying value of the trade receivables.
Trade payables
Trade payables are stated at their nominal value. 
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Borrowings
Interest bearing loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received. Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or 
redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis and charged to the income statement using the effective interest 
method. They are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Convertible bonds
Convertible bonds denominated in the functional currency of the issuing entity are accounted for as compound instruments. The equity 
components and the liability components are separated out on the date of the issue. The equity component is recognised in a separate reserve 
and is not subsequently remeasured. The liability component is held at amortised cost. The interest expense on the liability component is 
calculated by applying the effective interest rate, being the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt. The difference 
between this amount and interest paid is added to the carrying amount of the liability component.
Convertible bonds not denominated in the functional currency of the issuing entity or where a cash conversion option exists, are split into two 
components: a debt component and a component representing the embedded derivative in the convertible bond. The debt component 
represents a liability for future coupon payments and the redemption on the principal amount. The embedded derivative, a financial liability, 
represents the value of the option that bond holders have to convert into ordinary shares. At inception the embedded derivative is recorded at 
fair value and the remaining balance, after deducting a share of issue costs, is recorded as the debt component. Subsequently, the debt 
component is measured at amortised cost and the embedded derivative is measured at fair value at each balance sheet date with the change 
in the fair value recognised in the income statement. The embedded derivative and the debt component are disclosed together and the current/
non-current classification follows the classification of the debt component which is the host contract.
The deferred tax effect arising on the movement in the fair value of the embedded derivative is recognised through the income statement. Financial Statements

Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly relating to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying capital project under construction are capitalised 
and added to the project cost during construction until such time that the assets are substantially ready for their intended use in accordance 
with the Group policy which is when they are capable of commercial production. Where funds are borrowed specifically to finance a project, the 
amount capitalised represents the actual borrowing costs incurred. Where surplus funds are available out of money borrowed specifically to 
finance a project, the income generated from such short-term investments is also capitalised to reduce the total capitalised borrowing cost. 
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred. 
Capitalisation of interest on borrowings related to construction or development projects ceases when substantially all the activities that are 
necessary to make the assets ready for their intended use are complete or when delays occur outside of the normal course of business.
Available for sale financial assets
Listed equity shares and debt instruments held by the Group that are traded in an active market are classified as being available for sale (‘AFS’) 
financial assets and are stated at fair value. Unrealised gains and losses on financial asset investments are recognised directly in equity. On 
disposal or impairment of the investments, the gains and losses in equity are recycled to the income statement. Dividends received from 
investees accounted for as equity instruments are recognised in the income statement when the right to receive the payment is established. 
Financial instruments fair value through profit and loss
Held for trading financial assets
Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they have been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near term. The change in 
fair value of trading investments incorporates any dividend and interest earned on the held for trading investments and is accounted for in the 
income statement.
Derivative financial instruments
In order to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity price risks, the Group enters into forward contracts, option 
contracts, swap contracts and other derivative financial instruments. The Group does not hold derivative financial instruments for speculative 
purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at their fair value on the date of the derivative transaction and are remeasured at their fair 
value at subsequent balance sheet dates. 
Hedge accounting
The Group designates certain hedging instruments, which include derivatives and non-derivatives in respect of foreign currency risk, as either fair 
value hedges or cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in 
the income statement. The hedged item is recorded at fair value and any gain or loss is recorded in the income statement and is offset by the 
gain or loss from the change in the fair value of the derivative.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded in equity. This includes certain 
non-derivative liabilities that are designated as instruments used to hedge the foreign currency risk on future, highly probable, forecast sales. 
Amounts deferred to equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in the income statement. 
The gain or loss on hedging instruments relating to the effective portion of a net investment hedge is recognised in equity. The ineffective 
portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Gains or losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement on 
disposal of the foreign operations to which they relate.
Derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market at the balance sheet date and gains or losses 
are recognised in the income statement immediately.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. Any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. If 
a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to net profit or loss for the 
year.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and 
characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses 
reported in the income statement.
Held-to-maturity financial assets
Financial instruments with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity dates that the Group has the positive intent and ability to hold to 
maturity are classified as held-to-maturity investments. Held-to-maturity investments are measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.

2(b) Critical accounting judgement and estimation uncertainty
In the course of applying the policies outlined in Note 2(a), management made estimations and assumptions that impact the amounts 
recognised in the financial statements. Vedanta believes that judgement and estimation has been made in the following areas:
Oil & gas reserves
Oil & gas reserves are estimated on a proved and probable entitlement interest basis. Proven and probable reserves are estimated using 
standard recognised evaluation techniques. The estimate is reviewed regularly. Future development costs are estimated taking into account the 
level of development required to produce the reserves by reference to operators, where applicable, and internal engineers. 
Net entitlement reserves estimates are subsequently calculated using the Group’s current oil price and cost recovery assumptions, in line with the 
relevant agreements.
Changes in reserves as a result of factors such as production cost, recovery rates, grade of reserves or commodity prices could impact the 
depreciation rates, carrying value of assets and environmental and restoration provisions.
Carrying value of exploration and evaluation fixed assets 
Where a project is sufficiently advanced the recoverability of IFRS 6 Exploration assets are assessed by comparing the carrying value to internal 
and operator estimates of the net present value of projects. Exploration assets are inherently judgemental to value and further details on the 
accounting policy are included in accounting note above. The amounts for exploration and evaluation assets represent active exploration 
projects. These amounts will be written-off to the income statement as exploration costs unless commercial reserves are established or the 
determination process is not completed and there are no indications of impairment. The outcome of ongoing exploration, and therefore 
whether the carrying value of exploration and evaluation assets will ultimately be recovered, is inherently uncertain.
Carrying value of developing/producing oil & gas assets 
Management perform impairment tests on the Group’s developing/producing oil & gas assets at least annually with reference to indicators in 
IAS 36. Key assumptions in the impairment models relate to prices that are based on forward curves for two years and the long-term 
appropriate assumptions thereafter and discount rates that are adjusted to risk to reflect conditions specific to individual assets.
Other key assumptions in the impairment models based on management expectations are that government approval will be received to further 
increase production rates and that the Enhanced Oil Recovery program will be successfully implemented.
Mining properties and leases
The carrying value of mining property and leases is arrived at by depreciating the assets over the life of the mine, using the unit of production 
method based on proved and probable reserves. The estimate of reserves is subject to assumptions relating to life of the mine and may change 
when new information becomes available. Changes in reserves as a result of factors such as production cost, recovery rates, grade of reserves or 
commodity prices could thus impact the carrying values of mining properties and leases and environmental and restoration provisions.
Useful economic lives and impairment of other assets
Property, plant and equipment other than mining properties, oil & gas properties, and leases are depreciated over their useful economic lives. 
Management reviews the useful economic lives at least once a year and any changes could affect the depreciation rates prospectively and 
hence the asset carrying values. The Group also reviews its property, plant and equipment, including mining properties and leases, for possible 
impairment if there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate that carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable. In assessing 
the property, plant and equipment for impairment, factors leading to significant reduction in profits such as changes in commodity prices, the 
Group’s business plans and changes in regulatory environment are taken into consideration. The carrying value of the assets of a cash 
generating unit (‘CGU’) is compared with the recoverable amount of those assets, that is, the higher of net realisable value and value in use. 
Value in use is usually determined on the basis of discounted estimated future cash flows. This involves management estimates on commodity 
prices, market demand and supply, economic and regulatory climates, long-term plan, discount rates and other factors. Any subsequent changes 
to cash flow due to changes in the above mentioned factors could impact on the carrying value of the assets. 
Assessment of impairment at Lanjigarh Refinery
The Group has considered that the delay in obtaining regulatory approval for the expansion of the alumina refinery at Lanjigarh and regulatory 
approval for bauxite mining as an indication of impairment. Hence, the Group have reviewed the carrying value of its property, plant and 
equipments at Lanjigarh as at balance sheet date, estimated the recoverable amounts of these assets and concluded that there was no 
impairment because the recoverable amount (estimated based on value in use) exceeded the carrying amounts. 
The key assumptions and estimates used in determining the value in use of these assets were:
• The State of Odisha has abundant bauxite resources and under the terms of the memorandum of understanding (‘MOU’) with the 
Government of Odisha, management is confident that bauxite will be made available in the short to medium-term. The Company is also 
considering purchase/sourcing bauxite from alternate sources to support the existing and expanded refinery operations. In the initial years, 
the Company has assumed that bauxite will be purchased from third party suppliers in India and other countries, till the bauxite is sourced 
from our own mines.
• The State of Odisha has taken certain measures including reservation of areas for mining operations or undertaking prospecting and the 
constitution of a Ministerial Committee for the formulation of a policy for the supply of ores to Odisha-based industries on a long-term basis.
• The management expects that the conditions for the construction of the alumina refinery will be fulfilled and it is assumed that the approval 
for the expansion of the refinery would be received for commencement of production by fiscal 2018. Financial Statements
142 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report and accounts FY2014
2(b) Critical accounting judgement and estimation uncertainty continued
Management expects that the mining approvals for mining and the statutory approvals for the expansion project will be received as anticipated. 
Additionally the Group carries out impairment assessment for carrying value of these assets, every half year and challenges these assumptions.
As at 31 March 2014 the carrying amount of property plant and equipment related to alumina refinery operations at Lanjigarh and related 
mining assets is US$1,231 million (31 March 2013: US$1,423.6 million).
Assessment of impairment of Karnataka and Goa iron ore mines 
Karnataka mining 
The mining ban in Karnataka was lifted on 17 April 2013. The Group has complied with all conditions for the recommencement of operations, 
and mining operations resumed in December 2013 with a production 1.5 million tonnes during the year. The carrying value of assets as at  
31 March 2014 is US$260.4 million (31 March 2013: US$296 million).
Goa mining
The Supreme Court passed an order on 21 April 2014 whereby the ban was lifted, subject to certain conditions. The key conditions are as follows
• The maximum annual excavation for Goa has been limited to 20 million tonnes until the Expert Committee issues determines the final annual 
capacity of mining at Goa.
• All mining leases in the State of Goa are suspended and State Government would grant mining leases in accordance with the Mines and 
Minerals (Development and regulation) Act, 1957 .
• 10% of the sale price of the iron ore sold by the mining lessees to be contributed to a separate fund.
• Out of the sale proceeds of excavated ore, the leaseholders would be paid only the average cost of excavation of iron ore and the balance 
amount to be allocated amongst various affected stakeholders and the Government of Goa.
Vedanta is expecting to start mining activities at iron ore mines at Goa in the second half of fiscal 2015, after receipt of all regulatory clearances 
and approving of mining leases. Management has reviewed the carrying value of the assets as at balance sheet date, estimated the recoverable 
amounts of these assets and concluded that there was no impairment because the recoverable amount (estimated based on value in use) 
exceeded the carrying amounts.
The carrying value of assets affected as at 31 March 2014 is US$1,045.0 million (31 March 2013: US$799 million).
Restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs
Provision is made for costs associated with restoration and rehabilitation of mining sites as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises. Such 
restoration and closure costs are typical of extractive industries and they are normally incurred at the end of the life of the mine. The costs are 
estimated on the basis of closure plans and the estimated discounted costs of dismantling and removing these facilities and the costs of 
restoration are capitalised when incurred reflecting Company’s obligations at that time. A corresponding provision is created on the liability side. 
The capitalised asset is charged to the income statement over the life of the asset through depreciation over the life of the operation and the 
provision is increased each period via unwinding the discount on the provision. Management estimates are based on local legislation and/or 
other agreements. The actual costs and cash outflows may differ from estimates because of changes in laws and regulations, changes in prices, 
analysis of site conditions and changes in restoration technology. 
Provisions and liabilities
Provisions and liabilities are recognised in the period when it becomes probable that there will be a future outflow of funds resulting from past 
operations or events that can be reasonably estimated. The timing of recognition requires the application of judgement to existing facts and 
circumstances which may be subject to change especially when taken in the context of the legal environment in India. The actual cash outflows 
may take place over many years in the future and hence the carrying amounts of provisions and liabilities are regularly reviewed and adjusted to 
take into account the changing circumstances and other factors that influence the provisions and liabilities. 
Contingencies and commitments
In the normal course of business, contingent liabilities may arise from litigation and other claims against the Group. Where it is management’s 
assessment that the outcome cannot be reliably quantified or is uncertain the claims are disclosed as contingent liabilities unless the likelihood 
of an adverse outcome is remote. Such liabilities are disclosed in the notes but are not provided for in the financial statements. Although there 
can be no assurance regarding the final outcome of the legal proceedings, the Group does not expect them to have a materially adverse impact 
on the Group’s financial position or profitability. These are set out in Note 37 . 
The HZL and BALCO call options
The Group had exercised its call option to acquire the remaining 49% interest in BALCO and 29.5% interest in HZL. The Government of India 
has however, contested the validity of the options and disputed their valuation performed in terms of the relevant agreements the details of 
which are set out in Note 39. In view of the lack of resolution on the options, the non-response to the exercise and valuation request from the 
Government of India, the resultant uncertainty surrounding the potential transaction and the valuation of the consideration payable, the Group 
considers the strike price of the options to be at fair value, which is effectively nil, and hence the call options have not been recognised in the 
financial statements.

3. Segment information
The Group’s primary format for segmental reporting is based on its business segments. The business segments consist of zinc, iron ore, copper, 
aluminium, power and oil & gas with components not meeting the quantitative threshold for reporting being reported as ‘Others’. Business 
segment financial data includes certain corporate costs, which have been allocated on an appropriate basis. The risks and returns of the Group’s 
operations are primarily determined by the nature of the different activities in which the Group is engaged. Inter-segment sales are charged 
based on prevailing market prices. The Group’s activities are organised on a global basis. 
Vedanta Resources plc is company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. The Group’s reportable segments 
defined in accordance with IFRS 8 are as follows:
• Zinc-India
• Zinc-International
• Oil & gas 
• Iron Ore
• Copper-India/Australia
• Copper-Zambia
• Aluminium
• Power
Management monitors the operating results of reportable segments for the purpose of making decisions about resources to be allocated and 
for assessing performance. Segment performance is evaluated based on the EBITDA of each segment. 
The following tables present revenue and profit information and certain asset and liability information regarding the Group’s reportable 
segments for the year ended 31 March 2014 and 31 March 2013. Items after operating profit are not allocated by segment.

Consequent to the effectiveness of the scheme of merger (Note 44), tax effects on current/deferred tax has been given effect to in the financial 
statements for the year ended 31 March 2014.
The deferred tax benefit recycled from equity to the income statement is US$0.3 million (2013: US$5.3 million). The tax rate has gone up during 
the year from 2.7% to 11.5% largely on account of a credit of US$290 million in Cairn India due to reorganisation in previous year. The impact 
of tax reversal of US$257 million during the year on account of the Sesa Sterlite merger was largely offset by creating deferred tax liability on 
fair values at Cairn India on account of increase in surcharge by 5% and certain one time provisions.

foreseeable future. The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with such investments in subsidiaries is represented by the 
contribution of those investments to the Group’s retained earnings and amounted to US$6,662.7 million (2013: US$7 ,248.4 million).

13. Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
24,206,816 treasury shares are excluded from the total outstanding shares for the calculation of EPS.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year (adjusted for the effects of dilutive options and the Group’s convertible bonds).The 
following reflects the income and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations:

Diluted earnings per share on (loss)/profit for the year (US cents per share) (71.7) 58.3
The effect of 8 million (2013: 4.8 million) potential ordinary shares, which relate to share option awards under the LTIP scheme, on the 
attributable loss for the year is anti-dilutive and thus these shares are not considered in determining basic EPS. However the effect of these 
awards on underlying attributable earnings is dilutive and hence the potential ordinary shares are considered in determining underlying EPS 
below.
Loss for the year would be decreased if holders of the convertible bonds in Vedanta exercised their right to convert their bond holdings into 
Vedanta equity. The impact on loss for the year of this conversion would be the reduction in interest payable on the convertible bond.
The adjustment in respect of convertible bonds has an anti-dilutive impact on earnings and is thus not considered in determining diluted EPS.
Earnings per share based on underlying profit for the year (non-GAAP)
The Group’s underlying profit is the profit for the year after adding back special items, other losses/(gains) (Note 8) and their resultant tax and 
non-controlling interest effects. This is a non-GAAP measure.

Goodwill is allocated for impairment testing purposes to the following Cash Generating Units (‘CGU’s’). The allocation of goodwill to CGU’s is as 
follows:
• US$12.2 million Copper India.
• US$4.4 million Iron ore business.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. 
The Company has undertaken an impairment review of goodwill of US$16.6 million as at 31 March 2014. The carrying amount of goodwill 
allocated to the relevant cash generating unit is considered to be insignificant in comparison with the total carrying value of the cash generating 
unit. The carrying amount of goodwill was evaluated using the discounted future cash flows of the entities to which the goodwill pertains and 
comparing this to the total carrying value of the relevant cash generating units. It was determined that the carrying amount of goodwill is not 
impaired.

Vizag General Cargo Berth Private Limited (‘VGCB’), a special purpose vehicle, was incorporated for the coal berth mechanisation and upgrades 
at Visakhapatnam port. VGCB is owned by Sesa Sterlite and Leighton Welspun Contractors Private Limited in the ratio of 74 : 26. The project is to 
be carried out on a design, build, finance, operate, transfer basis and the concession agreement between Visakhapatnam Port and VGCB was 
signed in June 2010. In October 2010, VGCB was awarded with the concession after fulfilling conditions stipulated as a precedent to the 
concession agreement. Visakhapatnam Port has provided, in lieu of a licence fee, an exclusive licence to VGCB for designing, engineering, 
financing, constructing, equipping, operating, maintaining, and replacing the project/project facilities and services. The concession period is 30 
years from the date of the award of the concession. The capacity of an upgraded berth would be 10.18mmtpa and that the Visakhapatnam 
Port would be entitled to receive a 38.10% share of the gross revenue as royalty. VGCB is entitled to recover a tariff from the user(s) of the 
project facilities and services as per its tariff notification. The tariff rates are linked to the Wholesale Price Index (‘WPI’) and would accordingly 
be adjusted as specified in the concession agreement every year. The ownership of all infrastructure assets, buildings, structures, berths, wharfs, 
equipment and other immovable and movable assets, constructed, installed, located, created or provided by VGCB at the project site and/or in 
the port’s assets pursuant, to a concession agreement, would be with VGCB until expiry of this concession agreement. The cost of any repair, 
replacement or restoration of the project facilities and services shall be borne by VGCB during the concession period. VGCB has to transfer all its 
rights, titles and interest in the project facilities and services free of cost to Visakhapatnam Port at the end of the concession period
Revenue from construction contract of service concession arrangements on exchanging construction services for the port concession rights, 
recognised in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended 31 March 2014, is US$1.1 million (2013: US$65.3 million).
The intangible asset of right to use the sewage treatment plant is amortised over 25 years. Software licences are amortised over a period of

up to US$500 million at an interest rate of US$LIBOR plus 357 basis points repayable to the extent of 50% in October 2017 and balance in 
January 2018. 
In November 2013, the Company entered into a two-year Revolving Credit Facility arranged by The Royal Bank of Scotland and Standard 
Chartered Bank for borrowing up to US$100 million at an interest rate US$LIBOR plus 250 basis points. As at 31 March 2014, US$81 million has 
been drawn against this facility. 
In December 2013, the Company entered into a facility agreement with the Bank of India for borrowing up to US$100 million at an interest rate 
of US$LIBOR plus 357 basis points repayable to the extent of 50% in October 2017 and balance in January 2018.
Non-equity non-controlling interests
As at 31 March 2014, non-equity non-controlling interests remain of US$11.9 million, being deferred shares in KCM held by ZCCM. The deferred 
shares have no voting rights or rights to KCM’s dividends, but are entitled on a winding-up to a return of up to US$0.99 per share once all of 
KCM’s ordinary shares have received a distribution equal to their par value and any share premium created on their issue and which remains 
distributable to them.
The deferred shares are held at historic cost, being the fair value attributed to them at the time of initial acquisition of KCM in the year ended 
31 March 2005. They are classified as non-current liabilities as they are repayable only on the winding up of KCM, for an amount different than 
the pro rata share of net assets upon liquidation. The shares have been valued at US$0.99 per share, which is the maximum amount payable to 
the deferred shareholders. These deferred shares have not been discounted as the effect would not be material.

A. Vedanta Resource Jersey Limited (‘VRJL ’) issued 5.5% US$1,250 million guaranteed convertible bonds on 13 July 2009. The bonds are first 
convertible into exchangeable redeemable preference shares to be issued by VRJL, which will then be automatically exchanged for ordinary 
shares of Vedanta Resources plc. The bondholders have the option to convert at any time from 24 August 2009 to 6 July 2016. Conversion 
option exercised before 15 August 2012 were convertible at US$36.48 per share. Conversion options exercised on or after 15 August 2012  
were convertible at US$35.58 per share.
If the notes have not been converted, they will be redeemed at the option of the Company at any time on or after 28 July 2012 subject to 
certain conditions, or be redeemed at the option of the bondholders on or after 13 July 2014.
During the year the Company received notice from bondholders amounting to US$1.7 million to exercise the option to convert the bonds into 
equity shares of Vedanta Resources plc in accordance with the provisions of the Offer circular dated 9 July 2009. During the year ended  
31 March 2014 US$1.7 million of bonds were converted into 48,850 equity shares of Vedanta Resources plc.
The net proceeds of the convertible issue have been split between the liability element and equity component, representing the fair value of

27. Convertible bonds continued
The US$1,250 million convertible bond has a put option exercised by bond holders in July 2014. Management has assessed the possibility of 
bondholders exercising the put option as likely and accordingly the bond is now being amortised to July 2014 resulting in an additional US$70 
million interest expense being recognised in respect of accumulated amortisation in the current year.
The interest charged for the year is calculated by applying an effective interest rate of 17 .3% (March 2013: 11.2%). 
The fair value of the convertible bond as at 31 March 2014 is US$1,241.7 million (31 March 2013: US$1,194.1 million). 
B. Vedanta Resource Jersey II Limited (‘VRJL – II’) issued 4.0% US$883 million guaranteed convertible bonds on 30 March 2010. The bonds are 
first convertible into exchangeable redeemable preference shares to be issued by VRJL-II, which will then be automatically exchanged for 
ordinary shares of Vedanta Resources plc. The bondholders have the option to convert at any time from 10 May 2010 to 23 March 2017 . 
Conversion option exercised before 15 August 2012, were convertible at US$51.9251 per share. Conversion Options exercised on or after 
15 August 2012, are convertible at US$50.6460, as per the terms of offering circular.
If the notes have not been converted, they will be redeemed at the option of the Company at any time on or after 14 April 2013 subject to 
certain conditions, or be redeemed at the option of the bondholders on or after 29 April 2013 to 30 March 2015.
On 15 March 2013, 91.6% of bondholders exercised the put option to redeem the bonds on 29 April 2013, resulting in a repayment of 
US$809.8 million on that date. Consequently an additional charge of US$39.1 million has been recognised as part of finance cost in the 
previous year to reflect the revised amortised value of the bond liability.
At the inception, the net proceeds of the convertible issue was split between the liability element and a derivative component, representing 
the fair value of the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Company. The latter was not recorded within equity due to 
the existence of partial cash settlement terms within the bond which prevent the adoption of compound financial instrument accounting.

The fair value of the convertible bond as at 31 March 2014 was US$72.5 million (31 March 2013: US$880.2 million). 
C. Sesa Sterlite Limited issued 4% US$500 million convertible senior notes (denominated in US dollars) on 29 October 2009 which are due on 
30 October 2014. The bonds are convertible into American Depository Share (‘ADS’) to be issued by Sesa Sterlite Limited. The bondholders have 
the option to convert at any time before 29 October 2014 at a conversion ratio of 42.8688 for every US$1,000 of principal which is equal to a 
conversion price of US$23.33 per ADS. Pursuant to the effectiveness of Group simplification scheme in August 2014 (Note 44) conversion rate 
has changed to 25.7213 ADS every US$1,000 principal amount of notes which is equal to a conversion price of approximately US$38.88 per 
ADS. Sesa Sterlite has the option (subject to the terms of the bond) to redeem the convertible bond at any time after 4 November 2012.
Sesa Sterlite Limited had also issued 5% US$500 million convertible bonds (denominated in US dollars) on 30 October 2009 and due 
31 October 2014. The bonds are convertible into ordinary shares of Sesa Sterlite Limited. The bondholders have the option to convert at any 
time after 10 December 2009 and before 24 October 2014 at a conversion ratio of 13837 .6384 for every US$100,000 principal. Sesa Sterlite 
has the option (subject to certain conditions) to redeem the convertible bond at any time after 30 October 2012. As at 31 March 2014, 
the outstanding closing balance is US$216.8 million (2013: US$216.8 million). 
As the functional currency of Sesa Sterlite Limited is INR, the conversion of the convertible bonds (which are denominated in US dollars) would 
not result in the settlement and exchange of a fixed amount of cash in INR terms, for a fixed number of its shares respectively. Accordingly, the 
convertible bond must be separated into two component elements: a derivative component consisting of the conversion option (carried at fair 
value) and a liability component consisting of the debt element of the bonds. Further details of the accounting for such instruments are provided 
in the Group accounting policies (Note 2a).

IFRS 7 requires additional information regarding the methodologies employed to measure the fair value of financial instruments which are 
recognised or disclosed in the accounts. These methodologies are categorised per the standard as:
Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on 
observable market data (unobservable inputs). Financial Statements
162 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report and accounts FY2014
28. Financial instruments continued
Adoption of IFRS 13: Fair Value Measurement, has resulted in some minor changes to the method of valuation of financial derivatives 
instruments during the period. The credit risk arising from the non-performance by counterparties i.e. credit value adjustment (‘CVA’) and debit 
value adjustment (‘DVA’) of their contractual financial obligations have been adjusted in fair value of financial derivatives The net impact of 
CVA/DVA adjustment has resulted in a gain of US$1.4 million during the year ended 31 March 2014. Changes in the fair value of the financial 
derivative instruments attributable to the change in the credit risk, resulted in a decrease in the fair value of such instruments US$1.7 million 
during the year ended 31 March 2014.
The below table summarises the categories of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value:
As at 31 March 2014

– Held for trading 8,568.5 –

– Borrowings – (4.7)
Total – (77.2)
There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the year. No financial assets or liabilities that are measured at fair value were Level 3 
fair value measurements.
The fair value of borrowings is US$16,973.8 million (2013: US$16,420.2 million). For all other financial instruments, the carrying amount is either 
the fair value, or approximates the fair value.
The fair value of financial asset investments represents the market value of the quoted investments and other traded instruments. For other 
financials assets the carrying value is considered to approximate fair value.
The fair value of financial liabilities is the market value of the traded instruments, where applicable. Otherwise fair value is calculated using a 
discounted cash flow model with market assumptions, unless the carrying value is considered to approximate fair value.
The fair value of the embedded derivative liability of convertible bond has been calculated using the Black-Scholes model with market 
assumptions.
Derivative instruments and risk management
The Group’s businesses are subject to several risks and uncertainties including financial risks. 
The Group’s documented risk management policies act as an effective tool in mitigating the various financial risks to which the businesses are 
exposed to in the course of their daily operations. The risk management policies cover areas such as liquidity risk, commodity price risk, foreign 
exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and capital management (the latter covered in Note 33).
Notes to the Financial Statements

163 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report and accounts FY2014
28. Financial instruments continued
Risks are identified through a formal risk management programme with active involvement of senior management personnel and business 
managers at both the corporate and individual subsidiary level. Each operating subsidiary in the Group has in place risk management processes 
which are in line with the Group’s policy. Each significant risk has a designated ‘owner’ within the Group at an appropriate senior level. The 
potential financial impact of the risk and its likelihood of a negative outcome are regularly updated. The risk management process is coordinated 
by the Management Assurance function and is regularly reviewed by the Group’s Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is aided by the GRMC, 
which meets every quarter to review risks as well as the progress against the planned actions. Key business decisions are discussed at the 
monthly meetings of the Executive Committee. The overall internal control environment and risk management programme including financial 
risk management is reviewed by the Audit Committee on behalf of the Board.
Treasury management
Treasury management focuses on capital protection, liquidity maintenance and yield maximisation. The treasury policies are approved by the 
Board and adherence to these policies is strictly monitored at the Executive Committee meetings. Day-to-day treasury operations of the 
subsidiary companies are managed by their respective finance teams within the framework of the overall Group treasury policies. Long-term 
fund raising including strategic treasury initiatives are handled by a central team while short-term funding for routine working capital 
requirements is delegated to subsidiary companies. A monthly reporting system exists to inform senior management of investments, debt, 
currency, commodity and interest rate derivatives. The Group has a strong system of internal control which enables effective monitoring of 
adherence to Group policies. The internal control measures are supplemented by regular internal audits. 
The investment portfolio at our Indian entities is independently reviewed by CRISIL Limited and our portfolio has been rated as ‘Very Good’.
The Group uses derivative instruments as part of its management of exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates 
and commodity prices. The Group does not acquire or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The Group does 
not enter into complex derivative transactions to manage the treasury and commodity risks. Both treasury and commodities derivative 
transactions are normally in the form of forward contracts and interest rate and currency swaps and these are subject to the Group guidelines 
and policies. Interest rate swaps are taken to achieve a balance between fixed and floating rates (as described below under ‘Interest risk’) and 
currency swaps are taken primarily to convert the Group’s exposure to non-US dollar currencies to US dollar currencies.
Commodity risk
The Group is exposed to the movement of base metal commodity prices on the London Metal Exchange. Any decline in the prices of the base 
metals that the Group produces and sells will have an immediate and direct impact on the profitability of the businesses. As a general policy, the 
Group aims to sell the products at prevailing market prices. As much as possible, the Group tries to mitigate price risk through favourable 
contractual terms. The Group undertakes hedging activity in commodities to a limited degree. Hedging is used primarily as a risk management 
tool and, in some cases, to secure future cash flows in cases of high volatility by entering in to forward contracts or similar instruments. The 
hedging activities are subject to strict limits set out by the Board and to a strictly defined internal control and monitoring mechanism. Decisions 
relating to hedging of commodities are taken at the Executive Committee level and with clearly laid down guidelines for their implementation by 
the subsidiaries. 
Whilst the Group aims to achieve average LME prices for a month or a year, average realised prices may not necessarily reflect the LME price 
movements because of a variety of reasons such as uneven sales during the year and timing of shipments. 
The Group is also exposed to the movement of international crude oil price and the discount in the price of Rajasthan crude oil to Brent price.
Copper
The Group’s custom smelting copper operations at Tuticorin is benefited by a natural hedge except to the extent of a possible mismatch in 
quotational periods between the purchase of concentrate and the sale of finished copper. The Group’s policy on custom smelting is to generate 
margins from TC/RCs, improving operational efficiencies, minimising conversion cost, generating a premium over LME on sale of finished copper, 
sale of by-products and from achieving import parity on domestic sales. Hence, mismatches in quotational periods are managed to ensure that 
the gains or losses are minimised. The Group hedges this variability of LME prices through forward contracts and tries to make the LME price a 
pass-through cost between purchases of copper concentrate and sales of finished products, both of which are linked to the LME price. The Group 
also benefits from the difference between the amounts paid for quantities of copper content received and recovered in the manufacturing 
process, also known as ‘free copper’. The Group hedges on a selective basis the free copper by entering into future contracts. 
The Group’s Australian mines in Tasmania supply approximately 7% to 8% of the requirement of the custom copper smelter at Tuticorin on an 
arm’s length basis. Hence, TC/RCs are a major source of income for the Indian copper smelting operations. Fluctuations in TC/RCs are influenced 
by factors including demand and supply conditions prevailing in the market for mine output. The Group’s copper business has a strategy of 
securing a majority of its concentrate feed requirement under long-term contracts with mines. 
KCM is largely an integrated copper producer and whenever hedging is done it is with an intention to protect the Group from price fluctuations in 
copper. KCM also does hedging for its custom smelting operations, where back to back hedging is used to mitigate pricing risks.
For the mining assets in Australia and Zambia, part of the production may be hedged to secure cash flows on a selective basis.  Financial Statements

Aluminium
The requirement of the primary raw material, alumina, is partly met from own sources and the rest is purchased primarily on negotiated price 
terms. Sales prices are linked to the LME prices. At present the Group on selective basis hedges the aluminium content in outsourced alumina to 
protect its margins.
The Group also enters into hedging arrangements for its aluminium sales to realise month of sale LME prices.
Zinc and lead
The sales prices are linked to the LME prices. The Group has some long-term volume contracts with some customers where the prices are linked 
to prevailing LME prices at the time of shipment. The Group hedges custom production of Indian operations through forward contracts or other 
instruments. 
Iron ore
The Group sells some portion of its iron ore production on quarterly price contracts and the balance on the basis of prevailing market prices. 
Provisionally priced financial instruments
On 31 March 2014, the value of net financial liabilities linked to commodities (excluding derivatives) accounted for on provisional prices was a 
liability of US$454.1 million (2013: liability of US$702.4 million). These instruments are subject to price movements at the time of final 
settlement and the final price of these instruments will be determined in the financial year beginning 1 April 2014. 
Set out below is the impact of 10% increase in LME prices on profit for the year and total equity as a result of changes in value of the Group’s

The above sensitivities are based on volumes, costs, exchange rates and other variables and provide the estimated impact of a change in LME 
prices on profit and equity assuming that all other variables remain constant. 
Further, the impact of a 10% increase in closing copper LME for provisionally priced copper concentrate purchased at Sterlite Copper’s custom 
smelting operations is US$54.2 million (2013: US$65.1 million), which is a pass through in nature and as such will not have any impact on the 
profitability. 
Financial risk and sensitivities
The Group’s Board approved financial risk policies comprise liquidity, currency, interest rate and counterparty risk. The Group does not engage in 
speculative treasury activity but seeks to manage risk and optimise interest and commodity pricing through proven financial instruments.
(a) Liquidity
The Group requires funds both for short-term operational needs as well as for long-term investment programmes mainly in growth projects. The 
Group generates sufficient cash flows from the current operations which together with the available cash and cash equivalents and liquid 
financial asset investments provide liquidity both in the short-term as well as in the long-term. Anticipated future cash flows, together with 
undrawn committed facilities of US$1,526.2 million, and cash and liquid investments of US$8,937 .9 million as at 31 March 2014, are expected to 
be sufficient to meet the ongoing capital investment programme and liquidity requirement of the Group in the near future.

The Group has a strong balance sheet that gives sufficient headroom to raise further debt should the need arise. The Group’s current ratings 
from Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s & Fitch Ratings are BB, Ba1 and BB+ respectively (2013: BB, Ba1 and BB+ respectively). These ratings support 
the necessary financial leverage and access to debt or equity markets at competitive terms. The Group generally maintains a healthy net 
gearing ratio and retains flexibility in the financing structure to alter the ratio when the need arises (see Note 33 for further details).
The maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities based on the remaining period from the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity 
date is given in the table below. The figures reflect the contractual undiscounted cash obligation of the Group:

(b) Foreign currency
The Group’s presentation currency is the US dollar. The majority of the assets are located in India and the Indian rupee is the functional currency 
for the Indian operating subsidiaries. Exposures on foreign currency loans are managed through the Group-wide hedging policy, which is 
reviewed periodically to ensure that the risk from fluctuating currency exchange rates is appropriately managed. Natural hedges available in the 
business are identified at each entity level and hedges are placed only for the net exposure. Short-term net exposures are hedged progressively 
based on their maturity. Longer exposures beyond one year are normally unhedged. However all new long-term borrowing exposures are being 
hedged. Vedanta has hedged some of its non-US dollar borrowings into US dollar borrowings by entering into cross-currency swaps. Financial Statements

The sensitivities are based on financial assets and liabilities held at 31 March 2014 where balances are not denominated in the functional 
currency of the respective subsidiaries. The sensitivities do not take into account the Group’s sales and costs and the results of the sensitivities 
could change due to other factors such as changes in the value of financial assets and liabilities as a result of non-foreign exchange influenced 
factors. 
(c) Interest rate risk
At 31 March 2014, the Group’s net debt of US$7 ,919.5 million (2013: US$8,615.6 million net debt) comprises cash, cash equivalents and liquid 
investments of US$8,937 .9 million (2013: US$7 ,981.7 million) offset by debt of US$16,871.2 million (2013: US$16,592.8 million) and debt 
derivative asset of US$13.8 million (2013: Liability of US$4.5 million).
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on short-term and long-term floating rate instruments and on the refinancing of fixed rate debt. The 
Group’s policy is to maintain a balance of fixed and floating interest rate borrowings and the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt is 
determined by current market interest rates. As at 31 March 2014, 48.7% (2013: 42.6%) of the total debt was at a fixed rate and the balance 
was at a floating rate. The floating rate debt is largely linked to US dollar LIBOR. The Group also aims to minimise its average interest rates on 
borrowings by opting for a higher proportion of long-term debt to fund growth projects. The Group invests cash and liquid investments in 
short-term deposits and debt mutual funds, some of which generate a tax-free return, to achieve the Group’s goal of maintaining liquidity, 
carrying manageable risk and achieving satisfactory returns.
Floating rate financial assets are largely mutual fund investments which have debt securities as underlying assets. The returns from these 
financial assets are linked to market interest rate movements; however the counterparty invests in the agreed securities with known maturity 
tenure and return and hence has manageable risk. Additionally, the investments portfolio at our Indian entities is independently reviewed by 
CRISIL Limited, and our investment portfolio has been rated as ‘Very Good’.

Total financial liabilities 8,996.0 9,478.4 3,315.5 9,633.4 8,756.7 3,070.8
The weighted average interest rate on the fixed rate financial liabilities is 8.0% (2013: 7 .6%) and the weighted average period for which the rate 
is fixed is 4.5 years (2013: 3.06 years).
Considering the net debt position as at 31 March 2014 and the investment in bank deposits and debt mutual funds, any increase in interest 
rates would result in a net loss and any decrease in interest rates would result in a net gain. The sensitivity analyses below have been determined 
based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date. 
The below table illustrates the impact of a 0.5% to 2.0% change in interest rate of borrowings on profit and equity and represents 
management’s assessment of the possible change in interest rates.

(d) Credit risk
The Group is exposed to credit risk from trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, liquid investments and other financial instruments. 
The Group has clearly defined policies to mitigate counterparty risks. Cash and liquid investments are held primarily in mutual funds and banks 
with good credit ratings. Defined limits are in place for exposure to individual counterparties in case of mutual fund houses and banks. 
The large majority of receivables due from third parties are secured. Moreover, given the diverse nature of the Group’s businesses trade 
receivables are spread over a number of customers with no significant concentration of credit risk. Other than the exception of a single customer 
in our oil & gas business, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of the Group’s net sales or for any of the Group’s primary businesses 
during the year ended 31 March 2014 and no customer accounted for 10% or more of the Group’s net sales or for any of the Group’s primary 
businesses during the year ended 31 March 2013. The history of trade receivables shows a negligible provision for bad and doubtful debts. 
Therefore, the Group does not expect any material risk on account of non-performance by any of our counterparties. 
The Group’s maximum gross exposure to credit risk at 31 March 2014 is US$10,420.0 million (2013: US$9,852.8 million).  Financial Statements

Derivative financial instruments
The fair value of all derivatives is separately recorded on the balance sheet within other financial assets (derivatives) and other financial liabilities 
(derivatives), current and non-current. In addition, the derivative component of certain convertible bonds is shown as part of the overall 
convertible bond liability (Note 27). Derivatives that are designated as hedges are classified as current or non-current depending on the maturity 
of the derivative.
Embedded derivatives
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other contracts are treated as separate derivative contracts, when their risks and 
characteristics are not closely related to those of their host contracts. 
Cash flow hedges
The Group also enters into forward exchange and commodity price contracts for hedging highly probable forecast transactions and accounts for 
them as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value. Subsequent changes in fair value are recognised in equity until the hedged transactions 
occur, at which time the respective gains or losses are transferred to the income statement. 
The fair value of the Group’s open derivative positions at 31 March 2014, recorded within financial instruments (derivative) is as follows:

contracts for firm future commitments. 
The cash flows related to majority of cash flow hedges above are expected to occur during the year ended 31 March 2015 and consequently 
may impact the income statements for that year depending upon the change in the commodity prices and foreign exchange rate movements.

Restoration, rehabilitation and environmental
The provisions for restoration, rehabilitation and environmental liabilities represent the Directors’ best estimate of the costs which will be 
incurred in the future to meet the Group’s obligations under existing Indian, Australian, Zambian, Namibian, South African and Irish law and the 
terms of the Group’s mining and other licences and contractual arrangements. These amounts, calculated by considering discount rates within 
the range of 2% to 9%, become payable on closure of mines and are expected to be incurred over a period of one to 15 years. Within India, the 
principal restoration and rehabilitation provisions are recorded within Cairn India where a legal obligation exists relating to the oil & gas fields, 
where costs are expected to be incurred in restoring the site of production facilities at the end of the producing life of an oil field. The Group 
recognises the full cost of site restoration as a liability when the obligation to rectify environmental damage arises.
An obligation to incur restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs arises when environmental disturbance is caused by the development 
or ongoing production from a producing field.  Financial Statements

29. Provisions continued
KCM copper price participation
KCM Copper Price Participation relates to a provision in respect of a price participation agreement in Zambia which requires KCM to pay ZCCM 
an agreed annual sum when copper price exceeds specified levels and specific triggers. In the previous years the timing of the outflow was 
dependent on future copper prices as well as dividends paid.
KCM and ZCCM agreed for final settlement of Copper Price Participation liability. The total amount that to be paid was US$119.7 million to be 
settled in 16 instalments with the first instalment starting on 31 December 2012 and last instalment on 30 September 2016. During the year 
ended 31 March 2014, one instalment of US$6.9 million is paid. Total liability that remains outstanding is US$97 .8 million as at 31 March 2014. 
The provision recognised has been discounted at 7 .5% to take into account the expected timings of the various payments and recognised as a 
liability at US$89.3 million as at 31 March 2014. 
Other
Other includes provision on post retirement medical benefits. The expected period of utilisation is 18 years.
30. Deferred tax
The Group has accrued significant amounts of deferred tax. The majority of the deferred tax liability represents accelerated tax relief for the 
depreciation of capital expenditure and the depreciation on fair value uplifts created on acquisitions, net of losses carried forward by KCM and 
Sesa Sterlite Limited (post the reorganisation).
The amounts of deferred taxation on temporary differences, provided and not provided, in the accounts are as follows:

no expiry period, US$642 million untilised tax losses of Twin Star Mauritius Holdings Limited which is subject of Mauritius tax regime and can be 
carried forward for a period of five years and US$371.3 million of unutilised tax losses and capital allowances for Malco Energy Limited (‘MEL ’) 
which is subject to the Indian tax regime. Pursuant to the Indian tax regime, unutilised tax losses expire eight years from the date the losses are 
recorded, whereas unabsorbed depreciation can be carried forward to an indefinite period. No benefit has been recognised for these items on 
the grounds that their successful application against future profits is not probable in the foreseeable future.

The Group has US$1,135.1 million of unutilised tax losses at KCM (2013: US$1,263.4 million) which expire in the period 2014 to 2022. The Group 
has US$1,634.2 million of unutilised tax losses at SSL which is subject to the Indian tax regime. Pursuant to the Indian tax regime, unutilised tax 
losses expire eight years from the date the losses are recorded, whereas unabsorbed depreciation can be carried forward to an indefinite period. 
These unutilised tax losses have been recognised as a deferred tax asset, as they will unwind as the accelerated capital allowances unwind, 
thereby generating economic benefits for the Company.

Employee share schemes
The Group aims to provide superior rewards for outstanding performance and a high proportion of ‘at risk’ remuneration for Executive Directors. 
Three employee share schemes were approved by shareholders on Listing. The Board has no present intention to introduce any further share 
schemes.
The Vedanta Resources Long-Term Incentive Plan (the ‘LTIP’) and Employee Share Ownership Plan (the ‘ESOP’)
The LTIP and ESOP is the primary arrangement under which share-based incentives are provided to the Executive Directors and the wider 
management group. The maximum value of shares that can be conditionally awarded to an Executive Director in a year is 100% of annual 
salary. In respect of Mr Navin Agarwal and Mr MS Mehta, salary means the aggregate of their salary payable by Vedanta and their CTC payable 
by Sesa Sterlite Limited. Mr MS Mehta superannuated on 31 March 2014. The maximum value of shares that can be awarded to members of 
the wider management group is calculated by reference to the grade average CTC and individual grade of the employee. The performance 
condition attaching to outstanding awards is as follows:
• ESOP – measured in terms of business performance set against business plan for the financial year comprising operational deliverables, 
enabler parameters and sustainability performance specific to each company. The vesting schedule is graded over three years and varies from 
company to company with a minimum vesting of 30% triggering at either 80% or 85% business score. In another tranche, the vesting 
schedule is staggered over a period of three years from the date of grant, with 70% vesting based on the achievement of business 
performance and the remaining 30% based on continued employment with the Group till the end of third year.
• LTIP is that the Company’s performance, measured in terms of Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) (being the movement in a company’s share 
price plus reinvested dividends), is compared over the performance period with the performance of the companies as defined in the scheme 
from the date of grant. The extent to which an award vests will depend on the Company’s TSR rank against a group of peer companies 
(‘Adapted Comparator Group’) at the end of the performance period and as moderated by Remuneration Committee. The vesting schedule is 
shown in the table below, with adjusted straight-line vesting in between the points shown and rounding down to the nearest whole share.

The performance condition is measured by taking the Company’s TSR over the four weeks immediately preceding the date of grant and over 
the four weeks immediately preceding the end of the performance period, and comparing its performance with that of the comparator group 
described above. The information to enable this calculation to be carried out on behalf of the Remuneration Committee (‘the Committee’) is 
provided by the Company’s advisers. The Committee considers that this performance condition, which requires that the Company’s total return 
has out-performed a group of companies chosen to represent the mining sector, provides a reasonable alignment of the interests of the 
Executive Directors and the wider management group with those of the shareholders.

In the year ended 31 March 2014, 2,228,956 options lapsed in total and 371,406 options vested. As at 31 March 2014, 8,517 ,348 options 
remained outstanding and 345,230 options were exercisable at the year end. The weighted average share price for the share options exercised 
during the year was £8.5.
All share-based awards of the Group are equity-settled as defined by IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’. The fair value of these awards has been 
determined at the date of grant of the award allowing for the effect of any market-based performance conditions. This fair value, adjusted by 
the Group’s estimate of the number of awards that will eventually vest as a result of non-market conditions, is expensed uniformly over the 
vesting period.
The fair values were calculated using the Stochastic valuation model with suitable modifications to allow for the specific performance conditions 
of the LTIP . The inputs to the model include the share price at date of grant, exercise price, expected volatility, expected dividends, expected 
term and the risk free rate of interest. A progressive dividend growth policy is assumed in all fair value calculations. Expected volatility has been 
calculated using historical share prices over the period to date of grant that is commensurate with the performance period of the option. The 
share prices of the mining companies in the Adapted Comparator Group have been modelled based on historical price movements over the 
period to date of grant which is also commensurate with the performance period for the option. The history of share prices is used to determine 
the volatility and correlation of share prices for the companies in the Adapted Comparator Group and is needed for the Stochastic valuation 
model of their future TSR performance relative to the Company’s TSR performance. All options are assumed to be exercised six months after 
vesting.

32. Retirement benefits
The Group operates pension schemes for the majority of its employees in India, Australia, Africa and Ireland.
(a) Defined contribution schemes
Indian pension schemes
Central Recognised Provident Fund
The Central Recognised Provident Fund relates to all full-time Indian employees of the Group. The amount contributed by the Group is a 
designated percentage of 12% of basic salary less contributions made as part of the Pension Fund (see below), together with an additional 
contribution of 12% (limited to a maximum contribution of 30% in case of the Iron Ore Segment) of the salary of the employee.
The benefit is paid to the employee on their retirement or resignation from the Group.
Superannuation
Superannuation, another pension scheme applicable in India, is applicable only to executives in grade M4 and above. However, in case of Cairn 
India Group and Iron Ore Segment, the benefit is applicable to all executives. In Cairn India, it is applicable from the second year of 
employment. Certain companies hold policies with the Life Insurance Corporation of India (‘LIC’), to which they contribute a fixed amount 
relating to superannuation, and the pension annuity is met by the LIC as required, taking into consideration the contributions made. Accordingly, 
this scheme has been accounted for on a defined contribution basis and contributions are charged directly to the income statement. 
Pension Fund
The Pension Fund was established in 1995 and is managed by the Government of India. The employee makes no contribution to this fund but 
the employer makes a contribution of 8.33% of salary each month subject to a specified ceiling per employee. This must be provided for every 
permanent employee on the payroll.
At the age of superannuation, contributions cease and the individual receives a monthly payment based on the level of contributions through 
the years, and on their salary scale at the time they retire, subject to a maximum ceiling of salary level. The Government funds these payments, 
thus the Group has no additional liability beyond the contributions that it makes, regardless of whether the central fund is in surplus or deficit.
Australian Pension Scheme
The Group also operates defined contribution pension schemes in Australia. The contribution of a proportion of an employee’s salary into a 
superannuation fund is a compulsory legal requirement in Australia. The employer contributes 9.25% of the employee’s gross remuneration 
where the employee is covered by the industrial agreement and 12.25% of the basic remuneration for all other employees, into the employee’s 
fund of choice. All employees have the option to make additional voluntary contributions.
Zambian Pension Scheme
The KCM Pension Scheme is applicable to full-time permanent employees of KCM (subject to the fulfilment of certain eligibility criteria). The 
management of the scheme is vested in the trustees consisting of representatives of the employer and the members. The employer makes a 
monthly contribution to the KCM Pension Scheme and the member makes monthly contributions. 
All contributions to the KCM Pension Scheme in respect of a member cease to be payable when the member attains normal retirement age of 
55 years, or upon leaving the service of the employer, or when the member is permanently medically incapable of performing duties in the 
service of the employer. Upon such cessation of contribution on the grounds of normal retirement, or being rendered medically incapable of 
performing duties, or early voluntary retirement, the member is entitled to receive his accrued pension. The member is allowed to commute his/
her accrued pension subject to certain rules and regulations.  Financial Statements
174 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report and accounts FY2014
32. Retirement benefits continued
The Group has no additional liability beyond the contributions that it makes. Accordingly, this scheme has been accounted for on a defined 
contribution basis and contributions are charged directly to the income statement.
Skorpion Zinc Provident Fund, Namibia
The Skorpion Zinc Provident Fund is a defined contribution fund and is compulsory to all full time employees under the age of 60. Company 
contribution to the fund is a fixed percentage of 8% per month of pensionable salary, whilst the employee contributes 7% with the option of 
making additional contributions, over and above the normal contribution, up to a maximum of 12%.
Normal retirement age is 60 years and benefit payable is the member’s fund credit which is equal to all employer and employee contributions 
plus interest. The same applies when an employee resigns from Skorpion Zinc. The Fund provides disability cover which is equal to the member’s 
fund credit and a death cover of two times annual salary in the event of death before retirement. The latest actuarial value was performed  
31 December 2012. At that date the Fund was in credit. Current membership total is 809.
The Group has no additional liability beyond the contributions that it makes. Accordingly, this scheme has been accounted for on a defined 
contribution basis and contributions are charged directly to the income statement.
Black Mountain (Pty) Limited, South Africa Pension & Provident Funds
Black Mountain Mining (Pty) Ltd has two retirement funds, both administered by Alexander Forbes, a registered financial service provider. Both 
funds form part of the Alexander Forbes umbrella fund and are defined contribution funds. 
Membership of both funds is compulsory for all permanent employees under the age of 60. 
Lisheen Mine, Ireland Pension Funds 
Lisheen Pension Plan is for all employees. Lisheen pays 5% and employees pays 5% with the option to make Additional Voluntary Contributions 
(‘AVC’s’) if desired. Executive contributions are 15% by Lisheen and a minimum of 5% by the employee with the option to make AVC’s if desired. 
Death benefit is three times salary for employees and four times salary for executives. Pension and Life Cover ceases at 65.
The Group has no additional liability beyond the contributions that it makes. Accordingly, this scheme has been accounted for on a defined 
contribution basis and contributions are charged directly to the income statement.
(b) Defined benefit schemes
India
The Gratuity schemes are defined benefit schemes which are open to all Group employees in India who have a minimum of five years of service 
with their employing company. These schemes are funded by the Group in some subsidiaries. Based on actuarial valuation, a provision is 
recognised in full for the projected obligation over and above the funds held in scheme. In case where there is no funding held by the scheme, 
full provision is recognised in the balance sheet. Under these schemes, benefits are provided based on final pensionable pay.
The assets of the schemes are held in separate funds and a full actuarial valuation of the schemes is carried out on an annual basis.
Sesa Sterlite 
The Iron ore, Aluminium and copper division of Sesa Sterlite contribute to the LIC Fund based on an actuarial valuation every year. Sesa Sterlite’s 
Gratuity scheme is accounted for on a defined benefit basis. The latest actuarial valuation was performed as at 31 March 2014 using the 
projected unit credit actuarial method. At that date the fund was in deficit.
BALCO
At BALCO, all employees who are scheduled to retire on or before 31 March 2014 are being paid by BALCO. The Gratuity scheme is accounted for 
as a defined benefit scheme for all employees scheduled to retire after 31 March 2014. A provision is recognised based on the latest actuarial 
valuation which was performed as at 31 March 2014 using the projected unit actuarial method. At that date the fund was in deficit.
HZL
HZL contributes to the LIC based on an actuarial valuation every year. HZL ’s Gratuity scheme is accounted for on a defined benefit basis. The 
latest actuarial valuation was performed as at 31 March 2014 using the projected unit actuarial method. At that date the fund was in deficit.
TSPL
TSPL contributes to the LIC based on an actuarial valuation. Liabilities with regard to the Gratuity scheme are fully provided in the Balance Sheet 
and are determined by actuarial valuation as at the balance sheet date and as per gratuity regulations for TSPL. The latest actuarial valuation 
was performed as at 31 March 2014 using the projected unit actuarial method. 
Cairn 
Cairn contributes to the LIC based on an actuarial valuation every year. Cairn India Group’s Gratuity scheme is accounted for on a defined 
benefit basis. The latest actuarial valuation was performed as at 31 March 2014 using the projected unit actuarial method. At that date the 
fund was in deficit.

32. Retirement benefits continued
Zambia
Specified permanent employees of KCM are entitled to receive medical and retirement severance benefits. This comprises two months’ basic 
pay for every completed year of service with an earliest service start date of 1 July 2004. Under this scheme, benefits are provided based on  
final pensionable pay and a full actuarial valuation of the scheme is carried out on an annual basis. The accruals are not contributed to any  
fund and are in the form of provisions in KCM’s accounts.
On the death of an employee during service, a lump sum amount is paid to his or her dependants. This amount is equal to sixty months’ basic 
pay for employees who joined before 1 April 2000 and thirty months’ basic pay for employees who joined on or after 1 April 2000. For fixed 
term contract employees, the benefit payable on death is thirty months’ basic pay.
As at 31 March 2014, membership of pension schemes across SSL, BALCO, HZL, MEL, TSPL, KCM and Cairn stood at 25,286 employees  
(31 March 2013: 26,690). The deficits, principal actuarial assumptions and other aspects of these schemes are disclosed in further detail in  
notes (d) and (e) below.
(c) Pension scheme costs 
Contributions of US$62.9 million and US$nil in respect of defined benefit schemes were outstanding and prepaid respectively as at

In India, the mortality tables used, assume that a person aged 60 at the end of the balance sheet date has a future life expectancy of 19 years.
Assumptions regarding mortality for Indian entities are based on mortality table of ‘Indian Assured Lives Mortality (2006-2008)’ published by 
the Institute of Actuaries of India.
Assumptions regarding mortality for KCM are based on World Health Organisation Life Tables for 1999 applicable to Zambia which has been 
taken as a reference point. Based on this, a mortality table which is appropriate for the workers of Konkola Copper Mines plc has been derived.

(k) Sensitivity analysis
Below is the sensitivity analysis determined for significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of defined benefit obligations and based 
on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the reporting period while holding all other assumptions constant.
(US$ million) 
Increase/
(decrease) 
in defined 
benefit 
obligation
Discount rate
Increase by 0.50% (4.7)
Decrease by 0.50% 5.1
Salary increase
Increase by 0.50% 5.0
Decrease by 0.50% (4.6)
The above sensitivity analysis may not be representative of the actual benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would 
occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
(l) Risk analysis
The Group is exposed to a number of risks in the defined benefit plans. Most significant risks pertaining to defined benefits plans and 
management estimation of the impact of these risks are as follows:
Investment risk
The most of the Indian defined benefit plans are funded with the Life Insurance Corporation of India. The Group does not have any liberty to 
manage the fund provided to the Life Insurance Corporation of India.
The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to Government of India bonds 
for the Group’s Indian operations. If the return on plan asset is below this rate, it will create a plan deficit.
Interest risk
A decrease in the interest rate on plan assets will increase the plan liability.
Longevity risk/life expectancy
The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of plan participants both 
during and at the end of the employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan liability.
Salary growth risk
The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan participants. An increase in the 
salary of the plan participants will increase the plan liability.
33. Capital management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard continuity, maintain a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios in order to 
support its business and provide adequate return to shareholders through continuing growth.
The Group sets the amount of capital required on the basis of annual business and long-term operating plans which include capital and other 
strategic investments. The funding requirement is met through a mixture of equity, internal accruals, convertible bonds and other long-term and 
short-term borrowings.
The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, being the ratio of net debt as a percentage of total capital.
(US$ million) 
As at 
31 March 
2014
As at 
31 March 
2013
Total equity 17,974.8 18,869.0
Net debt 7,919.5 8,615.6
Total capital 25,894.3 27,484.6
Gearing 30.6% 31.4%
The reduction in the gearing ratio compared against the 2013 ratio is due to an 8% decrease in the net debt of the Group set off against a 
decrease of 5% in total equity. The primary reason for the decrease in net debt is due to increased levels of liquid investments, cash and cash 
equivalents when compared to 2013.

Guarantees
Companies within the Group provide guarantees within the normal course of business. Guarantees have also been provided in respect of certain 
short-term and long-term borrowings.
A summary of the most significant guarantees is set out below:
As at 31 March 2014, US$234.9 million of guarantees were advanced to banks, suppliers etc. in the normal course of business (2013: US$217 .1 
million). The Group has also entered into guarantees and bonds advanced to the customs authorities in India of US$727 .2 million relating to the 
export and payment of import duties on purchases of raw material and capital goods including export obligations (2013: US$1,638.8 million).
Cairn PSC guarantee to Government
The Group has provided parent Company guarantee for the Cairn India Group’s obligation under the Production Sharing Contract (‘PSC’).
Cairn India have provided various other guarantees under the Cairn India Group’s bank facilities for the Cairn India Group’s share of minimum 
work programme commitments of US$18.9 million is outstanding as of 31 March 2014 (2013: US$22.1 million).
Export obligations
The Indian entities of the Group have export obligations of US$3,789.9 million (2013: US$4,013.4 million) on account of concessional rates of 
import duty paid on capital goods under the Export Promotion Capital Goods Scheme and under the Advance Licence Scheme for import of raw 
material laid down by the Government of India.
In the event of the Group’s inability to meet its obligations, the Group’s liability would be US$478.4 million (2013: US$501.7 million), reduced in 
proportion to actual exports, plus applicable interest.
Contingencies
MEL claims with Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (‘TNEB’)
TNEB is claiming US$17 .0 million from MEL for an electricity self-generation levy for the period from May 1999 to June 2003. This claim has 
arisen since the commissioning of MEL ’s captive power plant in 1999. The Company has sought an exemption from the application of this levy 
from the Government of Tamil Nadu. The application is under consideration. Meanwhile, the Madras High Court has in its recent Order, remitted 
back the case to the State of Tamil Nadu, to take a decision afresh on the representation for grant of tax exemption on consumption of 
electricity and directed to pass a detailed speaking order.
HZL: Department of Mines and Geology
The Department of Mines and Geology of the State of Rajasthan issued several show cause notices in August, September and October 2006 to 
HZL, totalling US$55.6 million. These notices alleged unlawful occupation and unauthorised mining of associated minerals other than zinc and 
lead at HZL ’s Rampura Agucha, Rajpura Dariba and Zawar mines in Rajasthan during the period from July 1968 to March 2006. HZL believes 
that the claim becoming an obligation of the Company is unlikely and thus no provision has been made in the financial statements. HZL has 
filed writ petitions in the High Court of Rajasthan in Jodhpur and has obtained a stay in respect of these demands. 
RICHTER: Income Tax
The Group through its subsidiaries Richter Holdings Limited (‘Richter’) and Westglobe Limited (‘Westglobe’) in 2007 acquired the entire stake in 
Finsider International Company Limited based in the United Kingdom. Finsider at that point in time held 51 % stake in erstwhile Sesa Goa 
Limited. In October 2013, the Indian Tax Authorities (‘Tax Authorities’) have served an order on Richter and Westglobe for alleged failure to 
deduct withholding tax on capital gain on the indirect acquisition of shares in April 2007 . The Tax Authorities held that Richter and Westglobe 
were assessed in default for non-deduction of tax while making payment for acquiring the shares in 2007 . The Tax Authorities determined the 
liability for such non-deduction of tax as US$145.8 million comprising of tax and interest in case of Richter and US$97 .1 million in case of 
Westglobe. Being aggrieved, Richter and Westglobe filed appeals before first appellate authority. As regards constitutional validity of 
retrospective amendment made by Finance Act 2012 for imposing obligation to deduct tax on payments made against an already concluded 
transaction, writ petitions were filed in the High Court of Karnataka and the hearing is in progress. Richter and Westglobe believe that they are 
not liable for such withholding tax and intends to defend the proceedings. Financial Statements

37. Commitments, guarantees and contingencies continued
Cairn India: Income Tax
In March 2014, Cairn India received a show cause notice from the Indian Tax Authorities (‘Tax Authorities’) for not deducting withholding tax on 
the payments made to Cairn UK Holdings Limited (‘CUHL ’) UK, for acquiring shares of Cairn India Holdings Limited (‘CIHL ’), as part of their 
internal reorganisation. Tax authorities have stated in the said notice that a short-term capital gain has accrued to CUHL on transfer of the 
shares of CIHL to Cairn India, in financial year 2006–2007 , on which tax should have been withheld by the Company. The Company believes 
that the transaction is not liable for any withholding tax on account of retrospective amendment by insertion of Explanation 5 to Section 9(1)(i) 
of Indian Income Tax Act 1961 and that Cairn India intends to defend its position before the Tax Authorities, as well as taking appropriate legal 
course by way of filing writ petitions challenging the constitutional validity of retrospective amendment.
Sesa Sterlite Limited: Contractor claim
Shenzhen Shandong Nuclear Power Construction Co. Limited (‘SSNP’) subsequent to terminating the EPC contract invoked arbitration as per the 
contract alleging non-payment of their dues towards construction of a 210MW co-generation power plant for 6mtpa expansion project, and 
filed a claim of US$296 million. SSNP also filed a petition under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 before the Bombay High 
Court praying for interim relief. The Bombay High Court initially dismissed their petition, but on a further appeal by SSNP , the Division Bench of 
the Bombay High Court directed Jharsuguda aluminium to deposit a bank guarantee for an amount of US$29.8 million as a security, being a 
prima facie representation of the claim, until arbitration proceedings are completed. Jharsuguda Aluminium has deposited a bank guarantee of 
equivalent amount. Management is of the opinion that this claim is not valid under the terms of the contract with SSNP and it is unlikely that 
SSNP can legally sustain the claim and accordingly, no provision is considered necessary.
Miscellaneous disputes – SSL, HZL, MEL, BALCO, Cairn and Lisheen
The Group is subject to various claims and exposures which arise in the ordinary course of conducting and financing its business from the income 
tax, excise, indirect authorities and others. These claims and exposures mostly relate to the assessable values of sales and purchases or to 
incomplete documentation supporting the companies’ returns or other claims.
The approximate value of claims against the Group companies total US$1,150.1 million (2013: US$1,212.7 million), of which US$30.2 million 
(2013: US$27 .2 million) is included as a provision in the Balance Sheet as at 31 March 2014. 
The Group considers that it can take steps such that the risks can be mitigated and that there are no significant unprovided liabilities arising.

a. Call option – HZL 
In pursuance to the Government of India’s policy of disinvestment and the Share Purchase Agreement and a Shareholder’s Agreement (‘SHA’) 
both dated 4 April 2002 entered into with the Government of India, the Company acquired 26% equity interest in HZL. Under the terms of the 
SHA, the Group had two call options to purchase all of the Government of India’s shares in HZL at fair market value. The Group exercised the first 
call option on 29 August 2003 and acquired an additional 18.9% of HZL ’s issued share capital. The Company also acquired additional 20% of 
the equity capital in HZL through an open offer, increasing its shareholding to 64.9%. The second call option provides Group the right to acquire 
the Government of India’s remaining 29.5% share in HZL. This call option is subject to the right of the Government of India to sell 3.5% of HZL 
shares to HZL employees. The Group exercised the second call option via its letter dated 21 July 2009. The Government of India disputed the 
validity of call option and has refused to act upon the second call option. Consequently the Company invoked arbitration and filed a statement 
of claim. The arbitration proceedings are under progress in early stages. The next date of hearing is fixed on 13 September 2014.
b. Call option – BALCO 
The Group purchased a 51.0% holding in BALCO from the Government of India on March 2, 2001. Under the terms of the shareholder’s 
agreement (‘SHA’) for BALCO, the Group has a call option that allows it to purchase the Government of India’s remaining ownership interest in 
BALCO at any point from 2 March 2004. The Group exercised this option on 19 March 2004. However, the Government of India has contested 
the valuation and validity of the option and contended that the clauses of the SHA violate the provision of Section 111A of the (Indian) 
Companies Act, 1956 by restricting the rights of Government of India to transfer its shares and that as a result such provisions of the SHA were 
null and void. Subsequently the Group referred the matter to arbitration as provided in the SHA and the majority award of the arbitral tribunal 
rejected the claims of the Group on the ground that the clauses relating to the call option, the right of first refusal, the ‘tag-along’ rights and the 
restriction on the transfer of shares violate the (Indian) Companies Act, 1956 and are not enforceable. 
The Group challenged the validity of the majority award under section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 in the High Court of 
Delhi and sought for setting aside the arbitration award to the extent that it holds these clauses ineffective and inoperative. The Government of 
India also filed an application before the High Court of Delhi to partially set aside the arbitral award in respect of certain matters involving 
valuation. The High Court of Delhi passed an order dated 10 August 2011 directing our application and the application by the Government of 
India to be heard together as they arise from a common arbitral award. The matter is currently pending before the High Court of Delhi and 
scheduled for final hearing on 21 August 2014.
On 9 January 2012, the Group offered to acquire the Government of India’s interests in HZL and BALCO for US$2,577 .7 million and US$296.5 
million, respectively. The Group has, by way of letters dated 10 April 2012 and 6 July 2012, sought to engage with the Government of India on 
the same terms as the offer. This offer was separate from the contested exercise of the call options, and Group proposed to withdraw the 
ongoing litigations in relation to the contested exercise of the options should the offer be accepted. To date, the offer has not been accepted by 
the Government of India and therefore there is no certainty that the acquisition will proceed. 
The Group continue to include the shareholding in the two companies HZL and BALCO, in respect of which the Group has a call option as 
non-controlling interest.

41. Konkola Copper Mines: Value Added Tax
An assessment of output tax amounting to US$600 million has been raised by the Zambia Revenue Authority (‘ZRA’) covering the years 2011, 
2012 and the first quarter of 2013. The basis of assessment is that KCM has not provided all the documentary evidence that is required under 
Rule 18 of the Value Added Tax Rules to prove an export and as a consequence, all sales of product that were zero rated in the returns have been 
standard rated by assessment. KCM has filed for judicial review of the ZRA’s decision to standard rate the export products. After legally analysing 
the interpretation of Rule 18, management believes that KCM has got a reasonably strong arguable defence in the case.

5  Pursuant to the Scheme of Amalgamation.
The Group owns directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, more than half of the voting power of all of its subsidiaries as mentioned in the list 
above, and the Group is able to govern its subsidiaries’ financial and operating policies so as to benefit from their activities.
44. Group restructuring:
Pursuant of the Scheme of Amalgamation (the ‘Scheme’) sanctioned by the Indian and Mauritius Courts, Group’s subsidiary companies viz. 
Sterlite Energy Limited, Sterlite Industries (India) Limited, Aluminium Business of Vedanta Aluminium Limited, Ekaterina Limited and Residual 
business of Madras Aluminium Company Limited merged with Sesa Goa Limited (‘SGL ’) (A subsidiary of the Group).Bloom Fountain Limited, a 
subsidiary of Sesa Goa Limited acquired a 38.7% stake in Cairn India Limited (‘Cairn’). Consequent to this, Cairn became a subsidiary of SGL. By 
way of a slump sale agreement dated 19 August 2013 between Vedanta Aluminium Limited (‘VAL ’) and SSL, the power business consisting of 
1,215MW thermal power facility situated at Jharsuguda and 300MW co-generation facility (90MW operational and 210 MW under 
development) at Lanjigarh, was transferred on a going concern basis at its carrying value.
Subsequently, the name of SGL has been changed to Sesa Sterlite Limited (‘SSL ’).
These transactions are within subsidiaries of the Company and will not have any acquisition accounting impact other than change in the 
economic shareholding percentage. The simplification exercise has resulted in simplifying the structure, cross holding and aligning the debt with 
cash flow and change in economic holding percentage mainly in VAL and Cairn. VAL ’s effective holding has changed from 87 .6% to 58.3% 
whereas Cairn’s reduced from 49.8% to 34.3%. 
45. Ultimate controlling party
At 31 March 2014, the ultimate controlling party of the Group was Volcan, which is controlled by persons related to the Executive Chairman,  
Mr Anil Agarwal. Volcan is incorporated in the Bahamas, and does not produce Group accounts.

47. Company accounting policies
The Vedanta Resources plc (‘the Company’) balance sheet and related notes have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Principles and UK company law (‘UK GAAP’). The financial information has been prepared on an historical cost basis 
except preference shares which are stated at fair value. 
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the profit and loss account of the Company is not presented as part of these financial 
statements. The loss after tax for the period of the Company amounted to US$128.3 million (2013: loss of US$15.7 million)
These financial statements are presented in US dollars being the functional currency of the Company.
Significant accounting policies
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries represent equity holdings in subsidiaries except preference shares, valued at cost less any provision for impairment. 
Investments are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
Investment in preference shares of subsidiaries
Investments in preference shares of subsidiaries are stated at fair value. The fair value is represented by the face value of the preference shares 
as the investments are redeemable at any time for their face value at the option of the Company.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand, short-term deposits with banks and short-term highly liquid 
investments that are readily convertible into cash which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and are held for the purpose of 
meeting short-term cash commitments.
Financial asset investments
Financial asset investments are classified as available for sale under FRS 26 and are initially recorded at cost and then remeasured at subsequent 
reporting dates to fair value. Unrealised gains and losses on financial asset investments are recognised directly in equity. On disposal or 
impairment of the investments, the gains and losses in equity are recycled to the income statement. 
Currency translation
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company, being US dollars, are translated into US dollars at the spot 
exchange rates ruling at the date of transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies at the balance sheet date are 
translated into US dollars at year end exchange rates, or at a contractual rate if applicable. 
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and provision for impairment. 
Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is provided in full on all timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to 
pay less tax, at a future date, subject to the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Share-based payments
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured at fair value at the date at which they are granted. The fair value of share 
awards with market-related vesting conditions are determined by an external valuer and the fair value at the grant date is expensed on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Company’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. The estimate of the number of 
awards likely to vest is reviewed at each balance sheet date up to the vesting date at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the current 
expectations. No adjustment is made to the fair value after the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or not exercised. Amounts 
recharged to subsidiaries in respect of awards granted to employees of subsidiaries are recognised as intercompany debtors until repaid. 
Borrowings
Interest bearing loans are recorded at the net proceeds received i.e. net of direct transaction costs. Finance charges, including premiums payable 
on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on accruals basis and charged to the profit and loss account using the 
effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which 
they arise.

193 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report and accounts FY2014
47. Company accounting policies continued
Convertible bonds
The Convertible bonds issued by VRJL and VRJL-II (Note 54) are accounted for as a compound instrument. The gross proceeds (net of issue 
costs) were lent to the Company by VRJL and VRJL-II. The equity component has been recognised in a separate reserve of the Company and is 
not subsequently remeasured. The recognition of the equity component by the company acts to reduce the payable to VRJL and VRJL-II which 
arises once the gross proceeds are borrowed. The liability component is held at amortised cost. The interest expensed on the liability component 
is calculated by applying an effective interest rate. The difference between interest expensed and interest paid is added to the carrying amount 
of the liability component.
The bonds are first convertible into preference shares of the issuer having a principal value of US$100,000 per preference share, which are 
exchanged immediately for ordinary shares of the Company.
Financial instruments
The Company has elected to take the exemption provided in paragraph 2D of FRS 29 in respect of these parent Company financial statements. 
Full disclosures are provided in Note 28 to the financial statements of the Group for the period ended 31 March 2014.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at their fair value on the date of the derivative transaction and are remeasured at their fair 
value at subsequent balance sheet dates. 
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the profit and loss account. The 
hedged item is recorded at fair value and any gain or loss is recorded in the profit and loss account and is offset by the gain or loss from the 
change in the fair value of the derivative.
Derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market at the balance sheet date and gains or losses 
are recognised in the profit and loss account immediately.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. Any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. If 
a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to net profit or loss for the 
year.
Cash flow statement
The Company’s individual financial statements are outside the scope of FRS 1 Cash Flow Statements because the Company prepares publicly 
available Group financial statements, which include a consolidated cash flow statement. Accordingly, the Company does not present an 
individual company cash flow statement.
Related party disclosures
The Company’s individual financial statements are exempt from the requirements of FRS 8 Related Party Disclosures because its individual 
financial statements are presented together with its Group financial statements. Accordingly, the individual financial statements do not include 
related party disclosures.
Financial guarantees 
Guarantees issued by the Company on behalf of other Group companies are designated as ‘Insurance Contracts’. Accordingly these are shown 
as contingent liabilities. (Note 57)
Debtors
Debtors are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowance for estimated irrecoverable amounts. An allowance for 
impairment for debtors is made where there is an indication of a reduction in the recoverability of the carrying value of the debtor.
Creditors
Creditors are stated at their nominal value. Financial Statements

Source of information
In respect of all businesses, the information has been certified by in house geologist on behalf of Group management.
Basis of preparation
Ore reserves and mineral resources reported herein comply with the ‘Australasian Code for Reporting of Identified Mineral Resources and Ore 
Reserves’, other than those relating to Konkola Copper Mines plc (‘KCM’) which complies with the South African Code for Reporting of Mineral 
Reserves and Mineral Resources (the ‘SAMREC Code’). The former code is prepared by the Joint Ore Reserves Committee of the Australasian 
Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Australian Institute of Geoscientists, and Minerals Council of Australia, and is commonly referred to as the 
‘JORC Code’. As at the date of this document, the editions of the JORC and SAMREC Codes in force are dated December 2004 and March 2000, 
respectively. The JORC and SAMREC Codes recognise a fundamental distinction between resources and reserves. 
The terms and definitions in the SAMREC Code are consistent with those used in the JORC Code with minor differences in terminology – the 
JORC Code uses the term Ore Reserve whilst the SAMREC Code uses the term Mineral Reserve. For the purposes of ore and mineral resources 
reported herein, the term ore resources have been used throughout.
Oil & gas reserves and resources have been prepared according to the Petroleum Resources Management Systems (‘PRMS’) approved in March 
2007 by the Society of Petroleum Engineers, the world Petroleum Council, the American Association of Petroleum Geologist, and the Society of 
Petroleum Evaluation Engineers.
Mineral resources are based on mineral occurrences quantified on the basis of geological data and an assumed cut-off grade, and are divided 
into Measured, Indicated and Inferred categories reflecting decreasing confidence in geological and/or grade continuity. The reporting of 
resource estimates carries the implication that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic exploitation. An ore or mineral reserve is 
the economically mineable part of a measured or indicated mineral resource. It includes the effect of dilution and losses which may occur when 
the material is mined. Appropriate assessments, which may include feasibility studies, need to have been carried out and include consideration 
of and modification by realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors.
These assessments demonstrate at the time of reporting that extraction could be reasonably justified. Ore reserves are sub-divided in order of 
decreasing confidence into proved ore reserves and probable ore reserves.
The measured and indicated mineral resources have been reported as being inclusive of those mineral resources modified to produce the ore 
reserves, in addition to the ore reserves. The resource and reserve estimates provided herein comply with the resource and reserve definitions of 
the JORC Code, other than those relating to KCM which comply with the SAMREC Code.

•  Hire has seen an upturn in bookings to date for the 2015 wedding season, and the business is in 
excellent shape to build market share, following a difficult two years.
Commenting on the results and outlook, Brian Brick, Chief Executive Officer, said:
“We continue to make good progress in the delivery of our strategic priorities. The modernisation of the 
store portfolio is achieving the anticipated returns and we have exciting plans for the implementation of 
our multi-channel shopping environment. The adoption of the master brand “Moss Bros” and launch of 
our sub brands in Autumn 2014 have improved the resonance the brand has with current and potential 
customers of all age groups.
The early response to the 2015 Spring/Summer retail range is positive, and retail like-for-like* sales are 
continuing to improve year on year. Hire is showing signs of recovery and we are well placed to maximise 
revenues in 2015 following a difficult two years for wedding related hire.
The Group’s trading performance continues positively, in line with the Board’s expectations.”

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
I am pleased to report another year of continued good progress for the Group. 
Total like-for-like* sales including VAT reflected a 5.5% increase on the prior year. Profit before taxation 
was up 9.0% to £4.8m, compared with £4.4m in the previous year. EBITDA** continued on a positive trend 
to £9.7m, compared with £9.2m in the previous year. Similarly, our cash position continues to be very 
strong, despite investing in additional hire stock and the ongoing refit programme.
The retail environment was more competitive during the year, with heavy discounting around new events 
like Black Friday. We remained focused on our core offer and traded our way through what was for us and 
most retailers a significant shift in consumer buying patterns.
We continued to develop the Moss Bros master brand and re-launched the supporting sub-brands as Moss 
London, Moss 1851, and Moss Esq., and ran a number of creative marketing campaigns, which attracted 
positive national recognition. 
Actions to improve performance further have included investment in our product offer, which included the 
launch of a more modern range through the Moss London brand, the development of a strong casualwear 
range and the successful launch of hire lounge suits. The store refit programme continued with 14 refits 
completed in the year, and given the success of these refits both from a trading and a brand perception 
viewpoint, we have confirmed plans to accelerate our store refit programme in 2015, with 27 refits planned. 
The increased investment will impact cash in the short term but the proven three year payback means 
we will quickly recoup the funds invested and accelerate the reappraisal of our brands amongst our 
target customers.
In conjunction with these commercial initiatives, the business participated in the ‘Undercover Boss’ TV 
programme, which, as well as promoting the brand, highlighted a number of opportunities to improve the 
way we engage our employees in the development of the business. We will be investing in resources in the 
coming year to accelerate our employee development programme. 
We continued the development of the organisation to support our multi-channel aspirations, bringing 
marketing and e-commerce together in early 2015. 
The team continues to apply strong cash and working capital controls and the business continues 
to be debt free, with a healthy cash balance, supporting the Board’s progressive dividend and 
investment policies.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
CONTINUED
The Board is proposing the payment of a final dividend of 3.55 pence per share to be paid on 26 June 2015 
to all shareholders on the register on 5 June 2015 (ex dividend date 4 June 2015). The total dividend for 
the year is 5.25 pence per share, an increase of 5% on the previous year. It is our intention to continue this 
progressive dividend policy balanced against the wider investment needs of the business. 
In the coming year, we will accelerate our capital expenditure through the store refit programme, leverage 
the CRM database with one single view of the customer and build on our multi-channel offer. 
The continued development of the Moss Bros brand will enhance our position as ‘the No.1 men’s suit 
specialist’. Although we see a continuation of competitive market conditions, we are well placed to build on 
our specialist credentials and to grow our market share.
Finally, we would like to thank our people for their continued hard work and contribution to another 
successful year.

STRATEGY AND OBJECTIVES
Moss Bros Group PLC (“the Group”) retails and hires formal wear for men, predominantly in the UK. The 
Group operates predominantly through Moss Bros branded mainstream stores, promoting a number of 
own branded sub brands and third party brands. The Group also trades through the premium Savoy Taylors 
Guild fascia, where there is a historical link in areas such as the Strand in London.
The Group’s vision is to be the No. 1 men’s suit specialist through creating a multi channel menswear 
business focused on our target customer groups. There are three pillars to this strategy:
1)  Implement a clear brand strategy leveraging the Moss Bros master brand and complementary 
sub brands.
2) Achieve full multi channel capability so that customers can shop seamlessly across all channels.
3)  Revitalise the customer experience across all channels through great service and 
great environments. 
Through the customer insight project completed in 2013 our customers have told us very clearly how much 
they value the Moss Bros brand for its expertise, heritage, product quality and value for money. Some 
potential customers lacked awareness of our retailing credentials and product offer. We have therefore 
continued to develop the positioning of the brand, and we re-launched our sub brands under the master 
brand of Moss Bros in Autumn 2014. Our sub brands now comprise:
– Moss London – Slim fit styles targeted at younger, style conscious (formerly Ventuno)
– Moss 1851 – Great quality suits with a tailored fit for business and leisure (formerly Blazer)
–  Moss Savoy Taylors Guild – Our heritage brand, classic, great quality and luxury fabrics with a 
regular fit
– Moss Esq. – Great value suits for everyday wear with regular fit (formerly Dehavilland)
A key objective of our e-commerce initiatives is to provide a fully multi-channel offer to all customers, 
offering a number of ways to shop. The project to create a single customer database, including full 
customer transaction history, is nearing completion and offers significant CRM opportunities for the 
business. Our on-line performance continues to grow, with significant increases from launch in customer 
traffic flow, conversion rates and sales, particularly through mobile and tablet channels. There are also 
opportunities to exploit international on-line growth. 
There are also opportunities to grow and develop our UK store estate. The UK store refurbishment 
programme remains on track with positive results seen from refitted stores compared to non-refitted 
stores, with refitted stores achieving our three year payback target and an enhanced customer experience. 
We plan to accelerate the pace of refits in 2015.

RETAIL
There are 105 Moss Bros and Savoy Taylors Guild branded stores (2013/14: 104 in total) and 25 Moss Bros 
outlet stores (2013/14: 29) as at 31 January 2015, which trade Moss Bros own brands and carefully selected 
third party brands including Hugo Boss, Canali, Ted Baker, DKNY and French Connection, where the store 
profile demonstrates a demand for this type of product. The vast majority of the stores also have a Moss 
Bros Hire ‘store within a store’ operation within them.
In parallel with operational improvements, we have continued to review the positioning of the Moss Bros 
brand with current and potential customers and the overall perceived value of the offering. The concept of 
Moss Bros for Hire, Buy or Bespoke underpins our vision to be ‘the No. 1 men’s suit specialist’. 
HIRE
Moss Bros Hire is the market leader in the UK hire market and the number one recognised name for hire. 
We have 127 Moss Bros Hire outlets as at 31 January 2015 (2013/14: 129); all contained within core Moss 
Bros Retail and Savoy Taylors Guild Stores. 
E-COMMERCE
Our Retail website has seen significant increases from launch in customer traffic flow and conversion 
rates. Our mobile and tablet enabled site is performing well and offers significant potential for future 
growth. Our international focus has widened to now include local currency websites in Denmark, Sweden, 
the Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland and Australia. 
Our transactional Hire website continues to grow and ‘group booking’ functionality has now been added. 
Whilst still at an early stage of growth the results are encouraging and there is strong evidence of wedding 
hire customers beginning their journey online before engaging with our store estate to complete the 
transaction. Based on experience to date a number of enhancements are planned for 2015 to improve 
customer experience and grow the business. MOSS BROS GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014/15 I 7

Customer: Moss Bros Project Title: Report & Accounts 2014/15 T: 0207 055 6500 F: 020 7055 6600
SUPPLY CHAIN AND COSTS
The buying team continually assesses supplier performance, to ensure the most commercially beneficial 
results for the Group and to minimise lead times. Over the last few years, we have introduced direct 
sourcing from China and achieved a better buying margin as a result, whilst also improving the quality of 
our products. Costs remain tightly controlled with all expenditure carefully planned and monitored. With 
a continued increase in sales, the focus has shifted to process efficiencies, enabling us to further simplify 
the business. 
INFRASTRUCTURE
Appropriate deployment of information technology is vitally important to the success of our business and 
in enabling the establishment of a multi-channel shopping environment. The project to upgrade our main 
IT systems is due to complete in 2015 and will give us flexibility to actively develop our IT capability in 
response to customer demand.
The operational efficiency of our distribution centre based in Barking is closely monitored. Options for 
improving its performance, including space management, are continually appraised by the operations 
team to streamline the business.
PEOPLE
The need for talented and committed people across all areas of the Group requires a continuing focus on 
effective recruitment, induction and performance appraisal and management. We plan to invest further in 
this area in 2015. Training is provided to promote staff development and reduce staff turnover rates. 
Employment policies do not discriminate between employees or potential employees on the grounds of 
gender, colour, race, nationality, ethnic origin, national origin, religion, religious beliefs, sexual orientation 
or age. It remains the Group’s policy to give full and sympathetic consideration to the employment, 
training, career development and promotion of disabled employees. Special consideration is given to the 
continuity of employment of any employee becoming disabled after their employment has commenced and, 
where practicable, to the provision of alternative employment. 8 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
REVIEW OF OPERATIONS
The Group has continued to make good progress through the year. A focus on brand development, product 
improvement and strong operational delivery and cost control has enabled us to continue to grow profits. 
MULTI-CHANNEL PROJECT
Our previously stated project to implement a multi-channel shopping environment for our customers 
is nearing completion. The new hire website, launched in November 2013, marked the successful 
introduction of a single customer database across stores and on-line, including a full transaction history 
for customers. We are now in the final stages of rolling out our single customer database across our retail 
stores and websites. Once completed this will enable customers to shop for retail and hire seamlessly 
across a range of channels (in-store, PC, tablet, mobile) and we will be in a position to utilise customer 
relationship management software tools to focus customer communications on propositions that are 
relevant and appealing. An option for customers to receive their in store payment receipt via email has 
been introduced, and has been linked to a customer feedback system to monitor customer experience. 
As well as improving our customer experience, this will increase email collection rates and associated 
marketing opportunities. Social media is being used successfully to gain traction for the Moss Bros brand 
across a number of platforms.
RETAIL
We have continued to implement operational improvements across the business and our programme of 
refitting stores, together with the successful launch of our new sub brand line up, impacted positively 
on the like-for-like* sales, which were up by 7.1% on the previous year (2013/14: 6.4%). The promotional 
activity around Black Friday, held over the last weekend of November, generated significant customer 
interest across stores and online and affected the pattern of sales and margin across the key trading 
weeks, although there was some downward pressure on gross margins, which ended the year 0.1% below 
the previous year. Stock levels were kept closely under control. 
As planned, we opened six new stores and closed nine stores in the UK in the year. We are considering 
further new store opening opportunities in the UK in the next 12 months. The Group now trades from 
130 stores.
The inherent flexibility in our property estate gives us options in what we anticipate will be a fast changing 
retail landscape. The average lease length across the store portfolio is 53 months and we are targeting 
improved lease terms on renewal, of a 10 year term, with a tenant only break clause at year 5. The 
underpinning of hire and the demand for e-commerce ‘click & collect’ and ‘click & return’ points, together 
with advantageous lease deals, means there is an opportunity to expand our store footprint on a selective 
and cost effective basis, with good returns.
HIRE
Overall like-for-like* hire sales fell by 3.6% in the year. The shortfall was however confined to weddings 
with evening wear, Royal Ascot and school proms showing good levels of growth. We have carried out a 
full review of our product offer and customer experience. We have invested in new hire stock, introducing 
our lounge suit offer with two new styles, introducing new styling within our morning suit offer, and adding 
to our branded ranges which have proved popular. A number of initiatives around stock management and 
customer communications have been launched and we are confident that the product availability and 
customer experience will be improved for the 2015 season. 
We are confident our position as the leading hire brand will be maintained through the product and 
technology initiatives currently underway.

E-COMMERCE
Sales performed very strongly, with the rate of sales growth at 58.9% up on the previous year. Online sales 
now represent 7.8% of total sales (2013/14: 5.1%). Site traffic, conversion and retention rates are all on 
improving trends and the returns rate is steady at 23%. The mobile and tablet enabled website continues to 
grow strongly and now comprises 35% of total e-commerce sales.
Expansion into international markets is underway with dedicated, local currency sites for Eire, Sweden, 
Denmark, Netherlands, and Australia. Further territories are planned for 2015/16. E-commerce has also 
proved to be a very efficient means of clearing end of lines stock with faster sell through rates and an 
improvement in prices achieved.
The hire website continues to gain traction and we believe the recently added group hire functionality 
should support further growth. Results are encouraging and there is strong evidence of wedding hire 
customers beginning their journey online before engaging with our stores to complete the transaction – a 
true multi channel experience. Based on customer feedback a number of enhancements are planned for 
2015 to improve customer experience and therefore conversion rates.
SUPPLY CHAIN AND COSTS
The earlier clearance of residual stocks has enabled new seasons’ stock to be introduced in stores earlier, 
improving the customer offer and enabling much greater scope for tactical promotions. 
The increase in direct sourcing of stock from the Far East has increased our exposure to foreign exchange 
risk which is mitigated by our hedging policy.
PEOPLE
The next stage of the development of the business will focus closely on the development of our people, with 
clear career paths established so that staff who aspire to progress within the business have the scope and 
support to do so. Investment in staff training in the form of recruitment, induction, performance appraisal 
and performance management continues with a range of courses available and increased numbers of staff 
being trained. We will increase our focus on this area during 2015. Our customer insight project confirmed 
that excellent customer service is vitally important to our customers and will clearly differentiate us, 
particularly given our intended implementation of a multi-channel shopping environment. 
FINANCIAL REVIEW
Performance improvement across the business continued in 2014/15 with good like-for-like* sales growth 
and continued control over costs. Underlying profit before taxation on continuing operations was £4.8m, 
compared with a profit of £4.4m in the previous year, an increase of 9.0%.
REVENUE
Overall revenue was up 5.1% (up 5.5% like-for-like*) on the previous year to £114.7m. Retail was up 7.0% 
(up 7.1% like-for-like*) on the previous year. As reported, hire had a difficult year and was 4.9% lower 
(down 3.6% like-for-like*) on the previous year. 
GROSS MARGIN
Underlying gross margin decreased by 70 basis points in the year (58.3% vs 59.0%), due in part to the lower 
participation of hire, which is higher margin, in the overall sales mix.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share on total earnings was 4.02 pence compared with 3.76 pence per share last year. 
Diluted earnings per share, on total earnings, was 3.80 pence per share compared with 3.53 pence per 
share last year.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
CONTINUED
DIVIDEND
Given the strong progress made in 2014/15 and the ongoing cash generation the Board feels it is 
appropriate to propose the payment of a final dividend of 3.55 pence per share (2013/14: 4.7 pence) 
bringing the total for the year to 5.25 pence per share, compared with 5.0 pence per share for the 
year ended 25 January 2014, an increase of 5%. The final dividend is to be paid on 26 June 2015 to all 
shareholders on the register as at 5 June 2015 (ex dividend date 4 June 2015).
INVESTMENT
Total capital expenditure in the year was £8.1m (2013/14: £6.1m) and depreciation and amortisation was 
£5.0m (2013/14: £4.9m). This included the opening of six new stores and the refurbishment of 14 stores. 
The total capital expenditure included further investment in new Moss Bros hire inventory of £1.4m 
(2013/14: £1.6m), whilst depreciation on hire inventory was £0.9m (2013/14: £0.8m).
CASH AND LIQUIDITY
The year end cash balance was £19.6m compared with £28.3m last year as a result of investment in store 
refits and hire stock, and payment of dividends in line with our progressive dividend policy.
INVENTORY
The mix of inventory in the business was re-geared during the year to ensure sufficient inventory was 
available to support sales across the business including earlier intake of new season’s lines to maximise 
full price sales and gross margin. Stock at the year end was £15.7m. (2013/14: £13.5m).
TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES
The terms and conditions with our suppliers are reviewed and adjusted so as to maximise the average 
cash balance, whilst improving the product gross margin.
FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
The Board believes Moss Bros has an exciting future, with the growth of e-commerce underpinning the move 
to full multi-channel retailing in 2015/16. The adoption of Moss Bros as the master brand, supported by 
complementary sub brands and introduction of carefully targeted marketing activity, represents a significant 
opportunity. In order to maximise this opportunity, and with the increasing role that digital has to play in 
marketing, we brought marketing and e-commerce together in January 2015 and created the new position of 
Omni Channel Director, an important step in the process to becoming a fully multi-channel retailer . This will 
ensure a continuity of brand presentation and pricing across all our channels. The introduction of customer 
relationship management (“CRM”) following the full implementation of multi-channel in 2015/16, and the ongoing 
store refurbishment programme, will enhance further the customer experience and perceptions of the brand. 
RETAIL
The store refit programme is now entering its fourth year and 58 stores are now trading with the new look 
store format. Recognising that refitted stores are consistently achieving the three year payback criteria 
and in light of cash reserves available for investment, the Board has decided to accelerate significantly the 
refit programme with 27 stores planned for refit in 2015/16. This will have an impact on cash reserves in 
the short term due to the timing of capital expenditure but given the short payback period and the related 
reduced capital expenditure in 2016/17 this will be recouped quickly. 
HIRE
We will continue to leverage the opportunities to grow our market share through all distribution channels 
including the transactional internet site, launched in November 2013, which marked our entry into 
multi-channel, and which has seen traffic levels above expectations. Group hire functionality has recently 
been added to the website and a number of further improvements are planned for 2015. We will also explore 
new markets and the continued growth of the School Proms hire market is very encouraging. Investment in 
new product areas has been sharply increased to £2.5m in 2015 (2013/14: £1.4m), and includes lounge suits,

Early season wedding bookings for 2015 are showing an improvement on the prior year. It is too early to say 
if this upturn will be sustained but the business is in excellent shape to build market share.
Moss Hire also offers one of the most significant opportunities to develop our customer offering 
by leveraging the rich source of customer data, many of whom are currently unaware of, or do not 
consider the Moss Retail offer. We believe the opportunities for CRM, in the context of a multi-channel 
offer, are significant.
E-COMMERCE
We plan to exploit further growth opportunities both in the UK and overseas through building on our 
success and leveraging the advantages that full multi-channel capability will bring. Additional websites for 
overseas markets are planned. 
SUPPLY CHAIN & COSTS
Our supply chain continues to be of significant importance in delivering service and efficiencies. 
We anticipate central costs will increase in line with turnover in 2015/16 as we increase our investment in 
marketing and our multi-channel capability.
Capital expenditure for 2015/16 is estimated at £14m, including £7.5m for 27 store refits and £2.5m for 
hire stock. 
INFRASTRUCTURE
We successfully upgraded our Stock Control and Distribution Centre systems in 2014/15 and plans are in 
place to upgrade our Point of Sale systems. Implementation risk has been mitigated through upgrading 
existing systems, rather than wholesale replacement. The upgrade is largely cost neutral with lower 
annual maintenance costs offsetting higher depreciation charges. The upgrade of Point of Sale will involve 
capital expenditure of £0.4m in 2015/16. Additional one off costs of £0.2m will be incurred in 2015/16 
during the implementation period.
As well as introducing latest technology, the upgrade will improve business efficiency and our 
customer experience.
With the introduction of multichannel, growth of e-commerce and shortening of product lead times, the 
efficiency of the Distribution Centre is central to our ability to serve our customers. The investment made 
in IT in 2014/15 will enable further operational improvements to be made.
PEOPLE
We plan to maintain our focus on staff training and development with increased emphasis on improving 
customer satisfaction within a multi-channel environment. 12 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
CONTINUED
OUTLOOK
We continue to make good progress in the delivery of our strategic priorities. The modernisation of the 
store portfolio is achieving the anticipated returns and we have exciting plans for the implementation of 
a multi-channel shopping environment. The adoption of the master brand “Moss Bros” and launch of 
our sub brands in Autumn 2014 have improved the resonance the brand has with current and potential 
customers of all age groups.
Hire is showing signs of recovery and we are well placed to maximise revenues in the 2015 Wedding 
season. The early response to the 2015 Spring/Summer retail range is positive, with retail like-for-like* 
sales continuing to improve year on year as we move out of the winter clearance activity. 
The Group’s trading performance continues positively, in line with the Board’s expectations.

The Board monitors principal risks and uncertainties and implement measures to mitigate their risk on 
the business. An assessment of these is shown below.
 
Business area
 
Risk to Company
 
Mitigation of risk
Assessment of change in 
risk year on year
Hire The Hire business demands 
the highest level of 
customer service 
This is delivered through a 
highly developed and efficient 
infrastructure which enables 
consistent ‘delivery to promise’. 
Any disruption to this 
infrastructure would affect our 
ability to maintain customer 
service levels.
We have a dedicated customer 
service team which actively 
seek to resolve any customer 
service issues arising. 
We are continually refreshing 
and replenishing our stock of 
hire garments to ensure we are 
able to cater for all occasions 
whenever they fall due.
We have strengthened our 
market position during the year 
through the introduction of a 
new transactional Hire website.
The risk is ongoing, however we 
have expanded our customer 
service team during the year 
and have carried a full review of 
all systems and processes. 
Retail and 
Bespoke
Factors outside our control, 
such as an economic downturn 
affecting the UK, may have 
a material adverse effect 
on results 
As a retail business based and 
operating predominantly in the 
UK, we are particularly exposed 
to any economic downturn 
in the UK which could affect 
consumer confidence and 
therefore spending.
We continually focus on 
maintaining our product quality, 
customer service and supplier 
relationships, whilst retaining 
our competitive position, 
including value and pricing.
This risk has reduced as 
the economic outlook 
gradually improves.
 E-Commerce Customer satisfaction is as 
important online as offline
Ease of navigation/ability 
to transact quickly on the 
website is key to generating 
sales online.
Maintaining a competitive edge 
through customers being able 
to interact with the product 
online, offering product choice 
and availability, and allowing 
multiple payment and delivery 
options are important in 
growing our online presence.
Ensuring a secure online 
marketplace is also vital 
for customers to be able to 
transact safely.
We are continually developing 
our website offering in order to 
become fully multi-channel. 
Our Retail website has 
continued to see significant 
increases in customer traffic 
flow and conversion rates.
Our new Hire website has been 
well received by customers 
and in terms of the customer 
journey, we are seeing a high 
level of cross over with our 
stores.
We have implemented 
security policies, rules and 
technical measures to protect 
customer data.
With the continuous increase in 
trade through e-commerce and 
the market trend on moving to 
a fully multichannel operation, 
the risk has increased during 
the year.

Risk to Company
 
Mitigation of risk
Assessment of change in 
risk year on year
Brand image Maintaining our store 
presentation is important 
for attracting customers and 
growing our brand
The historical underinvestment 
in the store estate in previous 
years has meant that some 
of our stores lack the level of 
presentation that we require 
to grow the business and 
the brand. 
We are undergoing a store 
redevelopment programme to 
both modernise the look and 
feel of the stores and to meet 
more routine maintenance 
that has been deferred for 
many years.
The development and launch 
of a new sub brand line up, 
under the master brand ‘Moss 
Bros’, in Autumn 2014 has 
strengthened the brand identity
The risk has been reduced 
during the year with the 
progression of the store 
redevelopment programme. 
Costs Cost price increases and 
currency fluctuation could 
have a materially adverse 
affect on results
A fluctuation in currency rates 
could materially affect the 
Group’s cost base and margins. 
Management has mitigated the 
cost price risk as a significant 
proportion of inventory is 
direct sourced and prices have 
been agreed as a result of 
competitive tendering. 
In addition, the Group operates 
a treasury policy which hedges 
a significant proportion of the 
foreign exchange risk from such 
direct sourcing arrangements. 
Management closely monitor 
the effectiveness of these 
arrangements.
The risk is ongoing, however, 
and is continually monitored 
and addressed.
Supply chain A disruption to supplier 
continuity may adversely affect 
our operation 
Suppliers going out of business 
could have a significant impact 
on our ability to meet demand 
in store and online.
We are continually reviewing 
and refreshing our supplier 
list. The diversification of 
product buying across a 
range of suppliers limits the 
Group’s over reliance upon any 
individual supplier. 
The risk is ongoing, however, 
and is continually monitored 
and addressed.
Distribution cen-
tre (DC)
Operating our distribution 
centre from one location 
leaves the Group exposed 
to business catastrophes 
occurring at that location
Any business catastrophe 
affecting our distribution centre 
could severely affect the Group’s 
ability to supply to stores and 
customers.
We continually review and 
monitor our disaster recovery 
plan to ensure that all business 
risks are adequately covered. 
Our financial risk of operating 
from one location is mitigated 
through our comprehensive 
insurance cover. 
DC IT systems were upgraded 
in 2014.
With new and increased 
operating pressures on the 
DC through multi-channel, 
the reliance and consequent 
exposure to risk of the DC 
failing has increased during 
the year. 16 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk

Mitigation of risk
Assessment of change in 
risk year on year
IT Upgrade The business is in the process 
of upgrading its stock 
management, DC and point of 
sale systems over a two year 
period, from February 2014. 
Risks include project over run, 
in terms of both time and costs, 
and disruption to the business 
as the new systems are brought 
into use.
The project is an upgrade to 
existing systems, rather than 
wholesale replacement, and 
as a consequence there is 
an established upgrade path 
to follow. This reduces the 
implementation risk. 
The system is being supplied 
by the existing systems 
supplier whose track record is 
established and reliable.
Stock management and DC 
systems were successfully 
upgraded in 2014. The point of 
sale system will be upgraded 
in 2015.
People The Group’s reliance on 
key management and other 
personnel could put pressure 
on the business if they were to 
leave
Attracting and retaining 
high calibre people is a key 
priority and a central focus in 
striving for excellent customer 
service across the Group’s 
business channels. 
Effective recruitment policies 
and people development 
means the Group can take full 
advantage of the recovery in 
its performance. 
Long term incentive share 
awards were granted to 
senior employees during the 
year to more closely align 
their interests to those of the 
Group and a SAYE scheme is 
in operation. 
The risk is ongoing however 
is continually monitored 
and addressed.

CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION
The Board has a wide range of responsibilities and my overall objective is to ensure that the Board has 
the right mix of skills and experience to leverage the opportunities and overcome the challenges that the 
Company faces and that it works effectively as a team to identify, prioritise, communicate and review the 
delivery of the goals of the Company. We ensure that there is the right mix of enquiry and support to the 
Executive Directors from the Non-Executives.
The Non-Executive Directors discuss and agree the strategy with the Executive Directors and hold the 
Executives accountable for its execution; we ensure that we have the most talented team to execute this 
strategy; and we set the tone for governance.
The Board is committed to maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance, specifically 
ensuring that we send out consistent messages on the core values of the Company and acceptable 
behaviours. We have made good progress in achieving best practice and we regularly review the context, 
progress and maintenance of these standards, for the benefit of all of our stakeholders.
DEBBIE HEWITT
CHAIRMAN
STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE 2012 (“THE CODE”)
The Group is committed to the principles of corporate governance contained in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code that was issued in 2012 by the Financial Reporting Council (‘the Code’) for which the 
board is accountable to shareholders. The Board regularly reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management and internal control systems, which is further discussed on page 28. 
Compliance with the Code reviewed regularly and throughout the year ended 31 January 2015, the Board 
confirms that it has fully complied with the provisions set out in the code. 
The Company has applied the principles set out in the Code, including both the main principles and 
the supporting principles, by complying with the Code as reported above. Further explanation of how 
the principles have been applied is set out below and in the Directors’ Remuneration Report and Audit 
Committee Report.
LEADERSHIP
THE ROLE OF THE BOARD
At 2 April 2015, the Board consisted of the Chairman, three Non-Executive Directors and two Executive 
Directors. The Chairman of the Board is Debbie Hewitt who joined the Board as an Independent 
Non-Executive Director on 1 June 2009 and was appointed acting Chairman from 25 March 2010 and 
Chairman from 27 April 2010. Maurice Helfgott is the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director. The 
Group considers Maurice Helfgott, Bryan Portman, Zoe Morgan and the Chairman, Debbie Hewitt, to 
continue to display all of the qualities of independence as set out in the Code. 
Board papers containing relevant commercial and financial information are normally provided to all 
Board members in the week prior to a Board meeting to enable the Directors to consider the issues for 
discussion. The Board regularly reviews the type and amount of information provided. The Board plans 
to meet at least six times a year including two meetings to review and discuss the strategic issues facing 
the Company. The Board also holds meetings as appropriate, to fulfil the ongoing requirements of the 
business during the year.
BOARD COMMITTEES
In accordance with the Code and corporate governance best practice, the Board has established a number 
of committees. All of the committees have written terms of reference, approved by the Board.

AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Audit Committee is chaired by Bryan Portman (MBA, FCCA, FCIS), and during the financial year also 
comprised Debbie Hewitt (MBA, FCIPD) until 1 February 2014, Zoe Morgan from 1 February 2014 and 
Maurice Helfgott (MBA). The terms of reference for the Audit Committee provide that the Chief Executive 
Officer and Finance Director are invited to attend the meetings as appropriate. 
There is an opportunity for any employee, in confidence, to raise any concerns with management about 
possible impropriety in financial or other matters. The Company has established an internal confidential 
helpline which is independent of line management.
The Board has delegated to the Audit Committee responsibility for ensuring the financial statements, when 
taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable. The Audit Committee has considered all matters 
brought to its attention during the year. The Audit Committee has also considered whether there were any 
areas where they required more information in order to decide if the annual report is fair, balanced and 
reasonable and made arrangements for this information to be reported to them. The Committee met three 
times during the year and reported to the Board on all matters relating to the regulatory and accounting 
requirements affecting the Group, together with the financial reporting and internal control procedures 
including the annual and interim financial statements. 
In addition, the Audit Committee ensures that an objective and professional relationship is maintained with 
the external auditor. The external auditor may attend all meetings of the Audit Committee and have direct 
access to the Audit Committee and its Chairman.
The Audit Committee also reviews the possible risks facing the Group, the risk management function and 
internal controls. The Committee’s review of the interim and full year financial statements focused on the 
following key areas affecting the Group’s financial reporting: 
Valuation of property plant and equipment
The estimated useful lives of non-current assets is considered to be a key area of judgement, particularly 
given the nature of the business.
Valuation of inventory and related provisions
Inventory is a significant value on the Group’s statement of financial position and there is an element of 
judgement relating to the inventory provision.
Measurement and accounting for share-based payments 
The assumptions behind the Group’s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest is considered 
a key area of judgement.
Revenue recognition on hire and bespoke deposits
Revenue is deferred until collection of goods arises. The movement and amount deferred is significant to 
the financial statements. 
Other areas of focus considered by the Committee were:
Onerous leases
The assumptions underlying these calculations are highly sensitive to small changes.
Deferred taxation 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and a judgement 
made over the probability of there being sufficient taxable profits arising in the future to allow all or part of 
the asset to be recovered.

and powers to the Board Committees. The schedule of reserved matters is reviewed by the Board.
EFFECTIVENESS
THE COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD
The Articles provide that one-third of the Directors shall retire from office by rotation. Furthermore, 
Article 92 of the existing Articles requires a Director to stand for re-election if they were not appointed or 
re-appointed at either of the last two Annual General Meetings and article 90 requires Directors to stand 
for re-election if they have served as a Director for a continuous period of more than nine years.
Notwithstanding the provisions of the Articles, in compliance with best practice, all directors offer 
themselves for re-election annually. 26 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk

Evaluation of the Board’s performance has been conducted through individual questionnaires, followed by 
a review of the output by the Board and an action plan of improvements. This includes a review of progress 
on the actions agreed in the previous year’s review, a review of the individual contribution of Non Executives 
and a review of the Chairman.
APPOINTMENTS TO THE BOARD
Board members are appointed by the Board on the recommendation of the Nomination Committee, which is 
chaired by the Chairman and consists of the Non-Executive Directors, although the Chief Executive Officer is 
invited to meetings as appropriate.
Copies of the Executive Directors’ service contracts with the Company and copies of the Non-Executive 
Directors’ letters of appointment with the Company are available from the Company Secretary.
TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT
On appointment to the Board and to any Board Committee, every Director is provided with appropriate 
induction and training to enable them to discharge their duties as a Director. Additional training may be 
sought as necessary.
The Board has conducted a review of its effectiveness and the effectiveness of each individual Director. 
The conclusions of the review have been presented to and discussed by the Board as a whole and 
actions resulting from this review will be kept under review during the forthcoming year. The Senior 
Independent Director separately reviews the performance of the Chairman, with input from Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors.
RE-ELECTION
Subject to re-election at the first AGM after which they were appointed, Non-Executive Directors are 
appointed initially for a three year term. The Group will take into account the balance of skills and 
experience on the Board, their contribution and level of independence when considering whether to extend 
their appointment beyond the initial term. The Board may ask a Non-Executive Director to remain for a 
further term. The Non-Executive Directors’ contracts are terminable on three months’ notice and the 
Chairman’s on six months’ notice.

The Board takes significant measures to ensure that all Board members are kept aware of both the views 
of the major shareholders and changes in the major shareholdings of the Group.
The Board ensures two-way communication with major shareholders, through Broker briefings and 
feedback from the Executive Directors following meetings with major shareholders. The Chairman also 
meets with major shareholders on a regular basis. 
AUDIT COMMITTEE AND AUDITORS
During the period ended 31 January 2015, the Group’s external auditor, Deloitte LLP, provided advice to the 
Group. The fees paid to Deloitte for non-audit services were £7,000 (2013/14: £6,000). The use of Deloitte 
LLP for non-audit work was carefully evaluated by the Audit Committee and the Board.
The Audit Committee views the independence and objectivity of the Group’s auditor as essential and 
ensures that Deloitte is not instructed on any issues which would prejudice this. The Audit Committee 
obtains written confirmation on at least an annual basis of the independence of the external auditor.
To fulfil its responsibility regarding the independence of the external auditor, the Audit Committee 
also reviewed:
•  the external auditor’s plan for the current year, noting the role of the senior statutory audit partner, 
who signs the audit report and who, in accordance with professional rules, has not held office for 
more than five years (the senior statutory audit partner has held office for three years), and any 
changes in the key audit staff;
• the arrangements for day-to-day management of the audit relationship;
• the overall extent of non-audit services provided by the external auditor; and
• the past service of the auditor that was first appointed for the year ended 31 January 2009.
It is also the Committee’s policy to consider every year whether there should be an audit tender process.
To assess the effectiveness of the external auditor, the Audit Committee reviewed:
• the arrangements for ensuring the external auditor’s independence and objectivity;
• the external auditor’s fulfilment of the agreed audit plan and any variations from the plan;
•  the robustness and perceptiveness of the external auditor in their handling of the key accounting and 
audit judgements; and
• the content of the external auditor’s reporting on internal control.
ACCOUNTABILITY 
Each person who is a Director at the date of approval of this Annual Report confirms that:
•  so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor 
is unaware; and
•  the Director has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have taken as a Director in order to make 
himself/herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is 
aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of s418 of the Act.
Deloitte LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in office as auditor and a Resolution to 
re-appoint them will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 28 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk

GOING CONCERN
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position are set out in the Chairman’s Statement and the Chief Executive’s Business 
Review. The latter describes the financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position, together 
with the Group’s objectives, key risks and uncertainties. The Group’s financial risk management objectives 
and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk are described in note 23.
As also highlighted in note 23 to the financial statements, the Group meets its day-to-day working capital 
requirements through surplus cash balances. 
The Board of Directors has undertaken a recent thorough review of the Group’s budgets and forecasts 
and has produced detailed cash flow projections, which take account of reasonably possible changes in 
trading performance, showing that the Group is expected to operate within the level of its current surplus 
cash balances. 
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and Company have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts for the 53 weeks 
ended 31 January 2015.
RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board has applied principle C.2 of the UK Corporate Governance Code by establishing a continuous 
process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks the Group faces and for determining 
the nature and extent of the significant risks it is willing to take in achieving its strategic objectives. The 
Board regularly reviews the process, which has been in place from the start of the year to the date of 
approval of this report and which is in accordance with revised guidance on internal control published in 
October 2005 (the Turnbull Guidance). The Board is also responsible for the Group’s system of internal 
control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the 
risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.
In compliance with provision C.2.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board regularly reviews 
the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and internal control systems. The Board’s monitoring 
covers all material controls, including financial, operational and compliance controls. It is based principally 
on reviewing reports from management to consider whether significant risks are identified, evaluated, 
managed and controlled and whether any significant weaknesses are promptly remedied and indicate a 
need for more extensive monitoring. The Board has also performed a specific assessment for the purpose 
of this annual report. This assessment considers all significant aspects of risk management and internal 
control arising during the period covered by the report including the work of internal audit. The audit 
committee assists the Board in discharging its review responsibilities.
During the course of its review of the risk management and internal control systems, the Board has 
not identified nor been advised of any failings or weaknesses which it has determined to be significant. 
Therefore a confirmation in respect of necessary actions has not been considered appropriate.
The Board recognises that no system of internal control can provide absolute assurance against losses 
arising from mismanagement and that the Group’s systems must be designed to manage rather than 
eliminate risk. Internal control and risk management is an ongoing process designed to identify, evaluate 
and manage the significant risks faced by the Group. The system of internal control includes internal 
financial controls, operational procedures, risk management and compliance matters. The system has 
been in place throughout the period ended 31 January 2015 and up to the date of this Report.
The significant risks the Board has identified are detailed in the Chief Executive’s Business Review.

During the period the Board has reviewed the adequacy of the current internal audit department in 
accordance with the Code. In view of the size and scale of the Group, the Board decided it was not 
appropriate to expand the current scope of the internal audit function which focuses on inventory and 
cash control.
The Group’s work to review the risk management structure and ensure a robust mechanism is in place for 
logging and monitoring risks continues.

IN RESPECT OF THE ANNUAL REPORT, THE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT AND THE 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and 
the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that 
law the Directors are required to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation and have chosen to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable 
law). Under company law the directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit or loss of the company for 
that period.
In preparing the parent company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
•  state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
•  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume 
that the company will continue in business.
In preparing the group financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
•  present information including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, 
comparable and understandable information;
•  provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are 
insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and 
conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and
• make an assessment of the company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and 
explain the company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information 
included on the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
•  the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework, give 
a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the company and 
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and

•  the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and 
the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations. Having taken advice from the Audit Committee, the Board considers the report and accounts, 
taken as a whole, to be fair, balanced and understandable and that it provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy.

Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to present the Directors’ remuneration report for the year ended 31 January 2015. 
Following the adoption of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy at the 2014 AGM we continue to retain our 
overall philosophy of adopting clear and simple market competitive remuneration and incentive schemes. 
The alignment of executive remuneration structures with the objectives of the shareholders remains the 
principal focus, ensuring remuneration structures are fully attuned to the business strategy. 
In this Annual Statement, which precedes our Annual Report on Remuneration, I have summarised our 
performance in 2014/15, and how this relates to remuneration decisions and outcomes. 
In 2014/15, performance has continued to improve. Despite a generally challenging market, we have 
remained focused on establishing a clear brand strategy leveraging the Moss Bros brand, launching our 
new sub brands, continued development of our e-commerce proposition and store refits, and the delivery 
of other strategic objectives such as a shift to more direct sourcing. All of these have helped to improve our 
trading performance. In addition, careful management of stock and strong cash generation, all contributed 
to Moss Bros continuing to deliver a robust financial performance with annual pre-tax profit growth of 9.0% 
and an increase in annual dividend payment.
The incentive performance targets for 2014/15 introduced strategic performance objectives to the annual 
bonus alongside the current profit targets. These objectives included the development of our Hire strategy, 
e-commerce growth and brand and customer satisfaction tracking. Although the business achieved an 
increase in profit and progress on a number of strategic priorities the bonus thresholds were not met 
and no annual bonus will be payable in respect of 2014/15. The April 2012 LTIP award has matured, 
the performance condition for which was based on the 3 year cumulative profit to 31 January 2015, 
and will vest to the extent of 75% of the original share award. This is reflected in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration that follows. 
As set out in our remuneration policy which was approved by shareholders at last year’s AGM, 2014/15 was 
the first year in which the Committee operated the following features of our remuneration policy:
• The introduction of clawback provisions to the annual bonus and LTIP starting within the 2014/15 
annual bonus and LTIP awards granted in 2014/15 financial year; 
• The introduction of a further two year holding period for Executive Directors for any awards which are 
granted from 1 April 2014. This means that the first awards subject to this holding period were the LTIP 
awards granted on 14 April 2014.
The Committee believes that these two changes will help increase the long-term alignment of our 
executives’ interests with those of shareholders, which is one of the aims of our remuneration policy.
Looking forward, the Committee intends to keep the same incentive structure in 2015/16, with strategic 
performance objectives in place alongside the current profit targets. These objectives will include 
development of our Hire strategy, e-commerce growth and brand and customer satisfaction tracking. It 
will determine up to half of any bonus payment. As in prior years, the bonus will continue to be 
self-funding and as such, no bonus will be payable if the minimum profit target is not met. This will ensure 
that the annual bonus continues to focus on financial performance, but also provides an incentive to 
achieve key strategic objectives.
In relation to the LTIP, the Committee intends to make awards to Executive Directors which will vest after 
3 years if a demanding PBT performance target is satisfied, with dividend return conditions too.

At the 2015 Annual General Meeting, the Annual Statement and Annual Report on Remuneration will be 
put to an advisory vote which provides shareholders with the opportunity to voice their opinions on how the 
Committee has implemented the remuneration policy.
2014/15 was another year of progress for Moss Bros and, in this context, we look forward to receiving your 
support on our approach to Remuneration at the Annual General Meeting.

The Remuneration Committee determines the Company’s policy on the remuneration of the Executive 
Directors and other senior executives. The principles which underpin the remuneration policy for the 
Company are to:
• ensure Executive Directors’ rewards and incentives are directly aligned with the interests of the 
shareholders in order to reinforce the strategic priorities of the Group, optimise the performance of 
the Group and create sustained growth in shareholder value, without encouragement to take excessive 
undue risk;
• provide the level of remuneration required to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors of an 
appropriate calibre;
• ensure a proper balance of fixed and variable performance related components, linked to short and 
longer-term objectives; and
• reflect market competitiveness, taking account of the total value of all the benefit elements.
Remuneration for the Executive Directors is structured so that the variable pay element (annual bonus 
and long-term incentives) forms a significant proportion of the overall package. This provides a strong 
link between the remuneration paid to Executive Directors and the performance of the Company. This also 
provides a strong alignment of interest between the Executive Directors and shareholders (particularly as 
part of the annual bonus and all of the long-term incentive is payable in the form of shares).
For the purposes of section 226D(6)(b) of the Companies Act 2006 this policy took effect from the date of 
the 2014 AGM when it was approved by shareholders. It has been included here for reference.

Salaries for the Executive Directors are 
determined by the Remuneration Committee 
taking into account the experience and 
performance of the individual and comparing 
the levels of remuneration with the salaries 
of comparable UK based retailers. They also 
reflect the overall package in relation to fixed 
and variable pay.
Base salaries are reviewed annually, unless 
responsibilities change. In setting appropriate 
salary levels for the Executive Directors and 
considering whether there should be any 
increases, the Committee takes into account 
pay and employment conditions of employees 
elsewhere in the Group.
We would only expect a material adjustment 
of salaries in the event that the scale

substantially over time.
The salaries of any newly appointed Executive 
would reflect the scale and nature of the 
role and the relevant experience of any newly 
appointed individual.

CHOICE OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND TARGET SETTING
For the annual bonus and long-term incentive, our policy is to choose performance measures which help 
drive and reward the achievement of our strategy, and also provide alignment between employees and 
shareholders. The Committee reviews metrics each year to ensure they remain appropriate and reflect the 
future strategic direction of the Group.
Targets for each performance measure are set by the Committee with reference to internal plans and 
external expectations. Performance is generally measured on a ‘sliding scale’ so that incentive payouts 
increase pro-rata for levels of performance in between the threshold and maximum performance targets.
Performance measures and targets are disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration. In cases where 
targets are commercially sensitive, for example annual profit targets for the annual bonus, they will only be 
disclosed retrospectively.
DIFFERENCES IN PAY POLICY FOR EMPLOYEES AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
No element of the Executive Director remuneration policy is operated exclusively for Executive Directors, 
and, as stated in the introduction to this Policy Report on page 34, the principles applied to the 
remuneration of Executive Directors are the same as those for the Company. The difference between pay 
for Executive Directors and employees is that Executive Director pay is structured so that the variable pay 
element forms a significant proportion of the overall package and the total remuneration opportunity is 
higher to reflect the increased responsibility of the role.

Customer: Moss Bros Project Title: Report & Accounts 2014/15 T: 0207 055 6500 F: 020 7055 6600
EXECUTIVE SHAREHOLDING GUIDELINES
In any event, 50% of the value awarded as part of the annual bonus scheme will be awarded as deferred 
shares, to be held for a period of no less than three years, and shares vesting under the LTIP scheme, if 
exercised, to be held for a minimum of two years after the vesting date. 
Furthermore, to encourage executives to use vested LTIP shares to build and maintain a significant 
shareholding, executives are required to retain all of the post-tax number of shares until a minimum 
shareholding has been achieved. 
Executives who receive a long-term incentive award which exceeds 50% of salary are expected to build a 
holding equal in value to 100% of salary, before they are allowed to sell the vested shares. Executives who 
receive an award of 50% of salary are expected to build a holding of 50% of salary, along the same lines 
as above. Executives who receive an award below 50% of salary are expected to build a holding of 15% of 
salary, along the same lines as above.
For the purpose of this calculation, the value of shares is calculated using the higher of their acquisition 
price and current market price.

Fees Attract, retain and 
reward
Fees for the Non-Executive Directors are 
determined by the Board within the limits 
set by the Articles of Association and 
are based on information on fees paid in 
similar companies taking into account 
the experience of the individuals and the 
relative time commitments involved.
Fees for the Non-Executive Directors are 
reviewed in alternate years.
Current fee levels 
are set out in the 
Annual Report on 
Remuneration.
Overall fee limit 
will be within the 
limit set out in the 
Company’s Articles 
of Association.
Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to bonus payments or pension arrangements nor do they 
participate in the Company’s long-term incentive schemes. 
Note that clothing allowance benefit which is available to Debbie Hewitt was withdrawn for newly appointed 
Non-Executive Directors from 2010/11 onwards.
APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT
The principle applied in recruitment of a new Director is for the remuneration package to be set in 
accordance with the terms of the approved remuneration policy for existing directors in force at the 
time of appointment. In addition, the Committee may offer additional cash and/or share-based ‘buy out’ 
awards when it considers these to be in the best interests of the Company and, therefore, shareholders, 
including awards made under Listing Rule 9.4.2 R. Any such ‘buy out’ payments would be based solely 
on remuneration lost when leaving the former employer and would reflect the delivery mechanism (i.e. 
cash, shares, options), time horizons and performance requirements attaching to that remuneration. 
Shareholders will be informed of any such payments at the time of appointment.
As a result of this policy, the maximum ongoing variable remuneration (i.e. excluding buyout awards) which 
could be granted to a new executive Director is 200% of salary. 38 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk
Job No: 21485 Proof Event: 5 Park Communications Ltd Alpine Way London E6 6LA
Customer: Moss Bros Project Title: Report & Accounts 2014/15 T: 0207 055 6500 F: 020 7055 6600
In the case of an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may be 
allowed to pay out according to its terms on grant, adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment. 
In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may continue, provided 
that they are put to shareholders for approval at the first AGM following their appointment.
Other aspects of our recruitment policy include:
• Where it is appropriate to offer a below median salary initially, a series of increases to the desired 
salary positioning may be given over the proceeding few years subject to individual performance and 
experience in role.
• Different performance measures may be set initially for the annual bonus, taking into account the 
responsibilities of the individual, and the point in the financial year that they joined.
• A new Director may receive fees for professional advice as appropriate.
• A new Director may receive relocation assistance if applicable.
POLICY ON PAYMENT FOR LOSS OF OFFICE
Elements of fixed remuneration are treated as follows: 
Upon termination by either party the Executive Directors are entitled to salary and benefits for the 
duration of the notice period. It is the policy of the Remuneration Committee to seek to mitigate 
termination payments. 
In addition, the Company can make a payment in lieu of notice equal to base salary that would have been 
paid over the notice period. In addition, any statutory entitlements or sums to settle or compromise claims 
in connection with the termination would be paid as necessary.
Elements of variable remuneration would be treated as follows:
Annual bonus
Under the Annual Incentive Plan, an employee who ceases employment or is under notice prior to the 
payment of bonus typically will not receive any payment. However, the Committee has discretion, where an 
individual is considered a ‘good leaver’, to make a bonus payment, payable in cash, but pro-rated for the 
period of time served from the start of the financial year to the date of termination and not for any period 
in lieu of notice or garden leave. Any such bonus payment typically would be subject to the normal bonus 
targets, tested at the end of the year, and would take into account performance over the notice period.
Long Term Incentive Plan
Under the LTIP, unvested awards will normally lapse upon cessation of employment. However, in line with 
the plan rules, the Committee has discretion, where an individual is considered a ‘good leaver’, to allow 
awards to vest at the normal vesting date, or earlier. If the Committee exercises this discretion, awards 
are normally pro-rated to reflect time served since the date of grant and based on the achievement of the 
performance criteria.
SAYE
The Executive Directors participate on the same basis as for other employees.
APPROACH TO SERVICE CONTRACTS AND LETTERS OF APPOINTMENT
The Committee’s policy is to offer service contracts for Executive Directors with notice periods of six to 
twelve months. In addition, the Executive Directors are subject to a six month non-compete clause from 
the date of termination.
For the Chairman, appointment is terminable on six months’ notice. All other Non-Executive Directors’ 
appointments are terminable on three months’ notice on either side.

STATEMENT OF CONSIDERATION OF EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS ELSEWHERE IN THE GROUP
The Moss Bros Remuneration Committee does not consult directly with employees when determining 
remuneration policy for Executive Directors. However, remuneration and pay increases across the Group 
are taken into account when setting pay levels for Directors.
STATEMENT OF CONSIDERATION OF SHAREHOLDER VIEWS
The Remuneration Committee considers shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM each 
year. When any material changes are proposed to the remuneration policy, the Remuneration Committee 
Chairman will inform major shareholders in advance, and will generally offer a meeting to discuss these. 
KEY AREAS OF DISCRETION
Finally, we have chosen to highlight key areas of discretion in the application of our remuneration policy. 
These discretions are implicit in the policy stated above, but we have listed them for clarity. Key areas of 
discretion include, but are not limited to:
• Whether annual bonus is paid to Executives once notice has been served;
• Discretion in exceptional circumstances to amend previously set annual incentive targets or to adjust 
the proposed payout to ensure a fair and appropriate outcome.
• Certain decisions relating to the Long-Term Incentive Plan awards for which the Committee has 
discretion as set out in the rules of the relevant share plans which have been approved by shareholders. 
• The decisions on exercise of malus and/or clawback rights.
LEGACY ARRANGEMENTS
For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this Policy Report, authority is given to the Company to honour any 
commitments entered into with current or former Directors before the current legislation on remuneration 
policies came into force or before an individual became a director (such as the payment outstanding 
incentive awards, and clothing allowance for Directors) even where it is not consistent with the policy 
prevailing at the time such commitment is fulfilled. Details of any payments to former Directors will be set 
out in the Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise. 
EXTERNAL DIRECTORSHIPS FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Company believes that there are benefits to the Company and for Executive Directors accepting 
non-executive directorships in other organisations. Executive Directors may accept one non-executive 
directorship with the prior agreement of the Board provided it does not conflict with the Group’s interests 
and the time commitment does not impact upon the Executive Director’s performance. The Executive 
Directors may retain the fees from their external directorship.
In the case of the CEO, the Committee has approved two non-executive directorships, which were held 
prior to him joining the Board. These are unpaid and in the view of the Committee, they are not overly 
burdensome on his time. The Committee keeps this under review and reserves the right to ask him to 
step down from one or both if time commitments require him to do so. In any case, no Executive Director, 
including the CEO would be allowed more than one paid Non-Executive Directorship.
Details of outside directorships held by the Executive Directors and any fees that they received are provided 
on page 43 of the Annual Report on Remuneration.

This part of the report has been prepared in accordance with Part 3 of The Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 and [9.8.8R] of the Listing 
Rules. The Annual Remuneration Report will be put to an advisory shareholder vote at the 2015 AGM which 
is scheduled to be held on 22 May 2015. The information on pages 41 to 50 has been audited.
IMPLEMENTATION OF REMUNERATION POLICY IN 2015/16
Executive Directors’ Base Salaries
The Remuneration Committee has awarded modest cost of living salary increases of 3% for the 
forthcoming year which reflect the general level of increase given to employees across the business, and 
are considered to be at the median for equivalent roles in other retailers of a similar size. With effect from 
1 February 2015, these increases will take Brian Brick’s base salary from £301,000 to £310,500 and Robin 
Piggott’s base salary from £195,400 to £201,500.
Pension and Benefits
There will be no changes to pension or benefits provision.
Annual Bonus
The annual bonus in 2015/16 will be consistent with the policy detailed in the Policy Report in terms of the 
maximum bonus opportunity, and performance measures will be based 50% on the achievement of PBT 
targets, whilst the remainder will be based on the achievement of strategic objectives. To ensure that the 
bonus is self-funding, no bonus will be payable if the minimum PBT target is not met.
PBT and strategic objectives, together with the level of performance against each objective, will be 
disclosed retrospectively in the 2017/18 Annual Report on Remuneration because they are deemed 
commercially sensitive. 
Clawback will apply to any 2015/16 bonus payments. 
Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
Awards will be made under the LTIP in April 2015 on the same terms as set out in the policy table, and so 
will be subject to the new clawback provisions and the two year holding period for executive directors. For 
Brian Brick and Robin Piggott this award will be equivalent to 100% and 70% of salary respectively. The 
performance condition is anticipated to be as follows:
Award 2015/16 award
Performance measure Cumulative Profit Before Tax
Start of performance period 01/02/2015
End of performance period 27/01/2018
Target for 25% vesting £18.5m
Target for 50% vesting £20.0m
Target for 75% vesting £22.0m
Target for 100% vesting £24.0m
Cumulative Profit Before Tax for these purposes means operating profit after any charges arising from the 
LTIP and it would exclude exceptional profits, onerous lease provision release, movement in hire deposits 
and other material accruals unless the Remuneration Committee considers them appropriate to include.
Note that the Committee may adjust the targets in order to neutralise the effect of any changes to the 
capital base.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IN RESPECT OF THE SINGLE FIGURE TABLE
Annual Bonus
For 2014/15 the maximum bonus opportunity for Brian Brick was 100% of salary, and for Robin Piggott was 
80% of salary. The bonus was payable 50% on the achievement of PBT targets, whilst the remainder was 
based on the achievement of strategic objectives, subject to the achievement of a minimum level of PBT. 
As PBT targets were not met no annual bonus was awarded in respect of 2014/15.

The Committee has determined that the PBT performance targets for the 2014/15 annual bonus are 
currently commercially sensitive, and has committed to disclosing these targets in the 2016/17 annual 
report on remuneration. The strategic objectives against which bonus would have been payable, had the 
minimum level of PBT been achieved, included:
1.  Operating the business to a coherent strategic framework, including implementing measures and 
targets for brand tacking, customer and employee satisfaction; 
2.  Successful development of a Hire/Occasion strategy, including the implementation of an outstanding 
multichannel experience;
3. Sales and margin targets for online.

All awards granted under the LTIP are subject to continued employment and the satisfaction of the 
performance conditions set out below. All awards have a nil exercise price.
2012-2015 Award
An LTIP award for members of the Executive Management Team (including Executive Directors) with 
a performance period covering the three financial years ending January 2015 was made in April 2012. 
The award was based on a number of ordinary shares in the Company issued in the future at a nil 
exercise price, subject to the satisfaction of challenging performance conditions and the requirement for 
continued employment. 46 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk

Recognising the improvement in the level and stability of the Company’s profitability the Committee 
considered that the performance condition should be based on PBT (as opposed to EBITDA). PBT for these 
purposes means operating profit after any charges arising from the LTIP and it will exclude exceptional 
profits, onerous lease provision release, interest, movement in Hire Deposits and other material accruals, 
unless the Remuneration Committee considers them appropriate to include. The targets may be adjusted 
in order to neutralise the effect of any changes to the capital base.
Depending on the Company’s cumulative PBT performance during the three year performance period, the 
following percentages of the award will vest:
(i) 25% will vest if the business achieves a cumulative PBT of £7.9m
(ii) 50% will vest if the business achieves a cumulative PBT of £8.4m
(iii) 75% will vest if the business achieves a cumulative PBT of £8.9m
(iv) 100% will vest if the business achieves a cumulative PBT of £10.5m
Awards will only vest if the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that:
(i)  the PBT performance for the relevant financial year is reflective of the long-term underlying 
financial performance of the Company (taking into account expected future financial performance of 
the Company);
(ii)  the Company has maintained a regular dividend payment (or the Board has unanimously determined 
that, although retained earnings are considered sufficient to continue the payment of dividends under 
a regular dividend policy, dividends should not be paid and instead retained earnings should be used 
for other purposes).
2013-2016 Award
An LTIP award for members of the Executive Management Team (including Executive Directors) with 
a performance period covering the three financial years ending January 2016 was made in April 2013. 
The award will be based on a number of ordinary shares in the Company issued in the future at a nil 
exercise price, subject to continued employment, regular dividend payments and consistent underlying 
profit performance. 
For Brian Brick and Robin Piggott this award is equivalent to 100% and 70% of salary respectively. 
The Remuneration Committee considered that the performance condition should again be based on 
PBT; PBT for these purposes to have the same definition as for the April 2012 Award. The targets may be 
adjusted in order to neutralise the effect of any changes to the capital base.
The Committee did consider the inclusion of measures like TSR, but given the stage of the Company’s 
turnaround, the Company’s scale and the absence of direct competitors in this market, the Committee 
felt that for the current time PBT was an appropriate measure. Furthermore, by making it a cumulative 
measure, it would avoid a windfall from the performance of one particular year and therefore promotes 
reward for a more progressive growth pattern. 
Depending on the Company’s cumulative PBT performance during the three year performance period, the 
following percentages of the award will vest:
(i) 25% will vest if the business achieves a cumulative PBT of £12.0m
(ii) 50% will vest if the business achieves a cumulative PBT of £13.0m
(iii) 75% will vest if the business achieves a cumulative PBT of £14.0m
(iv) 100% will vest if the business achieves a cumulative PBT of £15.9m

2014-2017 Award
The Remuneration Committee has approved a new LTIP award for members of the Executive Management 
Team (including Executive Directors) which was made in April 2014 with a performance period covering the 
three financial years ending January 2017. The award will be based on a number of ordinary shares in the

Share ownership
As set out in the Policy Report, executives will be required to retain all of the post-tax number of shares 
until a minimum shareholding has been achieved. Executives who receive an award which exceeds 50% of 
salary are expected to build a holding equal in value to 100% of salary, before they are allowed to sell the 
vested shares. Executives who receive an award of 50% of salary are expected to build a holding of 50% of 
salary, along the same lines as above. Executives who receive an award below 50% salary are expected to 
build a holding of 15% of salary, along the same lines as above.
As at 31 January 2015 all executive Directors met the guideline. 48 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk

Maurice Helfgott, Bryan Portman and Zoe Morgan are independent Non-Executive Directors. The 
Company Chairman, Debbie Hewitt (who was independent on appointment), is also a member of the 
Committee. Moss Bros Group PLC falls under the category of a ‘small company’ as defined by the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, which only requires two independent Non-Executive Directors to sit on the 
Remuneration Committee. The Committee met three times during the year. Committee attendance is set 
out on page 26.
Adviser to the committee
During 2014/15, the Committee received advice from New Bridge Street (a trading name of AON 
Corporation) on senior executive remuneration and employee share schemes. Neither New Bridge Street 
nor AON Corporation provided other services to the Company during the period. New Bridge Street is a

OPINION ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF MOSS BROS GROUP PLC
In our opinion the financial statements:
•  give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and the parent company’s affairs as at 31 January 
2015 and of the Group’s profit for the period then ended;
•  have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union; and
•  have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards 
the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the 
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the 
Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the Company Balance Sheet and the related notes 1 to 25.  The 
financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union.
GOING CONCERN
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the directors’ statement on page 19 that the Group is a 
going concern. We confirm that
•  we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation 
of the financial statements is appropriate; and
•  we have not identified any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability 
to continue as a going concern.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as 
to the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
OUR ASSESSMENT OF RISKS OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below, which are the same risks as identified in 
the prior year, are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the allocation of resources in 
the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Store Impairments 
Loss making stores provide an indication that 
the fixed assets related to that store could be 
impaired. Impairments are subject to an element 
of judgement due to the assumptions made 
within cash flow projections. These assumptions 
relate to discount rates applied and forecast sales 
growth and margin figures which are based on 
management estimates.
The carrying value of Fixtures, Vehicles and 
Equipment is £11,688,000 at 31 January 2015.
See accounting policy on page 62 and Note 2 which 
details this as a key source of uncertainty.
We have challenged the cash flow projections 
as well as Management’s longer-term plans 
for each loss-making store to assess whether 
impairments are recognised at appropriate stores. 
This challenge included:
 –  comparison of forecasts to 
historical performance, 
 –  assessed forecast growth rates via 
comparison to industry benchmarks and 
historical information; and
 –  an assessment of how achievable 
cost reduction plans are making use 
of historical information available 
and the individual circumstances of 
stores in question. 
We have also compared stores which generate 
small positive income against the carrying value 
of the assets at that store to identify any further 
indicators of impairment.
The valuation of inventory and related provisions
Inventory is presented net of provisions for:
•  obsolescence and items to be sold at less than 
cost; and
• shrinkage
There is an element of judgement relating to 
these provisions which are based on historical 
evidence and the current economic conditions. 
The changing trends and economic environment 
require judgements in respect of provisions to be 
reassessed at each  reporting date.
Total net inventory valuation is £15,736,000 with 
provisions held against inventory of £455,000 at 
31 January 2015. The key sources of uncertainty 
is detailed in Note 2 and the accounting policy on 
page 62.
We have performed testing of the key controls 
around the valuation and provisioning within the 
inventory business cycle. We visited the Distribution 
Centre (‘DC’) in Barking for year-end stock take 
procedures, in addition to a sample of stores. 
We have considered the inventory provision for 
obsolescence and items to be sold at less than cost 
through evaluating:
 – Historical stock and sales data;  
 –  Management’s latest forecasts and trading 
plans; and
 –  Selling prices achieved subsequent to the 
year end. 
We have recalculated the shrinkage provision using 
data from the internal audit team and attended 
stock counts where we witnessed the controls in 
place around recording the volume of shrinkage.  MOSS BROS GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014/15 I 53

The measurement and accounting for share-
based payments
The share awards are measured at the fair value 
at the date of the grant and expensed on a straight 
line basis over the vesting period. The judgement 
of the fair value and number of awards expected 
to vest is based on management estimates. These 
estimates include the volatility of the share price 
and the expected number of options which will vest.
In the 2014/15 period there has been an IFRS 2 
charge of £226,000. The Share Based Payment 
reserve at 31 January 2015 is £1,224,000.
See accounting policy on page 62 and key sources 
of estimation within Note 2.
We have assessed Management’s accounting under 
the principles of IFRS 2 Share-based payments. We 
have tested the fair value calculations for all new 
share awards granted in the year and the vesting 
conditions and assessed the ongoing fair value of 
the existing share-based payments. This included:
•  a review of the share option award agreements;
•  an assessment of the reasonableness of inputs 
including volatility compared to a peer group;
•  recalculation of the amounts recognised over 
the vesting period; and
•  recalculation of the National Insurance 
amounts recognised in relation to these awards
The accounting for property leases  
(onerous lease provision)
Where the Group is the lessee of a property which 
is either vacant, loss making or sublet, a provision 
may be required to recognise the onerous element 
of the lease. The key judgements in the the 
calculation of the provision are the discount rate 
applied and forecast earnings at stores.
The total value of the provision at 31 January 2015 
is £1,865,000 and in the current period there has 
been a release of £430,000 of the onerous lease 
provision following the agreement of a sub-let of 
one of the leases previously provided against.
See accounting policy on page 67.
We have tested the utilisation and changes in the 
onerous lease provision and assessed whether 
the year-end provision is reasonable given the 
actual performance of the stores for which 
there is an onerous lease provision compared to 
Management’s forecasts. 
We have challenged all store forecasts to determine 
if the provision is complete.  Where stores do not 
have a provision, we have considered Management’s 
stated turnaround strategies in relation to the 
length of the lease remaining or plans to relocate 
the stores.
For stores where reductions in the onerous lease 
provision have been noted, we have challenged 
the circumstances of these reductions and agreed 
the changes to third party documentation and 
lease agreements.
Revenue recognition in relation to hire and 
bespoke deposits
We have identified the hire and bespoke revenue 
streams as areas of significant audit attention due 
to the specific accounting treatment of holding 
deposits as deferred revenue until the suits are 
collected by the customer. A risk exists that revenue 
could be released early before the collection has 
taken place.
At 31 January 2015, hire deposits of £1.3 million 
were recognised in deferred revenue in relation to 
future transactions. See the accounting policy on 
page 63.
We have tested the deferred revenue balance in 
relation to Hire and Bespoke deposits through 
inspection of sales invoices and recalculation of the 
deferred element. 
We have tested a sample of the direct costs held 
against the deferred hire revenue held on the 
balance sheet.
We have audited the recognition and release of the 
deferred revenue by investigating the substance 
of a sample of transactions within a week of the 
period end. This period is considered to cover the 
transactions most at risk of being recognised in the 
wrong period. 54 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk

The description of risks above should be read in conjunction with the significant issues considered by the 
Audit Committee discussed on page 24.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole, and not to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion 
on the financial statements is not modified with respect to any of the risks described above, and we do not 
express an opinion on these individual matters.
OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable 
that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We 
use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the group to be £0.5m (2014: £0.5m), which is below 0.5% (2014: 0.5%) 
of revenue, and below 2% (2014: 2%) of equity. Materiality is 10.4% of Profit on ordinary activities before 
taxation (2014: 11.3%).
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in 
excess of £10,000 (2014: £10,000), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds.  We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we 
identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT
Our audit work is designed to provide a full audit of the Group which consists of  Moss Bros Group PLC as 
the main trading entity and a number of dormant subsidiaries which are subject to analytical procedures. 
All work is performed by the Group audit team at the head office where all books and records are kept.
OPINION ON OTHER MATTERS PRESCRIBED BY THE COMPANIES ACT 2006
In our opinion:
•  the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
•  the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which 
the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
•  adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
• the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of 
directors’ remuneration have not been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. We have nothing to report arising 
from these matters.

Customer: Moss Bros Project Title: Report & Accounts 2014/15 T: 0207 055 6500 F: 020 7055 6600
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement 
relating to the company’s compliance with ten provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have 
nothing to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our 
opinion, information in the annual report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
•  apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the 
company acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our 
knowledge acquired during the audit and the directors’ statement that they consider the annual report is 
fair, balanced and understandable and whether the annual report appropriately discloses those matters 
that we communicated to the audit committee which we consider should have been disclosed. We confirm 
that we have not identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITOR
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.  Our 
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).  Those standards require us to comply with 
the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. We also comply with International Standard 
on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality 
control procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems include our 
dedicated professional standards review team and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 
of the Companies Act 2006.  Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.  
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.
SCOPE OF THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements 
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, 
whether caused by fraud or error.  This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation 
of the financial statements.  In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the 
annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any 
information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge 
acquired by us in the course of performing the audit.  If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE 53 WEEKS ENDED 31 JANUARY 2015
1. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Moss Bros Group PLC (“the Company”) is a public limited company incorporated in Great Britain and domiciled in the United 
Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. The address of the registered office is 8 St Johns Hill, London, SW11 1SA. The nature of 
the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic Review on pages 5 to 7. The consolidated financial 
statements of the Company for the 53 weeks ended 31 January 2015 (“the period”) comprise the Company and its subsidiaries 
(together “the Group”).
BASIS OF PREPARATION AND STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE
The Group and Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs). The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore 
the group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The preparation of financial information in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The 
estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be 
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets 
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Management believe the most significant areas of judgement to be:
Deferred tax
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and a judgement made over the probability of 
there being sufficient taxable profits arising in the future to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Share-based payments
The assumptions behind the Group’s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest is considered a key area of judgement.
Property Plant and Equipment
The estimated useful lives of non-current assets is considered to be a key area of judgement, particularly given the nature of 
the business.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting policies are recognised in 
the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of revision and future periods if the 
revision affects both current and future periods.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except where IFRSs require an alternative treatment. 
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.
The Group’s significant accounting policies are set out in this note, together with the judgements made by management in applying 
these policies, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements, apart from those 
involving estimations, which are dealt with separately in note 2. These accounting policies have been applied consistently to all 
periods presented in these consolidated financial statements except as set out below. The estimates and underlying assumptions 
are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
The Group and Company financial statements are presented in sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the Group operates and all values in tables are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds except when 
otherwise indicated.
The accounting policies adopted for the period are consistent with those adopted in the financial statements for the 52 weeks 
ended 25 January 2014. These can be seen via www.mossbros.co.uk.
Onerous property leases
The assumptions underlying these calculations are highly sensitive to small changes. MOSS BROS GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014/15 I 63

At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in 
these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU):
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the Standards and Interpretations listed above will have a material impact on the 
financial statements of the Group in future periods.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed 
review has been completed.
CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated Group accounts incorporate the accounts of Moss Bros Group PLC and its subsidiaries, all of which have made up 
their accounts to 31 January 2015. Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company has the 
power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In 
assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The financial statements 
of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control 
ceases. All intercompany balances, income, expenditure and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards 
and under the historical cost convention. The following Company accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with 
items which are considered material in relation to the Company’s financial statements. As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies 
Act 2006, the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account for the year. The Company only cash flow statement 
is the same as the Group as presented in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement.
The Company made a profit after taxation for the 53 week period to 31 January 2015 of £3,888,000 (52 week period to 25 January 2014: 
profit of £3,697,000*).
* Company balances restated due to presentation of Company Balance Sheet under IFRS accounting standards. See Note 25 for further details.
GOING CONCERN
The Directors, have at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources in place for operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Further detail is contained in the Corporate Governance Report on page 16.
REVENUE
Revenue comprises sales to third parties (excluding VAT) and is derived from the retail sale and hire of clothing and ancillary goods. 
Revenue is recognised on exchange of goods; for the hire of clothing, the exchange of goods occurs when the hire clothing and 
ancillary goods are collected for use by the customer. At this point it is deemed that all risks and rewards have been transferred. 
Hire deposits are held within deferred revenue until this date. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or 
receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT 
and other sales related taxes.
COST OF SALES
Cost of sales includes all costs of purchases and costs incurred in bringing inventories to their present location and condition. 
Costs of purchase comprise the purchase price, other taxes and transport costs. Inventory write downs are included in cost of sales 
when recognised. 64 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk

1. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
FOREIGN EXCHANGE
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and gains or 
losses on translation are included in the income statement.
LEASES
Leases under the terms of which the Company assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance 
leases. Assets acquired under finance leases are capitalised and the outstanding future lease obligations are shown in payables. As 
at 31 January 2015 and 25 January 2014, the Company had no finance leases. All other leases are defined as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
Amounts payable in respect of contingent rents are recognised in the period to which the sales relate.
Lease incentives are recognised as a liability. The aggregate benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of expense on a 
straight-line basis.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its exposure to foreign exchange rate risk. Further details of 
derivative financial instruments are disclosed in note 23.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured to 
their fair value at each balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative 
is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the 
nature of the hedge relationship
A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised 
as a financial liability. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the 
instrument is more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented 
as current assets or current liabilities.
HEDGE ACCOUNTING
Hedges of foreign exchange risk on firm commitments are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged 
item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the 
inception of the hedge and at interim and period end, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in 
offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item.
Cash flow hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in 
other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss, and is 
included in the ‘other gains and losses’ line item.
Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the 
periods when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss, in the same line of the income statement as the recognised hedged 
item. However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset, the gains and 
losses previously accumulated in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the 
non-financial asset.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, 
terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income at 
that time is accumulated in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. When a 
forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

DIVIDENDS
Dividends are not accrued until approved by Shareholders.
TAXATION
Group
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
CURRENT TAX
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profits as reported in the income 
statement because it excludes items of income and expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes 
items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
DEFERRED TAX
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in 
the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the 
balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred 
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if a temporary difference arises from the initial recognition 
of goodwill or from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the 
accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in 
which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Deferred tax is not discounted.
EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
Exceptional items are those significant credits or charges which, in the opinion of the Directors, should be separately disclosed by 
virtue of their size and one off nature, to enable a full understanding of the Group’s financial performance. Transactions which may 
give rise to exceptional items include charges for impairment, significant provisions for onerous property lease contracts, transaction 
related costs, redundancy costs and discontinued operations which have a material impact on the absolute amount of and trend in 
the result for the period. Therefore, such items are disclosed as exceptional on the face of the income statement.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
TRADE RECEIVABLES AND DEBTORS
Trade receivables and debtors represent amounts due from retailers in respect of sub-tenant income and concessions from which the 
Group trades, less commissions due.
GOVERNMENT GRANTS
Grants/compensation received in respect of expenses incurred are credited to the income statement to match the related expense. 
Grants/compensation received in respect of capital expenditure incurred are credited to property, plant and equipment and amortised 
to the income statement over the lives of the related assets.
PENSIONS
Contributions payable to the Group Personnel Pension Plan and other post retirement benefits are charged to the income statement 
in the period to which they relate. Differences between contributions payable in the period and contributions actually paid are shown 
as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet. 66 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk

1. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
SHARE-BASED PAYMENT
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the equity instrument at the grant date. 
Details are set out in note 8. The fair value determined at grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest. At each 
balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non 
market-based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in the profit or loss such 
that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Computer software and the directly related development costs that are not an integral part of the related hardware are classified as 
an intangible asset and stated at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over three to 
five years.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Depreciation is calculated so as to write down on a straight-line basis the cost of non-current assets over their estimated useful lives 
to their estimated residual values. The rates used are as follows:
Fixtures and fittings 5–10 years
Computer hardware 5 years
Computer software 3–5 years
Vehicles 6 years
Hire inventory is written down to £nil over its estimated useful economic life of five years.
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying value of its property plant and equipment and intangible assets to 
determine whether there is any indication that these assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the 
recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any.
The Group considers all the assets of a particular store to be one cash generating unit for the purposes of impairment estimate 
and the related assets of a particular store are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication 
of impairment.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in use. In assessing value in use of a store cash 
generating unit, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value.
If the recoverable amount of a cash generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the cash 
generating unit is reduced to the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
During 2014/15 the Group progressed with the store development programme which commenced during 2012/13. An additional 
charge of £0.5m was taken in 2012/13 to reflect accelerated depreciation on existing fixtures and fittings in those stores, so that the 
value of fixtures and fittings replaced on refit will be written off by the date of refit. Management have reassessed the useful economic 
lives of these assets and a £13,000 charge (2013/14: £13,000 credit) to the income statement has been made during the year ended 
31 January 2015. This has been treated as a prospective revision to the Group’s estimate for depreciation in accordance with IAS 8 
Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors.
LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS
Leasehold improvements are written off over the shorter of the period of the lease or the useful economic life of the assets on a 
straight-line basis.
Location premiums are paid to enter a property which is in a desirable location, stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision 
for impairment. Depreciation is calculated on location premiums over the useful economic life on a straight-line basis.
INVESTMENTS
Investments are stated at cost, less amounts written off for any impairment in value.
INVENTORIES
Retail inventory is valued at the lower of cost (weighted average by season) and estimated net realisable value (estimated selling price 
less estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in selling and distribution). Net realisable value is estimated as discussed 
in note 2. Volume discounts received and receivable are deducted from the cost of inventories.

Customer: Moss Bros Project Title: Report & Accounts 2014/15 T: 0207 055 6500 F: 020 7055 6600
PROVISIONS
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, and it is probable 
that the Group will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance 
sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash 
flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows.
Provisions for onerous property lease contracts are recognised when the Group believes that the unavoidable costs of meeting the 
lease obligations exceed the economic benefits to be received under the lease. Where material, these provisions are discounted to 
their present value. Provisions are recognised on a lease by lease basis.
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain 
future development of the business. To achieve this, the Board of Directors monitors the balance sheet, working capital, the cash 
flows and the level of dividends paid to shareholders.
The Board seeks to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the 
advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.
During the period the Company’s approach to capital management was reviewed and a policy of spreading cash deposits across 
three UK based banks was adopted so as to minimise the risks associated with default by any one bank. The banks selected carry 
the highest available credit ratings.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
2. KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
In applying the above accounting policies, management has made appropriate estimates in many areas and the actual outcome 
may differ from those calculated. The key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a significant risk of 
causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial period are:
IMPAIRMENT CALCULATIONS
The carrying amount of non-current assets on the balance sheet is dependent on the estimates of future profits and cash flows 
arising from the Company’s operations.
The key assumptions for the value used in calculating any impairment loss referred to in the property, plant and equipment 
accounting policy note, are regarding expected growth rates to individual stores during the year and discount rates applied to the 
forecast cash flows. Management estimates discount rates using a pre-tax discount rate based on the weighted average cost of 
capital for the Group. Sales and cost growth rates are based on the managements’ best expectations of future business performance 
over a maximum period of five years.
An impairment charge of £58,000 (2013/14: £nil) has been made during 2014/15 in relation to one loss making store.
ONEROUS PROPERTY LEASE CONTRACTS
The Company provides for onerous property lease contracts where the Group believes that the unavoidable costs of meeting the lease 
obligations exceed the economic benefit until the end of the lease. The provision is calculated as the lower of contracted rental costs, 
estimated net exit costs and the forecast operating losses through to the end of the lease. These provisions are based on the best 
estimate of the liability at the balance sheet date, the actual liability being dependent on future events such as economic conditions 
and marketplace demand. Expectations will be revised at each period until the actual liability arises, with any difference accounted 
for in the period in which the revision is made.
The provision for onerous property lease contracts is discounted to reflect the time value of money.
As a result, a credit of £281,000 was recognised within the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in relation to onerous 
property lease contracts for continuing operations for the period ended 31 January 2015 (2013/14: £397,000 charge). A further 
£364,000 credit was recognised in relation to an onerous lease which was sublet during the year. 68 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk

2. KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY CONTINUED 
SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS
The fair values of the options granted, and shares granted under the LTIP and SAYE, that are referred to in the accounting policies 
note, are measured using the Black-Scholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options and shares 
were granted. Details of the assumptions used are set out in note 8.
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS2 ‘Share-based Payments’. The Company has applied the requirements of FRS20 
‘Share-based Payments’.
The amount recorded in the statement of comprehensive income and statement of changes in equity in respect of share-based 
payment transactions, is an IFRS 2 charge of £226,000 and employer’s National Insurance charge of £80,000 (2013/14: IFRS 2 charge 
of £487,000 and employer’s National Insurance charge £188,000) and relates to the LTIP and SAYE.
INVENTORY PROVISIONS
Net realisable value is the selling price of inventory in the ordinary course of business less estimated selling costs. Provision is made 
for the estimated obsolescence of old seasons’ lines based on historical margin trends and for the estimated loss of inventory from 
shop theft based on historical data. The provision at 31 January 2015 was £455,000 (2013/14 £430,000).
3. REVENUE AND BUSINESS SEGMENTS
OPERATING SEGMENTS
The majority of the Company’s turnover arose in the United Kingdom, with the exception of two stores in Ireland.
IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components 
of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer to allocate resources to the segments and to assess 
their performance.
Information reported to the Group’s Chief Executive Officer for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment 
performance is focused on the split between Mainstream Retail, Bespoke and Hire. Given the similarities between Mainstream Retail 
and Bespoke, they meet the aggregation criteria under IFRS 8, therefore are both reported under Retail.
Information regarding the Group’s continuing operating segments is reported below.
The following is an analysis of the Group’s revenue and gross profit in the current and prior periods:

Only revenue and gross profit have been reported for the Group’s business segments; Retail and Hire, as the main operating costs, 
being property, related overheads and staff, cannot be separately identified as they both use the same stores and hence operating 
profit is not reported to the Chief Executive Officer split by Retail and Hire. Revenue and gross profit are the measures reported to the 
Chief Executive Officer for the purpose of resource allocation and assessment of segmental performance.
On the same basis, assets cannot be allocated between Retail and Hire, and are not reported to the Chief Executive Officer separately.

Olympics bid. £423,000 of this amount related to revenue and £1,017,000 related to fixed assets. Of the £1,017,000 which related to fixed assets, 
£610,000 was recognised in 2012/13 as an exceptional item representing six years accumulated depreciation and £407,000 was deferred into future

The Group and Company has applied the requirements of IFRS2 ‘Share-based Payments’.
SAVE AS YOU EARN SHARE OPTION SCHEME
A save as you earn scheme was approved and adopted in 2012/13. Under the terms of the scheme, the Board may offer options to 
purchase ordinary shares in the Company once in each financial year to those employees who enter into an HM Revenue & Customs 
(HMRC) approved Save As You Earn (SAYE) savings contract. For the 2014/15 plan, in line with HMRC regulations, the Board limited 
the maximum amount saved to £500 per month (2012/13 plan: £150 per month; cum 2013/14 plan: £250 per month). The price at 
which options were offered is the average closing price for three consecutive dealing days preceding the offer date. The options may 
normally be exercised during the six month period after the completion of the SAYE contract, three years after entering the scheme.

(1) Company balances restated due to presentation of Company Balance Sheet under IFRS accounting standards
At 31 January 2015 the deferred tax asset in respect of capital allowances, share-based payments and other short term temporary 
differences was recognised on the basis that the Company is profitable in 2015/16 and forecasts to be profitable in future years. 
At the balance sheet date, the Finance Act 2013 had been substantively enacted confirming that the main UK corporation tax rate 
will reduce to 21% with effect from 1 April 2014 and 20% from 1 April 2015. Therefore, at 31 January 2015, deferred tax assets and 
liabilities have been calculated based on a rate of 20% where the temporary difference is expected to reverse after 1 April 2015. These 
reductions may also reduce the Group’s future current tax charges accordingly.
10. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per ordinary share is based on the weighted average of 96,760,838 (2013/14: 95,230,174) ordinary shares in issue 
during the period after deducting for shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust and are calculated by reference to the profit 
attributable to shareholders of £3,888,000 (2013/14: profit of £3,580,000).
Diluted earnings per ordinary share is based upon the weighted average of 102,254,592 (2013/14: 101,294,098) ordinary shares 
after deducting for shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust, which include the effects of shares under SAYE, LTIP and Deferred 
Bonus Shares of 5,493,754, that were anti-dilutive for the period presented and could dilute earnings per share in the future and are 
calculated by reference to the profit attributable to shareholders as stated above.

*  The additional provision of £100,000 on dilapidations during the period reflects the Group’s estimate of obligations arising under operating leases. 
The additional provision of £84,000 represents one store provided for during the year.
**  The release of £430,000 on Onerous property lease provisions was in respect of an onerous lease which was sublet during the year. The net release, 
after charging £66,000 of capital contribution and professional fees, was a £364,000 credit to the income statement.
***  The utilisation of £249,000 of Dilapidations provision and £365,000 of Onerous property lease provision was the release on continuing stores.
The provision at 31 January 2015 of £1,865,000 (25 January 2014: £2,576,000) on onerous leases is the estimated future cost of the 
Group’s onerous property lease contracts and will be released over the lease terms up until 2024. The net release to the income 
statement on stores which closed during the year and on continuing stores was £645,000 (2013/14: release of £397,000). This has 
been discounted to reflect the time value of money. The effect of the unwinding of the discount rate on the release for the year was a 
credit of £135,000 (2013/14: credit of £220,000).
The provision at 31 January 2015 of £370,000 (25 January 2014: £519,000) on dilapidations is the estimated future cost of the Group’s 
dilapidations and is expected to be released within one year.

22. PENSIONS
The Group currently operates a defined contribution scheme. As at 31 January 2015 there were £47,000 outstanding contributions 
relating to the defined contribution scheme (25 January 2014: £49,000).
23. ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
(A) MANAGEMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
The Company’s financial instruments comprise cash and various items such as derivative forward foreign currency transactions, 
trade receivables and payables that arise directly from its operations.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage the Company’s liquidity.
The main risks arising from the Company’s financial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and interest rate 
risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks.
CREDIT RISK
Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is maintained on an ongoing basis. At the Balance Sheet date, 
there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The carrying amount of each financial asset represents the maximum credit exposure.
LIQUIDITY RISK
Cash balances are managed and monitored on a daily basis and the peaks and troughs in the cash cycle are well known through 
experience. The Company continues to operate the business from a debt free position and current trading levels generate a healthy 
cash flow.
FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK
The Company’s policy is to mitigate all currency exposures on purchases either by buying the amount of currency required at the 
time the obligation is known and holding it in a designated bank account until it is needed or by taking out forward foreign currency 
contracts. Details of forward foreign currency contracts outstanding as at 31 January 2015 are detailed in note (E) below.
INTEREST RATE RISK
Interest rate risk arises from investment of cash balances on short term deposits. The Company is not exposed to any other interest 
rate risk.

The Company recognised an allowance for doubtful debts where the trade receivable was considered irrecoverable on the basis of 
ageing and historical experience. In the current period £9,000 was provided for (2014/15: £5,000). If the Company believes that a 
specific balance is irrecoverable, it will be written off. The Company does not require collateral in respect of these financial assets.

Cash and cash equivalents generate interest income on short term deposits. The Company has no fixed rate financial instruments. 
Based on the average cash balance, the effective interest rate on financial assets is 0.46% (2013/14: 0.60%). 88 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk

23. ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CONTINUED
(C) FINANCIAL LIABILITIES 
There were no financial liabilities after excluding derivative financial instruments, as detailed below, and current trade payables as at 
31 January 2015 (2013/14: £nil).
(D) FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
As at 31 January 2015 and 25 January 2014, there was no material difference between the fair values and book values of the 
Company’s financial assets or liabilities.

Financial liabilities carried at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL)
 Forward foreign currency contracts    – (162)
    – (162)
In the current year the Group entered into several forward foreign currency contracts, to protect the cost to the Group of 2014/15 
inventory purchases and hedge against the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. During 2014/15 the Group had entered into £6,404,000 
(2013/14: £3,501,000) US dollar forward contracts which were outstanding at 31 January 2015. In the current year, these have been 
designated as cash flow hedges. The associated fair value gains and losses will be transferred to inventories when the purchases 
occur during the next 12 months, at which time the amount deferred in equity will be reclassified to profit and loss. At 31 January 
2015, £691,000 has been deferred in equity (2013/14: £144,000). The ineffective portion of cash flow hedges recognised in “Other gains 
and losses” within profit or loss is a debit of £17,000 (2013/14: credit of £2,000).
CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group manages its capital to ensure that the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to 
stakeholders through the optimism of the debt and equity balance. The Group’s overall strategy remains unchanged from 2011/12.
The capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents, and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, 
comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as a disclosed in note 18.
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
The Group’s risk management committee reviews the capital structure on a semi-annual basis. As part of this review, the committee 
considers the cost of capital and risks associated with each class of capital.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted (including criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement 
and the bases for recognition of income and expenses) for each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are 
disclosed in note 1.

Effect of 10% appreciation in foreign exchange rates on derivative cash flow hedges
Sterling against US Dollar
 Deferred in equity – Hedge Reserve    (66) (309)
 Profit or loss ineffectiveness    – (25)
The impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on cash flow hedges results from retranslation of forward purchases of US Dollars 
used to hedge 2015/16 inventory purchases. A negative number indicates a credit to equity where Sterling strengthens 10% against 
the US Dollar. The associated fair value gains and losses are deferred in equity until the purchases occur.
The sensitivity analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying amount of trade and other payables 
and receivables, due to the low associated sensitivity, and are reported before the effect of tax. It has been prepared on the basis 
that the Group’s hedging activities, hedge accounting designations and derivate contracts remain constant, reflecting the position at 
31 January 2015. Consequently, the analysis relates to the position at that date and is not necessarily representative of 2014/15 then 
ended. In preparing the sensitivity analysis, it is assumed that all hedges are fully effective.
The effect shown above would be reversed in the event of an equal and opposite change in foreign exchange rate.
All derivatives are categories as level 2 under the requirements of IFRS 7 and they are valued using techniques based significantly on 
observed market data.

24. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS CONTINUED
TRADING TRANSACTIONS
The Group entered into the following transactions with related parties who are not members of the Group:
Berkeley Burke Trustee Company Limited is considered a related party of the Group because Brian Brick, Chief Executive Officer 
of Moss Bros Group plc is a beneficiary of the pension fund. On 8 December 2011, Moss Bros Group plc agreed a long term lease 
with Berkeley Burke Trustee Company Limited, a pension fund and the superior landlord, for a store in Hounslow, on an arm’s 
length basis.
Moss Bros agreed a sublet of a store lease to White Stuff Ltd. Debbie Hewitt, Chairman of Moss Bros Group plc, is also Chairman 
and director of White Stuff. The transaction was on arms length commercial terms and Debbie Hewitt took no part in determining 
the commercial terms offered by Moss Bros or in the decision to accept them taken by White Stuff. The sublet is from June 2014 
until December 2021 at a rent of £50,000 per year. A capital contribution of £50,000 was paid to White Stuff on completion of the 
agreement. At the 31 January 2015 the balance due from White Stuff was £3,751 in respect of service charges payable in arrears.
25. COMPANY BALANCE SHEET RESTATEMENT
In the period to 31 January 2015 the Company only Balance Sheet has been reported in accordance with IFRSs for the first time 
as detailed in the accounting policies in Note 1. Previously the Company only Balance Sheet was reported under United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards. As a result of this change, as detailed in IAS 1, the comparative Balance Sheet positions for the period ending 
25 January 2014 and the opening position of this period at 26 January 2013 need to be restated and presented under IFRS. This note 
details the key adjustments made to the Company only Balance sheet on implementation of the IFRSs.

2.  Pursuant to regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 and section 360(B)(2) of the Act, the Company 
specifies that in order to have the right to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting (and also for the purpose of determining 
how many votes a person entitled to attend and vote may cast), a person must be entered on the register of members of the 
Company at 6pm on 20 May 2015 or, in the event of any adjournment, at 6pm on the date which is two days before the day of the 
adjourned meeting. Changes to entries on the register of members after this time shall be disregarded in determining the rights 
of any person to attend or vote at the meeting.
3.  A member of the Company entitled to attend, speak and vote at the Annual General Meeting may appoint a proxy to attend, speak 
and vote in their place. A member may appoint more than one proxy in relation to the Annual General Meeting provided that 
each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by that member. A proxy need not be a 
member of the Company.
4.  A form of proxy for the 2015 Annual General Meeting is enclosed. To be valid, the completed and signed form of proxy, together 
with the power of attorney or authority, if any, under which it is signed (or a duly certified copy of any such power or authority), 
or other instrument appointing a proxy must be received by post or by hand (during normal business hours) with the Company’s 
registrars, Capita Asset Services at PXS1, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, BR3 4ZF as soon as possible but not less than 
48 hours before the time of the meeting. If you are a CREST member, see note 5 below. Alternatively, a member may appoint a 
proxy electronically, or may wish to vote electronically online, at www.capitashareportal.com. Please see the form of proxy for 
further details.
  Return of a completed form of proxy, or other instrument appointing a proxy or any CREST Proxy Instruction will not preclude a 
member from attending and voting personally at the meeting if he/she wishes to do so.
5.  Alternatively, if you are a member of CREST, you may register the appointment of a proxy by using the CREST electronic proxy 
appointment service. Further details are contained below.
  CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for 
the Annual General Meeting and any adjournment(s) thereof by using the procedures, and to the address, described in the CREST 
Manual (available via www.euroclear .com/CREST) subject to the provisions of the Company’s articles of association. CREST personal 
members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s), should 
refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
  In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a 
“CREST Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK and Ireland Limited’s (“Euroclear”) 
specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message, 
regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a previously 
appointed proxy, must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (ID RA10) by the latest time(s) 
for receipt of proxy appointments specified in the notice of the Annual General Meeting, being 12 noon on 20 May 2015. For this 
purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the time stamp applied to the message by the CREST 
Applications Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by 
CREST. After this time any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee 
through other means.
  CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s) should note that Euroclear does not 
make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore 
apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if 
the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure 
that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is 
transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, 
their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s) are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning 
practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
  The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the 
Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.
6.  Any person to whom this notice is sent who is a person currently nominated by a member of the Company to enjoy information 
rights under section 146 of the Act (a “nominated person”) may have a right under an agreement between him/her and such 
member by whom he/she was nominated, to be appointed, or to have someone else appointed, as a proxy for the Annual General 
Meeting. If a nominated person has no such proxy appointment right or does not wish to exercise it, he/she may have a right 
under such an agreement to give instructions to the member concerned as to the exercise of voting rights. The statement of the 
above rights of the members in relation to the appointment of proxies does not apply to a nominated person. Such rights can only 
be exercised by a member of the Company. 94 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk

7.  Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all of its 
powers as a member provided that they do not do so in relation to the same shares.
8.  Any member attending the Annual General Meeting has the right to ask questions. The Company must cause to be answered 
any such question relating to the business being dealt with at the meeting but no such answer need be given if (a) to do so would 
interfere unduly with the preparation for the meeting or involve the disclosure of confidential information, (b) the answer has 
already been given on a website in the form of an answer to a question, or (c) it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or 
the good order of the meeting that the question be answered.
9.  Under section 527 of the Act, members meeting the threshold requirements set out in that section have the right to require the 
Company to publish on a website a statement setting out any matter relating to: (i) the audit of the Company’s accounts (including 
the auditor’s report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the Annual General Meeting; or (ii) any circumstance 
connected with an auditor of the Company ceasing to hold office since the previous meeting at which annual accounts and reports 
were laid in accordance with section 437 of the Act, (in each case) that the members propose to raise at the Annual General 
Meeting. The Company may not require the members requesting any such website publication to pay its expenses in complying 
with sections 527 or 528 of the Act. Where the Company is required to place a statement on a website under section 527 of the 
Act, it must forward the statement to the Company’s auditor not later than the time when it makes the statement available on the 
website. The business which may be dealt with at the meeting includes any statement that the Company has been required under 
section 527 of the Act to publish on a website.
10.  As at 2 April 2015 (being the last practicable date prior to the date of this document) the Company’s issued share capital 
consists of 100,799,873 ordinary shares, carrying one vote each. Therefore, the total voting rights in the Company as at that date 
are 100,799,873.
11.  You may not use any electronic address (within the meaning of section 333(4) of the Act) provided in this notice (or in any related 
documents including the proxy form) to communicate with the Company for any purposes other than those expressly stated.
12.  Under section 338 and section 338A of the Act, members meeting the threshold requirements in those sections have the right 
to require the Company (i) to give, to members of the Company entitled to receive notice of the Annual General Meeting, notice 
of a resolution which may properly be moved and is intended to be moved at the meeting and/or (ii) to include in the business 
to be dealt with at the meeting any matter (other than a proposed resolution) which may be properly included in the business. 
A resolution may properly be moved or a matter may properly be included in the business unless (a) (in the case of a resolution 
only) it would, if passed, be ineffective (whether by reason of inconsistency with any enactment or the Company’s constitution 
or otherwise), (b) it is defamatory of any person, or (c) it is frivolous or vexatious. Such a request may be in hard copy form or in 
electronic form, must identify the resolution of which notice is to be given or the matter to be included in the business, must be 
authorised by the person or persons making it, must be received by the Company not later than the date 6 clear weeks before the 
meeting, and (in the case of a matter to be included in the business only) must be accompanied by a statement setting out the 
grounds for the request.
13.  Voting on all resolutions at the Annual General Meeting will be by way of a poll. This means that you will be asked to complete 
a poll card if you attend in person. The Company believes that this is the best way of representing the views of as many 
shareholders as possible in the voting process.
EXPLANATORY NOTES
1.  Resolution 2. This resolution is to approve the Directors’ remuneration report (other than the part containing the Directors’ 
remuneration policy) for the financial year ended on 31 January 2015. You can find the report on pages 41 to 50 of the Company’s 
Annual Report and Accounts 2014/2015, which is available on the Company’s website www.mossbros.co.uk/investors/annual_
reports.htm. As this vote is an advisory vote, no entitlement of a Director to remuneration is conditional on it. This resolution 
should be put annually as required by the Companies Act 2006.
2.  Resolutions 3 to 8. As required by the UK Corporate Governance Code, biographical details of each of the Directors standing 
for re-election appear on page 19 of the Company’s Annual Report and Accounts 2014/2015. Under the Company’s articles of 
association, one-third of the Directors are required to retire by rotation each year. However, in accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, all the Directors will submit themselves for annual re-election by shareholders. The Chairman is satisfied that, 
following individual formal performance evaluations, the performance of the Directors standing for re-election continues to be 
effective and to demonstrate commitment to the role.
3.  Resolution 12. Your Directors may allot shares and grant rights to subscribe for, or convert any security into, shares only if 
authorised to do so by shareholders. The authority granted at the last Annual General Meeting is due to expire at this year’s 
Annual General Meeting. Accordingly, resolution 12 will be proposed as an ordinary resolution to grant new authorities to allot 
shares and grant rights to subscribe for, or convert any security into, shares. If given, these authorities will expire at the Annual 
General Meeting in 2016 or on 31 July 2016, whichever is earlier. Resolution 12 will allow the Directors to allot ordinary shares up

to a maximum nominal amount of £1,678,317, representing approximately one-third (33.33 per cent.) of the Company’s existing 
issued share capital and calculated as at 2 April 2015 (being the latest practicable date prior to date of this document).
 As at 2 April 2015 (being the last practicable date prior to the date of this document) the Company holds no treasury shares.
4.  Resolution 13. Your Directors also require a power from shareholders to allot equity securities for cash and otherwise than to 
existing shareholders pro rata to their holdings. The power granted at the last Annual General Meeting is due to expire at this 
year’s Annual General Meeting. Accordingly, resolution 13 will be proposed as a special resolution to grant such a power. Apart 
from offers or invitations in proportion to the respective number of shares held, the power will be limited to the allotment of 
equity securities for cash up to an aggregate nominal value of £251,999.68 (being five per cent. of the Company’s issued ordinary 
share capital at 2 April 2015, being the latest practicable date prior to date of this document). If given, this power will expire on 
31 July 2016 or at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting in 2016, whichever is the earlier. Your Directors will have due 
regard to institutional guidelines in relation to any exercise of this power, in particular the requirement for advance consultation 
and explanation before making any non pre-emptive cash issue pursuant to this resolution which exceeds 7.5 per cent of the 
Company’s issued share capital in any rolling three year period.
5.  Resolution 14. This resolution will give the Company authority to purchase its own shares in the markets up to a limit of 10 per 
cent of its issued ordinary share capital. The maximum and minimum prices are stated in the resolution. Your Directors believe 
that it is advantageous for the Company to have this flexibility to make market purchases of its own shares. Your Directors will 
exercise this authority only if they are satisfied that a purchase would result in an increase in expected earnings per share and 
would be in the interests of shareholders generally.
  In the event that shares are purchased, they may either be cancelled (and the number of shares in issue would be reduced 
accordingly) or, in accordance with the Act, be retained as treasury shares. The Company will consider holding repurchased 
shares pursuant to the authority conferred by this resolution as treasury shares. This would give the Company the ability to re-
issue treasury shares quickly and cost effectively and would provide the Company with additional flexibility in the management of 
its capital base.
  As at 2 April 2015, being the last practicable date prior to the date of this document, the total number of options over ordinary 
shares in the capital of the Company that were outstanding under all of the Company’s share option plans was 5,230,399, which 
if exercised would represent 5.19 per cent. of the Company’s issued share capital at that date. If the Company were to purchase 
its own shares to the fullest possible extent of its authority from shareholders (existing and being sought), this number of 
outstanding options could potentially represent 5.78 per cent of the issued share capital of the Company.
6.  Resolution 15. Changes made to the Act by the Companies (Shareholders’ Rights) Regulations 2009 increase the notice period 
required for general meetings of the Company to at least 21 clear days unless shareholders approve a shorter notice period, which 
cannot however be less than 14 clear days. (Annual General Meetings will continue to be held on at least 21 clear days’ notice.)
  Until the coming into force of the Companies (Shareholders’ Rights) Regulations 2009 on 3 August 2009, the Company was able to 
call general meetings other than an annual general meeting on at least 14 clear days’ notice without obtaining such shareholder 
approval. In order to preserve this ability, resolution 15 seeks the necessary shareholder approval. The approval will be effective 
until the Company’s next Annual General Meeting, when it is intended that a similar resolution will be proposed.
  The flexibility offered by this resolution will be used where, taking into account the circumstances, the directors consider this 
appropriate in relation to the business to be considered at the meeting.
  Note that the changes to the Act mean that, in order to be able to call a general meeting on less than 21 clear days’ notice, the 
Company must make a means of electronic voting available to all shareholders for that meeting.
7. Recommendation

are available:
 (a)  To appoint the Chairman as your sole proxy in respect of all your shares, simply fill in any voting instructions in the appropriate box and sign and date the form of 
proxy.
 (b)  To appoint a person other than the Chairman as your sole proxy in respect of all your shares, delete the words ‘the Chairman, or failing him the Senior Non-Executive

 (c)  To appoint more than one proxy, you may photocopy this form of proxy. Please indicate the proxy holder’s name and the number of shares in relation to which they 
are authorised to act as your proxy (which, in aggregate, should not exceed the number of shares held by you). Please also indicate if the proxy instruction is one of 
multiple instructions being given. If you wish to appoint the Chairman as one of your multiple proxies, simply write ‘the Chairman of the Annual General Meeting’. All 
forms must be signed and should be returned together in the same envelope.
2. Unless otherwise indicated the proxy will vote as he thinks fit or, at his discretion, abstain from voting.
3.  The form of proxy must arrive at Capita Asset Services, PXS1, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, BR3 4ZF during usual business hours accompanied by any power of

(according to the order in which the names stand in the register in respect of the holding) who tenders a vote in person or by proxy shall be accepted to the exclusion of 
the vote of the other joint holder(s).

a resolution.

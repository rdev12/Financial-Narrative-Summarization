Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Abcam plc
Chairman’s review
Introduction
This is my first full year review as Chairman of Abcam and 
covers a period during which the global economic environment 
has continued to create challenges of exceptional scale and 
duration for many companies. It is therefore very pleasing to 
report another outstanding performance from Abcam.
Financial highlights
Revenue increased by 25.2% to £71.1m (2009: £56.8m). 
Over the period we benefited from the relative weakness of 
Sterling, which had a positive impact on sales, but less so than 
in recent years. However, underlying sales growth at constant 
currency rates was still very strong at 23.1% (i.e. if foreign 
currency exchange rates had remained unchanged from 2009) 
with good performances coming from each of our main 
geographic markets.
Operating profit increased by 61.6% to £25.6m (2009: £15.9m 
after a non-recurring fixed asset impairment related charge of 
£1.1m). This strong performance reflects some benefit from 
exchange rates but also good cost management in the purchasing 
of OEM products, greater production efficiency leading to lower 
costs for our own products and tight operational cost control 
which, as sales have increased, has enabled the benefits of the 
operational gearing of the business to come through. Although 
opportunities exist within the business for further operational 
gearing, these are more limited and are unlikely to be at the 
same scale as in the 2009/10 financial year.
Lower interest rates led to a reduction in investment income, 
meaning that the growth in profit before tax was 58.4% at £25.8m 
(2009: £16.3m after a non-recurring fixed asset impairment 
related charge of £1.1m). After the award of share-based 
incentives to employees and the issuing of new shares following 
the exercise of share options, the growth in Earnings Per Share 
(EPS) was 54.5% to 53.82p (2009: 34.83p).
Cash flow in the period has been exceptionally strong with cash 
generated from operations of £24.9m (2009: £16.4m prior to 
one-off receipt of lease incentive of £1.1m). Operating cash flows 
before working capital movements were £28.7m (2009: £18.9m), 
giving a cash conversion ratio of 86.8% (2009: 87.0%). 
At 30 June 2010 cash and short-term deposits amounted 
to £40.2m (2009: £25.5m). 
“ Abcam has been resilient in the recent economic turmoil and we are fortunate 
in being geographically well-hedged, in a market where increasing levels of 
research mean that demand continues apace for high quality research tools.”

Dividends
Last year the Board increased the dividend distribution ratio 
to 35% of post-tax profit in the light of the strong cash flow and 
continued success of the Group. Further progress has been made 
on both these fronts in the 2009/10 financial year and consequently 
the Directors are recommending that the distribution ratio be 
increased to 37.5%. An interim dividend of 5.42p per share 
was paid in April 2010 and the Directors are recommending a 
final dividend of 14.61p per share, making a total of 20.03p for 
the year, an increase of 65.4% on that paid last year. Subject 
to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) in 
November, the final dividend will be paid on 26 November 2010 
to shareholders on the register on 5 November 2010.
Proposed share sub-division
In recent years the market price of the Company’s ordinary 
shares of one pence each has risen to a level where the Board 
believes that it is appropriate to propose the sub-division of each 
of the existing ordinary shares into five new ordinary shares of 
0.2 pence each. This may improve the liquidity and marketability 
of the ordinary shares of the Company by reducing the market 
price of an ordinary share and increasing the number of shares 
in issue. The Board will seek approval from shareholders for the 
proposed sub-division at the Company’s forthcoming AGM 
in November 2010.
People
I have been immensely impressed by the energy, knowledge 
and commitment of our staff, whom I would like to thank for their 
continued efforts on Abcam’s behalf, and in particular for their 
contribution to such a successful year. 
We also greatly value all our other stakeholders – customers, 
suppliers and shareholders – and appreciate their continued 
loyalty and support.
Outlook
Abcam has been resilient in the recent economic turmoil and 
we are fortunate in being geographically well-hedged, in a market 
where increasing levels of research mean that demand continues 
apace for high quality research tools. The new financial year has 
started well with sales in line with management’s expectations. 
However we still remain cautious due to the pressure on 
governments, especially in the West, to reduce their deficits 
and the potential for reductions in research funding which 
may impact our business.

Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Abcam plc
Chief Executive Officer’s review
I am delighted to report on another successful year for Abcam, 
with sales at £71.1m and strong growth of 25.2% (23.1% on 
a constant currency basis). We continued to attract many new 
customers and gain market share through a combination of 
continually adding high quality products to our catalogue, 
increasing validation of our existing products with a rigorous 
focus on data gathering and presentation, and providing high 
levels of customer service and support.
We also continue to invest to drive longer-term growth but, thanks 
to tight cost control and the operational gearing in the business, 
profit before tax increased by 58.4% to £25.8m (2009: £16.3m 
after a £1.1m charge associated with the restructuring at the 
production facility).
Market review
Sales in North America grew by 20.1% to $50.2m (£31.8m) 
(2009: $41.8m, £26.2m), representing 44.7% of our total sales 
for the year. We have continued to extend our commitment to 
improving service levels in the year, particularly on the West Coast 
where we have opened a small office in San Francisco to increase 
access to customer support in the region and to promote Abcam 
in the local market. Our programme of targeting other areas 
which we believe have high potential for sales growth has also 
contributed to this increase, which is a pleasing result in a 
highly competitive market. 
We have improved our service offering in Europe during the year. 
Local language support is now available for extended periods 
each day to allow better access for researchers to our customer 
support teams and we are now able to offer same-day receipt 
and despatch of orders to more customers across Europe. 
Emphasising knowledge, 
training and experience
We are building a great company by recruiting 
excellent people. Our Company culture is one that 
empowers individuals with responsibility given at an 
early stage. We are able to attract and retain the best 
calibre employees by creating a challenging yet fun 
environment where everyone is working together 
for success.
CORPORATE CUlTURE
“ I am delighted to report on another successful year for Abcam, with 
sales at £71.1m and strong growth of 25.2%.”
Jonathan Milner Chief Executive Officer
This year team leaders from 
across the organisation took 
part in a management framework 
programme, ensuring excellent 
people management throughout 
the business. 
We have an open plan environment 
that encourages communication 
between departments. Ideas and 
problems are shared for the 
best outcome.  11
Abcam plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
In addition, we have been successful in appointing non-exclusive 
distributors within certain European countries to enable us to sell 
to organisations not otherwise accessible to us. Sales to Europe 
grew by 20.5% to €22.7m (£20.0m) (2009: €18.9m, £16.3m), 
representing 28.2% of our total sales for the year.
We also had a successful year in the UK, which is our most 
highly penetrated market and where we have a market leadership 
position. Sales grew by 15.3% to £5.6m (2009: £4.9m), representing 
7.9% of our total sales for the year. The growth rate in the second 
half of the financial year was slightly higher than in the first half 
but the funding pressures we saw in the first half are still a feature 
of the market.
We continued the development of relationships with our network 
of sub-dealers in Japan, who have handled all our sales since 
January 2009. Working with them enables us to get closer to 
our customers than was previously the case and to build on the 
feedback we receive to better identify and fulfil our customers’ 
requirements. Sales in Japan grew by 39.7% to ¥983m (£6.8m) 
(2009: ¥704m, £4.6m), representing 9.5% of our total sales 
for the year.
We opened our sales and marketing office in Hong Kong in July 2009 
initially to drive sales in China and Hong Kong, but with the longer-term 
aim of taking on the management of our distributor network in 
South East Asia. It has been a very busy year for the team as they 
have been recruiting staff, appointing distributors in China and 
improving our delivery capability into China through the selection 
of a local company to handle the importation of our products. 
“The supply chain team specialises 
in the management of our stock pipeline. We work 
with a variety of departments ensuring customers 
get the products they want quickly. A key 
achievement during the final quarter of the 
year has been fulfilling over 78% of orders 
directly from stock.”

Chief Executive Officer’s review continued
Market review continued
We expect it will take several years to develop our position in 
the Chinese market to its full potential but we have made good 
progress in the year as sales to Hong Kong and China grew by 
62.2% to HK$34.3m (£2.8m) (2009: HK$21.1m, £1.7m), or 
3.9% of total sales.
Sales to the rest of the world, which is predominantly the 
remainder of South East Asia and is mostly served through local 
distributors, increased by 29.8% to $6.5m (£4.1m) (2009: $5.0m, 
£3.1m), representing 5.8% of total sales for the year. We continue 
to work closely with our distributor network and build on initiatives 
to improve our proximity to our researchers, which is a recurring 
theme throughout our business, and will be assisted by our 
South East Asian business now being managed locally through 
our Hong Kong office. 
Catalogue growth
We have increased the number of products in the catalogue 
by 20.2% during the year to 63,010, including over 50,000 
antibodies. Of the 10,610 new products, over 7,700 are 
antibodies from our supplier base, which continues to give us 
access to many top quality antibodies, and almost 700 were our 
own produced antibodies. We have also extended the breadth 
of antibody-related reagents we offer by over 2,200 products, 
including adding more ELISA kits, IHC reagents, proteins and 
other protein detection tools. The largest by number were proteins 
and growth in protein sales in the year was over 50% at £1.2m.
Developing our business 
through communication
We value communication: with our staff, suppliers, 
customers and the scientific community. Ideally we like 
to meet face to face at tradeshows, conferences and 
key account activities. One way for us to gain insight 
into customer needs is with focus groups. In the past 
year we held three, meeting with scientists and discussing 
the challenges they face in their labs today.
CUSTOMER EngAgEMEnT
We run quarterly surveys to 
speak with customers and monitor 
satisfaction with our products 
and services. 
Our market research team is able to gather intelligence 
quickly by polling customers on a range of topics. We act 
swiftly on feedback and inform future business decisions. 
Above Our open plan environment fosters cross-departmental 
communication, everyone working together for the best outcome
Developing 
leaders 13
Abcam plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
New products added during the year contributed £2.7m to 
sales in total, representing 3.8% of total sales. As information is 
added to these products through external publications, customer 
feedback and our own characterisation, we expect sales from 
them to increase over time.
During the year we refined our inventory purchasing methodology 
with the aim of improving customer service levels by increasing 
the number of orders that can be fulfilled directly from stock. 
This has resulted in an increase in inventory on a selective basis 
and as a result the closing inventory level was £9.1m (2009: £6.8m). 
eCommerce and marketing
The performance of the website is key to our success and during 
the year we have continued to invest to improve both the website 
functionality and accessibility. The response time for users around 
the world has improved by an average of 29% during the year 
and we have launched a Chinese version of the site to support 
our marketing initiatives in that region. 
We pride ourselves on our ability to work closely across our 
business disciplines. For example, our eCommerce, IT and 
marketing departments work together on our ongoing programme 
aimed at making the marketing to our customer database more 
effective and more relevant. This has been very successful over 
the years and continues to drive record numbers of visits to our 
website, which saw an increase of 29% over last year. 
The development and implementation of a new software 
module means that we can now undertake promotional activities 
which can be targeted at particular audiences and at particular 
complementary product ranges, making our marketing much 
more efficient and cost effective. We look forward to building on 
our eCommerce model, which will serve us well as we expand our 
range of protein detection tools. 
Our conference programme is a very effective marketing tool, 
enabling us to promote Abcam at the same time as hearing first 
hand from speakers and attendees about new developments at 
the cutting edge of research. In the 2009/10 financial year we 
held over a dozen events in locations across the world, and were 
delighted with the calibre of speakers we were able to attract. 
The year also saw record levels of customer satisfaction with 
the scientific quality of the conferences and several events were 
oversubscribed, demonstrating our increased success in this area. 
Our production facility
We reorganised our production facility during the 2008/09 
financial year, since which time great strides forward have 
been made in terms of production efficiency and in meeting our 
ongoing commitment to increase characterisation data on our 
products. The images provided by the production facility feed 
into our strategy of continually adding data to the catalogue from 
a range of sources, which this year included a continuation of 
our programme of commissioning data provision from selected 
third parties.
“ We have increased the number of products in the catalogue by 20.2% 
during the year to 63,010, including over 50,000 antibodies.”
“This year we're redesigning our product 
datasheets. These represent the most important 
content on our website so we created a beta site 
allowing us to share and seek feedback on the new 
design and functionality, in advance of a 
mainstream launch.”

Our production facility continued
Production in the year was at record levels through improved 
management of our product pipeline and an overhaul of our 
processes, which also saw the introduction of a new quality control 
system to ensure quality is maintained as production increases. 
Efficiency initiatives and people
A review of the year would not be complete without reference to 
our drive for efficiency improvements, which has been an integral 
part of our thinking since the Company was founded. During the 
year, we have reduced the size of our packaging and designed a 
smaller format of the data sheets which we use when shipping 
products to customers. This has increased efficiency as the new 
packs are easier to handle, whilst also improving our ability to 
maintain a temperature-controlled environment during shipping. 
As part of this initiative we redesigned the holders in which we 
ship vials to make them smaller and lighter. The new holders are 
coloured, inter-connecting Abcam-branded bricks, helping to 
improve efficiency whilst also representing a significant marketing 
opportunity, and have been a great success with customers.
The dedication, ability and sheer enthusiasm of our staff are an 
inspiration and it is their efforts that are behind the Company’s 
achievements, so enormous thanks to them. I would also like to 
welcome Mike Redmond as our new Chairman, who is already 
making a significant contribution to the Board.
Fostering a creative 
approach
To ensure we maintain efficiency and develop our 
product offering, employees are encouraged to 
champion their ideas. This culture of improvement and 
innovation ensures we have a pipeline of opportunities 
to assess, creating added value to customers whilst 
increasing profitability of the Group. If it’s something 
we’re passionate about and is beneficial to customers 
and the business, we’ll make it happen.

“ The dedication, ability and sheer enthusiasm of our staff are an 
inspiration and it is their efforts that are behind the Company’s 
achievements.”
Processing thousands of 
orders every year we spend a lot 
of time labelling products. With no 
automated solution on the market, 
we co-developed an automated vial 
labelling machine. This improved 
the efficiency of our operation teams 
four-fold and the design patent 
offers future licensing opportunities.

reducing waste and giving storage flexibility 
We’ve also integrated dry ice shipping facilities enabling us to 
provide customers with a more extensive range of temperature 
sensitive proteins.

investment possibilities.
Strategic development
Abcam’s ruthless focus on giving our customers the widest 
possible choice of antibody research tools for detection and study 
of their proteins has created a very successful business which has 
been able to continually and sustainably generate significant 
value for all its stakeholders. We have a proven and defensible 
business model, delivering strong underlying growth with the 
potential to expand by leveraging our eCommerce model, supply 
side strategy, strong brand and customer base. 
This is an exciting and challenging time for Abcam as we look to 
both strengthen our market position as the leader in antibody 
research tools and at the same time expand our product offering 
into the broader area of protein detection and regulation studies. 
We believe that we are well placed to achieve these goals. 
Abcam’s success to date has resulted from our single-minded 
focus on refining our core business model and incrementally 
expanding it so that it is aligned to the needs of the researcher, 
supporting them in the study of proteins, to unlock the secrets of 
cells in health and disease. This is a commitment that we at

Revenue
Revenue increased in the year by 25.2% to £71.1m or by 23.1% 
on a constant currency basis. Sterling was relatively stronger for 
the second half of the financial year, meaning that some of the 
revenue boost from comparative exchange rates recorded at the 
half year stage was reversed. The weighted average exchange 
rates applied to revenue in the year are shown in the table on 
the opposite page. 
gross margin
During the year we were successful in effectively managing 
increases in our average selling prices, whilst controlling costs 
from suppliers and our own production costs. Gross margin 
reported for the period was 66.7%, compared with 65.8% for the 
previous year, which comprised an increase of 1.8% in underlying 
margin, including 0.7% from units sold under Product Line 
Acquisition agreements, and a 0.9% negative impact from 
exchange rates.
The weakness of Sterling against each of our trading currencies 
contributed to an increase in Sterling-translated average unit selling 
prices. The negative impact on margin, however, resulted from the 
comparative rates for the US Dollar, which was the transactional 
currency for 50.9% of sales in the year but for 65.8% of the costs 
of units sold in the year. Since on average the US Dollar was 
stronger over the previous year, this had a proportionately larger 
impact on costs, thereby reducing gross margin. 
An analysis of the foreign currency components of revenue and 
cost of sales together with average exchange rates used for 
revenue in the period is given in the table opposite.

Administration and management expenses
Administration and management expenses in 2008/09 included 
an impairment charge of £1.1m relating to fixed assets associated 
with the high-volume production processes no longer used in the 
business. Excluding this charge, administration and management 
expenses increased by £0.7m to £18.1m (2009: £17.4m).
There was tight cost control in the period and as revenue 
increased, the operational gearing of the business came through. 
The main movements in costs arose as a result of:
  a 20% increase in average headcount excluding laboratory 
staff, in particular to increase staff resources in the 
Company’s eCommerce and IT functions, and customer 
support areas;
  an increase in profit-related pay to employees, following the 
substantial increase in profit during the year; 
  an 88% increase in the share-based payments charge as 
a result of the increase in headcount and the charge for the 
LTIP which was extended in the current year to include 
more managers in the business; and
  an increase in production recoveries credited back 
to profit and loss following the rise in the number of 
polyclonal projects initiated last year after the move away 
from high-volume monoclonal production.

Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Abcam plc
Financial review continued
Administration and management expenses continued
Costs were also incurred in the previous year in addition to 
the £1.1m impairment loss mentioned above, which were not 
repeated this year:
  costs associated with the office moves to larger premises 
in the UK and Japan, which included a period of overlap 
between the leases of the old and new premises whilst 
the new premises were refurbished; and
  a gain arising on exchange this year of £0.4m as compared 
to a loss in the previous year of £0.1m.
Although opportunities exist within the business for further 
operational gearing these are more limited and are unlikely to 
be at the same scale as in the 2010 financial year.
Research and development expenditure
Research and development (R&D) expenditure relates to the research 
costs for new polyclonal and monoclonal products, as well as 
costs incurred in searching for and testing different applications 
in which those products can be used. R&D expenditure increased 
by 20.3% in the year to £3.7m (2009: £3.1m), reflecting the 
increased investment in these areas. It is anticipated that R&D 
expenditure will remain at a similar level for the coming year, 
incorporating additional investment which will be offset by cost 
savings obtained through renegotiation of certain supply contracts. 
Since the Company’s R&D expenditure does not meet the 
requirements to be capitalised as an intangible asset, the costs 
are expensed through the income statement as incurred.
Profit
After adding back the ongoing share-based payments charge, 
operating profit expressed as a percentage of sales was 37.2% 
(2009: 28.8% including the impairment charge of £1.1m 
referred to previously). 
Investment revenue fell in the year, despite strong cash generation, 
reflecting the much reduced returns in the market on cash deposits.
Tax
The consolidated tax charge for the year was £6.6m or 25.6% of 
profit before tax (2009: 24.6%), reflecting the relative fall in the 
R&D tax credit uplift compared to profits generated. 
Inventories
The Group has strong inventory management systems which 
operate at the individual product level and are aimed at balancing 
high stock availability for customers, whilst minimising the levels 
of working capital tied up in inventory. During the year the decision 
was taken to further improve service levels by increasing the stock 
holding for those products deemed most likely to have insufficient 
stock in hand to be able to immediately fulfil customer orders. 
As a result, in the last quarter of the year we were able to fulfil 
79.3% of orders directly from stock, compared to the average 
for the first nine months of 75.6%. 
Over time, we expect the levels of stock to increase relative to 
sales, since Abcam products developed in-house may involve 
batch sizes larger than are required for immediate sale, as more 
stock is built up in overseas distribution offices to enable higher 
levels of service in local markets, and as we increase stock levels 
of particular own produced products as part of the initiative 
mentioned above.
Debtors
The strong debtor control processes have continued to operate 
effectively and debtor days at the year end were 32.6 (2009: 32.0). 
The majority of sales continue to be on credit and we would expect 
to see a trend of slowly increasing debtor days over time, as 
the geographic spread of sales widens, in line with practice 
in local markets.
Creditors 
Current liabilities rose from £8.6m to £10.1m. Current tax 
liabilities increased by £0.8m to £2.7m (2009: £1.9m), reflecting 
the increase in taxable profit during the year, and there was a 
credit balance on derivative instruments of £0.6m (2009: £nil). 
Trade and other payables contains deferred income of £1.3m 
(2009: £1.3m), including £0.8m of the cash incentive of £1.1m 
received on entering into a new lease for the head office during 
last year (2009: £1.0m), which is to be credited to profit and loss 
 “ In the last quarter of the year we were able to fulfil 79.3% of orders directly 
from stock, compared to the average for the first nine months of 75.6%.”

remainder of trade and other payables increased by 3.0% to 
£5.6m (2009: £5.4m).
Cash flow
The Group’s cash flow continues to be strong, with cash 
generated from operating activities after taxes of £19.7m 
(2009: £14.8m including the receipt of the £1.1m lease incentive 
referred to above). Consequently, after total payments of £6.0m 
(2009: £4.1m) relating to dividends paid, investment in property, 
plant and equipment and up-front payments for licence fees, 
and income of £0.9m (2009: £0.4m) from the exercise of share 
options, the Group’s cash and short-term deposits increased 
during the year by £14.7m.
The short-term deposits are cash deposits held with major UK 
banks, which had a maturity date of over three months when the 
deposit was made.
Earnings per share (EPS)
The number of shares issued during the year for the exercise 
of share options and for shares issued into the employee benefit 
trust was relatively small at 425,192 (2009: 458,669), meaning 
that as post-tax profit grew by 56.4% (2009: 108.7%) the growth 
in basic EPS was 54.5% (2009: 106.3%) and in diluted EPS 
was 53.8% (2009: 106.3%). 
Currency exposure
The Group continues to generate significant amounts of US Dollars, 
Euros and Japanese Yen in excess of payments in these currencies, 
and has arrangements in place to reduce the exposure to currency 
fluctuations by selling forward a proportion of the surpluses 
generated. Details of these contracts are set out in note 24.

Abcam plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Report on affairs of the Group
The Directors present their Annual Report on the affairs of the Group, together with the financial statements and the Independent Auditors’ Report, 
for the year ended 30 June 2010.
Principal activities and future developments
The Group’s activities consist of the development, marketing and distribution of antibodies and related products. It sells through the internet to 
customers in most countries of the world, operating through its parent company Abcam plc and through its wholly owned subsidiaries Abcam Inc, 
Abcam KK and Abcam (Hong Kong) Limited. 
Antibodies are sourced from over 250 of the world’s leading primary manufacturers, academic laboratories and institutes, and the Group also 
produces its own antibodies in its production facility in Cambridge, UK. Abcam intends to both strengthen its market position in antibody 
research tools whilst at the same time expanding its product offering into the broader area of protein detection and regulation studies through 
a combination of continuing organic growth as well as looking for strategic investment opportunities.
Further future developments are addressed in the Chairman’s Review, Chief Executive Officer’s Review and Financial Review on pages 8 to 19.
Business review
The Group’s management uses Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to monitor the progress of the business. Important KPIs are:

Sales increased by 25.2% in the year (23.1% on a constant exchange rate basis) as a result of continued increases in sales from the existing 
catalogue, as well as the launch of new products. The Group continued to generate strong margins, and pre-tax profits for the year increased 
to £25.8m (2009: £16.3m after the £1.1m charge associated with the impairment of fixed assets following the restructuring of the 
production facility).
Cash generation remained strong in the year, with the Group’s closing cash and short-term deposits standing at £40.2m (2009: £25.5m).
Further analysis of the year’s results, as well as the outlook for the coming year, is set out in the Chairman’s Review, the Chief Executive Officer’s 
Review and the Financial Review on pages 8 to 19.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. 
Risk management policies are constantly reviewed, taking into account market conditions and the Group’s activities. The Board 
receives a formal risk management update twice a year. 
The Group faces the competitive and strategic risks that are inherent in a rapidly growing company. Further information on those risks and 
how they are managed by the Group is set out below and on the following pages.
Competitors
There are several hundred antibody suppliers around the world. These include companies ranging from dedicated antibody suppliers to large 
multi-national companies selling broad ranges of other products in addition to antibodies. Abcam’s rapid growth may attract new competitors 
and/or stimulate existing competitors, some of which have greater financial, marketing and technological resources than Abcam, to invest 
further in their offerings to the market.
Abcam already sources products from many of the world’s leading suppliers and in response to this risk, continues to build its supplier and 
product base, invest in the functionality of its website and its operational capability. The challenges for a competitor would include establishing 
a suitably large catalogue of products with proven validation in research, sold under an established and successful brand, and if they were to 
follow Abcam’s supply model, building relationships with a broad range of high quality suppliers.
Loss of suppliers
Abcam may lose a supplier if for example that supplier’s business strategy changed or it was no longer willing or able to continue to 
provide products.
Abcam has over 250 suppliers and has had relationships with many of them for several years, with growing levels of sales, which makes this 
less likely. If this were to occur Abcam often has several antibodies to the same target and whilst each is unique, in the event of a particular 
product no longer being available, Abcam would look to offer customers alternative products from within the catalogue. In the 2010 financial 
year no supplier accounted for more than 5% of revenue.
Abcam has its own production capability which could also be utilised to generate alternative products. Products from the facility currently 
contribute approximately 16% of total Group revenue. 24

Principal risks and uncertainties continued
Intellectual property 
Research antibodies are not typically protected by intellectual property rights and the market can be characterised as having relatively low 
barriers to entry in this regard. However, where such rights are claimed to be the subject of third party patents or other proprietary rights, 
Abcam may be the subject of infringement actions or proceedings. 
Abcam believes that its principal protection in the market lies with its business model rather than through intellectual property rights. 
The breadth of highly specified products in its catalogue, its ability to add products quickly and cheaply, its extensive supplier base and 
its own production capability and brand, each act as significant barriers to entry for competitors. 
Movement of goods
The Group’s activities involve importing and exporting its products across many international borders. Any changes to the regulations covering 
such movements might have an effect on the Group’s trading activities.
Abcam closely monitors any changes to international import and export regulations and seeks to adapt its procedures wherever possible 
to ensure that the movement of products is not affected, whilst maintaining compliance with such regulations. 
Infrastructure
Abcam operates in a market which it has been able to exploit through the use of online and eCommerce based systems. These systems need 
to be robust, efficient and scalable in order for the Group to continue to manage its growth. The risks here are both from the infrastructure and 
organisation of the IT systems, as well as the ability of Abcam’s products to be found by online users through popular internet search engines. 
The Company invests extensively in its IT systems both from a scalability and security point of view, as well as from usability aspects. 
Abcam uses a global content delivery partner to increase both the reliability and access speed for viewing the majority of its static site content. 
Dynamic content is served from an external, fully supported data centre. The Company outsources regular security penetration testing on its 
website from a third party, and pays considerable attention internally to the search engine optimisation and usability of the website through 
user testing, feedback and surveys.
Staff recruitment and retention
The contribution made by Abcam’s highly skilled and dedicated staff has been and will continue to be important to Abcam’s future success. 
As the Group’s profile grows it is important that it is able to continue to recruit and retain high calibre staff.
Abcam places great emphasis on open communication with employees, including quarterly Company-wide meetings, weekly office meetings 
and regular staff committee meetings. There are also share ownership schemes and profit share arrangements for all employees, with rewards 
based on seniority within the business.
Use of distributors
In certain areas of the world Abcam works through third party distributors who undertake marketing support activities, and provide local 
logistical support. Consequently Abcam is dependent on them fulfilling these roles in an effective and efficient manner so as to enable sales 
to continue to grow in these regions. The distributors act as customers and so also represent a financial risk for uncollected account balances.
Abcam has a team dedicated to maintaining close relationships with our distributors. They typically work on annual contracts and there is 
a detailed qualification process which they are required to go through before being appointed. Outside of Japan, where sub-dealers are used, 
distributor sales amounted to around 10% of total sales in the 2010 financial year and no single distributor accounted for more than 
3% of total sales.
Technology
It is possible that new technologies may emerge in the future as viable alternatives to the use of antibodies in protein detection. 
In order to mitigate this risk Abcam has many contacts in the industry and an internal group specifically targeted at this area. In this way, 
Abcam looks to stay abreast of technological developments in the field as far as is practicable, with the aim of positioning the Company 
to exploit the commercialisation of such technologies if they appear.
Exchange rates
The Group has an exposure to exchange rate fluctuation, in particular the strength of Sterling relative to the US Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen. 
Although there are natural hedges in place due to the fact that the Group is able to utilise a proportion of its income in foreign currencies, 
in particular the US Dollar, to pay for outgoings in those currencies, the Group generates surpluses of each currency.
The Board’s policy is to sell forward some of the expected surplus in order to reduce the short-term exposure. However, longer-term 
movements in the relative strength of Sterling will impact the Group’s profits.
Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss. Trade receivables consist 
of a large number of customers spread across diverse geographical areas. The Group does not have a significant credit risk exposure to any 
single counterparty. Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and consideration is given as 
to whether there is any impairment in the value of any amounts owing. The standard payment terms for receivables other than intra-group 
balances are 30 days. Any variation in these terms requires authorisation by senior management. Year-end debtor days are 32.6 days 
(2009: 32.0 days).
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings 
assigned by international credit-rating agencies. Funds are split between at least two institutions. 25
Abcam plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Principal risks and uncertainties continued
Liquidity risk management
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk 
management framework for the management of the Group’s short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities by continuously monitoring cash flows and 
matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
The Group and Company hold cash deposits at call or with a maturity of up to twelve months. At 30 June 2010, the average maturity of 
balances was 146 days (2009: 47 days) of fixed rate deposits not sensitive to changes in interest rates. Sufficient funds are readily available 
to the Company to meet operational requirements.
Trade payables are normally payable within 30 days of invoice and the standard payment terms for intra-group receivables are 45 days.
For further details of the Group’s risk management strategy see note 24.
Directors’ indemnities
The Company has made qualifying third party indemnity provisions for the benefit of its Directors which were made during the reporting 
period and remain in force at the date of this report.
Research and development (R&D)
The Group undertakes R&D in areas related to its principal activities and this is discussed in the Financial Review on pages 16 to 19. 
During the year the Group spent £3.7m (2009: £3.1m) on R&D.
Dividends
As detailed in the Chairman’s Review, the Directors have taken the decision to propose an increase in the total annual dividend to 20.03p 
(2009: 12.11p). This represents a distribution of 37.5% of profit after tax, compared with the previous policy of a 35% annual distribution.
The Directors therefore propose paying a final dividend of 14.61p (2009: 9.40p) per ordinary share, to be paid on 26 November 2010 to 
shareholders on the register on 5 November 2010. Together with the interim dividend of 5.42p per share paid on 1 April 2010, this makes 
a combined dividend for the year of 20.03p (2009: 12.11p).
Capital structure
Details of the authorised and issued share capital, together with details of the movements in the Company’s issued share capital during the 
year, are shown in notes 25 and 26. The Company has one class of ordinary share which carries no right to fixed income. Each share carries 
the right to one vote at general meetings of the Company.
There are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding nor on the transfer of shares, which are both governed by the general provisions 
of the Company’s Articles of Association and prevailing legislation.
The Board is proposing the sub-division of each of the existing ordinary shares into five new ordinary shares of 0.2 pence each. This may 
improve the liquidity and marketability of the ordinary shares of the Company by reducing the market price of an ordinary share and increasing 
the number of shares in issue. Approval from shareholders for the proposed sub-division will be sought at the Company’s forthcoming AGM 
in November 2010.
With regard to the appointment and replacement of Directors, the Company is governed by the Articles of Association, the Companies Act and 
related legislation and, although not obliged to do so as an AIM listed company, has chosen to follow the principles set out in the revised 2008 
Combined Code on Corporate Governance (‘the Code’) wherever possible.
Directors
The interests of the Directors in the share capital of the Company at 30 June 2010, other than with respect to share-based options and 
awards and shares conditionally awarded through the Share Incentive Plan (which are detailed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on 
pages 36 and 37), were as follows:

Report on affairs of the Group continued
Directors continued
Three Directors will be retiring and offering themselves for re-election at the AGM to be held in November 2010:
•	 Tony Kouzarides who has been a Non-Executive Director for over nine years and retires in line with the principles set out in the Code;
•	 Jonathan Milner who last stood for re-election in 2007 and retires by rotation as required by the Company’s Articles of Association; and
•	  Jeff Iliffe who is retiring under the provisions of the Company’s Articles of Association regarding the minimum number of Directors required 
to retire each year.
Following performance evaluation, the Chairman has determined that each individual continues to demonstrate commitment to his role and to 
display effective performance; he is therefore recommending re-election of all Directors standing at this year’s AGM.
Supplier payment policy
It is the Group’s policy that payments to suppliers are made in accordance with the terms and conditions agreed with them, provided that the 
supplier has provided the goods or services in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions. At 30 June 2010, the Group had an average 
of 29 days of purchases (2009: 19 days) outstanding in trade creditors (excluding accruals and deferred income).
Charitable and political donations and community support
Abcam participates actively in the community of entrepreneurial businesses clustered around Cambridge, UK. The Company supports the 
Cambridge Network, the University of Cambridge and the Judge Business School both by giving talks and presentations on its business as 
well as hosting projects for MBA students. Abcam takes students from secondary education on work experience programmes as well as 
occasional international exchange students on placement.
The Group encourages employees to get involved in local charitable activities; a maximum of 0.1% of the previous year’s pre-tax profit is 
allocated for charitable donations, which is split between the UK, US, Japanese and Hong Kong offices. These are allocated by a committee 
of staff volunteers working within guidelines set down by the Directors.
The Group made no political donations during the year (2009: £nil) and made charitable donations of £15,401 (2009: £4,113), principally 
to children’s and local charities serving the communities in which the Group operates.
Substantial shareholdings
On 26 August 2010, the Company had been notified, in accordance with Chapter 5 of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules, of the following 
voting rights as a shareholder of the Company (excluding Directors’ interests which are set out on page 25):
         Number  Percentage

Corporate, social and ethical policies
Abcam recognises the importance of balancing the interests of its customers, shareholders, employees, suppliers and the communities in 
which it operates. Management of the environmental and social issues that play a part in the business is a key factor in the Group’s strategy 
for success and in the practice of good corporate governance.
The Group places considerable value on the involvement of its employees and has continued to keep them informed of the various factors 
affecting the performance of the Group. This is achieved through formal and informal meetings. Equity-based or similar incentives are 
currently made available to all employees of the Group.
Applications for employment by disabled persons are always fully considered, bearing in mind the aptitudes of the applicant concerned. 
It is the policy of the Group that the training, career development and promotion of disabled employees should, as far as possible, be identical 
to that of other employees. The Group needs highly-qualified staff and does not see age, colour, disability, ethnic origin, gender, or political 
or other opinion as a barrier to employment.
The Group aspires to carry out its business to the highest of ethical standards, treating employees, suppliers and customers in a professional, 
courteous and honest manner. The Group has an ethical policy which is reviewed by the Board and which is applied to its products. 
This includes reviewing and, where appropriate, visiting our suppliers to check the standards they follow in their products and services. 27
Abcam plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Health and safety and environment
Abcam provides and maintains a safe and healthy working environment, equipment and systems for all employees together with information, 
training and supervision as may be needed for this purpose. 
Compliance with legislation is the Group’s minimum requirement; however our aim is to achieve higher standards as best practice demands. 
The Group is committed to an annual audit process by external safety advisors in order to understand and maximise our performance, 
demonstrate best practice to all stakeholders and identify areas for targeted improvements. Core skills are identified and training programmes 
developed to ensure these are in place. 
Health and safety in the Group is ultimately the responsibility of the Chief Executive Officer. The management structure for health and safety is run 
by a Safety & Facilities Specialist and is supported through a Group Steering Committee whose membership includes the Chief Operating Officer, 
Scientific Director, Head of Corporate Services and representatives from all Abcam regional offices. The safety structure encompasses 
employees from all areas of the business and promotes ownership of health and safety across its wide remit.
A rigorous occupational health scheme is in place and we look to promote a positive and proactive safety culture. Our reporting system for 
absence promotes the best use of resources and there have being no RIDDOR reportable accidents or instances of ill health over the past year. 
Abcam seeks wherever possible to minimise its impact on the environment for the benefit of its employees and the public at large. The Group 
is committed to complying with environmental regulations and encourages and supports its employees in achieving this. 
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in 
the Chairman’s Review, the Chief Executive Officer’s Review and the Financial Review on pages 8 to 19. Notes 20, 23 and 24 include a 
description of the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of 
its financial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable financial resources and through a diverse customer base is subject not only to the Western economies but also 
Japan, China and, to a lesser extent, South America. As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its 
business risks successfully despite the current uncertain global economic outlook.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. 
Auditors
Deloitte LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in office as auditors and a resolution to re-appoint them will be proposed at the 
forthcoming AGM.
Directors’ statement as to disclosure of information to auditors
In the case of each of the Directors of the Company at the date on which this report was approved: 
•	  as far as each of the Directors is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and
•		 	 each of the Directors has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a Director to make himself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Approved by the Board and signed on its behalf by:
Mike Redmond
Chairman
6 September 2010 28
Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Abcam plc
Corporate governance statement
Although not required to do so by the AIM listing rules, the Directors have chosen to provide selected corporate governance disclosures with 
this report, which they consider valuable to the reader.
The Directors believe that effective corporate governance, appropriate to the Group considering its size and stage of development, will assist in 
the delivery of corporate strategy, the generation of shareholder value and the safeguarding of shareholders’ long-term interests. The Directors 
are committed therefore, wherever it is reasonably practicable, to ensure that the Group is managed in accordance with the principles set out 
in the Code.
Composition of the Board
The Board comprises the Chairman, three full-time Executive Directors and four Non-Executive Directors. Brief biographical details of all 
members of the Board are set out on page 21.
In order to assist in securing the recruitment and retention of high calibre Non-Executive Directors, prior to the flotation of the Company in 
2005, the Company granted options to Non-Executive Directors to acquire shares in the Company in addition to fees. In the period since 
listing on AIM, no equity-based incentives have been granted to Non-Executive Directors and there are no plans for any such grants in the 
future. During the year, Peter Keen exercised all his remaining share options. At the end of the year, the only Non-Executive Director with a 
small number of unexercised share options is Tony Kouzarides. These options are not subject to any performance conditions.
The holding of share options by Non-Executive Directors could, amongst other things, be relevant in determining whether a Non-Executive 
Director is independent. After detailed consideration, the Board has determined that it does not believe that the exercise or holding of share 
options by these Non-Executive Directors impacts on their independence in character and judgement. 
The Board therefore considers Mike Redmond, Tim Dye and Peter Keen to be independent within the meaning of the Code. Tony Kouzarides 
is also considered by the Board to be independent, notwithstanding the fact that he has served on the Board for more than nine years, since 
he demonstrates a continuous independence in character and judgement in all Board matters. Mark Webster is not deemed to be independent 
because he has been employed by the Company in an executive capacity during the last five years. Peter Keen has been identified as the 
Senior Independent Director.
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are vested in separate individuals, each with clear allocation of accountability and 
responsibility. The Chairman has prime responsibility for running the Board and the Chief Executive Officer has executive responsibilities for 
the Company’s strategic development, operations and results.
The structure of the Board and the integrity of each Director ensures that there is no one individual or group dominating the decision 
making process.
The role of the Board
The Board holds full meetings every month, with attendance required in person one month and via telephone the next month. The principal 
matters that it considers are as follows: 
•	 monthly management accounts, KPIs and performance against budget;
•	 regular reviews of R&D, operations and product sourcing;
•	 regular reviews of strategic objectives and Group priorities;
•	 the annual Group budget and revised forecasts;
•	 reporting including statutory accounts, dividend policy, dividend payments and the AGM;
•	 performance of the Board and sub-Committees;
•	 reports of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees;
•	 an annual review of risk-management strategy and controls and a six-monthly review of the risk register;
•	 matters relating to the Company’s obligations as an AIM listed Company; 
•	 determination of the remuneration policy for the Directors and other Senior Executives; and
•	 management of funds and major capital expenditure, including proposals for mergers or acquisitions of other companies or product lines.
The Board is supplied with information in a timely manner, in a form and of a quality appropriate to enable it to discharge its duties. 
Directors receive appropriate induction on joining the Board and regularly update their skills and knowledge.
The Board has a policy to set out which matters are reserved for the decision of the Board, and those to which the Executive Directors need 
not refer for approval. This policy also identifies those matters regarding which full delegation to a Board Committee is not normally permitted 
because a final decision is required to be taken by the whole Board. 
Matters which the Board considers are suitable for delegation to a Board Committee are contained in each Committee’s terms of reference. 29

Corporate governance statement continued
The Audit Committee
The Committee has responsibility for the following matters: 
•  reviewing the accounts and the key judgements and policies underlying them in relation to the interim and annual financial statements 
before they are submitted to the Board for final approval;
• reviewing management’s reports on internal controls;
• reviewing the Group’s risk-management process, including the adequacy of insurance cover;
• reviewing the appointment of the external auditors together with the audit fee;
•  monitoring the audit and non-audit work of the external auditors, including reviewing any management letters and the Company’s response; 
and
• reviewing the arrangements by which staff may, in confidence, raise concerns about possible improprieties.
As part of its procedures, the Committee discusses the interim and annual financial statements with the external auditors. When appropriate, 
non-Committee members are invited to attend. During the period under review the Committee has met twice on a formal basis and a number 
of times informally. The Committee is expected to continue to meet formally twice a year.
The Nomination Committee
The Committee is responsible for the following matters:
• reviewing the size and composition of the Board;
• identifying and nominating suitable candidates to fill vacancies on the Board; and
• reviewing succession planning for both Directors and the management team.
The process adopted by the Committee to identify a candidate for a specific vacancy is, in the first instance, to determine whether any 
individuals known to the Board would be suitable for the role. If no candidates can be identified through this process, or if the Committee 
believes that the process would be improved by the involvement of other candidates, then an external search consultancy will be approached. 
Short-listed candidates are interviewed by all members of the Committee and other Executive and Non-Executive Directors as the Committee 
deems appropriate. Once a suitable candidate has been identified and references taken, the Chairman of the Committee will recommend to 
the Board that the Company make a formal offer of employment to the candidate. 
There were no new appointments to the Board during the year. 
All Directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first AGM after their appointment, and to re-election thereafter at intervals of no 
more than three years.
The terms of appointment of all Non-Executive Directors will be available for inspection at the forthcoming AGM in November 2010.
The Remuneration Committee
The Committee is responsible for the following matters:
• setting the basic pay of Executive Directors and the remuneration of the Chairman;
• the operation of the performance-related bonus plan for the Executive Directors;
• agreeing the allocation and term for the granting of share-based incentives to Executive Directors;
• determining the Executive Directors’ pension contributions; and
• overseeing the overall annual staff pay review and the operation of the equity-based incentive schemes.
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is a matter for the Chairman and the Executive Directors.
The Group has a formal and transparent procedure for developing policy on Directors’ remuneration. No Director is involved in deciding his 
own remuneration.
The Committee aims to set levels of remuneration for Executive Directors that are sufficient to attract, retain and motivate Directors of the 
quality required, without paying more than necessary, and that are appropriate for the size and complexity of the Group. It aims to see that 
a significant proportion of each Executive Director’s remuneration package is performance-related. 31
Abcam plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Internal control
The Board acknowledges its responsibility for safeguarding the shareholders’ investment and the Group’s assets. In applying this principle, the 
Board recognises that it has overall responsibility for ensuring that the Group maintains an ongoing system of internal control to provide it with 
reasonable assurance regarding effective and efficient operation, internal financial control and compliance with laws and regulations. This has 
been in place for the year under review and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report.
The Audit Committee reviews the need for an internal audit function on an annual basis and has concluded that, despite the rate of growth 
in recent years, the structure of the Group and the level of control exercised by the management team, an internal audit function continues 
to be neither necessary nor cost effective at this time. The Directors have reviewed the effectiveness of the internal controls, and taken steps 
to ensure that the Group has an appropriate control environment for its size and complexity. The management team will ensure that the 
internal control environment develops with the size of the Company, with respect to the identification, evaluation and monitoring of risk.
Arrangements are also in place for all employees to raise concerns about any fraud, misconduct or wrongdoing which are formalised into 
a ‘whistle-blowing’ policy.
Such systems, which are designed to manage, rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, will provide reasonable, 
though not absolute, assurance against material loss or misstatement.
Board performance evaluation
The Board undertakes a regular evaluation of its own performance. This review involves detailed interviews with each Director and the 
Company Secretary and covers the functioning of the Board as a whole and the operation of each of the Committees. The review confirmed 
the high level of commitment and professionalism exercised by the Board in the strategic and commercial leadership of the Group. It also 
concluded that the Board and its individual members continue to perform effectively and operate within a framework of sound governance 
and practices which, wherever it is reasonably practicable, are consistent with the principles set out in the Code.
Following the appointment of Mike Redmond as Chairman in November 2009 the Board has undertaken an evaluation of its own performance 
and during the 2011 financial year it is intended that a further evaluation exercise will be undertaken.
The Company provides the Board with a regular programme of training opportunities, including training provided by external advisors, in order 
to ensure Directors remain appropriately informed of their roles and responsibilities. Regular updates on corporate governance are also 
provided to the Board by the Group’s advisors.
Dialogue with shareholders
The Board believes it is important to have open communications with shareholders. To this end, the Chief Executive Officer and 
Chief Financial Officer, working in consultation with the Company’s corporate and PR advisors, make themselves available and expect to meet 
with shareholders at least twice a year. It is the Company’s practice to give a presentation on the Group’s progress at the AGM each year.
Where appropriate the Company also consults with major shareholders on significant issues. 32

Directors’ remuneration report 
Although not required by the AIM listing rules to provide all the information detailed below, the Directors have chosen to provide Directors’ 
remuneration disclosures in this report which they consider valuable to the reader.
Unaudited information
The Group has a Remuneration Committee (the Committee), chaired by Peter Keen, which wherever possible follows the principles of the 
recommendations of the Code. The Committee consists of three independent Non-Executive Directors including the Company Chairman.
Independent consultants have been retained to advise on remuneration policy and to benchmark the Executive Directors’ remuneration 
against that of a comparator group of companies with similar characteristics to Abcam in terms of their size, nature of operations, historic 
growth achieved and market capitalisation. 
Their recommendations on salary and bonus arrangements were implemented with effect from 1 July 2009. Awards were also made to 
members of the senior management, including the Executive Directors, under the Company’s Long-Term Incentive Plan and other equity 
based incentive schemes as detailed below.
Remuneration policy
The Group’s policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the Executive Directors should be performance-related. The four 
main elements of the remuneration package for the Executive Directors during the year were as follows:
• basic annual salary;
• a performance-based bonus;
• equity-based incentives; and
• pension contributions.
For future years the Committee will ensure that:
• it maintains a competitive package of total compensation, commensurate with comparable packages available in similar companies; and
•  the interests of the Executive Directors are closely aligned with those of the Company’s shareholders through the provision of 
share-based incentives.
Where appropriate, independent advice will be sought to confirm these objectives are being met.
Basic salary
The Executive Directors’ basic salaries are reviewed at least annually by the Committee, with any revisions normally becoming effective 
on 1 July each year. The independent consultants’ report, which was commissioned to assist the review ahead of the 2010/11 financial year, 
concluded that the salaries of the Executive Directors had fallen below those of a comparator group of companies. In light of the Group’s 
strong performance in recent years, the need to maintain competitive packages and, after consultation with the Company’s major shareholders, 
the Committee approved salary increases to take effect from 1 July 2010 to the lower quartile level of the comparator group. Over time and 
when appropriate it is the Committee’s intention that base salaries should reflect the median.
The recent review resulted in the following amendments to basic salary, effective from 1 July:
         2010/11  2009/10 
         £000  £000
Jonathan Milner        310* 235*
Jim Warwick        232 190
Jeff Iliffe         220 180
*  Jonathan Milner waived a £25,000 increase in salary which would have taken effect on 1 July 2009 and he has waived a further increase of £75,000 effective 
1 July 2010. His base salary will therefore remain at £210,000 but with effect from 1 July 2010, his bonus arrangements and other benefits will be based on the 
£310,000 figure.
Executive Directors’ service contracts, which include details of remuneration, will be available for inspection at the forthcoming AGM in 
November 2010. 33

Performance-related payments
The bonus payable to Executive Directors is based on the financial performance of the Group and the achievement of individual performance 
targets related to the strategic objectives for each individual. 
In the year under review the total ‘on target’ bonus for Executive Directors was set at 37.5% of basic salary. 80% of the on target bonus was 
based on the achievement of a target profit figure and 20% on achievement of individual strategic objectives. No payment was due under the 
profit-based bonus if profit was less than 90% of target and the maximum payment was due at 105% of target. Ordinarily the bonus was 
capped at 75% of basic salary; however if the maximum part of the target profit element of the performance bonus was earned, then to 
reward exceptional performance, the Committee could at its discretion award bonuses of up to an additional 25% of salary, i.e. the maximum 
bonus that could be payable was capped at 100% of salary. The criteria for the payment of such a bonus include additional revenue growth 
targets and the successful launch of suitable initiatives to sustain the longer-term growth strategy of the business.
As stated in the Chairman’s Review, the year has been one of outstanding performance and excellent progress; all financial and personal 
performance targets were materially exceeded and the bonus for 2009/10 became payable in full, at 100% of basic salary.
For 2010/11 the Remuneration Committee has altered the bonus arrangements and 85% of the bonus is based on the achievement of a 
target profit figure and 15% on the achievement of individual strategic objectives. The total ‘on target’ bonus will be increased to 52.5% of 
basic salary but on a more demanding ratchet in that no payment will be made unless 95% (2009/10: 90%) of target profit has been met 
and the maximum payment is due at 115% (2009/10: 105%) of target. The maximum bonus will be capped at 100% of salary. 
Under the Abcam Profit Share Scheme (PSS) an amount was allocated to all employees of the Group (excluding Executive Directors) during 
the year on a points-based system, with the payment being dependent on the level of pre-tax profit achieved, the amount allocated varying 
depending on the level of profitability. The PSS payment was not capped, and payments on account from the PSS were made each quarter, 
although at no stage did they exceed 85% of the amount due until the audited financial statements were approved. Amounts paid under the 
scheme are not pensionable.
The PSS scheme remains in place for the 2010/11 financial year with revised pre-tax profit targets and payment levels.
Equity-based incentives
Equity-based incentives are issued to the Executive Directors on a regular basis. In the period since listing on AIM, no equity-based incentives 
have been granted to Non-Executive Directors and there are no plans for any such grants in the future.
The Abcam plc 2005 Plan
The Abcam plc 2005 Plan (the Plan) was adopted prior to flotation in 2005 and amended in 2008 to make it more tax efficient for US-based 
employees. All options granted under the Plan since flotation have been based on out-performance of the FTSE AIM All-share index measured 
on the third anniversary of the date of grant. If the target is achieved, then options will be exercisable during the next seven years, subject to 
the rules of the scheme. If the target is not met at the third anniversary, then it will be monitored on certain dates over the next twelve months. 
If the target is met on any of those dates, then the options become exercisable. If the target is not met on any of those dates, the options will 
lapse on the fourth anniversary.
In the year under review no options were granted under the Plan to the Executive Directors.
The following graph shows the performance against the FTSE AIM All-share index for the options issued since flotation which have yet to 
vest and which have not been forfeited subsequently. If all the options had crystallised at 26 August 2010 then all performance conditions 
in relation to the options would have been met. Details of these options are set out in note 30 to the financial statements.

SAYE scheme
The Company has also established a non-discretionary HMRC-approved SAYE scheme in which all UK employees, including the Executive 
Directors, can participate. Under this scheme, employees contract to save any amount, up to a maximum of £250 per month, of their post-tax 
earnings for a period of either three or five years. At the time of entering the contract the Company offers the employee the option to acquire 
shares, using the money that has been saved over the life of the contract. The price at which the shares could be purchased is the market 
value of the shares on the date immediately preceding the offer, at a discount of 20%. The take-up under the scheme was relatively low when 
the most recent offer was made in 2008, since many employees were already at the allowable investment limits. No options were granted 
under the SAYE scheme in the year under review.
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The LTIP includes performance conditions which comply with guidelines and best practice governing the grant of share-based incentives in 
a listed company, to the extent to which the Committee considers such practice to be appropriate to the Group. The maximum level of award 
(being the aggregate market value of shares subject to the award at the date of grant) that can be granted to an eligible employee under the 
LTIP in any financial year is limited to 150% of that employee’s salary.
Under the LTIP, performance share awards made to the Executive Directors in 2009/10 took the form of nil cost options and are subject to 
achievement over three years of two separate conditions, the first condition applying to 50% of the shares subject to each award and the 
second condition applying to the remaining 50%.
The Total Shareholder Return (TSR) condition
In respect of the first 50% of each award (the TSR Awards), the number of shares that will vest will depend on the Company’s TSR 
performance as compared to a comparator group of companies (the Comparator Group):
• where the Company’s TSR is below the 50th percentile, none of the TSR Awards will vest;
• where the Company’s TSR is at or above the 70th percentile of the Comparator Group, all of the TSR Awards will vest; and
•  where the Company’s TSR is between the 50th and the 70th percentile, the proportion of the TSR Awards that will vest will be calculated on 
a straight-line basis from 30% at the 50th percentile and rising to 100% at the 70th percentile.
The Earnings Per Share (EPS) condition
In respect of the second 50% of each award (the EPS Awards), the number of shares that vest will depend on the EPS growth of the Company 
over the vesting period:
• at an average of less than 15% growth per annum, equating to 52.1% growth over the period, none of the EPS Awards will vest;
• at average growth per annum of 20%, equating to total growth of 72.8%, the EPS Awards will vest in full; and
• at growth rates between these two figures, the EPS Awards will vest proportionately.
For a number of senior employees, excluding the Executive Directors, awards were made during 2009/10 with the same performance 
condition as those under the Plan, i.e. out-performance of the FTSE AIM All-share index.
The Company regularly monitors its performance against these conditions. If the awards had crystallised as at 30 June 2010, all performance 
conditions relating to awards in 2008/09 and 2009/10 would have been met, and therefore all TSR and EPS Awards would have vested in full.
For the LTIPs to be granted in 2010/11 a revised Comparator Group will be prepared and it is proposed that the TSR and EPS conditions will 
remain unchanged. 2009/10 has been a very successful year for the Group and in order to maintain appropriate incentive to the Executive 
Directors to continue performance at the highest level, it is proposed that the level of award for the Executive Directors in the coming year be 
between 100% and 120% of basic salary.
For the 2010/11 financial year it is intended that all awards under the LTIP will have the same TSR and EPS conditions.
Share Incentive Plan (SIP)
Abcam operates an HMRC-approved SIP for all UK employees. Under the SIP, awards are made as follows:
Share awards
Annual awards are made to UK-based staff, with a market value of up to £3,000 each. Awards take the form of a conditional entitlement to 
shares and will vest after three years’ continuous employment with the Company.
Partnership and matching shares
All UK-based employees are given the opportunity to invest up to £1,500 per annum to acquire new shares in the Company at market value. 
If these shares are held for three years and the employee remains employed by the Company during that time then they will also receive an 
additional share for each share acquired.
The Abcam 2009 Company Share Option Plan (CSOP)
The Group operates an HMRC-approved CSOP for UK-based employees of the Company, with a maximum of £30,000 of market value options 
granted per employee. In 2009/10 options granted under the CSOP vest on the same basis and with the same performance conditions as 
those granted under the LTIP and it is intended that this will also be the case in 2010/11. 35

Pension arrangements
In the UK, all employees, including Executive Directors, are invited to participate in the Group personal pension plan, which is a money 
purchase plan. The pensionable element of remuneration in the year under review was basic salary. During the year, the Group contributed 
12% of basic salary, excluding the individual performance bonus, to a Group personal pension plan in the name of each Executive Director.
The Company operates a flexible benefits scheme for all UK-based employees, including Executive Directors, under which the option 
to sacrifice an element of basic pay and purchase additional pension contributions or other benefits is available. As a result of the salary 
sacrificed and used to purchase additional pension contributions, the Company’s National Insurance liability is reduced. The benefit of this 
reduction is added as an additional contribution to each employee’s pension fund, and for Directors this amount is included within the 
employer’s pension contribution figures disclosed in the table of remuneration details below.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
The Directors are required to prepare financial statements for the Group in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union (IFRSs) and have also chosen to prepare financial statements for the parent company in accordance with 
IFRSs. Company law requires the Directors to prepare such financial information in accordance with IFRSs, the Companies Act 2006 and 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial statements present fairly for each financial year the Company’s financial position, 
financial performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in 
accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International Accounting 
Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements’. In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation 
will be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRSs. Directors are also required to:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
•  present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; and
•  provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Company, for safeguarding the assets, for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other 
irregularities and for the preparation of financial statements which comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements differs from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement
We confirm to the best of our knowledge:
•  the financial statements, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and
•  the Report on Affairs of the Group includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.

Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Abcam plc
Independent auditors’ report
to the Members of Abcam plc
We have audited the financial statements of Abcam plc for the year ended 30 June 2010 which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, 
the Consolidated and parent company Statements of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated and parent company Statements of Changes 
in Equity, the Consolidated and parent company Balance Sheets, the Consolidated and parent company Cash Flow Statements, and the 
related notes 1 to 32. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in 
an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other 
than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that 
the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
•  the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and the parent company’s affairs as at 30 June 2010 and of the 
Group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued by the IASB
As explained in note 3 to the financial statements, the Group in addition to complying with its legal obligation to apply IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union, has also applied IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
In our opinion the Group financial statements comply with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
•  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Other matters
In our opinion the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the provisions of 
the Companies Act 2006 that would have applied if the Company were listed on a regulated market.
Although not required to do so, the Directors have voluntarily chosen to make a corporate governance statement detailing the extent of their 
compliance with the June 2008 Combined Code. We reviewed:
• the Directors’ Statement contained within the Report on Affairs of the Group in relation to going concern; and
•  the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the June 2008 Combined 
Code specified for our review.

Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Abcam plc
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
For the year ended 30 June 2010
1. General information
Abcam plc (the Company) is incorporated in the UK under the Companies Act 2006. The address of the registered office is 330 Cambridge 
Science Park, Milton Road, Cambridge CB4 0FL, UK.
The Group’s activities consist of the development, marketing and selling of antibodies and related products. The Group sells through the 
internet to customers in most countries of the world. The Group operates through its parent company Abcam plc and through its wholly 
owned subsidiaries Abcam Inc, Abcam KK and Abcam (Hong Kong) Limited.
These financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the 
Group operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 3.
2. Adoption of new and revised standards
In the current year, the following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted and have affected the amounts reported 
in these financial statements:
Standards affecting presentation and disclosure
IAS 1 (revised 2007) Presentation of Financial Statements 
IAS 1 (2007) has introduced a number of changes in the format and content of the financial statements. This standard requires the 
presentation of a third balance sheet where changes in accounting policies retrospectively cause a change to the presentation to the primary 
statements. Abcam has not presented a third balance sheet since there are no material changes to the primary statements as a result of the 
adoption of the new standards listed. 
Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments (Amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures)
The amendments to IFRS 7 expand the disclosures required in respect of fair value measurements and liquidity risk. The Group has elected 
not to provide comparative information for these expanded disclosures in the current year in accordance with the transitional reliefs offered in 
these amendments.
Standards affecting the reported results and financial position
The standards were updated as part of Improvements to IFRSs (2008). 
Amendment to IAS 38 Intangible Assets
IAS 38 has been amended to state that an entity is permitted to recognise a prepayment asset for advertising or promotional expenditure only 
up to the point at which the entity has the right to access the goods purchased or up to the point of receipt of services. Mail order catalogues 
have been specifically identified as a form of advertising and promotional activities. The Group has always accounted for its promotion 
expenditure through the income statement as incurred, and there have been no changes made to the accounting policies as a result of 
this new requirement. 
Amendment to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment – Vesting Conditions and Cancellations
The amendments clarify the definition of vesting conditions for the purposes of IFRS 2, introduce the concept of ‘non-vesting’ conditions and 
clarify the accounting treatment for cancellations. The amendment has been applied retrospectively in accordance with the relevant 
transitional provisions, but has had no impact on the financial statements. 
The following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted in the current year. Their adoption has not had any significant 
impact on the amounts reported in these financial statements but may impact the accounting for future transactions and arrangements.
IAS 23 (revised 2007) Borrowing Costs
The principal change to the Standard was to eliminate the option to expense all borrowing costs when incurred. This change has had no 
impact on these financial statements because it has always been the Group’s accounting policy to capitalise borrowing costs incurred on 
qualifying assets. 
Amendments to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements – Puttable Financial Instruments 
and Obligations Arising on Liquidation
The revisions to IAS 32 amend the criteria for debt/equity classification by permitting certain puttable financial instruments and instruments 
(or components of instruments) that impose on an entity an obligation to deliver to another party a pro-rate share of the net assets of the entity 
only on liquidation, to be classified as equity, subject to specified criteria being met. This has had no impact in the current or prior financial year.
Amendments to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement – Eligible Hedged Items
The amendments provide clarification on two aspects of hedge accounting: identifying inflation as a hedged risk or portion, and hedging 
with options.
IFRS 3 (revised 2008) Business Combinations
The revision introduces several changes which have a significant impact on the accounting for business combinations and the costs 
associated with them. 
Amendments to IFRIC 9 and IAS 39 Embedded Derivatives
The amendments serve to clarify that on reclassification of a financial asset out of the ‘at fair value through profit or loss’ category all 
embedded derivatives have to be assessed and, if necessary, separately accounted for in financial statements. 49
Abcam plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
2. Adoption of new and revised standards continued
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these 
financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not been adopted by the EU):
FRS 1 (amended)/IAS 27 (amended)  Cost of an Investment in a Subsidiary, Jointly Controlled Entity or Associate
IFRS 9  Financial Instruments
IAS 24 (revised November 2009)   Related Party Disclosures
IAS 27 (revised 2008)  Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements
IAS 28 (revised 2008)  Investments in Associates
IFRIC 17   Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners
Improvements to IFRSs (April 2009)
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have a material impact on the 
financial statements of the Group.
3. Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs). The financial statements 
have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with 
Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments. 
The Group financial statements are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand Pounds (£000) except 
when otherwise indicated. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company made 
up to 30 June each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee 
entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. 
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services 
provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Sales of goods are recognised when goods are despatched and title has passed.
Sales of goods that result in award credits for customers, under the Abpoints Scheme, are accounted for as multiple element revenue 
transactions and the fair value of the consideration received or receivable is allocated between the goods supplied and the award credits 
granted. The consideration allocated to the award credits is measured by reference to their fair value – the amount for which the award 
credits could be sold separately. Such consideration is not recognised as revenue at the time of the initial sale transaction but is deferred 
and recognised as revenue when the award credits are redeemed and the Group’s obligations have been fulfilled.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable, which is the 
rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
Revenue derived from the Company’s conferences is recognised when the conference is held; however it is not material.
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Benefits received 
and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it 
operates (its functional currency). For the purposes of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group 
company are expressed in Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated 
financial statements. 50

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
For the year ended 30 June 2010
3. Significant accounting policies continued
Foreign currencies continued
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency 
(foreign currencies) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary 
assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated to the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary 
items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was 
determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise except for:
•  exchange differences on transactions entered into to hedge certain foreign currency risks (see below under financial instruments/hedge 
accounting); and
•  exchange differences on monetary items receivable from or payable to a foreign operation for which settlement is neither planned nor likely 
to occur, which form part of the net investment in a foreign operation, and which are recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve 
and recognised in profit or loss on disposal of the net investment.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the results of the operations of the Company’s overseas subsidiaries, Abcam Inc, 
Abcam KK, and Abcam (Hong Kong) Limited are translated at the monthly average exchange rates during the period and their balance sheets 
at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on the translation of the opening net assets and results of 
operations are classified as equity and recognised in the Group’s foreign currency translation reserve.
Retirement benefit costs
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made to state-managed 
retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the nature of the Group’s obligations under the 
schemes is equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes some items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never 
taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the 
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet 
liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to 
the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets 
and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition of other 
assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests 
in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred 
tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except where it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the 
deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities 
and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities 
on a net basis.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the 
following bases:
Office equipment, fixtures and fittings  20% per annum
Laboratory equipment 20% per annum
Computer equipment  33% per annum
Hybridomas  33% per annum
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and is recognised in income. 51
Abcam plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
3. Significant accounting policies continued
Intangible assets
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Expenditure on development activities is recognised as an asset if and only if it meets the recognition criteria set out in IAS 38 – Intangible Assets.
Payments made to acquire software and distribution rights from third parties are capitalised at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over 
their estimated minimum useful lives. The minimum useful life is determined to be three years in the case of software, and the term of the 
deal in the case of distribution rights, which can extend up to ten years.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any 
indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in 
order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually 
and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows 
are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its 
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs 
and an attributable portion of production overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. 
Cost is calculated using the standard cost method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of 
completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items 
where appropriate.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised 
in the income statement when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. When a trade receivable is considered uncollectable, it is 
written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account. 
Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in the income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. The accounting 
policies adopted for specific financial liabilities and equity instruments are set out below.
Trade payables
Trade payables are measured at amortised cost.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments
Forward contracts are used by the Group to manage its exposure to the risk associated with the variability in cash flows in relation to both 
recognised assets or liabilities and forecast transactions.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their 
fair value at each balance sheet date. A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative 
fair value is recognised as a financial liability. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement immediately unless the derivative 
is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in the income statement depends on the 
nature of the hedge relationship.
A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than twelve months 
and it is not expected to be realised or settled within twelve months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities. 52

3. Significant accounting policies continued
Hedge accounting
The Group designates certain derivatives as either hedges of highly probable forecast transactions or hedges of foreign currency risk of firm 
commitments (cash flow hedges).
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along 
with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge 
and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is effective in offsetting 
changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item.
Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in equity. 
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss, and is included in the ‘administration and 
management expenses’ line of the income statement.
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss, in the 
same line of the income statement as the recognised hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated 
or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time remains in equity and is 
recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, 
the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment. In accordance with IFRS 1, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants 
of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested at 1 July 2006.
Incentives in the form of shares are provided to employees under share option, share purchase (SIP) and long-term incentive plans (LTIP). 
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions) at the date of 
grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the 
vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value of options issued under the Group’s share option schemes is measured by the use of the Monte Carlo Simulation.
Fair value of the awards under the Group’s LTIP is measured by the use of the Monte Carlo Simulation for the TSR portion and the Binomial 
Model for the EPS portion.
Fair value of an equity-settled payment under the SIP is measured as the face value of the award on the date of grant.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, 
exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. Charges made to the income statement in respect of share-based payments are 
credited to retained earnings.
The Group operates an employee benefit trust as part of its incentive plans for employees. All assets and liabilities of the trust are recorded 
in the balance sheet as assets and liabilities of the Company until such time as the assets are awarded to the beneficiaries. All income and 
expenditure of the trust is similarly brought into the results of the Company.
Own shares
Own equity instruments which are acquired are recognised at cost and deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in the income 
statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s own equity instruments. Any difference between the carrying amount 
and the consideration is recognised in reserves.
4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 3, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates 
and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities as at the date of reporting the financial statements, and the reported 
amounts of revenues and expenditure during the year. In preparation of the consolidated financial statements, estimates and assumptions 
have been made by the Directors concerning the fair value of share options, the estimated useful lives of fixed assets, accruals and provisions 
required, the carrying value of investments, the recoverability of deferred tax assets, the carrying value of intangible assets and other similar 
evaluations. Actual amounts may differ from those estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period 
in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects 
both current and future periods.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk 
of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.
Impairment of intangibles
After reviewing the circumstances surrounding its remaining product line acquisition deals during the year, it was considered that the carrying 
value of certain of these intangible assets was no longer supportable due to a concern over the security of supply of products subject to those 
agreements. An impairment loss of £147,000 (2009: £201,000) has been recognised to take account of the recoverable amount of the contracts. 53
Abcam plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued
Fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments
As described in note 24, the Directors use their judgement in selecting an appropriate valuation technique for financial instruments not 
quoted in an active market. Valuation techniques commonly used by market practitioners are applied. For derivative financial instruments, 
assumptions are made based on quoted market rates adjusted for specific features of the instrument. Other financial instruments are valued 
using a discounted cash flow analysis based on assumptions supported, where possible, by observable market prices or rates.
Valuation of own manufactured inventory
The standard costs used for the valuation of own manufactured inventory require a number of assumptions concerning the allocation of 
overheads. These assumptions are based primarily on management’s estimates of time spent in each relevant area of activity and normal 
levels of activity.
Provision for slow moving or defective inventory
The provision for slow moving or defective inventory is based on management’s estimation of the commercial life and shelf life of inventory 
lines and is applied on a prudent basis. In assessing this, management takes into consideration the sales history of products and the length 
of time that they have been available for resale.
5. Income statement for the Company
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company has elected not to present its own income statement for the year. 
Abcam plc reported a profit for the year ended 30 June 2010 of £20,626,000 (2009: £12,402,000).
6. Revenue
An analysis of the Group’s revenue, all of which derives from continuing operations, is as follows:

7. Operating segments
Products and services from which reportable segments derive their revenues
The Directors consider that there are no identifiable business segments that are engaged in providing individual products or services or a 
group of related products and services that are subject to risks and returns that are different to the core business. The information reported 
to the Group’s Chief Executive Officer, who is considered the chief operating decision maker, for the purposes of resource allocation and 
assessment of performance is based wholly on the overall activities of the Group. The Group has therefore determined that it has only one 
reportable segment under IFRS 8, which is ‘sales of antibodies and related products’. The Group’s revenue and results and assets for this 
one reportable segment can be determined by reference to the Group’s income statement and balance sheet.
The Group has no individual product or customer which comprises more than 10% of its revenues.

The above table reflects the committed cash payments under operating leases, rather than the expected charge to the income statement 
in the relevant periods. The effect on the income statement will differ to the above figures to the extent of the amortisation of a £1.1m lease 
incentive received on signing of a new lease in 2008/09, and also the amortisation of the rent-free period included in the same lease agreement. 
The expected charge in 2010/11 on these operating leases is expected to be £859,000 for the Group and £350,000 for the Company.

Deferred tax (note 22)         (310) (527) 
         6,609 4,012 
Corporation tax is calculated at 28% (2009: 28%) of the estimated assessable profit for the year. Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated 
at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
The Finance Act 2010, which provides for a reduction in the main rate of corporation tax from 28% to 27% effective from 1 April 2011, was 
substantively enacted on 21 July 2010. As it was not substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, the rate reduction is not yet reflected 
in these financial statements in accordance with IAS 10, as it is a non-adjusting event occurring after the reporting period.
The impact of the rate reduction, which will be reflected in the next reporting period, is estimated to reduce the UK deferred tax asset 
provided at 30 June 2010 by £35,000. 56

13. Tax continued
The Government has also indicated that it intends to enact future reductions in the main tax rate of 1% each year down to 24% by 1 April 2014.
The future 1% main tax rate reductions are expected to have a similar impact on the financial statements as outlined above, however the 
actual impact will be dependent on our deferred tax position at that time.
The charge for the year can be reconciled to the profit per the income statement as follows:

Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of  
diluted earnings per share        36,575,384 35,967,328 
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of 
shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share is calculated on the same basis as basic earnings per share but with a further 
adjustment for the weighted average shares in issue to reflect the effect of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. The number of dilutive potential 
ordinary shares is derived from the number of share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market 
price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the year. 57

16. Intangible assets continued
The amortisation period for the upfront licence fees and software is three years. The amortisation period for the distribution rights is the term 
of the agreement. After reviewing the circumstances surrounding the remaining product line acquisition deals, it was considered that the 
carrying value of certain of these intangible assets was no longer supportable due to a concern over the security of supply of products subject 
to those agreements. An impairment loss of £147,000 (2009: £201,000) has been recognised in the year to take account of the recoverable 
amount of the contracts.

As a result of the decision in the prior year to refocus the monoclonal manufacturing resource towards more targeted, lower level production, 
an impairment loss of £1.1m was recognised in that year relating to tangible assets associated with the higher volume production processes 
which will not now be implemented. No further impairments of property, plant and equipment were necessary during the current year.

Trade receivables
The average credit period taken for sales is 32.6 days (2009: 32.0 days). No interest has been charged on the receivables. Trade receivables 
are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts determined by reference to past default experience. The Group and Company 
have provided fully for all receivables over 90 days past due because historical experience is such that receivables that are past due beyond 
90 days are generally not recoverable. Trade receivables between 30 days and 90 days are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable 
amounts from the sale of goods determined by reference to past default experience.
Credit limits for each customer are reviewed on a monthly basis. No customer represents more than 5% of the total balance of trade receivables.
The analysis below shows the balances included in debtors which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group or Company has not 
provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable. Neither the Group nor 
Company holds any collateral or other credit enhancements over these balances, nor do they have a legal right of offset against any amounts 
owed to the counterparty.

Trade receivables continued
Movement in the allowance for doubtful debts continued
In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group and Company consider any change in the credit quality of the receivable from 
the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large 
and unrelated. Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
An impairment loss was recognised in the year ended 30 June 2008 relating to certain customers in financial difficulties. The difference 
between the carrying amount of these trade receivables and the present value of the expected litigation proceeds was written off as 
uncollectable within the year ended 30 June 2009. No such individually impaired trade receivables relating to customers in financial 
difficulties have been identified in the current year.

At the balance sheet date, there are no aggregate temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which a 
deferred tax liability has not been recognised (2009: £1,210,000). No liability was recognised in the prior year in respect of these differences 
because the Group was in a position to control the timing of the reversal of temporary differences and it was probable that such differences 
would not reverse in the foreseeable future. No temporary differences exist in the current year as a result of a change to the UK tax legislation 
which largely exempts dividends from UK tax if received on or after 1 July 2009. The Directors believe that all dividends to be paid by the 
Company’s subsidiaries will meet the criteria for exemption from UK tax.

Trade creditors and accruals principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing costs. At 30 June 2010, the Group had 
an average of 29 days of purchases (2009: 19 days) outstanding in trade creditors (excluding accruals and deferred income). Most suppliers do 
not charge interest for the first 60 days of the invoice. The Group has financial risk management policies in place to ensure that all payables are 
paid within the credit time frame. The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other payables approximates to their fair value.
The deferred creditor represents the earn-out payable on sales of products under a distribution agreement.
24. Financial instruments
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns whilst maximising the return 
to stakeholders. The capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to the equity holders of the 
parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings.
Significant accounting policies
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the 
basis on which income and expenses are recognised in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are 
disclosed in note 3. Foreign exchange contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and the yield curves derived from quoted 
interest rates matching maturities of these contracts.

* Financial liabilities at amortised cost within trade and other payables consist of trade payables, intercompany payables, other taxes and other payables.
The Directors consider there to be no material difference between the book value and the fair value of the Group’s financial assets and 
liabilities at the balance sheet date. This is because most of the financial assets and liabilities are short term.
Fair value measurements recognised in the statement of financial position
Financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value have been classified using a fair value hierarchy that 
reflects the significance of the inputs used in measuring the fair value of those instruments. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:
• Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
•  Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for 
the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
•  Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based 
on observable market data (unobservable market inputs).
The Group’s derivatives meet the definition of Level 2, as outlined above. There were no transfers between Level 1 and 2 during the year.
Risk in relation to the use of financial instruments
Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group or the 
Company. Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers spread across diverse geographical areas. The Group does not have 
a significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty. Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts 
receivable and consideration is given as to whether there is any impairment in the value of any amounts owing. 64

24. Financial instruments continued
Risk in relation to the use of financial instruments continued
Credit risk continued
The standard payment terms for receivables other than intra-group balances are 30 days. Any variation in these terms requires authorisation 
by senior management. Year-end debtor days are 32.6 days (2009: 32.0 days). All overdue debts are provided for where collectability is 
considered doubtful or the value of the debt is impaired. Objective evidence of impairment could include the Group’s past experience of 
collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average credit period of 32.6 days, as well as 
observable changes in international or local economic conditions.
The standard payment terms for intra-group receivables are 45 days. There is not considered to be any risk of impairment of these receivables 
unless the financial assets of the entity holding the corresponding liability are impaired. 
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings 
assigned by international credit-rating agencies. Funds are split between at least two institutions.
Market risk
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Group 
enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on the sales of goods and services denominated in US Dollars, 
Euros and Japanese Yen.
Foreign currency risk management
The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The Group’s policy is to maintain natural hedges where 
possible, by matching foreign currency revenue and expenditure. Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters 
utilising forward exchange contracts.
The carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities at the reporting date, not denominated in 
the local functional currency, are as follows:
       Liabilities  Assets
       30 June 30 June 30 June 30 June

Hong Kong Dollars      — — 55 —
       (1,376) (1,709)  8,871 5,819 
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The Group’s principal functional currency is Sterling. The Group is mainly exposed to US Dollars and Euros but has an increasing exposure to 
Japanese Yen. Since opening an office in Hong Kong, the Group is also now exposed to Hong Kong Dollars. At the current time, this exposure 
is not considered material and hence is not included in the analysis below. 
The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to an 8% increase and decrease in the Sterling exchange rate against the relevant foreign 
currencies on the Group’s profit before tax and equity. 8% represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign 
exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and forward exchange 
contracts and adjusts their translation at the period end for an 8% change in foreign currency rates. A positive number indicates an 
increase in profit or equity.
     Yen currency impact  Euro currency impact  US Dollar currency impact

     £000  £000  £000  £000  £000  £000
Effect of an 8% strengthening in relevant exchange rate on:
Profit or loss     — —  — 94  237 68 
Other equity     385 176  1,051 1,163  594 907 
Effect of an 8% weakening in relevant exchange rate on: 
Profit or loss     — —  (1) (111)  (279) (80) 
Other equity     (453) (167)  (1,234) (1,365)  (697) (1,064) 
In management’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative of the inherent foreign exchange risk as the year-end exposure does not 
necessarily reflect the exposure during the year. 
Forward exchange contracts
It is the policy of the Group to enter into forward exchange contracts to manage the risk associated with anticipated sales transactions out to 
15 months within 30% to 80% of the exposure generated. Upon maturity of a forward exchange contract, the Group may enter into a new 
contract designated as a separate hedging relationship.
Foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and the yield curves derived from quoted interest 
rates matching maturities of the contracts. 65

At 30 June 2010, the fair value of contracts held as cash flow hedges is £619,000 (2009: £1,296,000). The remaining contracts are not held 
as cash flow hedges. 
Liquidity risk management
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management 
framework for the management of the Group’s short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities, continuously monitoring cash flows and matching 
the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
The Group and Company hold cash deposits at call or with a maturity of up to twelve months. At 30 June 2010, the average maturity of 
balances was 146 days (2009: 47 days) of fixed rate deposits not sensitive to changes in interest rates. Sufficient funds are readily available to 
the Company to meet operational requirements.
Trade payables are normally payable within 30 days of invoice and the standard payment terms for intra-group receivables are 45 days.

Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis
An increase of 1% in the average interest rate during the year would have resulted in an increase in interest received by the Group of 
£443,000 (2009: £376,000) and by the Company of £423,000 (2009: £369,000). A decrease of 1% in the average interest rate during the 
year would have resulted in a reduction in interest received by the Group of £184,000 (2009: £136,000) and by the Company of £179,000 
(2009: £113,000). There would have been no effect on equity reserves.
The closing cash and short-term deposits balance at the year end has been used as the basis for the calculations. A 1% increase or decrease 
in interest rates represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates. 67

30. Share-based payments
Equity-settled share option scheme
The Company operates a number of share option schemes for certain employees of the Group. The share-based compensation charge relates 
to option awards from the EMI plan, Unapproved Share Option Plan, the US Employees Share Option Plan, the Abcam 2005 share option 
scheme, the SAYE scheme, the Abcam Company Share Option Plan (CSOP), the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and the Share Incentive 
Plan (SIP). Option grants under each scheme have been aggregated.
The vesting period for grants under the SAYE scheme is either three years or five years, as selected by the employee at the date of grant. 
Those options with performance criteria vest when the criteria are met. The vesting period for all other options is from one to three years. If the 
options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant the options expire. Options are forfeited if the employee leaves 
the Group before the options vest.
The volatility of the options is based on the long-term average volatility in the share price of five quoted companies that are considered to have 
a reasonable comparability with Abcam plc. The dividend yield is based on Abcam’s actual dividend yield in the past.
The risk free rate is the yield on UK Government Gilts at each date of grant. The employee exercise multiple is based on published statistics for a 
portfolio of companies. The employee exit rate is based on management’s expectations and, in accordance with IFRS 2, is applied after vesting.
The Group recorded a total share-based expense of £826,000 in the year (2009: £464,000), of which £702,000 (2009: £374,000) was 
included within administration and management expenses and £124,000 (2009: £90,000) was included within R&D expenses.
Summary of all schemes, excluding SIP and LTIP
Options outstanding as at 30 June 2010 had an exercise price of between 25p and 904p (2009: 12.5p and 462p). The weighted average 
remaining contractual life is 7.35 years (2009: 7.46 years). The weighted average fair value of the options outstanding at the end of the year 
was 120.59p (2009: 65.56p). The Group recorded total share-based expenses of £279,000 (2009: £272,000) relating to all schemes 
excluding the SIP and LTIP.

the EMI scheme so no further grants can be made under this scheme. 71

Share Incentive Plan (SIP)
All UK-based employees are eligible to participate in the SIP whereby employees buy shares in the Company. These shares are called 
Partnership Shares and are held in trust on behalf of the employee. For every Partnership Share bought by the employee the Company will 
give the employee one share free of charge (Matching Shares), provided the employee remains employed by the Company for a period of 
at least three years. The employees must take their shares out of the Plan on leaving the Company and will not be entitled to the Matching 
Shares if they leave within three years of buying the Partnership Shares. In addition, the Company can also award employees the right to 
acquire up to a maximum of £3,000 of shares (Free Shares). There are no vesting conditions attached to the Free Shares, other than 
being continuously employed by the Company for three years from the date of grant.

For the purposes of IFRS 2 the fair value of these Matching Shares and Free Shares is determined as the market value of the shares at the 
date of grant. No valuation model is required to calculate the fair value of awards under the SIP. The fair value of an equity-based payment 
under the SIP is the face value of the award on the date of grant because the participants are entitled to receive the full value of the shares 
and there are no market-based performance conditions attached to the awards.
The Group recognised a total expense of £195,000 (2009: £68,000) related to Matching and Free Share awards in the year.
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The Company approved a new LTIP in 2008. Vesting of performance share awards made under this scheme to the executive management team is 
conditional upon achievement of two separate performance conditions. Full details of these performance conditions are shown in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report. In 2010, LTIP awards were made to members of senior management, in addition to the executive management team. Vesting 
of awards made to senior management are based on market-based performance criteria only, and are calculated using the Monte Carlo model.
All awards made under this scheme have a fixed term of three years. Save as permitted in the LTIP rules, awards lapse on an employee 
leaving the Company.
Details of performance share awards outstanding during the year are as follows:

These performance share awards were made on 9 November 2009 (2009: 6 November and 17 November 2008). The aggregate of the fair 
values of the awards made on that date is £756,000 (2009: £573,000).  74

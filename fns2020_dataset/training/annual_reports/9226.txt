Peter Erskine
Chairman
Dear Shareholder,
2010 has been a significant year of change for Ladbrokes.
In April, following a thorough recruitment process with many 
high calibre candidates, we appointed Richard Glynn as the 
new Chief Executive of the Group. Aside from his relevant 
online experience (after nine years at Sporting Index) and 
analytical skills, what impresses me most is Richard’s 
ambition and enthusiasm for the business. His desire to 
succeed and restore Ladbrokes to a position of leadership 
within the industry is infectious. 
He has executed an honest, thorough and expeditious 
appraisal of the business. This confirmed that whilst our 
brand remains amongst the best in the gambling industry 
we have fallen behind the competition in areas such as 
technology and digital marketing. 
Strategy
Over the next few pages Richard has taken a candid 
approach to discussing the challenges which the business 
now faces, as well as outlining how he and his team plan to 
overcome them. He has prioritised six objectives or ‘Critical 
Success Factors’ and the Group is now fully focused on 
achieving them. 
Organisational change
To implement these changes effectively the management 
team has been restructured. This revised organisational 
structure addresses the historic lack of alignment in what 
had been an operationally siloed business as well as 
promoting a greater level of responsibility and accountability 
throughout. Offices have been consolidated with everybody 
moved to the head office at Rayners Lane, reflecting a one 
customer one company ethos. A number of new hires have 
been made to strengthen the existing team.
Chairman’ s  
statement
Our Chairman, Peter Erskine, 
looks back at the  
performance of the Group 
over the past 12 months 
and considers how recent 
changes to the Board, senior 
management appointments 
and a newly aligned 
operational structure,  
position it for the future. Overview
Ladbrokes plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2010
05
The report on Corporate Governance is set out on  
pages 32 to 36. During 2010 the Board has been applying 
the principles relating to its role and effectiveness.  
This included taking a lead in Richard Glynn’s appointment, 
reshaping the structure of the Board and developing the 
new strategy for the Company’s long term success.
Dividend
In line with our stated intention to resume a progressive 
dividend policy the Group will be paying a final dividend  
of 3.75 pence per share taking the full year dividend to  
7.60 pence per share. This dividend is approximately  
2.0 times covered by underlying earnings, excluding the 
impact of High Rollers and the effect of the HMRC 
settlement in April 2010. 
The dividend will be payable on 1 June 2011 to shareholders 
on the register as at 25 February 2011.
Summary
Within the context of a tough economic climate and  
a material organisational restructure, the continued 
commitment, enthusiasm and team spirit of people in  
all parts and at every level of the Ladbrokes business  
has been encouraging.
I am satisfied with the progress made during 2010.  
The business has delivered an improved performance  
with operating profit
(1)(2)
 up 20.9% on last year driven by 
double digit profit growth across all divisions. The strength 
of the balance sheet has been enhanced by a 29.1% 
reduction in net debt. 
We have established a solid platform for growth and defined 
clear, ambitious but achievable objectives on which to focus 
and I am confident that we now have the right team, with 
the right skills and the right strategy to make them a reality.
Peter Erskine
Chairman
In August Gary McIlraith joined us from Alix Partners as 
Managing Director of Digital Channels, International and 
Strategy. Gary’s expertise at delivering enhanced customer 
performance in the highly segmented online environment  
is particularly valuable in the rapidly changing digital age. 
As a consequence of the restructuring and flattening 
of reporting lines, John O’Reilly decided, after a very 
successful 18 years, to leave Ladbrokes to seek  
new challenges.
In December Stephen Vowles started as Director of 
Customer Experience, a role which reflects the Group’s 
commitment to adopt a customer centric approach 
throughout its operation, offer and brand positioning. 
Stephen’s brand experience includes eight years with 
Proctor & Gamble where he played a pivotal role in the 
launch of Nectar. 
In February 2011 Nick Rust joined us from Gala Coral as 
Managing Director of Retail. He is a highly experienced retail 
betting and gaming executive with a very good industry 
reputation. This appointment has allowed Richard Ames  
to take up a key central role as Managing Director of 
Consumer Operations with responsibility for delivery of 
cross-Group operations in areas such as technology, 
trading and business intelligence. 
Finally, after 16 years association with the Group, Brian 
Wallace, Group Finance Director, has advised the Board of 
his intention to stand down as a Director. Brian has agreed 
to remain in his role until late summer to help the change 
go as smoothly as possible. On behalf of the Board and 
the senior team at Ladbrokes I would like to thank him for 
the significant contribution he has made to the Group over 
many years and wish him every future success.
Board and Corporate Governance
The Board has also been further enhanced by the 
appointment of John Kelly as Senior Independent Non-
executive Director. John has an in depth knowledge of the 
industry having previously been Chief Executive Officer and 
Chairman of the Gala Coral Group. John’s appointment 
adds another string to our bow and after having added 
Darren Shapland and Sly Bailey in December 2009, I feel we 
have a strong and experienced Board who are ready and 
able to tackle the challenges to come.
Meetings with shareholders over the past 12 months have 
served to emphasise the importance which is placed on  
the Board and its corporate governance. I am pleased  
with how the Board is interacting and developing. Board 
meetings have a healthy level of debate which provides  
me with confidence that each Board member is heavily 
engaged in understanding and advising on the subjects 
being discussed.

Chief  
Executive’s 
review
Richard Glynn
Chief Executive
Why did you want to join 
Ladbrokes?
Put simply I wanted the best job in the sector and I’m 
delighted to have been given the opportunity. When I think 
back to when I was in my twenties my friends and I would 
all go to Ladbrokes when we wanted to place a bet. It was  
a growth company and an innovator. In recent years it  
has become less competitive. However I believe it has 
significant core strengths and upside potential and with  
a clearer focus, some targeted investment, a lot of hard 
work and more decisive execution, we can restore 
Ladbrokes to its industry leading position. 
This is a big opportunity because there are some very clear 
and achievable things that we can do that will make a big 
difference to this Company’s position in the marketplace. 
This year we have been able to make a start on some of 
these things and this has already helped us to achieve some 
good results. Whilst we have now broken ground, the next 
two years will be crucial as we develop our technology, 
marketing capabilities and business intelligence, 
foundations that will enable us to compete more  
effectively in a fast-changing marketplace. 
What has been clear to me for some time is that Ladbrokes 
has been over-reliant on its brand and has not invested 
enough to enable it to compete. I believe that with a much 
clearer strategic approach and the right investment to 
enable it, we can make Ladbrokes favourite. 
What were the most signiﬁcant 
things you found when you joined 
the Company?
I undertook a thorough assessment of the business when 
I joined. I wanted to look at its strengths and weaknesses 
and make an honest appraisal of where we were and where 
we needed to be. I have to say that while I have identified 
many things that can be improved there are also many 
things that have impressed me and even surprised me 
about this Company. I knew before I came that Ladbrokes 
had a strong brand, a strong balance sheet and a reputation 
for working effectively with regulators. 
I’ve been impressed at the strength of the Retail estate 
and the continued focus on operational efficiency and 
cost controls as well as the many talented people here who 
have welcomed the opportunity to contribute to a genuine 
change in our culture and approach. Their impressive level 
of knowledge and a willingness to work hard is coupled with 
a tangible desire for success. If I didn’t know it before I 
came, I am now convinced that the core ingredients needed 
to reignite this business are all here. I did find a lack of 
strategic direction, underinvestment and a siloed approach 
to doing business that was holding the Company back. 
However we have worked, and continue to work, hard to 
address these historical weaknesses and to outline a clear 
path to making the business great again.  Ladbrokes plc

(i)  Building upon our retail strength 
(ii) Focusing on brand and consumer 
(iii) Maintaining regulatory leadership 
(iv)  Developing our pricing, trading  
and liability management
(v) Delivering technological excellence
(vi) Establishing a strong digital capability
In some areas we are more advanced than others – for 
example in Retail we have done some excellent work to 
control costs and optimise the profitability of the estate.  
The contract with Global Draw, announced earlier in 2010, 
to supply new machines to our UK shops began in January 
2011. We expect the new machines, their enhanced content 
and an improved operational focus to drive material 
improvements to machine profits in 2011.
Our brand is strong, but we have been underinvested in  
it over recent years and it has lacked consistency. We 
now need to make it more relevant to today’s consumers. 
We also know that Ladbrokes has a strong regulatory 
reputation and we will continue to focus on this area  
to ensure that regulation is sensible and proportionate  
in those markets where we currently operate and may 
choose to operate in the future. 
The final three areas are interlinked and rely on us investing 
in systems, skills and technologies to maximise the 
potential of the business across all channels and across  
our existing markets. 
By building an optimised pricing, trading and liability 
management system we can offer an improved range of 
products, including wider and deeper Bet In Play markets. 
It will also enable us to maximise our margin. 
This relies on having the best trading platform available and 
that means investment in technology. Technology is also 
core to our Digital business where we are already focused 
on improving our understanding of the customer and 
expanding our product offer. Mobile is a good example of 
this and we have recently launched a range of smartphone 
apps; Sports Bet, Kick Off and Blackjack, prioritising 
marketing spend in this area to support our ambitions. 
E-excellence is about the skills that we require to ensure 
this technology delivers to its utmost potential through 
better customer relationship management, better search 
engine optimisation and an improved ability to recruit and 
retain customers. 
Together these elements make us an e-enabled business 
with the potential to compete much more effectively 
at home and crucially in the international marketplace  
where we may need to partner with brands or tender 
for government licences to secure the best opportunities. 
What do you think are your key 
challenges at Ladbrokes?
The most recent success of the business has primarily been 
driven by an operational focus on retail betting and gaming. 
Whilst our Digital business has grown significantly since 
launching in 2000, it is currently not as competitive as it 
ought to be in a rapidly evolving marketplace, particularly 
when you consider our brand heritage. There are several 
challenges which we must meet head on in order to  
change this. 
In order to address them we first needed to restructure the 
siloed nature of the business. Operationally the Company 
has historically been divided by product with a lack 
of alignment meaning an inconsistent and at times 
commercially inefficient approach. We have put in place 
a completely new management structure with roles and 
responsibilities focused on delivering to the customer, 
regardless of the channel. 
Having set the structure it was crucial that we brought in 
the right people to enhance our existing talent base. During 
2010 we appointed; Gary McIlraith, Director of Digital 
Channels, International Development and Strategy; Nick 
Rust, Managing Director of Retail; Stephen Vowles, Director 
of Customer Experience and Andrew Harley, Group Human 
Resources Director. We now have a strong senior team 
focused on delivery of a clear vision, supported by an 
experienced and knowledgeable Board. We’ve brought 
in people with the right skills to make this a business that 
responds to the customers’ needs whichever channel they 
choose to interact with us.
We are now well positioned to tackle the other challenges 
facing the business.
What approach are you taking to 
meeting these challenges?
With the structure and people in place I’ve set some very 
clear objectives for the business. I’ve called these our 
critical success factors and have summarised them as:

Can you explain your  
online strategy?
Ladbrokes has seen strong growth in the online gambling 
sector over the past ten years to the point where Digital 
now accounts for over 30% of Group operating profit
(1)(2)
. 
However during this period we have also seen the emergence 
of many new competitors in the online space and therefore 
need to invest and further develop in order to become more 
competitive. Our online strategy is focused as follows:
(i)  Reinforcing our reputation as a leader in sports 
betting. Whilst many of our customers enjoy playing our 
world-class Casino, Poker, Bingo and Games, many of 
them came to us first to bet on their favourite sport. Our 
heritage and expertise in sports betting gives us a head 
start against newer market entrants but we have to 
continue to innovate, in areas such as Bet In Play and 
mobile sports betting, to stay ahead.
(ii)  Having the best online products. We are constantly 
expanding the range of sports events and markets 
available to customers and regularly introducing new 
and exciting casino games. In 2011 we plan to have circa 
27,000 Bet In Play events available and will continue to 
innovate to ensure Ladbrokes customers have access  
to the best betting and gaming products available in  
the market. 
(iii)  Customer closeness. I want Ladbrokes to have a 
better understanding of its customers than any of our 
competitors. In this way we can deliver products better 
tailored to their needs and an improved customer 
experience. Ladbrokes is a trusted brand, which is 
especially important to online customers. We will build 
on this strength and give customers more reasons to 
choose Ladbrokes in the future. 
(iv)  Developing our online marketing capabilities. 
The online world has become increasingly competitive 
and the skills needed to attract and retain customers 
more sophisticated. In the last year we have invested 
significantly in increasing our online marketing 
capabilities and expect this to improve our profitability 
going forward. 
Establishing a strong  
digital capability
Digital now represents over 30% of Group 
operating proﬁt

Y ou seem to have fallen behind 
some of your competitors in UK 
Retail. What steps are you taking  
to address this?
The financial performance of the UK Retail business is 
measured by looking at the level of OTC revenue, machine 
revenue and operating costs. Whilst our level of OTC gross 
win per shop is competitive, we see clear opportunities to 
increase our gross win percentage. Indeed we are already 
taking steps to improve our pricing, trading and liability 
management, all of which will help to do this.
We also recognise that our existing machine performance has 
fallen behind in the market but we have well defined plans to 
address this. As I have already mentioned, we have changed 
our machines supplier and we will complete a rollout of the 
brand new ‘Vision’ cabinet during the first half of 2011. In 
preparation for this we have appointed a specific management 
team whose sole focus is on improving operational 
performance and the training of staff ahead of and during 
the rollout process. We have very clear performance targets in      
this area and aim to align our machine profitability to that of our 
closest competitors over the next two years. The evidence is 
already pointing to good rates of growth in 2011. 
The control of costs in Retail has been a key focus and 
there have been tremendous strides in this area over the 
past 18 months. Whilst we expect our costs to increase 
due to a change in VAT and our machines arrangement, 
we continue to prioritise cost control particularly within 
the context of existing economic uncertainty in the UK 
and have implemented a pay freeze throughout the 
business for the second consecutive year.
Retail will also benefit from our increased customer focus and 
from the brand work that we will be conducting during 2011. In 
addition the focus upon improving our technology capabilities 
particularly our trading, pricing and liability management 
expertise will support our objective of maximising revenues 
and minimising costs in the Retail business. 
Finally as I have already mentioned we’ve appointed Nick 
Rust, as Retail Managing Director. Nick brings with him a 
strong track record of performance as Managing Director  
of Coral Retail. 
After a detailed trial and evaluation process of all 
national operators Ladbrokes agreed a four year 
contract with Global Draw for the supply of new 
gaming machines to our UK Retail estate. Global 
Draw is the market leader in this ﬁeld, supplying 
and operating over 18,000 server based gaming 
machines in over 4,000 venues worldwide. Rollout 
of the new machines began in January and will be 
completed during the ﬁrst half of 2011.
The new Vision cabinet, which will be exclusive  
to Ladbrokes, is an evolution of the successful 
Nevada dual screen terminal, with additional 
functionality derived from the brand new  
Videobet platform. Speciﬁc features include new 
promotional and marketing tools to enhance 
tournament mode and allow speciﬁcally targeted 
campaigns focused on individual games managed 
centrally or locally. The platform is fully integrated 
with Ladbrokes BS2000 (EPOS), and loyalty  
card systems.
The agreement allows us to offer customers the 
best of both worlds with the ability to play the 
most popular games from the established 
Barcrest terminals and slots games, as well as  
the new Global Draw products, including market 
leading 20p Roulette, Blackjack, and a range of 
popular slots games created by Reeltime, Games 
Media and third party providers. 
We will have access to an extensive range of new 
games throughout the duration of the agreement 
from a variety of games designers, with new B2/
B3/Category C products and a mix of exclusive 
content being introduced every year.
Ladbrokes is conﬁdent that the combination of a 
new Global Draw cabinet, a wide range of proven 
successful content displayed on a menu and 
layout already familiar to existing Ladbrokes 
machine players is a winning one.
Roll out of the 
new Global Draw 
machines will be 
completed during 
the ﬁrst half of 2011

Business review
How are you looking to use 
technology to enable the strategy?
The development of our technology is critical to our 
ambition to become a truly e-enabled business. It can 
enable us to become better at what we do in so many 
different ways. It will underpin best in class pricing, trading 
and liability management and this gives us the tools we 
need to manage risk, improve trading margin and 
differentiate our consumer offer. 
In 2011, we will continue to develop our pricing, trading and 
liability management platform, building on the progress we 
made in 2010. We will also implement a new eCommerce 
platform that has all of the features you would expect from  
a leading e-enabled business. This includes improved site 
search capabilities, a single customer wallet for all products 
and our own front end platform that lets us seamlessly and 
easily integrate the best Sportsbook and gaming products 
available in the market. The eCommerce project will take 
approximately 18 months to complete, but we have already 
begun and the improvements to our platform will start to 
come through in 2011. Technological development will 
also enable better use of data and content and improved 
business intelligence which will enhance our strong brand 
and customer base. Strength in these areas will enable  
us to deliver improved customer satisfaction and will 
increase our competitive edge in what is a rapidly 
evolving marketplace. 
How important do you  
think mobile betting will  
be in future?
We see mobile as an important part of providing a complete 
customer offer in a rapidly evolving marketplace. We have 
invested accordingly in 2010 and the launch of our new and 
exciting Sports Bet, Blackjack and Kick Off smartphone  
apps ensures that we are well placed to simplify and 
improve the betting experience of existing customers  
as well as reaching out to new ones. Indeed our  
innovation in this area was recently recognised with  
us winning the Mobile Gambling Award for Mobile  
Entertainment at the recent Future Mobile Awards

We see mobile as a strong growth opportunity and 
it will be supported by new marketing campaigns in 2011.

What are your plans to grow 
outside the UK?
We believe that regulated markets offer the best opportunity 
for Ladbrokes to expand our business and create value for 
shareholders. We are in favour of appropriate regulation that 
benefits consumers by ensuring operators are regulated 
whilst generating necessary tax revenue for governments 
and creating an incentive for operators like ourselves to 
compete on a level playing field generating a fair return  
on our investment. 
We already have market leading retail operations in 
Belgium, Ireland and Spain and in 2011 we will begin to 
operate online in South Africa through a business venture 
based on a regulated licence awarded in 2010. 
In 2010 we saw preparatory action in many countries, 
particularly within Europe, for legislation to regulate online 
gambling. We are watching those markets closely and, 
where appropriate regulation is adopted, we will look at the 
potential for Ladbrokes to enter and compete successfully 
on a market by market basis.
Develop our pricing, 
trading and liability 
management
Pricing, trading and liability management lie  
at the heart of a betting company. They are 
fundamental to further enhancing our  
reputation as a leader in sports betting which  
is where our heritage lies and which is often the 
point of entry for customers new to Ladbrokes
Maintaining 
regulatory 
leadership 
In an environment of regulatory change 
continuing to play a lead role in working 
alongside trade bodies, industry representatives 
and governments will help minimise the 
exposure of the business and our industry  
to future tax increases Ladbrokes plc

Business review
How active do you intend to be in 
the area of regulation and what 
are your priorities?
We have always played and will continue to play a lead  
role in this area working closely with trade bodies and 
industry representatives.
We have a major task in terms of communicating what  
this industry does in terms of social responsibility and the 
importance of sensible regulation for customers, business 
and Government. Our key priority in the UK is to limit the 
exposure of the business and industry to future tax 
increases and ensure that changes in the way the business 
is taxed remain commercially equitable. We are actively 
engaged with both the Government and the Opposition  
on the Levy debate as regards the current scheme and  
also in terms of a future commercial partnership to  
replace it. Outside of the UK differing cultural and social 
attitudes towards gambling, particularly within Europe is  
reflected in a lack of a uniform approach to regulation. 
Accordingly we will assess opportunities to expand 
internationally on a case by case basis. 
How do you plan to build upon 
Ladbrokes’ brand heritage? 
This will be a major focus for Stephen Vowles as Director of 
Customer Experience. The Ladbrokes brand leads the 
market in terms of unprompted awareness in the UK. This is 
a strength, but, in isolation, is not enough. In today’s highly 
competitive environment online brands have made a great 
deal of progress at our expense and we have not been fast 
enough to respond. By ending our siloed approach to 
products we are now able to develop a truly integrated 
approach to marketing and dramatically improve our 
communications and customer retention.
In 2011 we will start to evolve the positioning of the 
Ladbrokes brand based upon the continuing customers 
learnings driven by our OddsOn! loyalty programme. This 
unique insight into how, where and when our customers 
engage with us will enable the development of an industry 
leading approach to the personalisation of product. 
What has been achieved so far?
It has been a year of significant change. We have delivered a 
strong performance, particularly in the latter half of this year as 
well as preparing the foundations for the significant changes 
which are still to come. We are focused on what we are trying 
to achieve and have a clearly defined set of priorities that will 
enable us to achieve it. It will no doubt be challenging; we 
operate in an increasingly competitive marketplace. We have 
however clearly identified what needs to be done, have put in 
place the right structure to do it and will continue to work 
tirelessly in order to continue delivering against our objectives. 
What do you hope customers will 
be saying about Ladbrokes in  
two years’ time?
I want them to see a major difference. I want them to see us 
as having the most complete and consistent offer no matter 
how they choose to bet with us and I want them to be proud 
to recommend us to their friends. I want them to make 
Ladbrokes favourite.

Despite the disruption caused by the machine supplier 
trials, ongoing throughout the year, total machine gross win 
grew 7.2% during the year to £302.8 million with average 
gross win per gaming machine per week rising 6.6% to 
£730 in 2010. The performance in the fourth quarter was 
particularly encouraging with gross win per gaming 
machine per week up 11.6% reflecting strong management 
focus and the end of the disruption period on Barcrest 
machines (92% of the estate). During the year 24 regional 
managers have been deployed to focus solely on machines 
and we carried out a machine re-siting initiative. In 2010 
there were on average 7,953 terminals versus 7,892 in 2009. 
At 31 December 2010 there were 8,020 machines. 
After conducting extensive machine trials with multiple 
suppliers during the year, in August we announced our 
intention to switch 95% of our machine estate to Global 
Draw machines. The new “Vision” cabinet on the “Video-
bet” platform is already in 139 of our shops and we expect  
to complete this rollout during the first half of 2011.  
We believe, that over time, this significant step will have  
a material impact on closing the machine performance  
gap between ourselves and our competitors.
After adjusting for the effects of higher VAT, net revenue  
for machines grew 4.8%. 
Operating costs fell £3.7 million in the year to £458.7 million 
reflecting continued strong cost control. The benefit of an 
additional VAT recovery (£4.7 million) and the buyout of 
premium pay (2010 benefit of £3.0 million; £12.0 million 
annualised) was partially offset by incremental advertising 
around the World Cup and accrued bonuses during  
the year. 
Operating profit before non-trading items for the year  
was up 10.9% at £149.1 million. 
At 31 December 2010 there were 2,098 shops  
(31 December 2009: 2,088) in Great Britain. During the year, 
there were 40 openings, 30 shop closures, 25 relocations 
and 102 shop refurbishments.

UK Retail
The strength of our brand

envy of many of our online 
competitors. Retail is the 
bedrock of the business 
and remains a very visible, 
stable and commercially 
compelling high quality 
source of regulated earnings
OTC amounts staked were down 7.3% year on year driven 
by the challenging economic environment and the loss of a 
significant number of horseracing fixtures due to adverse 
weather. The first and last quarters of the year saw the most 
horseracing abandonments and these quarters were 11.1% 
and 10.6% down respectively. Quarters two and three, with 
minimal abandonments and the benefit of the World Cup, 
were 3.3% and 4.7% down respectively.
OTC gross win for the year declined by 2.4% to £417.0 
million. The overall OTC gross win margin of 16.7% 
was 0.8 percentage points higher than 2009 with the 
improvement due to a strong performance from football. 
Our football margin of 25.1% was 8.7 percentage points 
higher year on year reflecting both the unexpectedly  
low return in 2009 and the better than normal results  
during 2010. 
OTC net revenue decline was 0.8%, as the 7.3% OTC  
stake decline was offset by the improved margin and  
a £7.1 million reduction in OTC free bets (to £7.8 million  
in 2010), following the change to the OddsOn! loyalty 
scheme in July 2009. Business review

Other European Retail – Ireland
The economic and trading environment in Ireland remains 
challenging. OTC amounts staked fell 12.0% year on year  
or 9.1% on a constant currency basis. 
Overall gross win in Ireland was down 7.4% at £79.9 million 
with a positive machine performance (in Northern Ireland) 
more than offset by the decline in OTC amounts staked.  
The OTC gross win margin was 0.5% higher than in 2009 
with a strong football margin slightly offset by a weaker 
horse margin.
Net revenue fell by 4.3% including lower free bets (down 
£3.1 million).
In response to the challenging environment, the business 
has continued to maintain a tight focus on cost control. 
Operating costs for Ireland fell by 7.5% to £59.4 million 
(2009: £64.2 million) driven largely by staff scheduling 
efficiencies and a review of all head office costs. On a 
constant currency basis, costs were down 4.2%.
At 31 December 2010 there were 208 shops (31 December 
2009: 207) in the Republic of Ireland and 78 shops  
(31 December 2009: 78) in Northern Ireland. During the year, 
two shops were closed, three opened, 20 refurbished and 
three relocated.

Other European Retail – Spain
Bet volumes and amounts staked in the Sportium joint 
venture continue to exceed expectations. Notwithstanding 
Spain’s success at World Cup 2010, the overall gross win 
margin was 18.3%. The joint venture has improved 
efficiencies in its corner-focused business model and the 
estate has continued to grow. The corner-focused model 
has been designed to capitalise on any regulatory change 
and the Group continues to monitor regulatory progress 
closely. Helped by encouraging net revenue trends and 
increasing scale, operating losses were significantly 
reduced to £1.8 million (2009: £3.5 million). Sportium 
remains the market leader in Madrid and generated positive 
cash flows in the final quarter of 2010.
At 31 December 2010 there were 91 corners (31 December 
2009: 78) and 15 standalone shops (31 December 2009: 
five). Sportium intends to open a further 22 corners and  
two shops in 2011.

Digital net revenue increased by 5.4% to £169.4 million.  
This increase and a 4.2% growth in active customers as 
well as 4.5% growth in new sign-ups, reflects the benefit  
of investments made in our online mobile products and the 
development of our online marketing capabilities. Revenue 
growth in Sportsbook, Casino and Bingo was partially 
offset by continued weakness in Poker where the market 
remains challenging.
Higher net revenue, lower costs and lower taxes resulted in 
operating profit before non-trading items rising 36.0% to 
£62.7 million.
Sportsbook net revenue grew 16.9% to £65.1 million driven 
by 18.9% growth in pre-event turnover and 11.2% growth  
in Bet In Play with the overall gross win margin in line with 
2009 at 6.5%. As stated at the half year, the World Cup 
boosted player numbers and revenues and delivered very 
good gross win margins. This trend continued into the 
second half of the year with excellent football performance 
delivering a margin of 8.5%, 2.7 percentage points higher 
than 2009. Conversely, horseracing margins softened  
due to the introduction of Best Odds Guaranteed in  
August 2009, together with relatively poor results in  
some of the significant racing festivals over the year, 
particularly the Grand National, Royal Ascot and Glorious 
Goodwood. Overall horse margin for the year of 5.6% was 
2.7 percentage points lower than 2009. Active customer 
growth of 11.3% was driven by the World Cup as well as 
continued improvements in the functionality and content  
of our Sportsbook site, with average monthly active player 
days growing by 13.0% and yield per customer showing 
5.6% growth against 2009.
Casino net revenue was up 6.3% to £55.3 million following 
an exceptionally strong second half of the year (net revenue 
growth of 14.3%). Active player growth of 5.6% was 
achieved while maintaining average yield per customer 
at 2009 levels. This was achieved by focusing on both 
improving the retention of new player signups and building 
up one to one relationships with our VIP customers through 
better customer service and stand out promotions to our 
most valuable players. 
Poker net revenue fell 20.7% during the period to £18.8 million 
with the European poker market remaining challenging. 
While the number of active customers in the year fell by 
27.7%, this is against a comparative period which saw 
significant customer reactivation and incentivisation 
accompanying the migration of our Poker customer base to 
the Microgaming network. Customer yield growth of 9.8% 
was a result of lower customer acquisition numbers aided 
by an increased focus on VIP retention. 
Bingo net revenue grew 11.4% to £13.7 million. While the 
number of customers declined 3.0% with a lower level of 
player recruitment activity and marketing spend in 2010, this 
was more than offset by 14.8% growth in customer yield 
driven through continued product improvements and 
proactive customer management to deliver greater 
customer lifetime value. 
With only one major new game launched in the year,  
net revenue for Games was down 2.9% at £16.5 million, 
with active customers down 0.7% and yield showing a  
3.3% decline.

Operating costs of £106.7 million fell 0.3% compared to 
2009. This was a result of more effective marketing spend 
and reduced levy costs from the relocation of our 
Sportsbook operation to Gibraltar in 2009, which were 
partially offset by technology and people costs resulting 
from the move. Marketing investment was 18.8% of net 
revenue in the period compared to 20.6% of net revenue 
in 2009. Nevertheless, new player signups grew 4.5% 
bolstered by the World Cup customer recruitment 
campaign. The adjusted cost per acquisition was flat 
compared to 2009 at £91.

The profit from High Rollers for the period was £5.0 million 
(2009: £66.9 million).
The Core Telephone Betting business continues to struggle 
to compete with offshore low tax operators and the shift  
of customers to the internet. Excluding High Rollers, net 
revenue was up 3.2% to £16.2 million with the 11.6% 
decline in amounts staked offset by a better gross win 
margin of 6.0% (2009: 5.4%) and lower free bets. Unique

call volumes down by 12.8%. 
The majority of telephone calls are now handled by staff in 
the UK Retail estate and this initiative, combined with the 
closure of the Liverpool call centre in 2010, has resulted in 
telephone operating costs (excluding High Rollers) falling

were published on 15 February 2011. The survey provides 
an update on participation in gambling and the prevalence 
of problem gambling in Great Britain. Ladbrokes will 
continue to play its part in tackling problem gambling 
through responsible business practices, working with the 
Government and key bodies like the Responsible Gambling 
Strategy Board and by donating funds to the Gambling 
Research, Education and Treatment Foundation. 
The Horserace Betting Levy 
The Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and 
Sport has determined the 50th Levy Scheme. The Scheme, 
which runs from April 2011 to March 2012, will apply at an 
increased rate of 10.75% on gross profits on British 
horseracing. The threshold below which licensed betting 
offices pay abated charges was reduced to £50,000 per 
shop. Over the long term Ladbrokes believes a commercial 
replacement for the Levy will bring better outcomes for both 
racing and betting. Ladbrokes will continue to engage with 
the Government on positive solutions for change. 
Machine Taxation Reform
The Government has confirmed its intention to proceed with 
reforms to the taxation of gaming machines and proposes 
to replace both Amusement Machine Licence Duty (AMLD) 
and VAT on net takings with a new Machine Games Duty 
(MGD). MGD will be a tax on the income from the playing 
of prize games on machines. The Government intends to 
consult on draft legislation with relevant parties in Spring/
early Summer 2011, with the intention of legislating in the 
2012 Finance Bill.
Offshore regulation 
The previous administration carried out a consultation into 
the Regulatory Future of Remote Gambling in Great Britain. 
This consultation closed in June 2010 and the Government 
is due to report during 2011 on the consultation findings and 
proposals for regulating remote gambling operators.
Other European Retail 
Ireland
Legislation was introduced in the 2011 Irish Finance Bill  
to extend betting tax to online operators at the rate of 1%  
of turnover.
Spain 
A number of regions are pursuing regulation of retail  
betting and Ladbrokes, through our Sportium joint venture,  
will be targeting opportunities in Aragon and Navarra.  
As in Madrid, there will be a focus on corners and self-
service betting terminals. 
Opportunities in newly regulating markets
Ladbrokes is adopting a focused approach to new market 
opportunities. Markets are assessed on a case by case 
basis and where the taxation and regulatory frameworks  
do not represent a realistic probability to deliver value to 
shareholders we will not pursue these opportunities. For 
this reason we have withdrawn from the French market and 
did not pursue digital opportunities in Belgium and Norway. 
The Spanish Government has proposed legislation to 
regulate online gambling. Ladbrokes will assess the market 
opportunity on the basis of the final approved law, with 
particular regard to taxation levels. Ladbrokes plc

 In 2009 Corporate costs and International development costs were disclosed separately.
Revenue 
Revenue from continuing operations decreased by 
£52.1 million (5.0%) to £980.1 million (2009: £1,032.2 million). 
Excluding High Rollers activity, revenue increased by 
£12.9 million (1.3%) to £976.6 million (2009: £963.7 million) 
mainly as a result of improved machines performance in 
the UK Retail estate and improved sportsbook performance 
in Digital.
Proﬁt before ﬁnance costs, tax and  
non-trading items 
Profit before finance costs, tax and non-trading items 
decreased by £28.1 million (11.9%) to £207.3 million  
(2009: £235.4 million). Excluding High Rollers activity,  
profit before finance costs, tax and non-trading items 
increased by £33.8 million (20.1%) to £202.3 million  
(2009: £168.5 million) reflecting increased profits across  
all channels partially offset by higher corporate costs. 
Finance costs 
The net finance costs of £34.0 million were £10.1 million 
lower than last year (2009: £44.1 million) mainly reflecting 
lower average net debt. There was also interest income of 
£20.0 million in respect of an interest rebate following the 
HMRC tax settlement.
Proﬁt before tax 
The decrease in trading profits offset by favourable net 
interest in the period has resulted in a 1.0% increase in 
profit for continuing operations before taxation and non-
trading items to £193.3 million (2008: £191.3 million).
Non-trading items before tax
£28.5 million of non-trading losses before tax include a  
£7.3 million impairment charge in the UK and Irish Retail 
estate, a £3.1 million loss on closure of shops and disposal 
of assets in the UK and Other European Retail estates, as 
well as an £8.1 million charge in relation to accelerated 
depreciation of machines and related contract termination 
costs. £1.9 million of impairment and related closure costs 
were incurred following the exit from a French joint venture 
and £0.7 million related to litigation and transaction costs. 
Additionally, £7.4 million of restructuring costs were incurred 
across the Group. These include costs associated with 
changes in executive management and operational 
structure as a result of a full strategic review of the Group. 
Finance non-trading costs of £17.7 million include  
£8.6 million in relation to bond termination costs and 
£9.1 million in relation to the unwinding of interest  
rate swaps. Business review

Taxation
On 21 April 2010 the Group reached a settlement with 
HMRC which covered substantially all outstanding items  
in respect of tax years through to 31 December 2007.  
The settlement resulted in the recognition in the 2010 
income statement, within the tax charge, of a £261.9 million 
tax credit in relation to prior years. Additionally the Group 
received cash of £80.0 million in respect of corporation  
tax repayable from HMRC. 
Excluding the corporation tax settlement, the Group 
taxation charge for continuing operations before non-
trading items of £35.6 million represents an effective tax 
rate of 18.4% (2009: 15.0%).
Discontinued operations
The £9.1 million trading loss in discontinued operations is 
the loss before interest, tax and non-trading items from 
Italy. The Italy Retail business was sold on 31 May 2010 
and the total loss on disposal of the Italy business was 
£17.3 million.
The Paddington Casino licence was sold for £4.3 million  
on 22 January 2010.
Earnings per share (EPS) –  
Continuing operations
EPS (before non-trading items) increased 113.8% to 
46.4 pence (2009: 21.7 pence), reflecting the benefit of 
the corporation tax settlement. EPS (including the impact 
of non-trading items) was 41.5 pence (2009: 19.5 pence).  
Fully diluted EPS (including the impact of non-trading items) 
was 41.4 pence (2009: 19.4 pence) after adjustment for 
outstanding share options.
EPS (before non-trading items and excluding the benefit  
of the corporation tax settlement) decreased 28.1% to  
15.6 pence (2009: 21.7 pence), reflecting the increased 
underlying corporation tax rate and higher weighted 
average number of shares. 
Earnings per share (EPS) – Group
EPS (before non-trading items) increased 123.6% to 
45.4 pence (2009: 20.3 pence), reflecting the benefit of 
the corporation tax settlement. EPS (including the impact 
of non-trading items) was 38.5 pence (2009: 9.9 pence).  
Fully diluted EPS (including the impact of non-trading items) 
was 38.4 pence (2009: 9.9 pence) after adjustment for 
outstanding share options.
EPS (before non-trading items and excluding the benefit  
of the corporation tax settlement) decreased 27.6% to  
14.7 pence (2009: 20.3 pence), reflecting the increased 
underlying corporation tax rate and higher weighted 
average number of shares. 
Cash ﬂow, capital expenditure  
and borrowings
Cash generated by operations was £272.9 million. After net 
finance costs of £35.6 million, income taxes received of 
£51.9 million and £48.8 million on capital expenditure and 
intangible asset additions, cash inflow was £240.4 million.
At 31 December 2010, gross borrowings of £509.9 million 
less cash and short term deposits of £17.9 million have 
resulted in a net debt of £492.0 million.
Reconciliation of gross win to revenue
The Group reports the gains and losses on all betting and 
gaming activities as revenue in accordance with IAS 39, 
which is measured at the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable from customers less fair value 
adjustment for free bets, promotions and bonuses. Gross 
win includes free bets, promotions and bonuses, as well as 
VAT payable on machine income.

Risks and how we 
manage them
Risk governance 
and responsibilities
  The key risks are assessed 
by the Risk Committee using  
a bespoke risk methodology  
and reviewed by the  
Operations Board
  At each Board meeting any 
changes to key risks are 
identified and all key risks are 
reviewed formally by the Board 
twice yearly
  The risk management processes 
are reviewed by the Audit 
Committee annually
  Risk management forms an 
integral part of the Group’s 
internal control, planning and 
approval process
Risk management 
process
  The Risk Committee considers 
the following impact areas in 
assessing risks:
 – Legal and regulatory
 – Betting and gaming compliance
 –  Financial management  
and bookmaking
 – Reputation
 – Technology
 – Data integrity and fraud protection
 – Customers
 – Employees
  For each risk identified within 
these impact areas the likelihood, 
consequence, mitigating controls  
and actions, risk owner and  
forecast residual risk are identified 
by the Risk Committee
  The overall risk level is quantified 
and assessed to ensure that the 
appropriate mitigation measures 
and future actions have  
been identified
  The Board has overall 
responsibility for risk 
management as an integral  
part of strategic planning
  The Operations Board (made 
up of executive directors and 
senior executives) makes 
recommendations on the overall 
approach to risk management 
and identifies the key risks.  
The Operations Board is 
assisted by a Risk Committee 
made up of Group and divisional

Strategy 
Achieving the strategy outlined in the Chief Executive’s 
review will deliver long-term growth for the benefit of all 
stakeholders whilst minimising some of the key risks that 
Ladbrokes faces. Failure to achieve the strategy has the 
potential to affect the business and its performance.  
How strategy is established and the associated risks are 
managed are described in Corporate governance. 
Principal risks and uncertainties
There are general business risks faced by Ladbrokes that 
are comparable to those faced by most other businesses.  
In addition, there are more specific risks which are either 
unique to Ladbrokes or apply to the industry it operates in. 
The risks outlined here are those principal risks and 
uncertainties that are material to the Group. They do not 
include all those associated with Group activities and are 
not set out in any order of priority. 
General business risks include:
  Marketplace – changes in the economic environment, 
changes in consumer leisure spend.
  Financial – availability of debt financing and costs 
of borrowing, taxation, pension fund liability. 
  Operational – recruitment and retention 
of key talent, execution of international expansion. Business review

Annual Report and Accounts 2010

Speciﬁc risks that are material to Ladbrokes are:
 Risks Mitigation
Marketplace
Competition  
Ladbrokes faces competition primarily from other land-based 
bookmakers, online betting exchanges and other online gambling 
operators. In particular, the online gambling market is 
characterised by intense and substantial competition and by 
relatively low barriers to entry for new participants. In addition, 
Ladbrokes faces competition from market participants who 
benefit from greater liquidity as a result of accepting bets and 
wagers from jurisdictions in which Ladbrokes does not operate 
(because of legal reasons or otherwise).
   
Ladbrokes’ performance and competitive position are 
continuously monitored and, where appropriate, changes are 
instituted, including in relation to marketing, product development, 
yield management, cost control and investment. Acquisition 
opportunities, with a view to taking advantage of market 
consolidation, are continuously evaluated.
Betting and gaming industry
Taxes, laws, regulations and licensing  
Regulatory, legislative and fiscal regimes for betting and gaming 
in key markets around the world can change, sometimes at short 
notice. Such changes could benefit or have an adverse effect on 
Ladbrokes and additional costs might be incurred in order to 
comply with any new laws or regulations. 
   
Regulatory, legislative and fiscal developments in key markets are 
monitored closely (see page 21 for further details), allowing 
Ladbrokes to assess and adapt quickly to changes in the 
environment and minimise risks to the business. Ladbrokes 
engages with its regulators and the relevant trade organisations 
with regard to the betting and gaming regulatory framework and 
other issues of shared concern, such as problem gambling. 
Increased cost of product 
Ladbrokes is subject to certain financing arrangements intended 
to support industries from which it profits. Examples are the 
horseracing and the voluntary greyhound racing levies which 
respectively support the British horseracing and greyhound 
industries. In addition, Ladbrokes enters into contracts for the 
distribution of television pictures, audio and other data that are 
broadcast into Ladbrokes’ betting shops. 
  
Ladbrokes engages with the relevant trade associations and the 
principal bodies of sport and event industries with regard to  
sports rights payments, including the statutory horseracing levy, 
animal welfare and other issues.
Operational and bookmaking
Bookmaking   
Ladbrokes may experience significant losses as a result  
of a failure to determine accurately the odds in relation 
to any particular event and/or any failure of its risk  
management processes.
  
Ladbrokes’ core expertise is risk management and it has 
developed the skills and systems to be able to offer a wide range 
of betting opportunities and accept large bets. There is in place a 
highly experienced trading team and risks are spread across a 
wide range of events. A bookmaker’s odds are determined so as 
to provide an average return to the bookmaker over a large 
number of events and therefore, over the long-term, Ladbrokes’ 
gross win percentage has remained fairly constant. 
Sporting schedules and cancellations  
There are certain high profile sporting events which attract 
significant betting activity e.g. the Grand National and the FIFA 
Football World Cup. Cancellation or curtailment of such events, 
for example due to adverse weather conditions, or the failure of 
certain sporting teams to qualify for sporting events, can 
adversely impact Ladbrokes’ results. 
In addition to gaming machines, Ladbrokes has a number  
of alternative products to fill gaps in the schedules including  
virtual horseracing.
High ﬁxed cost base  
Ladbrokes has a relatively high fixed cost base as a proportion  
of its total costs, consisting primarily of employee and rental 
costs associated with its betting shop estate. This means that 
falls in revenue could have a significantly adverse effect on 
Ladbrokes’ profitability unless the Group reduces its costs 
substantially in the short to medium term.
 
Business re-engineering initiatives have been implemented to 
reduce the cost base. Structural contingency plans have been  
put in place and where possible central facilities have been  
co-located. The future strategy to increase online revenues will 
limit the dominance of the fixed costs. Ladbrokes plc

Risks and how  
we manage them
continued
Operational and bookmaking
Loss of key locations  
Ladbrokes has a number of key sites, in particular Imperial House 
at Rayners Lane in London, its head office and main operations 
centre, and its premises in Europort in Gibraltar from where the 
online gaming operations are based. 
   
Existing business continuity plans and arrangements for offsite 
data storage, alternate system availability and remote working for 
key operational and senior management are currently under review 
as part of an ongoing process.
Information technology and communications 
Technology changes   
The market for online gambling products and services is 
characterised by technological developments, new product and 
service introductions and evolving industry standards. Failure by 
Ladbrokes to use leading technologies effectively, develop its 
technological expertise, enhance its products and services and 
improve the performance, features and reliability of its technology 
and advanced information systems, could have a material 
adverse effect on its competitive position.
  
Ladbrokes has committed considerable resources into  
upgrading its existing technology, IT infrastructure,  
communication systems and application systems, as well as 
developing and acquiring new platforms. Rigorous testing  
regimes are utilised to ensure a continued high quality of  
product offerings and services are maintained. 
Technology failure  
Ladbrokes’ operations are highly dependent on technology and 
advanced information systems and there is a risk that such 
technology or systems could fail. In particular, any damage to,  
or failure of online systems and servers, electronic point of sale 
systems and electronic display systems could result in 
interruptions to financial controls and customer service systems. 
Ladbrokes has a level of resilience in place which seeks to 
eliminate single points of failure within key technology locations.
Data disclosure  
Ladbrokes processes sensitive personal customer data (including 
name, address, age, bank details and betting and gaming history) 
as part of its business and therefore must comply with strict data 
protection and privacy laws in all jurisdictions in which the Group 
operates. Ladbrokes is exposed to the risk that this data could be 
wrongfully appropriated, lost or disclosed, or processed in 
breach of data protection regulation. This could also result in 
prosecutions and the loss of the goodwill of its customers and 
deter new customers.
 
Advanced security systems are deployed to protect transactional 
data. Sophisticated hardware and security mechanisms are used 
to ensure all sensitive and confidential data is fully encrypted.  
To provide fail-safe integrity of all data, a series of storage systems 
are used to replicate all data processed by online services. In 
respect of fraud protection, an extensive programme of data 
monitoring is in place with both prevention and detection  
audit controls.
Failure in the supply chain 
Ladbrokes is dependent on a number of third parties for the 
operation of its business. The withdrawal or removal from the 
market of one or more of these major third party suppliers, or 
failure of third party suppliers to comply with contractual 
obligations could adversely affect our operations. 
 
Infrastructure suppliers, network and telecommunication suppliers 
and application service providers are long-term partners in 
providing an infrastructure which seeks to ensure the delivery of 
sophisticated and high performance transaction processing 
systems. There is continual communication with these suppliers 
and providers at an operating level and service level agreements 
have been established to maintain high service levels. The ongoing 
review of business continuity plans will include key supplier 
alternatives and the future strategy is to bring more of the value 
chain in-house.

Fair Play – Corporate  
 responsibility at Ladbrokes
are trained to support this commitment. To check our 
performance, we continually seek the views of our 
customers and encourage feedback on our employees 
and services. Our performance is also checked through  
third-party audits (e.g. mystery shopper surveys) and by 
monitoring customer complaints. During 2010 our mystery 
shopper scores averaged 90% customer satisfaction. 
Furthermore, our customer loyalty card – OddsOn! – 
continues to grow with 250,000 new customers signing 
up in 2010 and a total of 1.1 million customers altogether. 
Through OddsOn! we have given back to our customers 
over 3.4 million free bets, with 1.1 million of those in 2010.
Ensuring responsible gambling
We continue to meet the regulatory requirements in all 
countries where we are licensed to operate, including those 
of the UK Gambling Commission, the Gibraltar Regulatory 
Authority, the governments of the Republic of Ireland and 
Northern Ireland, the Belgium Gaming Commission and the 
regional governments in Spain. Furthermore, we continue to 
support the UK Gambling Commission’s three key licensing 
objectives to:
 keep crime out of gambling;
 ensure gambling is conducted fairly and openly; and
  protect children and vulnerable people from being 
harmed or exploited by gambling.
All relevant personnel are trained to meet our high 
standards and our performance is monitored on a continual 
basis by our Compliance Director and the supporting 
Compliance Committee. 
Ladbrokes continues to work with its peers and national 
governments to improve responsible gambling behaviour 
across the industry. For many years we have supported the 
Association of British Bookmakers (ABB) and the Remote 
Gambling Association (RGA) in establishing industry-wide 
CR standards and promoting self-regulation. 
We ensure that our customers are well informed about our 
products, about problem gambling issues and for our online 
customers, about their own gambling history. 
We provide inherent protection to try to limit the possible 
financial impacts on our customers from excessive 
gambling e.g. daily and weekly deposit limits and 
appropriate customer due diligence.
We protect the young and the vulnerable through clear 
marketing standards, strict age limits, online age verification 
checks and self-exclusion arrangements.
For most people, gambling is an enjoyable and harmless 
leisure pursuit. However, for a small number of people 
gambling can become a behavioural problem. Ladbrokes 
has a responsibility to help tackle problem gambling, 
understand its causes and promote its treatment. We make 
our employees aware of the symptoms of problem gambling 
and train them in how to respond.
Ladbrokes was a founding member of the GREaT 
Foundation, formerly known as the Responsibility in 
Gambling Trust (RIGT). Through our membership of GREaT, 
we support GamCare and the Gordon Moody Association 
(formerly Gordon House). A key role for GREaT is to develop a 
national public education and awareness strategy, as part of 
the overall prevention of problem gambling agenda. The 
gambleaware website continues to perform well and the logo 
or website address www.gambleaware.co.uk is carried on all 
our websites and advertising.
Supporting our business with a strong 
workforce
During 2010, a new human resources People Plan has been 
developed to meet the needs of our changing business. 
Our Corporate Responsibility (CR) programmes are in 
line with our broader business strategy. We embed CR 
principles into our day to day operations, maintaining high 
ethical and socially responsible standards and remaining 
compliant with all relevant CR legislation.
The 7 pillars of our CR strategy represent the key CR issues 
for our business:
1.  keeping our customers satisfied, well informed and 
interested in the products and services we offer;
2.  promoting responsible gambling behaviours across our 
business and the industry as a whole;
3.  attracting a diverse workforce and sustaining high levels 
of competence, motivation and loyalty to the business;
4.  minimising the risks from our third-party relationships – 
business partnerships, joint ventures or within our  
supply chain;
5.  minimising health, safety and security risks to our 
business, our employees and the general public from  
our operations;
6.  understanding global environmental agendas and 
minimising the impact of increasing environmental costs 
on our operations; and
7.  being a good corporate citizen and a respected 
neighbour in our communities.
We monitor our performance through appropriate key 
performance indicators (KPIs) reflecting each pillar of our 
CR strategy. Our progress has been good and remains 
aligned to our strategic aims.
Putting customers at the heart of our business
We are keen to drive brand loyalty and all that the brand 
stands for, including trust and integrity. It is important to 
provide our customers with an enjoyable, efficient, secure, 
fair and socially responsible service and all our employees 
We are committed to 
being a leader of our sector 
in responsible business 
practice. Maintaining a 
reputation for fairness 
and integrity, strengthening 
our customer focus and 
achieving high levels of 
employee satisfaction are all 
vital to growing our business. Ladbrokes plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2010
28
Our development and reward programmes are designed 
to support our business objectives and pay dividends for 
enhanced performance. As our business becomes more 
sophisticated, we need to ensure that we sustain a high 
level of competence across the business and increase our 
capacity to respond to changing market needs. To meet this 
need we have restructured our business management and 
made some key appointments at senior levels. 
We aim to be a modern, attractive and fair employer and 
to value and recognise employee loyalty. We provide clear 
opportunities for employee development and progression, 
all of which helps to maintain high levels of employee 
satisfaction and minimise turnover. 
Our incentive schemes and benefits programmes are 
proving to be best in class initiatives, having been 
shortlisted again for a number of prestigious awards. 
A rolling programme of employee engagement 
consultations is underway to provide robust information on 
the issues that matter most to our workforce. The results of 
these consultations, which include an annual engagement 
survey, will provide managers with data upon which they 
can build action plans for improvement. 
Minimising risks in our supply chain
We assess the social, ethical and environmental risks 
associated with our business partnerships, joint ventures and 
product sourcing. This work is ongoing and by the end of 2010 
over 1,085 suppliers have now signed up to our Environmental, 
Socially Responsible and Ethical Purchasing Policy through 
our central procurement process.
Providing a safe environment for our 
employees and customers
We aim for best practice health, safety and security 
standards throughout all our operations and we support a 
proactive culture of risk management. We also monitor and 
seek to minimise the financial impacts of health and safety 
related claims from across our business.
One of the important risks to the health of our employees 
and our customers comes from breaches of security on our 
premises, such as robbery and theft. We have invested 
heavily in CCTV which is installed across all of our UK retail 
estate, both to help reduce the number of incidents and to 
help protect employees and customers.
During 2010 we worked with the Safe Bet Alliance to 
develop and issue a Voluntary Code of Safety & Security 
for Bookmakers. The Safe Bet Alliance is a collaborative 
initiative which includes ABB, Metropolitan Police, Local 
Authorities Coordinators of Regulatory Services (LACORS) 
and Community Union. The Code sets out a single national 
standard for betting shop safety and security.
Ladbrokes is the only bookmaker to have developed a 
Primary Authority relationship in the UK under the new 
scheme for better regulation. Liverpool City Council now 
acts as a single point of contact – a Primary Authority – for 
all health and safety issues affecting Ladbrokes shops all 
over the UK. 
Our health and safety record in 2010 was good. We had no 
reportable fatalities or major injuries across our business 
and, following 180 health and safety inspector visits in the 
UK alone, there were no enforcement notices or 
prosecutions for health and safety offences.
Providing a greener future
We seek to minimise the impact of increasing environmental 
costs on our operations and have set up a green task force 
to help us achieve this aim, with representatives from 
across the business.
We have identified and implemented a number of energy 
efficiency initiatives during 2010 in support of our aim to 
reduce our UK carbon footprint by 21% by 2013 compared 
with 2008 usage. This is equivalent to a saving of more than 
11,000 tonnes of CO
2 per year. The majority of this saving 
will be made in the retail estate. All of our shop linear 
fluorescent lighting has been upgraded to incorporate high 
frequency technology, which has reduced our total energy 
spend by 8% in 2010. We have also developed a new shop-
fitting specification incorporating many of the new carbon 
reduction technologies. As a result our new shops are 30% 
more efficient. So we are making steady progress. 
We have also been working hard to green our UK car fleet by 
offering qualifying lower emission cars. Our car fleet now has 
an average emission figure of 141g of CO
2 per km, nearly 20g 
per km less than the average for new cars in the UK.
Contributing to society and being a good 
corporate citizen
We contribute positively to the societies in which we 
operate, through employment, payment of taxes, 
contributions to growth in the economy and supporting 
industries and by supporting our local communities. 
We recognise the links our employees have to their own 
communities and through Ladbrokes in the Community 
Charitable Trust (LICCT) we support their activities by giving 
something back. LICCT has raised over £5.7 million for 
good causes since it was established in 2003. The funds 
have been raised by employees all around the UK and 
Ireland. During 2010 LICCT donated over £750,000 to 
charitable and community causes across the UK.
In addition, Ladbrokes has donated over £945,000  
to community safety, citizenship and problem  
gambling charities. 
A leader in our sector
During 2010 our high standards of CR were recognised by 
many index and award bodies. For the fourth time we have 
been listed as one of Britain’s Most Admired Companies and  
in October, we were Highly Commended at the pwc Building 
Public Trust Awards (BPTA). The BPTA for Sustainability 
Reporting recognises the greatest depth and relevance of 
sustainability reporting in the FTSE 250. For the eighth year 
in succession we were pronounced one of the leaders in our 
sector in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes (DJSI) and 
were included in the FTSE4Good Indices.
Managing our issues
The Chief Executive is ultimately responsible for CR 
matters. The Chief Executive is supported by the CR  
Team who provides an overview and advisory function  
for the business.
Overall governance of CR is the responsibility of the Board. 
CR and governance issues are given full consideration by 
the Board when defining Group strategy.
CR risks are regularly reviewed by the business and are 
considered by the Board, as appropriate, as a part of the 
corporate risk review process (see page 24). CR matters are 
reported to the Board on a regular basis (as a minimum 
quarterly) thus forming part of the Board calendar,  
along with tailored director briefings and, where 
appropriate, training.
The Board reviews the key CR issues and agrees the annual 
CR strategy. Board members are provided with adequate 
background information to support their decision making. 
The Remuneration Committee also takes account of CR 
issues when determining executive remuneration  
and benefits. 
CR governance and management processes are subject  
to internal audit and the reporting process is externally 
reviewed by our CR advisors, Acona Limited. Business review

Governance
The Board has a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved 
for its decision and approval. These include the approval of the 
strategic and annual profit plans, key public information releases 
(e.g. financial statements), dividends, major acquisitions and 
disposals, material contracts, treasury and other Group policies. 
The section “Internal control and risk management systems”  
on pages 34 and 35 contains further information on how the  
Board operates.
The Company seeks to ensure that the Board is supplied with 
appropriate and timely information to enable it to discharge its 
duties. The Board requests additional information or variations 
to regular reporting as it requires. A procedure exists for directors 
to seek independent professional advice in the furtherance of their 
duties, if necessary. All directors have access to the advice and 
services of the Company Secretary.
All directors receive an induction on joining the Board.  
A combination of tailored Board and committee agenda items 
and other Board activities, including briefing sessions, assist the 
directors in continually updating their skills and the knowledge 
and familiarity with the Company required to fulfil their role both 
on the Board and on Board committees. In addition, external 
seminars, workshops and presentations are made available to 
directors. The Company provides the necessary resources for 
developing and updating directors’ knowledge and capabilities.
The Board undertakes a formal annual evaluation process of 
its own performance and that of its committees and individual 
directors which in 2010 was externally facilitated by Lintstock.
Questionnaires tailored to the specific circumstances of the 
Company were completed by each director on the Chairman, 
in relation to their own performance and on the effectiveness 
of the Board and its committees.
The Chairman conducts an appraisal of each director. The Senior 
Independent Director, having consulted with each of the other 
directors, conducts an appraisal interview with the Chairman. 
In 2010 a detailed report on the effectiveness of the Board and 
its committees was produced by Lintstock and the results of which 
were considered by the Board and the individual committees and 
actions arising were agreed. The following themes were addressed: 
board composition, expertise and dynamics; board support, time 
management and board committees; strategic, operational and risk 
oversight; succession planning and human resources management; 
and priorities for change. 
Whilst all directors are expected to bring an independent 
judgement to bear on issues of strategy, performance, resources 
(including key appointments) and standards of conduct, the 
independent non-executive directors were selected and appointed 
for this purpose.
The Company Secretary is responsible for advising the Board 
through the Chairman on all governance matters.
Appointment and replacement of directors
A person who is willing to act as a director, and is permitted by 
law to do so, may be appointed as a director of the Company by 
shareholders in general meeting by ordinary resolution (requiring 
a simple majority of the persons voting on the relevant resolution) 
or by a decision of the directors. No person, other than a director 
retiring at that general meeting, shall be appointed or re-appointed 
a director at any general meeting unless he or she is recommended 
by the directors or, not less than seven clear days before the date 
appointed for the meeting, notice executed by that person of his or 
her willingness to be appointed or re-appointed is lodged at the 
Company’s registered office.
The Board continues to be committed to high standards of corporate 
governance. The Board strives to provide the right leadership, 
strategic oversight and control environment to produce and sustain 
delivery of value to all of the Company’s shareholders. The Board 
applies integrity, principles of good corporate governance and 
accountability throughout its activities and each director brings 
independence of character and judgement to the role. All of the 
members of the Board are individually and collectively aware of 
their responsibilities to the Company’s stakeholders.
The following describes the Board’s approach to corporate 
governance and how the Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance and the UK Corporate Governance Code have 
been applied.
Compliance statement
In 2010 the Company was subject to and complied with all of the 
provisions set out in section 1 of the Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance published in June 2008, apart from section 1 A.3.3. 
and C.3.1. during the period from 15 May 2010 to 1 September 
2010 when, respectively, there was no Senior Independent Director 
and the Audit Committee consisted of only two non-executive 
directors. This was following the resignations of N M H Jones 
and H E Staunton and prior to the appointment of a replacement 
independent non-executive director, the recruitment process for 
whom commenced in February 2010 and concluded with the 
appointment of J M Kelly in September 2010. 
As at 31 December 2010 the Company complied with the 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code published 
in June 2010. 
Both Codes are published by the Financial Reporting Council 
and are available on its website www.frc.org.uk.
Board
The Board currently comprises the non-executive Chairman, three 
executive directors and six independent non-executive directors. 
The Chairman has a primary responsibility for the running of the 
Board and for relations with shareholders. The Chief Executive is 
responsible for the operations and for the development of strategic 
plans and initiatives for consideration by the Board. The division 
of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Chief Executive 
has been clearly established, set out in writing and agreed by the 
Board. During 2010 the division of responsibilities was reviewed 
and restated. J M Kelly acts as Senior Independent Director, 
whose role is to provide a sounding board to the Chairman and to 
serve as an intermediary for the other directors when necessary. 
Other roles and responsibilities of the Senior Independent Director 
are described elsewhere.
The other significant commitments of the Chairman during 2010 
are detailed in his biography on page 31. There were no changes 
to those commitments during 2010.
The Board schedules eight meetings each year, but arranges to 
meet at other times as appropriate. Of the ten meetings held in 
2010, C J Rodrigues and C P Wicks were both unable to attend 
one scheduled meeting due to other business commitments, 
D M Shapland was unable to attend one scheduled meeting due 
to illness and both C Bell and J P O’Reilly did not attend two 
scheduled meetings following the Company’s announcements 
that they were to step down as directors of the Company.
In addition, the Chairman met during the year with the  
non-executive directors without the executive directors present.
Corporate  
governance Governance
Ladbrokes plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2010

The articles of association of the Company provide that:
  at every Annual General Meeting any director who has been 
appointed as a director by the directors since the last Annual 
General Meeting, or who was not appointed or re-appointed as 
a director at one of the preceding two Annual General Meetings, 
must retire from office (notwithstanding any agreement the 
director may have with the Company) and that any director 
so retiring may offer himself or herself for appointment or  
re-appointment as a director by the members at the meeting;
  any director may retire from office at any general meeting and 
that any director so retiring may offer himself or herself for 
appointment or re-appointment as a director by the members 
at the meeting; and
  if a director retires from office at any general meeting, the director 
shall retain office until the end of the meeting (irrespective of 
the outcome of any resolution that the director be appointed or 
re-appointed as a director put to the members at the meeting).
The UK Corporate Governance Code specifies that all directors 
of FTSE 350 companies should be subject to annual election 
by shareholders. The Company is a FTSE 350 company and 
all directors will be subject to election or re-election at the 2011 
Annual General Meeting.
The independent non-executive directors understand that the 
Board will not automatically recommend their re-election by 
shareholders. The Chairman and the independent non-executive 
directors are appointed for a specified term of approximately three 
years, subject to re-election. 
The Companies Act 2006 allows shareholders in general meeting 
by ordinary resolution (requiring a simple majority of the persons 
voting on the relevant resolution) to remove any director before 
the expiration of his or her period of office, but without prejudice 
to any claim for damages which the director may have for breach 
of any contract of service between him or her and the Company.
A person also ceases to be a director if he or she notifies the 
Company of his or her resignation, ceases to be a director by 
virtue of any provision of the Companies Act 2006, becomes 
prohibited by law from being a director, has a bankruptcy order 
against him or her or is the subject of a relevant insolvency 
procedure, or if a medical practitioner gives a written opinion 
stating the director has become physically or mentally incapable 
of acting as a director and may remain so for more than three 
months, or is removed from office by notice signed by all the other 
directors sent to the director, or if the Board so decides following 
at least six months’ consecutive absence without permission or he 
or she becomes subject to relevant procedures under the mental 
health laws.
Powers of the Company’s directors
Subject to the articles, the directors are responsible for the 
management of the Company’s business, for which purpose they 
may exercise all the powers of the Company. The shareholders 
may, by special resolution, direct the directors to take, or refrain 
from taking, specified action. The directors’ exercise of the powers 
of the Company to borrow money is restricted. The directors have 
power to issue new shares and to purchase the Company’s own 
shares, in each case to the extent permitted by law or as allowed 
by shareholder resolution (resolutions to issue and purchase 
shares are regularly proposed at the Company’s Annual 
General Meetings).
Board committees
The Board has four standing committees, all of which have written 
terms of reference clearly setting out their authority and duties. 
The terms of reference of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration 
Committees, which are reviewed annually, can be viewed on the 
Company’s website (www.ladbrokesplc.com). The Operations 
Board, the Risk Committee and the Compliance Committee 
referred to elsewhere are not formal Board committees.

H E Staunton and N M H Jones resigned from the Committee on 
14 May 2010. D M Shapland was appointed as Chairman on 
14 May 2010.
All members of the Committee are independent non-executive 
directors. Appointments to the Committee are made by the Board 
at the recommendation of the Nomination Committee, which 
consults with the Chairman of the Audit Committee.
The Board has satisfied itself that the members of the Committee 
have recent and relevant financial experience.
The Committee is provided with sufficient resources to undertake 
its duties. It has access to the services of the Company Secretary 
(who acts as secretary to the Committee) and all other employees. 
The Committee is able to take independent legal or professional 
advice when it believes it necessary to do so. 
The Committee meets as required, but not less than three times a 
year. Four meetings were held in 2010. Between 15 May 2010 and 
1 September 2010 there were only two members in the Committee 
and the Committee’s terms of reference were amended 
accordingly. One meeting was held during this period with full 
attendance. D M Shapland was unable to attend a second meeting 
during this period due to illness and on this occasion J F Jarvis 
and C J Rodrigues were appointed temporary additional members 
of the Committee. There was full attendance at the other two 
meetings held in 2010.
Although other directors, including the Group Finance Director, 
attend Audit Committee meetings, the Committee also meets for 
private discussions with the external auditor, who attends all of its 
meetings, and can do so with the internal auditor.
The Committee is the body which carries out the functions 
required by DTR 7.1.3. The main role and responsibilities of the 
Committee in 2010 were to:
  monitor the integrity of the financial statements of the Company;
  review the Company’s internal financial control and risk 
management systems;
  monitor and review the effectiveness of the Company’s internal 
audit function; and
  oversee the Company’s relationship with the external auditor 
including the recommendation to the Board of its appointment 
and remuneration.
Should the Committee’s monitoring and review activities reveal 
any material cause for concern or scope for improvement, it will 
make recommendations to the Board on action needed to address 
the issue or make improvements. Ladbrokes plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2010

The Committee meets as required but not less than twice a year. 
Four meetings of the Committee were held in 2010. There was full 
attendance at these meetings.
The main role and responsibilities of the Committee are to:
  review the structure, size and composition of the Board 
(which includes an objective and comprehensive evaluation of 
the balance of skills, knowledge and experience of the Board) 
and make recommendations to the Board with regard to any 
changes;
  consider succession planning for the directors and other senior 
executives and make recommendations to the Board;
  identify and nominate for the approval of the Board candidates 
to fill Board vacancies as and when they arise;
  review the leadership of the Company to ensure the 
continued ability of the Company to compete effectively  
in the marketplace;
  recommend candidates for the role of Senior Independent 
Director and for membership of the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees, in consultation with the Chairmen of those 
Committees; and
  make recommendations to the Board concerning the 
re-appointment of non-executive directors at the end of their 
specified term of office and the re-election by shareholders 
of any director under the retirement by rotation provisions 
or otherwise.
The Committee performed the above activities as necessary  
in 2010.
R I Glynn was appointed as an executive director and as Chief 
Executive with effect from 22 April 2010. J M Kelly was appointed as 
a non-executive director and Senior Independent Director with effect 
from 1 September 2010. Descriptions of the roles and capabilities 
required were prepared and suitable candidates were identified by 
external advisers. In the case of J M Kelly’s appointment, this was 
following a review of the structure, size and composition (including 
skills, knowledge and experience) of the Board.
Remuneration Committee
Details of the Remuneration Committee, including membership,  
are set out in the Directors’ remuneration report, which should 
be read in conjunction with this section.
Internal control and risk management systems
The Board has ultimate responsibility for the internal control and 
risk management systems operating throughout the Group and 
for reviewing their effectiveness. No such systems can provide 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. The 
Group’s systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and to provide 
the Board with reasonable assurance that potential problems will 
normally be prevented or will be detected in a timely manner for 
appropriate action.
The Company had procedures in place throughout the year and 
up to 17 February 2011, the date of approval of this Annual Report, 
which accord with the Internal Control Guidance for Directors on 
the Combined Code published in September 1999.
The Board has delegated the detailed design of the systems of 
internal control and risk management to the executive directors.
The main activities of the Committee in 2010 were as follows:
  with the assistance of reports received from management 
and the external auditor, the critical review of the significant 
financial reporting issues in connection with the preparation 
of the Company’s financial and related formal statements;
  assessing the scope and effectiveness of the systems 
established to identify, assess, manage and monitor financial 
and non-financial risks; 
  monitoring the integrity of the Company’s internal financial 
controls. The Committee does so by reference to:
  (a) summaries of business risks and mitigating controls;
  (b)  regular reports and presentations from the heads of 
keyrisk functions, internal audit and external audit; and
  (c)  the results of the system of annual self-certification  
of compliance with key controls and procedures;
  monitoring and reviewing the plans, work and effectiveness of 
the internal audit function, including any actions taken following 
any significant failures in internal controls;
  reviewing, with the external auditor, its terms of engagement,

reviewing its effectiveness; and
  reviewing the independence and objectivity of the 
external auditor.
The external auditor reports to the Committee on the actions 
taken to comply with professional and regulatory requirements 
and with best practice designed to ensure its independence. The 
Committee has agreed a policy on the engagement of the external 
auditor to supply non-audit services, the application of which it 
monitors. The policy, which can be viewed on the Company’s 
website (www.ladbrokesplc.com), specifies services that may 
not be provided and contains a level of cost at which Committee 
approval is required enabling the Committee to satisfy itself that 
auditor objectivity and independence are safeguarded.
Finance Committee
This Committee meets as required to deal with all routine business 
that excludes matters that are specifically reserved to the Board 
or to another committee and specific matters delegated to it by 
the Board requiring attention between scheduled Board meetings.

Annual Report and Accounts 2010

The framework and key procedures during 2010 in relation to the 
financial reporting process were as follows:
  the Group operates through two principal divisions, Retail and 
Digital. Responsibilities for managing business risks arising 
were defined by the Board;
  the executive directors met regularly together and with other 
senior executives (the Operations Board) to consider Group 
strategy, financial performance, business development and 
Group management issues. In addition, there are monthly 
financial and operational review meetings together with an 
annual programme of plans/reforecasting and strategy reviews 
attended by the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director 
together with other executives as appropriate. Divisional 
management comprised executives with appropriate functional 
responsibilities. Divisional management met regularly to manage 
their respective businesses;
  the Board established corporate strategy and Group business 
objectives. Divisional management integrated such objectives 
into business strategies for presentation to the Board with 
supporting financial objectives;
  there was an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the risks faced by the Group. Key risks and their 
financial implications were appraised by the Operations Board 
which was assisted by a committee of Group and divisional 
executives (the Risk Committee). This was an integral part of the 
strategic planning process. The appropriateness of controls was 
considered, having regard to cost/benefit, materiality and the 
likelihood of risks crystallising. Key risks and actions to mitigate 
those risks were considered at each regular Board meeting and 
were formally reviewed and approved by the Board twice yearly. 
Each key risk was assigned Operations Board member 
ownership;
  divisional budgets, containing financial and operating targets, 
capital expenditure proposals and performance indicators, were 
reviewed by the executive directors and supported divisional 
business strategies. The Group profit plan was approved by 
the Board;
  reports on financial and non-financial performances were 
regularly provided to directors and discussed at Board 
meetings. Performance against both budgets and objectives 
together with management of business risks, were reviewed 
with divisional management, as were forecasts and material 
sensitivities. The Board regularly received reports from key 
executives and functional heads covering areas such as 
operations, forecasts, business development, strategic 
planning, human resources, legal and corporate matters, 
compliance, health and safety and corporate responsibility;
  there was a Group-wide policy governing appraisal and 
approval of investment expenditure and asset disposals. Major 
projects were reported on at each regular Board meeting. Post 
investment audits were undertaken on a systematic basis and 
were formally reviewed by the Board twice yearly;
  key policies and control procedures (including treasury, 
compliance and information system controls) are documented in 
manuals having Group-wide application. Operating companies 
also used procedure manuals that integrated with Group controls;
  a system of annual self-certification of compliance with key 
controls and procedures was operated throughout the Group;
  the Group had an internal audit function, outsourced to Deloitte 
LLP, which reported to management on the Group’s operations; 
and
  to underpin the effectiveness of controls, it was the Group’s 
policy to recruit and develop management and employees of 
high calibre, integrity and with appropriate disciplines. High 
standards of business ethics and compliance with laws, 
regulations and internal policies were demanded from 
employees at all levels.
The role of the Audit Committee in reviewing the effectiveness of 
the systems of internal control and risk management is explained 
in the Audit Committee section.
The Board also conducts an assessment of the effectiveness 
of the internal control and risk management systems. The 
assessment takes account of all significant aspects including: 
risk assessment; the control environment and control activities; 
information and communication; and monitoring.
Relations with shareholders
There is a regular programme of meetings with major institutional 
shareholders to consider the Group’s performance and prospects. 
In addition, presentations are made twice yearly after the 
announcement of results, the details of which, together with the 
Group’s financial reports and announcements, can be accessed 
via the Company’s website (www.ladbrokesplc.co.uk). The 
Chairman met in 2010 with several institutional investors and their 
representative bodies in addition to results presentations and the 
Annual General Meeting. Other directors are available to meet the 
Company’s major shareholders if requested.
The Senior Independent Director is available to shareholders if 
they have concerns, where contact through the usual channels of 
Chairman, Chief Executive and Group Finance Director has failed 
to solve, or for which such contact is inappropriate.
A report on investor relations, which includes updates on 
meetings with major institutional shareholders, is given at each 
Board meeting. The Company’s brokers also present to the 
Board annually. Principles of ownership, corporate governance 
and voting guidelines issued by the Company’s major institutional 
shareholders, their representative bodies and advisory organisations 
are circulated to, and considered by, the Board.
The Company corresponds regularly on a range of subjects with its 
individual shareholders who have an opportunity to question the 
Board at the Annual General Meeting. Further information on our 
relations with shareholders is contained in Shareholder information.
Rights attaching to the shares and restrictions  
on voting and transfer
The Company’s share capital consists of ordinary shares of 28
1
⁄3p 
each. Subject to any suspension or abrogation of rights pursuant 
to relevant law or the Company’s articles of association, the 
ordinary shares confer on their holders (other than the Company 
in respect of its treasury shares):
(a)  the right to receive out of profits available for distribution 
such dividends as may be agreed to be paid (in the case 
of a final dividend in an amount not exceeding the amount 
recommended by the Board as approved by shareholders 
in general meeting or in the case of an interim dividend in an 
amount determined by the Board). All dividends unclaimed 
for a period of 12 years after having become due for payment 
are forfeited automatically and cease to remain owing by the 
Company;
(b)  the right, on a return of assets on a liquidation, reduction 
of capital or otherwise, to share in the surplus assets of the 
Company remaining after payment of its liabilities pari passu 
with the other holders of ordinary shares; and Ladbrokes plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2010
36
in the Company’s articles of association, shareholders are subject 
to the compulsory acquisition provisions in sections 974 to 991 
of the Companies Act 2006 and can be required by the Company 
to transfer their shares following certain action by a gambling 
industry regulator (as more specifically set out in the Company’s 
articles of association).
Signiﬁcant agreements that take effect, alter or terminate 
upon a change of control following a takeover bid
The agreements between Ladbrokes Group Finance plc (“LGF”), 
a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and 14 separate 
banks for the provision by the banks of revolving credit facilities 
of up to £866 million on a committed basis provide that the banks 
may give notice of cancellation if a change of control occurs. On 
cancellation the amounts drawn would be immediately repayable. 
In the context of a takeover bid, the acquirer would normally 
arrange substitute facilities. In addition, LGF issued a bond in 
March 2010. The bond has a “Put Event” that allows bondholders 
to exercise a put option when a change of control occurs. The put 
option allows the bondholders to require LGF to purchase the 
bonds at a price of 101 pence.
The agreement between Ladbrokes International Limited (“LI”), 
a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and Prima Poker 
Limited (“PP”), pursuant to which PP granted to LI a non-exclusive 
licence to use an interactive gaming system and supplies various 
poker related services to LI, states that PP may give notice of 
termination if LI or any affiliate of LI is acquired by a competitor 
of PP. On termination (in these circumstances), LI must pay a 
termination fee (calculated by reference to the monthly fees 
otherwise payable to PP for the remainder of the term subject to 
a maximum of 24 months). The payment is effectively reduced 
by the 150 days’ notice required to be served by PP. 
The agreement between LI and Microgaming Systems Anstalt 
(“MGS”), pursuant to which MGS granted to LI a non-exclusive 
licence to use an interactive casino system and supplies various 
casino related services to LI, states that MGS may give notice 
of termination if LI or any affiliate of LI is acquired by a competitor 
of MGS. On termination (in these circumstances), LI must pay 
a termination fee (calculated by reference to the monthly fees 
otherwise payable to MGS for the remainder of the period up 
to 30 November 2011). The payment is effectively reduced by 
the 90 days’ notice required to be served by MGS. 
Amendment of the Company’s articles of association
The Company’s articles of association may be amended  
by the members of the Company by special resolution 
(requiring a majority of at least 75% of the persons voting 
on the relevant resolution).
(c)  the right to receive notice of and to attend and speak and vote 
in person or by proxy at any general meeting of the Company. 
On a show of hands every member present (or in the case of 
a corporation, represented) and voting has one vote and 
every proxy present who has been appointed by one or more 
members present has one vote (and a second vote where 
the proxy has been appointed by more than one member and 
has been instructed by one or more members to vote for the 
resolution and by one or more other members to vote against 
the resolution). On a poll every member present (or represented) 
in person or by proxy has one vote for every share of which that 
member is the holder. The appointment of a proxy must be 
received not less than 48 hours before the time of the holding 
of the relevant meeting or adjourned meeting or in the case of a 
poll taken otherwise than at or on the same day as the relevant 
meeting or adjourned meeting be received after the poll has 
been demanded and not less than 24 hours before the time 
appointed for the taking of the poll.
These rights can be suspended. If the member, or any other person 
appearing to be interested in shares held by that member, has failed 
to comply with a notice pursuant to section 793 of the Companies 
Act 2006 (notice by company requiring information about interests 
in its shares) the Company can suspend (until one week after the 
default ceases) the right to attend and speak and vote at a general 
meeting and if the shares represent at least 0.25% of their class 
the Company can withhold any dividend or other money payable 
in respect of the shares and refuse to accept certain transfers of the 
relevant shares. In addition, following certain action by a gambling 
industry regulator (as more specifically set out in the Company’s 
articles of association), the Company may suspend all or some of 
the rights attaching to all or some of the shares held by any relevant 
shareholder to attend and to speak at meetings and to vote, to 
receive any dividend or other money payable in respect of the 
shares, and to the issue of further shares or other securities in 
respect of the shares.
Shareholders, either alone or with other shareholders, have other 
rights as set out in the Company’s articles of association and in 
company law (principally the Companies Act 2006).
The Trustee of the Ladbrokes Share Ownership Trust, which is 
used in connection with certain of the Company’s employee share 
ownership plans, held 1,426,077 ordinary shares in the Company 
at 31 December 2010 which are not voted by plan members and 
which it can vote in its absolute discretion.
A member may choose whether his or her shares are evidenced 
by share certificates (certificated shares) or held in electronic 
(uncertificated) form in CREST (the UK electronic settlement 
system). Any member may transfer all or any of his or her shares 
subject in the case of certificated shares to the rules set out in the 
Company’s articles of association or in the case of uncertificated 
shares the regulations governing the operation of CREST (which 
allow the directors to refuse to register a transfer as therein set 
out); the transferor remains the holder of the shares until the 
name of the transferee is entered in the register of members. 
The directors may refuse to register a transfer of certificated 
shares in favour of more than four persons jointly or where there 
is no adequate evidence of ownership or the transfer is not duly 
stamped (if so required). The directors may also refuse to register 
a share transfer if it is in respect of a certificated share which is not 
fully paid up or on which the Company has a lien provided that, 
where the share transfer is in respect of any share admitted to the 
Official List maintained by the UK Listing Authority, any such 
discretion may not be exercised so as to prevent dealings taking 
place on an open and proper basis, or if in the opinion of the 
directors (and with the concurrence of the UK Listing Authority) 
exceptional circumstances so warrant provided that the exercise 
of such power will not disturb the market in those shares. Whilst 
there are no squeeze-out and sell out rules relating to the shares

did the practices described on page 32 for ensuring the Board is 
supplied with appropriate and timely information and for assisting 
the directors to update their knowledge. In addition to business 
presentations regularly made to the Board at which CR was 
considered as appropriate, the Board conducts an annual CR 
review and Board members regularly receive CR updates. CR 
performance is included in divisional accountability systems and 
remuneration arrangements. The Remuneration Committee in 
determining executive remuneration takes into account CR matters 
as described in the Directors’ remuneration report.
The risks and opportunities relating to CR in 2010 primarily 
revolved around the reputation of the Group and the quality  
of its brands. 
A review of the Group’s activities and future developments, which 
fulfils the requirements of the business review, including the 
financial performance during the year, key performance indicators 
and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the 
Group is given on pages 16 to 29 and forms part of this report. The

Of particular importance was the promotion of responsible 
gambling and the protection of children and the vulnerable. CR 
also impacted (i) the performance of the Group’s employees on 
whom the Group relies for the provision of high quality services to 
customers and (ii) the health and safety of these employees and 
the customers they serve.
Performance indicators continued to be developed in accordance 
with Group-wide CR. No breaches of CR policies and procedures 
material to the Group were identified by the Board in 2010.
The identification and management of CR issues, the CR reporting 
framework and accuracy of any associated data has been reviewed 
by the Company’s CR adviser, Acona Limited.
Employee policies
The Board values two-way communication between senior 
management and employees on all matters affecting the welfare 
of the business. As well as regular management roadshows 
and visits to operating units, conferences and meetings, 
communication is via the intranet and other multimedia formats.
Throughout the Group via the Staff Council, opinion surveys and 
feedback programmes, employees are encouraged to be involved 
in the running of the business. The Company’s Annual Report 
is made available to employees and, together with regular staff 
magazines, provides employees with a greater awareness of the 
Group’s performance as well as the financial and economic factors 
that affect it. 
In addition, those employees who are eligible are also 
encouraged to become involved in the Group’s performance 
through participation in share schemes.
Throughout the Group, the principles of equal opportunities  
are recognised in the formulation and development of  
employment policies.
It is the Company’s policy to give full and fair consideration 
to applications from people with disabilities, having regard to  
their particular aptitudes and abilities. If an employee becomes 
disabled, the Company’s objective is the continued provision of 
suitable employment, either in the same or an alternative position, 
with appropriate adjustments being made if necessary. Employees 
with disabilities share equally in the opportunities for training, 
career development and promotion.
Directors’ indemnities and insurance
The Company continues to maintain directors’ and officers’ 
liability insurance. In accordance with the Company’s articles of 
association, the Company has entered into a deed of indemnity  
to the extent permitted by law with each of the directors.
Charitable donations
During 2010, in addition to donations made to overseas charities, 
Group companies donated £945,557 to UK charitable organisations 
for charitable purposes.
Supplier payment policy
The Company agrees payment terms for its business transactions 
when goods and services are ordered. It ensures that suppliers 
are aware of the terms of payment and the relevant terms are 
included in contracts where appropriate. Subject to satisfactory 
performance by the supplier, arrangements are adhered to when 
making payments. At the year end, the Company had no trade 
creditors.
Going concern
In assessing the going concern basis, the directors considered 
the Group’s business activities and the financial position of the 
Group as described in pages 4 to 29 and the Group’s financial risk 
management objectives and policies as included in note 25 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
The directors consider that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and 
that it is therefore appropriate to adopt the going concern basis  
in preparing its financial statements.

Dear Shareholder 
In 2010 the Ladbrokes business underwent significant operational change. The recruitment of a new Chief Executive with the ambition 
to restore Ladbrokes to a position of leadership within the industry led to a strategic review which included a restructuring of the 
management team to support the new business priorities.
In parallel the Remuneration Committee (the “Committee”) reviewed the remuneration arrangements across the organisation.  
Our goal was to take a fresh look at the basis on which we set fixed and variable pay. We wanted to ensure pay policy was aligned  
with Ladbrokes’ new strategic objectives and that a competitive base pay regime was complemented by performance pay that 
handsomely rewarded exceptional performance but did not over pay for average outcomes. 
The result is a new pay framework in which annual cash potentials have been moderated; award levels under the annual bonus have 
been reduced; one third of the annual bonus must be deferred into shares for a period of three years and pension and company car 
costs have been contained.
We have kept performance share awards, but introduced lower levels of grants and required the Chief Executive to grade individual 
contributions to the strategic development of the Company when setting proposed award levels. 
As time progresses we expect to see differentiation in grant levels whilst maintaining demanding vesting criteria based on relative 
Total Shareholder Return performance and stretching Earnings Per Share growth targets.
The centrepiece is the introduction of the one-off Ladbrokes Growth Plan. Participants have to hold significant personal investments 
in Ladbrokes shares to qualify. They receive up to four times that holding in matched shares but performance conditions are truly 
demanding. Performance is measured over a five year period. No shares vest until the share price reaches £2.00 at which only 25%  
of the shares are allocated. Maximum vesting will only occur if a share price of £2.97 is achieved. This creates real value for 
employees, but only if they have created between £400 million and £1.3 billion of shareholder value. 
We are committed to transparent reporting of remuneration arrangements and do not believe the proposed arrangements raise 
environmental, social or governance issues or inadvertently motivate irresponsible behaviours.
Further details of all the changes to Ladbrokes’ remuneration arrangements are provided within this report.
The Committee appreciates all feedback from shareholders and hopes to receive your support at the forthcoming AGM.

Governance
Remuneration Committee remit, composition  
and activities continued
Appointments to the Committee are made by the Board at the 
recommendation of the Nomination Committee, which consults 
with the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
The Committee normally invites the Chief Executive, the Group  
HR director and the HR director – Reward & Resourcing to attend 
committee meetings concerning proposals relating to the 
remuneration of the executive directors, other than when their 
personal remuneration is discussed. The Company Secretary  
acts as secretary to the Committee.
The Committee met nine times in 2010. P Erskine and  
H E Staunton did not attend one meeting each during the  
year due to other business commitments. The Committee  
retained independent remuneration consultants (Deloitte LLP) 
and has taken advice during the year from them in relation to 
executive remuneration matters. Deloitte LLP also provides the 
Company with outsourced internal audit and miscellaneous tax 
and consulting services. SJ Berwin LLP, one of the Company’s 
corporate lawyers, has also provided material assistance.
In forming the remuneration policy, the best practice provisions set 
out in the UK Corporate Governance Code have been followed 
and the Guidelines issued by the Association of British Insurers 
(ABI) and the National Association of Pension Funds (NAPF) have 
been noted. 
During 2010 the Committee, amongst other items, considered  
the following:
  remuneration arrangements for the new Chief Executive; 
  design and approval of the Ladbrokes Growth Plan; 
  base salary and pension review for executive directors; and 
  review of the structure, quantum and calibration of the annual 
bonus and performance share plans for 2011 onwards.
Remuneration policy 
The principles that guided the remuneration review were that the 
compensation arrangements should:
  be aligned with and support the business strategy;
   enable the Company to attract, retain and motivate key 
individuals; and 
  be strongly aligned with shareholder value creation.
Summary of ﬁxed remuneration arrangements  
for 2011 onwards
Base salary 
  Policy is set at a competitive level. 
   Salaries are reviewed annually with reference to market 
practice in companies of a similar size and complexity, 
taking into account business and personal performance.
Pension 
  Aim is to provide market competitive arrangements. 
   Executives can opt upon appointment to join the defined 
contribution scheme or take a cash supplement equivalent to 
22.5% of base salary.
   For longer serving executives in the legacy defined benefit plan, 
a cash supplement of 22.5% of base salary is provided above 
the earnings cap. Governance

conditions. Any share price  
target must be attained 
throughout a period of 30 
consecutive dealing days.
  25% of the award will vest if a 
share price of £2.00 is achieved.
  100% of the award will vest if a 
share price of £2.97 is achieved.
Remuneration mix 
In support of the remuneration philosophy, the mixture of fixed and variable reward is heavily weighted towards the performance  
related elements. In particular, there is an emphasis on long term share based incentives i.e. the Performance Share Plan and Ladbrokes 
Growth Plan.
The mixture of fixed and variable remuneration is broken down as follows:
  at target performance – 35% is fixed and 65% is variable remuneration; and
  at maximum performance – 15% is fixed and 85% is variable remuneration.
For the purposes of the analysis above, fixed remuneration represents base salary but excludes pension (or cash equivalent) and 
benefits. Variable remuneration represents annual bonus, Performance Share Plan and Ladbrokes Growth Plan awards (on an 
annualised basis). Ladbrokes plc

Base salary
In January 2010, in line with the policy for all other employees,  
the annual salaries of the executive directors were not increased.
Again, in 2011, no increases to executive directors’ salaries 
occurred generally as part of the annual pay review. Base salaries 
have been frozen across the business.
Exceptionally, the base salary of R J Ames was increased. On his 
appointment to the Board in January 2009, his base salary was 
positioned significantly below the market. As outlined in last year’s 
Remuneration report the Committee undertook to review his base 
salary in 2010.
In April 2010, the Committee increased his base salary to market 
levels to reflect his strong performance as an executive director 
since his appointment to the Board. With effect from 1 April 2010, 
his base salary was increased from £275,000 to £320,000  
per annum. 
Following the appointment of R I Glynn and the restructuring of  
the Board, R J Ames’ role has changed from Managing Director 
– UK and Ireland Retail to Managing Director – Consumer 
Operations. As a result of the increased scope and responsibility 
of this role, he received a further salary increase effective from 
1 January 2011 to £370,000 per annum. This was outside the 
annual pay review process.
Executive
Base salary with effect 
from 1 January 2011
R I Glynn £580,000
B G Wallace £494,400
R J Ames £370,000
Annual bonus
Executive directors participate in the annual bonus plan and the 
Deferred Bonus Plan (“DBP”).
For 2011, the maximum bonus opportunity is 170% of base salary 
for the Chief Executive and 130% for other executive directors. 
This is a reduction in bonus opportunity from previous years when 
other executive directors received a maximum bonus opportunity 
of 150% of base salary.
70% of the total bonus opportunity is based on financial 
performance, assessed by reference to profit, and the remaining 
30% on individual performance objectives which are agreed and 
approved by the Remuneration Committee at the beginning of 
each financial year.
The minimum threshold below which no payment is made is 95% 
of the profit target and the maximum awards will be delivered for 
achieving 107% of the profit target.
From 2011 onwards, high roller profits will be excluded from the 
profit calculations for annual bonus purposes. Going forward,  
high rollers will only form part of the individual performance 
elements of the bonus for those directly responsible for this  
area of the business. 
This change is designed to ensure that the bonuses reflect 
underlying business performance. It also ensures that only those 
individuals who can directly influence high roller performance are 
subject to its outcome. 
One third of any annual bonus earned will be delivered in shares 
under the DBP and will only vest subject to continued employment 
after a three year vesting period.
Performance Share Plan (“PSP”)
Following the introduction of the Ladbrokes Growth Plan, the 
Remuneration Committee considered it appropriate to reduce the 
normal maximum PSP opportunity for executive directors 
excluding the Chief Executive from 175% of salary to 150% of 
salary in 2011. This moves award levels more towards general 
market practice in companies of a similar size and reduces the 
overall quantum of the ongoing package. The Chief Executive’s 
normal PSP opportunity will remain at 175% of base salary. 
From 2011 onwards, annual award levels will be determined  
based on an assessment of individual performance prior to grant 
and will not normally be made at the maximum levels set out 
above. Awards of up to 250% of salary may be made in 
exceptional circumstances (e.g. recruitment or retention) at  
the Committee’s discretion.
Vesting of awards is subject to the achievement of performance 
targets over a three year performance period and continued 
employment. 50% of the award will be based on the Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) performance of the Company relative  
to a select group of industry peers. The comparator group for the 
2011 awards remains unchanged and is as follows:
888 Holdings Paddy Power
Bwin PartyGaming
Boyd Gaming Punch Taverns
Enterprise Inns Rank Group
Lottomatica Sportingbet
Mitchells and Butlers Whitbread
OPAP William Hill
The remaining 50% of the award will be subject to the achievement 
of an absolute Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) growth target. 
Using TSR and EPS performance conditions is consistent  
with market practice. TSR has been selected as a performance 
condition to support the drive for long term shareholder value.  
EPS has been chosen as it is the key financial metric of  
the business.

Ladbrokes Growth Plan (“LGP”)
R I Glynn and the Board are committed to revitalising the business 
and engaging every team member in the common aim of 
reshaping the business. In May 2010, shareholders approved a 
one-off long term incentive plan designed to incentivise key senior 
executives to create significant long term shareholder value. 
The first award under the plan was made to R I Glynn in June 2010. 
He is required to hold 1,008,946 Ladbrokes shares for the duration 
of the plan, in order to strongly align his interests with those of 
shareholders. He received a four times matching award on his 
investment shares, which is subject to very stretching share price 
growth performance targets. 
The Committee considers that it is important that all key senior 
executives of the business are incentivised on a consistent basis. 
Therefore it intends to make awards under the plan to key 
members of the senior management team as soon as practicable 
in 2011 on similar terms to the award made to R I Glynn. 
Executive directors will be required to invest up to 150% of base 
salary in Ladbrokes shares and will receive up to a four times 
matching award, subject to performance targets considered 
similarly demanding.
The extent to which LGP matching awards will vest will be 
dependent on the achievement of extremely stretching share price 
growth performance targets over a five year period. Any share 
price targets must be attained for a period of 30 consecutive 
dealing days to be deemed to have been met. The following share 
price targets apply to the LGP:
Share Price 
Performance Level
%  
vesting levels 
Below £2.00 per share 0
£2.00 per share 25
£2.97 per share 100
Vesting will be on a straight line basis between minimum and 
maximum share price targets (i.e. between £2.00 and £2.97).
If a share price of £2.97 is achieved, approximately £1.3 billion of 
value will have been created for shareholders through share price 
growth since R I Glynn’s appointment.
Up to one third of the award may vest at the end of year three if the 
targets have been achieved at that time. A further third may vest at 
the end of year four if the targets have been met at that time. The 
remainder of the award may vest at the end of year five, subject to 
the achievement of the performance targets.
The Committee is mindful that absolute share price targets must 
demand a real stretch in performance to ensure significant value 
creation for shareholders. In particular, the Committee will retain 
responsibility to amend the targets if it is necessary to take 
account of exceptional factors including, for example, corporate 
events or exceptional market or industry factors which would 
otherwise render the targets inappropriate.
Restricted Share Plan (“RSP”)
The RSP is used from time to time as an attraction and retention 
vehicle for key management positions. However, executive 
directors are not eligible to participate in this plan.
All-employee incentive arrangements
There are two share plans currently in operation in which all UK 
employees, subject to minimum service requirements, are eligible 
to participate. 
The share plans are operated to strengthen and widen employee 
share ownership. These are summarised below.
Savings Related Share Option Scheme 
The Company offers a Savings Related Share Option Scheme, 
which is approved by HMRC (“the 1983 Scheme”), and is linked to 
a Save-As-You-Earn contract under which participants save a 
regular monthly sum by deducting from earnings up to £250 per 
month for either three or five years. Subject to common service 
criteria, the 1983 Scheme is open to all UK employees (including 
executive directors).
Options are normally exercisable during a period of six months 
following the expiry of three and five years (as previously selected 
by the participant) from the dates of grant and there are no 
performance conditions. Option prices are calculated by reference 
to the average mid-market quotation of shares are shown by the 
Stock Exchange Daily Official List for the five business days 
immediately preceding the date of grant, discounted by up to  
20% per share.
Share Incentive Plan 
The Share Incentive Plan which is approved by HMRC is open to 
all UK employees (including executive directors) who have 
completed at least 12 months’ service. To encourage employee 
participation, the Company provides a match of one bonus share 
for every two shares purchased by employees. The bonus shares 
are held conditionally upon satisfaction of a one-year service 
requirement. The maximum monthly contribution by employees 
has been set at £75 per month.
Pension
As part of the Committee’s desire to manage fixed costs,  
it reviewed pension arrangements during the year. 
The policy for executive directors joining Ladbrokes after 2007  
has been to offer the choice between:
  membership of Ladbrokes’ defined contribution scheme; or
  a cash supplement of up to 30% of base salary.
In 2010, the Committee decided to reduce the level of cash 
supplement from 30% of base salary to 22.5% of base salary with 
effect from 1 January 2011. This brings arrangements in line with 
market practice in companies of a similar size and complexity. 
Ladbrokes has historically operated a defined benefit plan, the 
Ladbrokes Pension Plan (“LPP”). For members of the LPP, they 
accrue benefits on base salary up to the LPP-specific Earnings 
Cap (2010/2011 £123,600), and receive a cash supplement of 
22.5% of base salary above the Earnings Cap (previously 30%  
of base salary above the Earnings Cap).
Further details of the retirement benefits for individual executive 
directors are set out on page 50.
Beneﬁts 
The Company also offers benefits including private healthcare,  
life assurance and a cash allowance in respect of a company 
car from 1 January 2011 (legacy vehicles will be retained until  
lease expiration). Ladbrokes plc

Executive directors’ shareholding guidelines 
Shareholding guidelines require executive directors to build up over time personal shareholdings equivalent in value to at least one  
year’s base salary. It is intended that the specified ownership level will be achieved through the retention of shares earned under the 
Company’s incentive plans.
Incentives – performance periods ended 31 December 2010
Annual bonus
Approximately 75% of the 2010 annual bonus was based on profit performance and the remaining 25% on individual performance 
objectives. In respect of the profit plan:
  it was set by the Board at the beginning of 2010 by reference to internal projections and the prevailing economic conditions 
at the time;
  the minimum threshold below which no payments are made is 95% of the profit plan; and
  maximum awards would be delivered for achieving 105% of the profit plan.
The maximum bonus opportunity for 2010 was 150% of base salary for executive directors and 170% for the Chief Executive. One third 
of any annual bonus earned will be delivered in shares under the DBP and will only vest subject to continued employment after a three 
year vesting period.
The Company has performed well during the last financial year despite challenging economic conditions and bonuses have been 
determined as follows to the executive directors:

Individual Objectives

B G Wallace 113% 373 143,061 560 76%
R J Ames 113% 233 89,413 350 76%
PSP
The performance period for 2008 PSP awards ended on 31 December 2010. The structure of the 2008 PSP was the same as outlined on 
page 42 for the 2011 awards. 
50% of the award was based on TSR performance against select industry peers, using the same comparator group as outlined on page 
42 for the 2011 awards (with the exception of Harrahs Entertainment which delisted during 2008). The Company was positioned below 
median and therefore this element of the award did not vest.
The remaining 50% of the award was subject to EPS performance and the same performance targets applied as outlined on page 42 for 
the 2011 awards. The minimum threshold was not attained and therefore this element of the award also did not vest.
Service contracts 
In line with Company’s policy, all executive directors are employed on conventional one year rolling contracts, with the exception of R I Glynn.
Executive Date of Contract Company Notice Period Director Notice Period
R J Ames 1 January 2009 1 year 6 months
C Bell 20 December 2006 1 year 6 months
R I Glynn 30 March 2010 1 year* 1 year
J P O’Reilly 1 January 2007 1 year 6 months
B G Wallace 5 March 2007 1 year 6 months
*R I Glynn’s appointment is subject to notice of 12 months on either side save that such notice may not expire prior to the end of April 2012. 
New appointments to the Board will normally be made on a one year rolling contract. 
The Company normally expects executive directors upon departure to mitigate their loss. In any specific case that may arise, the 
Committee will carefully consider any compensatory payments having regard to performance, age, service, health or other circumstances 
that are relevant.
The Company may terminate employment by making a payment in lieu of notice equivalent to the value of base salary and benefits in 
respect of the notice period. Governance

Matters relating to Board changes 
R I Glynn 
R I Glynn’s remuneration arrangements were fully disclosed at the 
time of his appointment and are outlined in this report. 
Prior to his appointment, he had a number of existing remuneration 
and equity interests which he was required to relinquish when 
accepting the Ladbrokes Chief Executive role. In recognition of 
him doing so, he was entitled to receive an interest in Ladbrokes 
shares with a value of £1.75 million on appointment. He is required 
to hold this interest in Ladbrokes shares for a minimum of three 
years forming the basis of a long term holding in the Company. 
This one-off compensatory share award was also disclosed at the 
time of his appointment.
C Bell
As disclosed in last year’s remuneration report, the Company 
announced on 12 January 2010 that C Bell was to step down as  
a director of the Company. In accordance with his contract  
C Bell received salary, pension contributions and benefits for the 
duration of his 12 month notice period which commenced on  
1 February 2010. Payments were made on a phased basis, subject 
to mitigation. He was only eligible for a pro-rata bonus in respect 
of the period worked in 2010 subject to performance.
All outstanding awards under the PSP lapsed upon cessation  
of employment. All share awards under the DBP vested in 
accordance with the scheme rules. Share awards under all  
other share plans will be treated in accordance with the relevant 
scheme rules.
J P O’Reilly
The Company announced on 5 August 2010 that J P O’Reilly was 
to step down as a director of the Company. In accordance with his 
contract J P O’Reilly received salary, pension contributions and 
benefits for the duration of his 12 month notice period which 
commenced on 5 November 2010. Payments will be made on a 
phased basis subject to mitigation. He was eligible for a payment 
in respect of bonus for the 2010 financial year subject to the 
achievement of performance objectives.
J P O’Reilly’s 2010 PSP award lapsed upon his cessation of 
employment. 2008 and 2009 awards will vest at the end of the 
original performance period, subject to the performance 
conditions being met and time pro-rating to reflect the proportion 
of the performance period in which he remained in employment. 
All share awards under the DBP vested in accordance with the 
scheme rules. Share awards under all other share plans will be 
treated in accordance with the relevant scheme rules. 
A S Ross
A S Ross did not seek re-election at the May 2009 AGM but 
retained his executive director terms and conditions until 20 July 
2009. Thereafter, as disclosed in last year’s remuneration report, 
he was engaged by the Company three days a week until 19 July 
2010. He received a daily rate of £1,061 plus benefits of a mobile 
phone, company car and private medical cover.
B G Wallace
Following the departure of C Bell, it was essential to maintain 
continuity in the business during a critical transition period for the 
Company. Therefore the Committee decided to offer a special 
one-off incentive of 70% of base salary to B G Wallace. This will 
become payable in March 2011, subject to continued employment. 
Non-executive directors 
Non-executive directors are retained on terms set out in their 
letters of appointment. They do not have service contracts with 
either the Company or any of its subsidiaries. The appointment  
of a non-executive director is terminable without notice. 
The standard letter of appointment for non-executive directors  
is available for inspection on request.
The Committee determines the fees of the Chairman of the Board 
and the Board as a whole determines the remuneration of each of 
the non-executive directors. Non-executive directors receive fees 
set relative to median market practice and are regularly reviewed. 
There was no increase in the remuneration of the Chairman or 
other non-executive directors as at 1 January 2011.
Non-executive directors are not eligible for annual bonus, share 
incentives, pension or other benefits.
The annual fees are payable as follows:
Role Fee
Chairman £250,000
Senior Independent Director £60,000
Board member £43,000
Audit Committee Chairman £10,000
Remuneration Committee Chairman £10,000

  R I Glynn’s Ladbrokes Growth Plan award comprises the following:
   a restricted interest in a share held jointly with the Trustees of the Employee Benefit Trust; and 
    a nil cost option, which together entitle him to the value of a whole share. Details of the restricted interest in shares is provided in the previous table. 
  On 30 June 2010, an option was granted which would entitle R I Glynn to acquire at nil cost such number of shares that have an aggregate market 
value of £6,901,190.64 on the date of exercise, subject to achievement of the performance conditions outlined on page 43. The option expires on 
30 June 2020.
Rights issue 
Adjustments to share option/awards 
To take account of the effects of the rights issue completed in October 2009, adjustments were made at that time to awards and options 
held under the Company’s employee share schemes.
For the PSP, RSP and DBP, the number of shares under award were appropriately adjusted. In the case of the share options plans 
(1978 Scheme, International Scheme and 1983 Scheme), both the number of options under award and the exercise price were adjusted. 
Under the Share Incentive Plan, all participants received the right to buy one new share for every two shares already held in the plan.  
All of the executive directors took up their rights under the rights issue, and as a result, new shares were allotted to each individual. 
Ladbrokes shares previously held under the Share Incentive Plan will continue to be held in the plan on the same terms.
The treatment outlined above was in accordance with the relevant scheme rules. Adjustments in respect of the 1978 Scheme and the 
1983 Scheme were approved by HMRC.
Review of performance conditions under the PSP and other share option schemes
In January 2010, the performance conditions under the PSP and the other share option schemes were reviewed by the Committee and 
appropriate adjustments were made to reflect the dilutive effect of the rights issue. 
In relation to awards within an EPS performance condition under the PSP and the other share option schemes (1978 Scheme and 
International Scheme), the relevant EPS target has been appropriately adjusted in accordance with IAS33 for awards outstanding 
at the time of the rights issue. 
For the TSR performance condition under the PSP, historic share prices prior to the rights issue were reduced by a factor of 1.17454, 
determined by dividing the closing share price on the last trading day before the rights issue (£1.7140) by the theoretical ex-rights  
price (£1.4593).
Retirement provision during 2010
R I Glynn has received a cash supplement of 22.5% of base salary since he was appointed to the Board on 22 April 2010. 
B G Wallace has received a cash supplement of 30% of base salary since he re-joined the Group on 5 March 2007. The pension benefits 
accrued during his previous employment with the Group were transferred to non-Group pension arrangements in 2006 and are not 
included in these disclosures.
R J Ames is a member of the LPP, details of which are set out on page 50. He also received a cash supplement of 30% of base salary 
above the LPP-specific Earnings Cap.
C Bell and J P O’Reilly were also members of the LPP. In respect of their base salary above the LPP-specific Earnings Cap, both 
received 30% of base salary in the form of a cash supplement for the period of 2010 during which they were in employment. 
The transfer value figures below have been provided by the independent actuarial advisers appointed by the Trustees of the LPP, 
calculated in accordance with the LPP’s agreed transfer value policy. The accrued pension benefit is an annual figure. The transfer 
value represents the amount that would be paid to another pension scheme if this accrued pension benefit were to be transferred away 
from the LPP (although C Bell is no longer able to make such a transfer as he is in receipt of a pension from the LPP). A transfer value 
represents a liability of the LPP but not a sum paid or due to the individual.
Listing rules and Schedule 7A disclosure 
Set out below are details of the pension benefits, payable on retirement at age 60 (age 65 in the case of R J Ames), to which each of 
the directors shown is entitled at 31 December 2010. The figures shown overleaf, including the accrued pensions, are the total pension 
entitlements in respect of all pensionable service with the Company including any service with Ladbrokes prior to becoming a director. Ladbrokes plc

The transfer value increase over the year includes the effect of any increase in pensionable salary, completing further service, being a 
year closer to their nominal pension retirement date and changes in market conditions. For C Bell, the transfer value increase over the 
year also includes the effect of moving from the transfer value assumptions for non-pensioner members to those for pensioners.

  C Bell ceased accrual and took early retirement from the LPP on 31 March 2010. The pension figure shown above as at 31 December 2010 is a 
notional accrued pension before allowing for the early retirement reduction applied and commutation of part of his pension for a cash lump sum. 
The transfer value of C Bell’s LPP benefits calculated at 31 December 2010 allows for his early retirement and includes the benefits paid out  
during 2010. His LPP benefits were reduced for the period between the date he started to receive his pension and his 60th birthday to reflect  
early payment. The reduction used early retirement factors which apply to all members of the LPP, and were set by the Trustees of the Plan  
(not Ladbrokes) to be broadly financially neutral.

 J P O’Reilly ceased accrual in the LPP from 5 November 2010.

   In April 2010 the Group announced that it had reached a settlement with HMRC which covered substantially all outstanding items in respect of tax 
years to 31 December 2007. The settlement has resulted in the recognition within the tax charge of a £261.9 million tax credit in relation to prior years 
(note 11). Finance income has also increased by £20.0 million to reflect the interest consequences of the settlement (note 9).

   A final dividend of 3.75 pence (2009: nil) per share, amounting to £33.8 million (2009: nil), was declared by the directors on 17 February 2011. 
These financial statements do not reflect the dividend payable. The 2010 interim dividend of 3.85 pence per share (£34.7 million) was paid in 2010.

1 Corporate information
Ladbrokes plc (the Company) is a limited company incorporated 
and domiciled in the United Kingdom whose shares are publicly 
traded. The address of its registered office and principal place of 
business is disclosed in the corporate information section of the 
Annual Report.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company and  
its subsidiaries (together, ‘the Group’) for the year ended  
31 December 2010 were authorised for issue in accordance  
with a resolution of the directors on 17 February 2011. 
The principal activities of the Group are described in note 6.
2 Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been 
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted for use in the European Union. 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling.  
All values are in millions (£m) rounded to one decimal place except 
where otherwise indicated.
To assist in understanding its underlying performance, the Group  
has defined the following items of income and expense as 
non-trading in nature:
   profits or losses on disposal or impairment of non-current 
assets or businesses;
  unrealised gains and losses on derivative financial instruments; 
  business restructuring costs; and
  litigation and transaction costs.
The non-trading items have been included within the appropriate 
classifications in the consolidated income statement.
3 Changes in accounting policies 
The Group has adopted the following new standards and 
interpretations for the year ended 31 December 2010:
IFRS 3 Business Combinations (Revised) and IAS 27 Consolidated 
and Separate Financial Statements (Amended) were issued in 
January 2008. 
IFRS 3R has introduced a number of changes in the accounting for 
non-controlling interests, business combinations achieved in stages, 
contingent consideration and transaction costs.
IAS 27 requires that a change in the ownership interest of a 
subsidiary is accounted for as an equity transaction. Therefore, 
such changes will have no impact on goodwill, nor will it give rise 
to a gain or a loss. Furthermore, the amended standard changes 
the accounting for losses incurred by the subsidiary as well as the 
loss of control of a subsidiary. 
There were no significant acquisitions or changes in the ownership 
interest of subsidiaries during the period to which these standards 
would have been relevant.
IFRIC 12 Service Concession Agreements, IFRIC 17 Distribution of 
Non-Cash Assets to Owners and IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets 
from Customers were all adopted for the year, but have not had an 
impact on the Group.
The International Accounting Standards Board’s Second Annual 
Improvements Project was published in May 2009, with the 
majority of changes being applicable from 1 January 2010. The 
project made minor amendments to a number of standards, 
primarily with a view to removing inconsistencies and clarifying 
wording. The amendments to these standards did not have any 
impact on the accounting policies, financial position or 
performance of the Group. 
4 Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial 
statements of the Company and its subsidiaries at 31 December 
each year. The underlying financial statements of subsidiaries are 
prepared for the same reporting year as the Company, using 
consistent accounting policies. Control is achieved where the 
Company has the power to govern the financial and operating 
policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from  
its activities.
All intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses 
are eliminated on consolidation.
Subsidiaries are consolidated, using the purchase method of 
accounting, from the date on which control is transferred to the 
Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which 
control is transferred from the Group. 
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities  
of a subsidiary are measured at fair value at the date of 
acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair 
values of the separately identifiable net assets acquired is 
recognised as goodwill. Where necessary, adjustments are made 
to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting 
policies used in line with those used by the Group.
Use of assumptions, estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial information requires the use of 
assumptions, estimates and judgements about future conditions. 
Use of available information and application of judgement are 
inherent in the formation of estimates. Actual results in the future 
may differ from those reported. In this regard, management 
believes that the accounting policies where judgement is 
necessarily applied are those that relate to: the measurement and 
impairment of indefinite life intangible assets; the measurement of 
pension and other post employment benefit obligations; the 
determination of the initial fair value of betting and gaming 
transactions; the recoverable amount of trade receivables; income 
tax and the valuation of financial guarantee contracts.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised 
in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects 
only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods, 
if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Further information about key assumptions concerning the future 
and other key sources of estimation uncertainty are set out below.
Indeﬁnite life intangible assets
The Group has determined that betting shop licences and a 
customer relationship intangible asset have indefinite lives.
The Group determines whether indefinite life intangible assets are 
impaired at least on an annual basis. This requires an estimation of 
the ‘value in use’ of the cash generating units to which the 
intangible assets are allocated. Estimating a value in use amount 
requires management to make an estimate of the expected future 
cash flows from the cash generating unit and also to choose a 
suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of 
those cash flows. Further details are given in notes 15 and 16.
Pension and other post employment beneﬁt obligations
The cost of defined benefit pension plans and other post 
employment benefits is determined using actuarial valuations.  
The actuarial valuation involves making assumptions about 
discount rates, expected rates of return on assets, future salary 
increases, mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the 
long-term nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to 
significant uncertainty. Further details are given in note 31.

4 Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies continued 
Betting and gaming transactions
Betting and gaming transactions are measured at the fair value of 
the consideration received or receivable from customers. This is 
normally the nominal amount of the consideration but on certain 
occasions, the fair value is estimated using valuation techniques, 
taking into account the credit profile of customers in determining 
the collectability of the consideration. In addition, where there are 
indicators that any trade receivable is impaired at the balance 
sheet date, management makes an estimate of the asset’s 
recoverable amount. Further details are given in note 20.
Income tax
The Group is subject to tax in a number of jurisdictions.  
Significant judgement is required in determining the provision  
for income taxes due to uncertainty of the amount of income tax 
that may be payable, and in respect of determining the level of the 
future taxable profits of the Group that support the recoverability  
of deferred tax assets. Further details are given in note 11.
Financial guarantee contracts
The valuation of financial guarantee contracts and related 
indemnities requires use of assumptions of the risks of default  
of the guaranteed entities and the credit profiles of the 
counterparties. Further details are given in note 26.
Investments in joint ventures 
A joint venture is an entity in which the Group holds an interest on 
a long-term basis and which is jointly controlled by the Group and 
one or more other venturers under a contractual agreement. 
The Group’s share of results of joint ventures is included in the  
Group consolidated income statement using the equity method  
of accounting. Investments in joint ventures are carried in the 
Group consolidated balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition 
changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the entity less any 
impairment in value. The carrying value of investments in joint 
ventures includes acquired goodwill.
If the Group’s share of losses in the joint venture equals or 
exceeds its investment in the joint venture, the Group does not 
recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations to  
do so or made payments on behalf of the joint venture. 
Investments in associates
Associates are those businesses in which the Group has a 
long-term interest and is able to exercise significant influence  
over the financial and operational policies but does not have 
control or joint control over those policies. 
The Group’s share of results of associates is included in the Group 
consolidated income statement using the equity method of 
accounting. Investments in associates are carried in the Group 
consolidated balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes 
in the Group’s share of net assets of the entity less any impairment 
in value. The carrying value of investments in associates includes 
acquired goodwill.
Goodwill
Goodwill on acquisition is initially measured at cost, being the excess 
of the cost of the business combination over the Group’s interest in  
the net fair value of the separately identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities of a subsidiary or associate at the date of 
acquisition. In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, 
goodwill is not amortised but reviewed annually for impairment and  
as such, is stated at cost less any provision for impairment of value. 
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the consolidated income 
statement and is not subsequently reversed. On acquisition, any 
goodwill acquired is allocated to cash generating units for the purpose 
of impairment testing. Where goodwill forms part of a cash generating 
unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the 
goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the 
carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss  
on disposal of the operation. 
Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are capitalised at cost and 
those acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised 
separately from goodwill if the fair value can be measured reliably 
on initial recognition. The costs relating to internally generated 
intangible assets, principally software costs, are capitalised if the 
criteria for recognition as assets are met. Other expenditure is 
charged against profit in the year in which the expenditure is 
incurred. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried 
at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated 
impairment losses. 
The useful lives of these intangible assets are assessed to be 
either finite or indefinite. Where amortisation is charged on assets 
with finite lives, this expense is taken to the consolidated income 
statement through the ‘depreciation and amounts written off 
non-current assets’ line item. Useful lives are reviewed on an 
annual basis. 
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for 
impairment annually, either individually, or at the cash generating 
unit level. 
A summary of the policies applied to the Group’s intangible assets  
is as follows:

4 Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies continued 
Property, plant and equipment
Land is stated at cost less any impairment in value. Buildings, 
plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any impairment in value. Depreciation is 
calculated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life  
of the asset as follows:
Buildings – 50 years or estimated useful life of the building, or 
lease, whichever is less, to estimated residual value. 
Fixtures, fittings and equipment – four to 10 years as considered 
appropriate to write down cost to estimated residual value.
The carrying values of plant and equipment are reviewed for 
impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying values may not be recoverable. If any such indication 
exists and where the carrying values exceed the estimated 
recoverable amount, the assets or cash generating units are 
written down to their recoverable amount. The recoverable amount 
of plant and equipment is the greater of fair value less costs to sell 
and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset 
that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the 
recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit to 
which the asset belongs. Impairment losses are recognised in the 
consolidated income statement in the ‘depreciation and amounts 
written off non-current assets’ line item.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon 
disposal, with any gain or loss arising (calculated as the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
item) included in the consolidated income statement in the year  
of disposal. 
Leases
Leases that transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and 
benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item are capitalised 
at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased item or,  
if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. 
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges 
and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant  
rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.  
Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter  
of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the benefits and 
risks of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. 
Operating lease payments, other than contingent rentals, are 
recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement 
on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Recoverable amount of non-current assets
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is any 
indication that an asset may be impaired. Where an indicator of 
impairment exists, the Group makes a formal estimate of the 
recoverable amount. Where the carrying amount of an asset 
exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired 
and is written down to its recoverable amount. The recoverable 
amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash generating unit’s fair 
value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for 
an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash 
inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or 
groups of assets.
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for 
sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value 
less costs to sell.
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) are classified as held for 
sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale 
transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is 
regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the 
asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its 
present condition. Management must be committed to the sale, 
which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a 
completed sale within one year from the date of classification. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consists of cash at bank and in hand 
and short-term deposits with an original maturity of less than three 
months, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Financial assets
Financial assets are recognised when the Group becomes party to 
the contracts that give rise to them.
The Group classifies financial assets at inception as either loans 
and receivables or as financial assets at fair value through profit  
or loss.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with 
fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. On initial recognition, loans and receivables are measured 
at fair value net of transaction costs. Subsequently, the fair values 
are measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest 
method, less any allowance for impairment.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss comprise 
derivative financial instruments and guarantees provided to the 
Group. Financial assets through profit or loss are measured  
initially at fair value with transaction costs taken directly to the 
consolidated income statement. Subsequently, the fair values  
are remeasured, and gains and losses from changes therein are 
recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Trade receivables are generally accounted for at amortised cost. 
The Group reviews indicators of impairment on an ongoing basis 
and where such indicators exist, the Group makes an estimate of 
the asset’s recoverable amount.
Financial guarantees provided to the Group are classified as 
financial assets and are measured at fair value by estimating the 
probability of the guarantees being called upon and the related 
cash inflows to the Group.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities comprise interest bearing loans and 
borrowings, derivative financial instruments, ante post bets and 
guarantees given to third parties. On initial recognition, financial 
liabilities are measured at fair value plus transaction costs where 
they are not categorised as financial liabilities at fair value through 
profit or loss. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 
include derivative financial instruments and guarantees.
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are measured 
initially at fair value, with transaction costs taken directly to the 
consolidated income statement. Subsequently, the fair values are 
remeasured and gains and losses from changes therein are 
recognised in the consolidated income statement.
All interest bearing loans and borrowings are initially recognised at 
fair value net of issue costs associated with the borrowing. After 
initial recognition, fixed rate interest bearing loans and borrowings 
are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate method.
The Group has provided financial guarantees to third parties in 
respect of lease obligations of certain of the Group’s former 
subsidiaries within the disposed hotels division. Financial guarantee 
contracts are classified as financial liabilities and are measured at 
fair value by estimating the probability of the guarantees being called 
upon and the related cash outflows from the Group. Statutory reports and

4 Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies continued 
Derecognition of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities
Financial assets are derecognised when the right to receive cash 
flows from the assets has expired or when the Group has 
transferred its contractual right to receive the cash flows from the 
financial assets or has assumed an obligation to pay the received 
cash flows in full without material delay to a third party, and either:
  substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have been 
transferred; or
  substantially all the risks and rewards have neither been 
retained nor transferred but control is not retained.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation is 
discharged, cancelled or expires.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments and hedge accounting 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as cross 
currency swaps, foreign exchange swaps and interest rate swaps, 
to hedge its risks associated with interest rate and foreign 
currency fluctuations. Derivative financial instruments are 
recognised initially and subsequently at fair value. The gains or 
losses on remeasurement are taken to the consolidated income 
statement except where the derivative is designated as a cash flow 
hedge or a net investment hedge. Fair values of Over the Counter 
derivatives are obtained using valuation techniques, including 
discounted cash flow models and option pricing models. 
Derivative financial instruments are classified as assets where their 
fair value is positive, or as liabilities where their fair value is 
negative. Derivative assets and liabilities arising from different 
transactions are only offset if the transactions are with the same 
counterparty, a legal right of offset exists and the parties intend  
to settle the cash flows on a net basis.
The derivative financial instruments taken out as hedges were 
designated and documented as hedges on the date that the relevant 
derivative contract was committed to, as one of the following:
   a hedge of the fair value of an asset and liability 
(fair value hedge);
  a hedge of the income/cost of a highly probable forecasted 
transaction or commitment (cash flow hedge); or
  a hedge of a net investment in a foreign entity 
(net investment hedge).
In relation to fair value hedges that meet the conditions for hedge 
accounting, any gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging 
instrument at fair value is recognised immediately in the consolidated 
income statement. Any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable 
to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the 
hedged item and recognised in the consolidated income statement. 
In relation to cash flow hedges that meet the conditions for hedge 
accounting, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is 
recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is 
recognised in the consolidated income statement.
For all cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in 
equity are transferred to the consolidated income statement in the 
same year in which the hedged cash flow affects the consolidated 
income statement.
In relation to net investment hedges, the post-tax gains or losses on 
the translation at the spot exchange rate of the hedged instrument 
are recognised in equity. The portion of the post-tax gains or losses 
on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective 
hedge is recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is 
recognised in the consolidated income statement. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument 
expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, no longer qualifies for 
hedge accounting or as a result of a management decision to 
cease hedging. At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on 
the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until, 
in the case of a hedge of a forecast transaction, the transaction 
occurs or, in the case of net investment hedging, until the Group 
disposes of its investment in the foreign entity being hedged. 
Where a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net 
cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the 
consolidated income statement for the year.
For derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge 
accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are 
taken directly to the consolidated income statement for the year.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present 
obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is 
probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic 
benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable 
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. 
Provisions are measured at the directors’ best estimate of the 
expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet 
date and are discounted to present value where the effect is 
material using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to 
the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a 
finance cost.
Foreign currency translation
The presentation and functional currency of Ladbrokes plc and the 
functional currencies of its UK subsidiaries is sterling (£). 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in sterling 
at the foreign currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
are retranslated at the foreign currency rate of exchange ruling at 
the balance sheet date. 
All foreign currency translation differences are taken to the 
consolidated income statement with the exception of differences 
on foreign currency borrowings that provide a post-tax hedge 
against a net investment in a foreign entity. These are taken 
directly to equity until the disposal of the net investment, at which 
time they are recognised in the consolidated income statement. 
Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences on 
those borrowings are also dealt with in equity. 
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost 
in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the 
date of the initial transaction. Non-monetary items measured at 
fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange 
rate at the date when the fair value was determined.
The main functional currency of overseas subsidiaries is the Euro. 
At the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of these overseas 
subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange 
ruling at the balance sheet date and their income statements are 
translated at the average exchange rates for the year. The post-tax 
exchange differences arising on the retranslation, since the date of 
transition to IFRSs, are taken directly to a separate component of 
equity. On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative 
amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign entity 
is recognised in the consolidated income statement.

4 Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies continued 
Income tax 
Deferred income tax is provided, using the liability method, on all 
temporary differences at the balance sheet date, between the tax  
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for 
financial reporting purposes.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences:
  except where the deferred income tax liability arises from the 
initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is 
not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, 
affects neither the accounting profit nor the tax profit; and
   associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, 
except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
differences can be controlled and it is probable that the 
temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible 
temporary differences and carry forward of unused tax assets and 
unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
profit will be available against which the deductible temporary 
differences and carry forward of unused tax assets and unused 
tax losses can be utilised: 
   except where the deferred income tax asset relating to 
the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not 
a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, 
affects neither the accounting profit nor the tax profit; and
    in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with 
investments in subsidiaries and associates, deferred tax assets 
are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the 
deductible temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable 
future and taxable profit will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at 
each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to 
allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax 
rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is 
realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date.
Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
Income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is 
recognised in equity and not in the consolidated income statement.
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount  
of sales tax except:
  where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of goods and 
services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in 
which case the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost 
of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as 
applicable; and
   receivables and payables are stated with the amount of sales 
tax included.
The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the 
taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables  
in the consolidated balance sheet.
Pensions and other post employment beneﬁts
The defined benefit pension fund holds assets separately from the 
Group. The pension cost relating to this fund is assessed in 
accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries 
using the projected unit credit method. 
Actuarial gains or losses are recognised in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income in the period in which  
they arise.
Any past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that 
the benefits have already vested and otherwise is amortised on a 
straight line basis over the average period until the benefits vest. 
The retirement benefit asset recognised in the balance sheet 
represents the fair value of scheme assets less the value of the 
defined benefit obligations as adjusted for unrecognised past 
service cost.
The Group’s contributions to defined contribution plans are 
charged to the consolidated income statement in the period  
to which the contributions relate.
For defined benefit schemes, management makes annual 
estimates and assumptions in respect of discount rates, future 
changes in salaries, employee turnover, inflation rates and life 
expectancy. In making these estimates and assumptions, 
management considers advice provided by external advisers, 
such as actuaries. Where actual experience differs to these 
estimates, actuarial gains and losses are recognised directly  
in equity. Refer to note 31 for details of the values of assets and 
obligations and key assumptions used.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the 
proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Treasury shares
Own equity instruments that are reacquired (treasury shares) are 
deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in profit or 
loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s 
own equity instruments.
ESOP trusts
Where the Group holds its own equity shares through ESOP trusts 
these shares are shown as a reduction in equity. Any consideration 
paid or received for the purchase or sale of these shares is shown 
in the reconciliation of movements in shareholders’ funds and no 
gain or loss is recognised within the consolidated income 
statement or the statement of comprehensive income on the 
purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of these shares.
Dividends
Dividends proposed by the Board of Directors and unpaid  
at the year end are not recognised in the financial statements  
until they have been approved by shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting.
Revenue
Continuing operations 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable from customers for goods and services 
provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT 
and other sales related taxes.
For licensed betting offices, on course betting, Core Telephone 
Betting, High Rollers, Digital Sportsbook businesses and online 
Casino operations (including games and other number bets), 
revenue represents gains and losses, being the amounts staked 
and fees received, less total payouts and the fair value of reward 
points issued from betting activity in the period. Open betting 
positions are carried at fair market value and gains and losses 
arising on these positions are recognised in revenue.
When a bet is placed and reward points are issued under the 
OddsOn! loyalty scheme, the fair value of the reward points is 
deferred and recorded as a liability. The deferred revenue is 
recognised when the reward points are used or when they expire. Statutory reports and 
ﬁnancial statements
Ladbrokes plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2010

4 Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies continued 
Revenue from the online Poker business reflects the net income 
(rake) earned from Poker games completed by the period end.
In the case of the greyhound stadia, revenue represents income 
arising from the operation of the greyhound stadia in the period, 
including sales of refreshments.
Discontinued operations
Italy Retail and Casino revenue represented gains and losses, 
being the amount staked less total payouts, from betting activity  
in the period.
Finance costs and income 
Finance costs and income arising on interest bearing financial 
instruments carried at amortised cost are recognised in the 
consolidated income statement using the effective interest rate 
method. Finance costs include the amortisation of fees that are an 
integral part of the effective finance cost of a financial instrument, 
including issue costs, and the amortisation of any other 
differences between the amount initially recognised and the 
redemption price.
Net gains and losses in respect of mark-to-market adjustments  
on financial instruments carried at fair value, fair value adjustments 
to the carrying value of hedged items that form part of fair value 
hedges and foreign exchange adjustments are included in 
non-trading items in the consolidated income statement.
Net gains and losses on financial guarantees are included in 
discontinued non-trading items.
Share-based payment transactions 
Certain employees (including directors) of the Group receive 
remuneration in the form of equity settled share-based payment 
transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for 
shares or rights over shares (equity settled transactions).
The cost of equity settled transactions is measured by reference 
to the fair value at the date on which they are granted. The fair 
value is determined using a binomial model, further details of 
which are given in note 32. In valuing equity settled transactions, 
no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than 
conditions linked to the price of the shares of Ladbrokes plc 
(market conditions).
The cost of equity settled transactions is recognised together with 
a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the 
performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which 
the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award (vesting 
date). The cumulative expense recognised for equity settled 
transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects 
the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the number 
of awards that, in the opinion of the directors of the Group at that 
date, based on the best available estimate of the number of equity 
instruments, will ultimately vest.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, 
except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market 
condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or 
not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other 
performance conditions are satisfied.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional  
share dilution in the computation of earnings per share as shown  
in note 13.
The Group has an employee share incentive plan and an employee 
share trust for the granting of non-transferable options to 
executives and senior employees. Shares in the Group held by the 
employee share trust are treated as treasury shares and presented 
in the balance sheet as a deduction from equity. Refer to 
consolidated statement of changes in equity.
The Group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of 
IFRS 2 Share-based Payment in respect of equity settled awards 
and has applied IFRS 2 only to equity settled awards granted after 
7 November 2002 that had not vested on 1 January 2006.
Future accounting developments
IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures (Revised) was issued in 
November 2009. The Group is required to adopt this standard for 
the year ended 31 December 2011. IAS 24R simplifies the 
identification of related party relationships, particularly in relation 
to significant influence and joint control. These changes must be 
applied retrospectively with earlier application being permitted, 
with disclosure of such fact.
IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation – Classification of 
Rights Issues (Amendment) was issued in October 2009. The 
Group is required to adopt this standard for the year ended  
31 December 2011. The definition of a financial liability has been 
amended to classify rights issues (and certain options or warrants) 
as equity instruments. This amendment is to be applied 
retrospectively with early application permitted, with disclosure  
of such fact.
IFRIC 14 Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement 
(Amendment) was issued in November 2009. The Group  
is required to adopt this amendment for the year ended  
31 December 2011. The amendment to IFRIC 14 provides 
guidance on assessing the recoverable amount of a net pension 
asset and permits an entity to treat the prepayment of a minimum 
funding requirement as an asset. The amendment is required to 
be applied retrospectively to the beginning of the earliest period 
presented in the first financial statements in which the entity 
applied the original interpretation. 
IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments 
was issued in November 2009. The Group is required to adopt this 
amendment for the year ended 31 December 2011. IFRIC 19 
clarifies that equity instruments issued to a creditor to extinguish  
a financial liability qualify as consideration paid. The equity 
instruments issued are measured at their fair value, unless this 
cannot be reliably measured, in which case they are measured at 
the fair value of the liability extinguished. Any gain or loss is 
recognised immediately in profit or loss. If the amendment results 
in a change in accounting policy, this is applied retrospectively. 
Earlier application is permitted and must be disclosed.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments was reissued in October 2010.  
The Group is required to adopt this standard for the year ended 
31 December 2013. The first phase of IFRS 9 addresses the 
classification and measurement of financial assets. The key 
requirements of IFRS 9 are that at initial recognition, all financial 
assets are measured at fair value with different requirements for 
subsequent measurement for debt and equity instruments. Phase 
1 of IFRS 9 can be early adopted. The standard is to be applied 
retrospectively; however, early adopters get some transitional relief 
from restating comparative figures.
The Group has decided not to early adopt the above standards, 
and is currently assessing their impact on its financial statements. 
There are no other IFRSs or IFRICs in issue but not yet effective 
that are expected to have a significant impact for the Group.

6 Segment information
Management has determined the Group’s operating segments based on the reports reviewed by the Board of Directors to make 
strategic decisions. 
The Group’s continuing businesses are organised and managed according to the nature of the services provided, which permits 
aggregation of the Group’s operating segments into five reportable segments. The Group’s reportable segments are:
 UK Retail: comprises betting activities in the shop estate in Great Britain.
 Other European Retail: comprises all activities connected with the Ireland (North and South), Belgium and Spain shop estates.
 Digital (formerly eGaming): comprises betting and gaming activities from online and mobile operations.
 Core Telephone Betting: comprises activities relating to bets taken on the telephone, excluding High Rollers.
 High Rollers: comprises activities relating to bets taken on the telephone from High Rollers.
The discontinued operations comprise Italy Retail and Hotels in 2010 and Italy Retail, Casino and Hotels in 2009. 
The Board assesses the performance of operating segments based on a measure of profit before interest and tax. This measurement 
basis excludes the effect of non-trading income and expenditure from the operating segments.
Transfer prices between operating segments are on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties. Statutory reports and

In addition to salary, employees may qualify for various benefit schemes operated by the Group. Eligibility for benefits is normally 
determined primarily according to an employee’s length of service and level of responsibility. The amounts of some benefits are 
proportionate to individual salary.
Benefits may include paid leave for holidays, maternity and illness, as well as insured benefits. The latter can cover private healthcare for 
the employee and their immediate family, long-term disability, personal accident and death in service cover. Company cars, including 
fuel benefits, are provided predominantly to meet job requirements but also to certain executives.
The principal benefit schemes are:
(i) Pensions
 (a) Ladbrokes Group Stakeholder Pension Plan 
   New employees in the UK are offered membership of Ladbrokes Group Stakeholder Pension Plan, a defined contribution pension 
scheme. Subject to meeting certain eligibility and employment grade criteria, the Group matches employees’ contributions up to a 
maximum of 15% of base salary.
 (b)  Ladbrokes Pension Plan (LPP)  
Members contribute on average six per cent of pensionable salary per annum. Benefit generally accrues to provide a target 
pension of two thirds (for joiners after June 2002: half) of final pensionable salary for an employee attaining age 65 with at least 40 
years’ membership. A spouse’s pension is payable following death.
   LPP – Executive Section 
Members contribute on average seven per cent of pensionable salary per annum. Benefit accrues to provide a target pension from 
all sources of two thirds of final pensionable salary for an executive attaining age 60 with at least 20 years’ membership (for joiners 
after June 2002, employees attaining age 65 with at least 26.7 years’ service). A spouse’s and children’s pensions are payable 
following death. 
   Senior executives subject to the Earnings Cap: 
Following the A-Day pensions review, the pre-A-Day Revenue limits regime has been maintained as the framework for the LPP, 
including a LPP-specific Earnings Cap. Executive directors and senior executives have a choice between:
  (i)  membership of the Executive Section of the LPP plus a cash supplement of up to 30% of base salary above the Earnings Cap; 
or
  (ii) a cash supplement of up to 30% of base salary in lieu of membership of the LPP.
(ii) Share-based payments

  In 2010, the adjustment in respect of prior periods of £262.2 million includes £261.9 million as a result of the HMRC tax settlement.
In April 2010, the Group announced that it had reached a settlement with HMRC which covered substantially all outstanding items in 
respect of tax years to 31 December 2007. The settlement has resulted in the recognition within the tax charge of a £261.9 million tax 
credit in relation to prior years. The settlement included £46.2 million relating to the recognition of a deferred tax asset. The asset 
primarily reflected the recognition of tax losses available for offset in future periods. The settlement resulted in a cash repayment of 
£80.0 million of corporation tax by HMRC, which is offset by current year payments of £28.1 million. There was also interest income  
of £20.0 million in respect of an interest rebate following the HMRC tax settlement. Statutory reports and

The Group has further tax losses at 31 December 2010 of £71.3 million (2009: £74.2 million) that are available indefinitely for offset against 
future taxable profits of the companies in which the losses arose. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these 
losses as there is insufficient certainty that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of temporary differences 
may be deducted. There are no significant taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associated 
undertakings and joint ventures.
The Chancellor, in the Budget on 22 June 2010, announced reductions in the main rate of corporation tax and rates of capital 
allowances. The standard rate of UK Corporation Tax will be reduced from 28% to 27% from 1 April 2011, and there will be progressive 
annual reductions of a further 1% until a rate of 24% is reached with effect from 1 April 2014. The Finance Act (No 2) 2010 received Royal 
Assent on 27 July 2010, with the first of the rate reductions being substantively enacted from 21 July 2010. 
The deferred tax assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are calculated at the substantively enacted rate of 27%. Whilst detailed 
calculations have not been prepared at this stage, it is estimated that the impact of the remaining annual corporation tax rate reductions 
would be to reduce the value of the group’s deferred tax liabilities at the balance sheet date by approximately £13.0 million, and to 
reduce the value of the group’s deferred tax assets at the balance sheet date by approximately £12.0 million.

13 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share has been calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to shareholders of the Company of  
£348.3 million (2009: £74.4 million) by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year of 904.6 million (2009: 751.4 million). 
At 31 December 2010, there were 907.4 million 28
1
/ 3 pence ordinary shares in issue excluding treasury shares (939.1 million including 
treasury shares). At 31 December 2009, there were 902.0 million 28
1
/ 3 pence ordinary shares in issue excluding treasury shares 
(933.8 million including treasury shares).
At 31 December 2010, 12.7 million (2009: 15.5 million) shares were deemed anti-dilutive for the purpose of calculating adjusted earnings 
per share.
The calculation of adjusted earnings per share before non-trading items is included as it provides a better understanding of the 
underlying performance of the Group. Non-trading items are defined in note 2, and disclosed in notes 7, 11 and 14.

Goodwill and intangible assets included in continuing operations
Goodwill relates to the consideration exceeding the fair value of net assets of business combinations including the deferred tax liability 
arising on statutory licence acquisitions.
Licences comprises the cost of acquired betting shop licences. The acquired betting shop licences are not amortised as they are 
considered to have an indefinite life for a combination of reasons:
 Ladbrokes is a leading operator in well-established markets;
 there is a proven, sustained demand for bookmaking services; and 
 existing law acts to restrict entry.
Ladbrokes has a very strong track record of renewing its betting permits and licences at minimal cost. 
Software relates to the cost of software acquisition and the capitalised costs in respect of internally generated software.
The customer relationship relates to the Group’s acquisition of its former partner in the Nordic region. The existing arrangement 
constituted an intangible right, which was valued at the acquisition date. Having considered the Group’s long term business plans for  
the Nordics, the Group concluded that the relationship had an indefinite life as there was no foreseeable limit to the period over which 
the asset was expected to generate net cash inflows.

16 Impairment testing of goodwill and indeﬁnite life intangible assets
The Group tests annually for impairment and at each reporting date if there are indications that goodwill and indefinite life intangible 
assets are impaired, by comparing the carrying amounts of these assets with their recoverable amounts (being the higher of fair value 
less costs to sell and value in use).
Goodwill
Goodwill is tested for impairment by allocating its carrying amount to groups of cash generating units (CGUs) expected to benefit from 
the synergies of the combination. If the recoverable amount of a group of CGUs exceeds its carrying amount, the group and any goodwill 
allocated to that group would be regarded as not impaired. Goodwill has been allocated as follows:
 
2010 
£m
2009 
£m
Goodwill
UK Retail 35.4 35.4
Other European Retail 13.1 13.2
48.5 48.6
No impairments were identified in 2010.
Licences
Licences have been allocated to the individual UK and Other European Retail CGUs that are expected to benefit from the assets. Each 
CGU represents the lowest level within the Group at which the licences are monitored for internal management purposes which in the 
majority of instances is an individual shop. The carrying value of licences at 31 December 2010 was £496.1 million (2009: £507.2 million) 
allocated as £322.9 million to UK Retail (2009: £326.7 million) and £173.2 million to Other European Retail (2009: £180.5 million). 
Basis on which recoverable amount has been determined
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. These are based on budgets approved by 
management for the next three years extrapolated thereafter using a 2.5% growth rate (2009: 2.5%). This rate does not exceed the 
average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
Key assumptions used in value in use calculations
The key assumptions taken into account by management are the amounts staked, the gross win margin and the discount rate applied. 
The estimated amounts staked and gross win margin are based upon historic experience, management’s best estimate of future trends 
and performance taking account of industry sources. The discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 11.0% (2009: 10.5%).
The recoverable amounts of certain individual UK and Other European Retail CGUs were below their carrying amounts at 31 December 
2010 and accordingly an impairment loss of £8.5 million has been recognised in the consolidated income statement for the year ended 
31 December 2010 (2009: £3.2 million) within the non-trading ‘Depreciation and amounts written off non-current assets’ line item, 
allocated as £3.4 million to UK Retail and £5.1 million to Other European Retail.
The recoverable amount of individual CGUs is sensitive to changes in cash flows or discount rate. Change in the cash flow projections or 
the discount rate would trigger a further impairment loss. For example, an increase of 0.5% in the discount rate would have resulted in a 
further impairment loss of approximately £0.5 million for UK Retail and £5.9 million for Other European Retail, or a reduction in projected 
cashflows of 5% would have resulted in a further impairment loss of approximately £0.9 million for UK Retail and £7.5 million for Other

Customer relationships of £40.5 million (2009: £40.5 million) have been allocated to a CGU within the Digital operating segment.
The recoverable amount of the CGU is considerably in excess of the carrying amount of the customer relationships and accordingly  
no impairment charge was required.  Statutory reports and

 The depreciation charge for the year includes accelerated depreciation of £7.1 million recorded in non-trading items (note 7).
At 31 December 2010, the Group had entered into contractual commitments for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment 
amounting to £1.2 million (2009: £1.3 million).
The recoverable amounts of certain property, plant and equipment within individual UK and Other European Retail CGUs were  
assessed as at 31 December 2010 and accordingly an impairment reversal of £1.4 million in UK Retail and an impairment loss of  
£0.2 million in Other European Retail have been recognised in the consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 December 2010 
(2009: £2.9 million charge) within the non-trading ‘Depreciation and amounts written off non-current assets’ line item.

25 Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s treasury function provides a centralised service for the provision of finance and the management and control of liquidity, 
foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The function operates as a cost centre and manages the Group’s treasury exposures to 
reduce risk in accordance with policies approved by the Board. 
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, overdrafts, loan notes, bonds, financial guarantee contracts, and cash 
and short-term deposits. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The Group has 
various other financial instruments such as trade receivables, trade payables and accruals that arise directly from its operations.
The Group enters into derivative transactions, such as forward foreign exchange contracts, currency swaps and interest rate swaps. The 
purpose of these transactions is to assist in the management of the Group’s financial risk and to generate the desired effective currency 
and interest rate profile. At 31 December 2010, the Group had no such derivatives.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Group’s policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken other 
than betting and gaming transactions. The Group’s exposure to ante post betting and gaming transactions is not significant.
The Group has a £2.0 billion Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN) programme that it uses to increase the flexibility of funding with regards to 
source, cost, size and maturity. At 31 December 2010, one public Eurobond issue remained under this programme, being the remainder 
of the £250 million 7.125% bond, maturing July 2012. During the year the Group repurchased £118.6 million of the 7.125% Sterling bond 
due 2012. At 31 December 2010, the remaining amount under this bond was £131.0 million. Funds raised via the EMTN programme have 
been used to repay bank debt.
In addition, in March 2010, the Group issued a £225 million 7.625% Sterling bond due 2017 which was fully subscribed, with issue costs 
of £3.9 million.
The main financial risks for the Group are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Board reviews and 
agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. The Group also monitors the market price risk arising 
from all financial instruments. 
Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on interest bearing loans and borrowings and on cash and cash equivalents.
The Group’s policy for the year ended 31 December 2010 was to maintain a minimum of 25% (2009: 25%) of net debt at fixed interest 
rates to reduce its sensitivity to movements in variable short-term interest rates. At 31 December 2010, £352.6 million or 69.2%  
(2009: £457.3 million or 63.9%) of the Group’s gross borrowings were at fixed rates.
Interest on financial instruments at floating rates is re-priced at intervals of less than six months. Interest on financial instruments at fixed 
rates is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
Interest rate sensitivity 
The table below demonstrates the sensitivity to reasonably possible changes in interest rates on income and equity for the year when 
this movement is applied to the carrying value of financial assets and liabilities.

100 basis points decrease 0.7 1.6 – (0.3)
200 basis points decrease 1.4 3.0 – (0.7)
The sensitivity has been estimated by applying the basis points movement to the carrying value of the financial assets and liabilities, 
subject to interest at floating rates, held by the Group at the year end.
Foreign currency risk
The Group carries out operations through a number of foreign enterprises and has foreign exchange exposure to the Euro, arising from 
foreign currency assets. The Group’s exposure to currency risk at a transactional level is monitored and reviewed regularly. 
Until 30 June 2009, the Group sought to mitigate the effect of its structural currency exposure arising from the translation of  
foreign currency assets through Euro drawings under its committed facilities. The Group ceased formal net investment hedging  
on 30 June 2009.
The total carrying value of the Group’s foreign currency borrowings at 31 December 2010 was £nil (2009: £17.6 million), of which £nil 
(2009: £16.4 million) was swapped into sterling.  Statutory reports and

Exchange rate sensitivity
The impact of 10% and 20% movements in the exchange rates between sterling and the Euro is shown below:

10% decrease in the exchange rate (0.1) (0.3) 9.5 12.0
20% decrease in the exchange rate (0.3) (0.7) 21.4 27.0
The impact on equity relates primarily to unhedged foreign exchange exposure arising on translation of foreign currency assets and 
liabilities.
These sensitivities have been calculated before adjusting for tax and have been estimated by applying the percentage movement to the 
carrying value of financial assets and liabilities denominated in Euros at the year end.
Credit risk
The Group is not subject to significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread across a large number of counterparties  
and customers.
It is the Group’s policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. In addition, 
receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis. Any changes to credit terms are assessed and authorised by senior 
management on an individual basis. 
The Group’s High Rollers division consists of individuals who place sizeable stakes. The Group manages this activity and the associated 
risk exposure by utilising senior management expertise to manage the levels of stakes placed. Of the £3.4 million (2009: £13.7 million) 
trade receivables balance, £2.8 million (2009: £12.6 million) relates to the Group’s Core Telephone Betting and High Rollers divisions. 
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents and a loan to a 
joint venture, the Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying 
amount of these instruments. Credit risk in respect of cash and cash equivalents is managed by restricting those transactions to banks 
that have a defined minimum credit rating and by setting an exposure ceiling per bank. 
The Group also has exposure to credit risk arising from the financial guarantee contracts provided by the Group. This risk is partly 
mitigated by the indemnity received from Hilton Hotels Corporation for any loss incurred in connection with these guarantees. For further 
detail of these guarantees refer to note 26.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of borrowings with a range of 
maturities. The Group’s policy on liquidity is to ensure that there are sufficient medium-term and long-term committed borrowing 
facilities to meet the medium-term funding requirements. At 31 December 2010, there were undrawn committed borrowing facilities of 
£718.6 million (2009: £428.1 million). Total committed facilities had an average maturity of 2.5 years (2009: 2.6 years).

two years.
Hedging activities
Hedging of net investments in foreign operations
The Group ceased to designate its committed Euro borrowings as a partial hedge of the net investments in its European subsidiaries  
from 30 June 2009. Pre-tax losses of £nil (2009: £10.4 million) (post-tax losses of £nil (2009: £7.5 million)) arising on the translation of 
these borrowings have been deferred in reserves during the year.
Fair value hedges
The Group uses interest rate and cross currency swaps to manage its fair value exposure to interest rate movements on its borrowings 
by swapping borrowings from fixed rates to floating rates in accordance with the policy of the Group. Contracts with nominal values of 
£nil (2009: £16.2 million) have fixed interest receipts and floating interest payments based on LIBOR. The fair value of the swaps at  
31 December 2010 is £nil (2009: asset of £0.4 million). 
Cash ﬂow hedges
The Group previously used interest rate swaps to manage its cash flow exposure. At 31 December 2009, the Group had contracts  
for interest rate swaps with nominal values of £199.0 million maturing between January 2011 and January 2012. The fair value at  
31 December 2009 was a liability of £9.2 million which was deferred in equity in retained earnings. During the year the Group terminated 
these interest rate swaps, as the underlying interest cash flows were no longer expected to occur. As a result, £9.1 million of losses 
deferred to equity have been reclassified to the consolidated income statement as a non-trading finance cost, and £0.5 million remains 
deferred in equity until the forecast cash flows occur in the period to August 2011. 
There is no ineffectiveness recognised in the consolidated income statement arising from cash flow hedges.
Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments
The Group continued to hold cross currency swaps until their maturity in July 2009. These swaps did not qualify as net investment 
hedges under IAS 39 but were economic hedges of the Group’s foreign currency borrowings. The fair value of the Group’s foreign 
exchange swaps at 31 December 2010 was a liability of £nil (2009: £0.1 million).
Capital management
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a credit rating that enables the Group to raise 
funds at an economic interest rate and to maintain healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder 
value. The Group manages its capital structure (net debt and equity – see note 27 and the consolidated statement of changes in equity 
for further details) and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the 
Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares. 
The Group monitors capital using a net debt to EBITDA ratio. The target range is less than 3.0 (2009: less than 3.0) times net debt to 
EBITDA ratio. The ratio at 31 December 2010 was 1.9 (2.0 adjusted to remove profit from High Rollers) and at 31 December 2009 was  
2.5 (3.3 adjusted to remove profit from High Rollers).  Statutory reports and

Fair value of ﬁnancial instruments
Derivatives used for hedging and assets and liabilities designated as at fair value through profit or loss are carried at fair value.
The fair value of cash at bank and in hand approximates to book value due to its short-term maturity. The fair value of the £250 million 
7.125% bond at 31 December 2010, of which £131.0 million remained outstanding, was £138.3 million (2009: £261.6 million). The fair value 
of the £225 million 7.625% bond at 31 December 2010 was £228.0 million. The amortised cost of interest bearing loans and borrowings, 
with the exception of the £250 million 7.125% bond and £225 million 7.625% bond and the carrying value of all other assets and liabilities, 
approximates to fair value.
The hierarchy of the Group’s ﬁnancial instruments carried at fair value is as follows:

The Group classifies all derivatives as level 2 financial instruments, as their fair value is determined based on techniques for which all 
significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Financial guarantee contracts, included within other non-current financial liabilities, are classified as level 3 financial instruments, as their 
fair value is measured using techniques where the significant inputs are not based on observable market data. Further information about 
financial guarantee contracts, including sensitivities, and a reconciliation of changes in fair value in the year, is included below.
Other current financial liabilities are deferred revenues associated with the fair value of reward points issued. Included in trade and other 
payables are £6.0 million of antepost liabilities (2009: £4.6 million); both are classified as level 3 financial instruments as their fair value is 
measured using techniques where the significant inputs are not based on observable market data. Changes in the fair value of these 
instruments are recorded in the consolidated income statement.
No financial instruments are classified as level 1, for which fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or 
liabilities. During the year ended 31 December 2010, there were no transfers between level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements.
Financial guarantee contracts
The Group has given guarantees to third parties in respect of lease liabilities of former subsidiaries within the disposed hotels division. 
The Group received an indemnity from Hilton Hotels Corporation (HHC), at the time of the hotels disposal, in relation to any loss the 
Group may subsequently incur under these third party guarantees. The guarantees expire between 2011 and 2042 and the lease 
liabilities comprise a combination of minimum contractual and turnover based elements.
The undiscounted maximum liability exposure in respect of the guarantees for all periods up to 2042 is £901.2 million (31 December 
2009: £933.0 million), with a maximum indemnity receivable of the same amount. Included in the maximum liability exposure is  
£505.9 million (31 December 2009: £517.2 million) in relation to the turnover based element of the hotel rentals and £395.3 million  
(31 December 2009: £415.8 million) in relation to the minimum contractual based element. The undiscounted maximum liability 
represents the total of all guaranteed rentals under the non-cancellable agreements into which the Group has entered.
The net present value of the maximum exposure at 31 December 2010 is £385.9 million (31 December 2009: £407.7 million). Included in 
the net present value of the maximum exposure is £193.4 million (31 December 2009: £201.0 million) in relation to the turnover based 
element of the hotel rentals and £192.5 million (31 December 2009: £206.7 million) in relation to the minimum contractual based element.
The Group monitors its exposure under these guarantees on a regular basis and seeks, where appropriate, to novate its obligations. 
The financial guarantees liability has been valued using a probability based model to estimate the net present value of the liabilities 
payable in the event of a default by the hotels covered by the guarantees, and the probability of such a default and new tenants  
being identified.
At 31 December 2010 the Group has recognised a financial liability of £8.1 million (31 December 2009: £9.3 million) in respect  
of these guarantees.

The change in the year in the fair value of the financial guarantees liability has been recognised in the consolidated income statement 
and classified in discontinued operations.
No asset has been recognised in respect of the indemnity at 31 December 2010 (2009: £nil).
The key assumption in the probability model is the hotels default rate. A rate of 2.2% has been used at 31 December 2010 (2009: 2.2%). 
A 0.5 percentage point increase in the default rate would increase the financial liability by £1.5 million.

The Ladbrokes Share Ownership Trust (‘LSOT’) is used in connection with the Company’s Deferred Bonus Plan, the Ladbrokes Growth 
Plan, the Restricted Share Plan and the 2010 Share Award Plan (together ‘the Plans’) (refer to note 32 for further details of the Plans and 
the various performance conditions). The LSOT may also be used in connection with the Company’s other share-based plans, including 
the 1978 Share Option Scheme and the International Share Option Scheme. The trustee of the LSOT, Computershare Trustees (CI) 
Limited, subscribes for the Company’s shares or purchases them in the open market, as required, on the basis of regular reviews of the 
anticipated commitments of the Group, with financing provided by the Company.
The Ladbrokes Share Incentive Plan (‘LSIP’) is currently used in connection with the Company’s OWN share plan (‘the OWN plan’) and 
Freeshare share plan (‘Freeshare’) (refer to note 32 for further details). The trustee of the LSIP, Computershare Trustees Limited, 
purchases the Company’s shares in the open market, as required, using: (i) deductions made from the salaries of participants in the 
OWN plan; (ii) dividends paid on the shares held by the LSIP and (iii) financing provided by the Company to make awards of Freeshares 
to employees with more than one year’s service. Under the OWN plan, to match those shares acquired using participants’ salary 
deductions, one additional share is allotted by the Company to the LSIP for every two held per employee.
All expenses of the LSOT and LSIP are settled directly by the Company and charged in the financial statements as incurred. 
The following table shows the number of shares held in trust that have not yet vested unconditionally and the associated reduction in

Deﬁned contribution schemes
The total cost charged to the consolidated income statement of £0.9 million for continuing operations (2009: £1.0 million) and £nil for 
discontinued operations (2009: £0.7 million) represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates specified in the 
rules of the scheme.
Deﬁned beneﬁt plans
The Group’s only significant defined benefit retirement plan is the Ladbrokes Pension Plan, which is a final salary pension plan for UK 
employees. Assets are held separately from those of the Group. Although the Group is responsible for the operation of this arrangement, 
professional advisers are appointed to assist the trustees in running it.
The last formal actuarial valuation of the Ladbrokes Pension Plan was carried out with an effective date of 30 September 2007, with the 
next valuation as at 30 June 2010 currently in process. 
The latest actuarial valuation was updated to 31 December 2010 by an independent qualified actuary in accordance with IAS 19 
Employee Benefits. The value of the defined benefit obligation and current service cost have been measured using the projected unit 
credit method, as required by IAS 19.
In July 2010, the Government announced that in future statutory indexation for pensions would be linked to the Consumer Prices Index 
(CPI) rather than the, historically, higher Retail Prices Index. On the basis of legal advice, the Group has assessed that this change will 
act to reduce the Group’s pension liabilities. To reflect this, in 2010 the Group has recognised an actuarial gain of £8.6 million outside 
profit and loss through other comprehensive income.

The overall expected return on plan assets was derived as an average of the long-term expected rates of return on each of the major 
asset classes invested in, weighted by the allocations of assets among the classes over the long term. The sources used to determine 
the best estimate of long-term returns include bond yields, inflation and investment market expectations derived from market data and 
analysts’ or government’s expectations. At 31 December 2010, the long-term expected rates of return on equity instruments and debt 
instruments were assumed to be 8.0% pa and 4.4% pa, respectively, for the plan. The equivalent assumptions at 31 December 2009 
were 8.2% pa and 4.6% pa respectively.
The post retirement mortality assumed for most members is based on the standard SAPS mortality table with the CMI 2009 projections, 
which takes into account future improvements, adjusted to reflect plan specific experience. The assumption used implies that the 
expected future lifetime of members aged 65 in 2010 is 86.6 years for males and 87.6 years for females. For members with large 
pensions a longer lifetime is assumed (89.9 for males and 90.4 for females). The post retirement mortality assumption has been updated 
since 2009 when expected future lifetimes were generally assumed to be 85.8 years for males aged 65 and 87.8 years for females, with 
longer lifetimes assumed for members with large pensions of 89.2 years for males and 91.0 years for females. Statutory reports and

Changes to the assumptions will impact the amounts recognised in the consolidated balance sheet and the consolidated income

  This ignores the potential positive impact that a general fall in bond yields may have on the value

32 Share-based payments
Ladbrokes plc has the following share-based payment plans, all of which are settled by equity: the Deferred Bonus Plan, the 
Performance Share Plan, the Ladbrokes Growth Plan, the International Share Option Scheme, the 1978 Share Option Scheme, the 
Restricted Share Plan, Sharesave, the OWN Plan, Freeshare and the 2010 Share Award Plan. The plans and the various performance 
conditions are discussed in more detail below. 
(i)  Deferred Bonus Plan
For certain senior executives, one third of the gross annual bonus (changed from half of the gross annual bonus in respect of the bonus 
year 2007) is delivered in shares that vest after three years. For other employees, one third of the gross annual bonus (changed from half 
of the gross annual bonus in respect of the bonus year 2007) is delivered in shares that vest after two years.
(ii)  Performance Share Plan 
An award under the Performance Share Plan consists of a conditional allocation of shares that will vest, subject to the achievement of 
performance conditions, at the end of the three year period. The awards have two separate performance conditions; half of the award 
vests based on TSR and half of the award vests based on EPS.
(iii)  Ladbrokes Growth Plan
Awards are subject to share price growth performance conditions. Any share price target must be attained throughout a period of 30 
consecutive dealing days and performance is assessed over a five year period. Up to one third of the award may vest at the end of year 
three if the performance targets have been achieved at that time. A further third may vest at the end of year four if the targets have been 
met at that time. The remainder of the award may vest at the end of year five, subject to the achievement of the performance targets. 
The award can take the form of a restricted interest in a share held jointly with Computershare Trustees (CI) Limited, the trustee of the 
Ladbrokes Share Ownership Trust and a nil cost option, which together will entitle the executive to the value of a whole share.
(iv) International Share Option Scheme and the 1978 Share Option Scheme
The share options granted are all market value options with a three year vesting period. Vested options lapse if they have not been 
exercised within ten years of the date of grant. All options have an EPS growth based performance condition. No options were granted in 
2010 and there is no present intention to grant options in the future.

(v)  Restricted Share Plan
Awards under the Restricted Share Plan will vest in their entirety after three years. However, for awards granted prior to May 2010, 
employees can elect for 50% of the award to vest after two years. Awards are not subject to performance conditions.
(vi)  1983 Savings Related Share Option Scheme (‘Sharesave’) 
Under Sharesave, options are granted at a 20% discount to market value. The scheme operates with a savings period of either three or 
five years, at the end of which the option may be exercised.
(vii)  OWN Plan 
Under the OWN Plan, employees can contribute up to £75 per month to acquire shares. For every two shares purchased, the Group 
provides a match of one additional share. 
(viii)  Freeshare 
Under Freeshare, an award of up to £250 in value was made to participating employees on reaching one year’s service. No new awards 
will be made from 2011 onwards. 
(ix)  2010 Share Award Plan 
An award under the 2010 Share Award Plan consists of a one-off compensatory share award to the Chief Executive in the form of a nil 
cost option. The award is not subject to performance conditions and will vest after three years.
For a more detailed description of each of the above plans, refer to the Directors’ remuneration report.

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was £1.52 (2009: £1.73).  
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was 24.9 pence (2009: 33.0 pence). The weighted average remaining 
contractual life for the share options outstanding at 31 December 2010 is between three and eight years (2009: between two and eight 
years). The range of exercise prices for options outstanding at the end of the year was £1.10 – £3.60 (2009: £1.21 – £3.60).
At 31 December 2010, there were 8,622,081 options outstanding with an exercise price between £1.10 and £2.00, 3,416,505 options 
outstanding with an exercise price between £2.01 and £3.00, and 2,572,425 options outstanding with an exercise price between  
£3.01 and £3.60. 
At 31 December 2009, there were 8,505,615 options outstanding with an exercise price between £1.21 and £2.00, 3,298,801 options 
outstanding with an exercise price between £2.01 and £3.00, and 4,902,085 options outstanding with an exercise price between  
£3.01 and £3.60.
The inputs into the binomial model are as follows:

Weighted average share price (£) 1.40 1.44
Weighted average exercise price (£) 1.10 1.38
Expected volatility (%) 25.0 33.0
Expected life (years) 4.19 4.24
Risk free rate (%) 3.63 3.12
Expected dividends (%) 7.41 5.71
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous four years.  
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, 
exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised an expense of £3.8 million (2009: £3.9 million) relating to equity settled share-based payment transactions.

 2010 2009
Number 3,369,375 3,768,163

The fair value of share awards was measured by calculating the present value of the dividends receivable between the grant date  
and the vesting date and valuing the market related performance conditions through the use of a closed-form model, similar to a  
Monte Carlo simulation.

Operating lease commitments – Group as lessee
The Group has a number of lease agreements that, pursuant to their economic substance, qualify as non-cancellable operating lease 
agreements. These primarily relate to rents payable on land and buildings. The terms of the leases vary significantly but can broadly be 
summarised as follows:
Lease terms
Shop leases are typically 15 years with a tenant only break clause at 10 years and rent reviews every five years. Other leases are typically 
between three and 10 years.
Determination of rent payments
Rent payments are based on the amount specified in the agreement.
Terms of renewal
The agreements are not terminated automatically after expiry of the lease term and in the majority of cases, lease extension options have 
been agreed upon and in many other cases, there will be an opportunity to negotiate lease extensions with the lessor.
Restrictions
There are no restrictions imposed upon the Group, concerning dividends, additional debt or further leasing under any of the existing 
lease arrangements.
Subleases
The Group does sublease areas of leased properties and receives sublease payments from third parties.

The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report  
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable laws  
and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors 
have elected to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. Under Company law 
the directors must not approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that 
period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are 
required to:
  select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
   make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
  state whether the applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained by the financial statements;
  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will 
continue in business. 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Group and enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence 
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity  
of the Company’s website and legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Statement of directors’ 
responsibilities in relation to the 
Consolidated ﬁnancial statements
Directors’ statement pursuant to the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed in 
pages 30 and 31 of this Annual Report, confirm that, to the best  
of each person’s knowledge and belief:
    the financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union, give a true and fair view  
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the 
Group; and
    the directors’ report contained in the Annual Report includes a 
fair review of the development and performance of the business 
and the position of the Group, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement  
of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Balance Sheet,  
the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the 
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and the related notes 1  
to 35. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in 
their preparation is applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body,  
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state 
to the Company’s members those matters we are required to  
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.  
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities set out on page 99, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the Group financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to 
audit the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate  
to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on ﬁnancial statements
In our opinion, the Group financial statements:
  give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 
31 December 2010 and of its profit for the year then ended;
  have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union; and
  have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
  the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial 
year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the Group financial statements; and
  the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement 
set out on pages 32 to 36 with respect to internal control and 
risk management systems in relation to financial reporting 
processes and about share capital structures is consistent with 
the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if,  
in our opinion:
  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made;
  we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit; or
  a Corporate Governance Statement has not been prepared by 
the Company.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
  the directors’ statement, set out on page 38, in relation to going 
concern; and
  the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the 
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the June 
2008 Combined Code specified for our review; and
  certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on 
directors’ remuneration.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the parent Company financial 
statements of Ladbrokes plc for the year ended 31 December 
2010 and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
that is described as having been audited.

1 Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical 
cost convention except as otherwise stated. They have been 
drawn up to comply with applicable UK accounting standards. 
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption from preparing 
a cash flow statement under the provisions of FRS 1 (revised).  
The required consolidated cash flow statement has been included 
within the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
2 Change in accounting policies
There have been no changes in accounting policies during the year.
3 Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies
Investments
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision  
for impairment.
The Company assesses these investments for impairment 
wherever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable. If any 
such indication of impairment exists, the Company makes an 
estimate of the recoverable amount. If the recoverable amount is 
less than the value of the investment, the investment is considered 
to be impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.  
An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the profit and 
loss account.
Financial assets
Financial assets are recognised when the Company becomes 
party to the contracts that give rise to them.
The Company classifies financial assets at inception as either 
financial assets at fair value or loans and receivables. On initial 
recognition, loans and receivables are measured at fair value. 
Financial assets at fair value comprise guarantees provided to the 
Company. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are 
measured initially at fair value, with transaction costs taken directly 
to the profit and loss account. Subsequently, the fair values are 
remeasured and gains and losses from changes therein are 
recognised in the profit and loss account.
Financial guarantees provided to the Company are classified as 
financial assets and are measured at fair value by estimating the 
probability of the guarantees being called upon and the related 
cash inflows to the Company.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities comprise guarantees given to third parties.  
On initial recognition, financial liabilities are measured at fair value 
plus transaction costs where they are not categorised as financial 
liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities at 
fair value through profit or loss are measured initially at fair value, 
with transaction costs taken directly to the profit and loss account. 
Subsequently, the fair values are remeasured and gains and  
losses from changes therein are recognised in the profit and  
loss account.
Financial guarantee contracts
The Company has provided financial guarantees to third parties  
in respect of lease obligations of certain of the Company’s former 
subsidiaries within the disposed hotels division. 
Financial guarantee contracts are classified as financial liabilities 
and are measured at fair value by estimating the probability of the 
guarantees being called upon and the related cash outflows from 
the Company.
Derecognition of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities
Financial assets are derecognised when the right to receive cash 
flows from the assets has expired or when the Company has 
transferred its contractual right to receive the cash flows from the 
financial assets or has assumed an obligation to pay the received 
cash flows in full without material delay to a third party, and either:
  substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have been 
transferred; or
  substantially all the risks and rewards have neither been 
retained nor transferred but control is not retained.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation is 
discharged, cancelled or expires.
Taxation
Deferred tax is recognised as an asset or liability, at appropriate 
rates, in respect of transactions and events recognised in the 
financial statements of the current and previous periods that give 
the entity a right to pay less, or an obligation to pay more, tax in 
future periods. Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the 
extent it is probable that there will be suitable taxable profits from 
which they can be recovered.
No provision is made for any taxation on capital gains that would 
arise from the future disposal of any fixed assets shown in the 
financial statements at valuation, except to the extent that at the 
balance sheet date there is a binding sale agreement.
Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
Foreign currency translation
The presentation and functional currency of the Company and the 
functional currencies of its UK subsidiaries, is sterling. 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in sterling 
at the foreign currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
are retranslated at the foreign currency rate of exchange ruling at 
the balance sheet date. 
All foreign currency translation differences are taken to the profit 
and loss account with the exception of differences on foreign 
currency borrowings that provide a post-tax hedge against a net 
investment in a foreign entity. These are taken directly to equity 
until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are 
recognised in the profit and loss account. Tax charges and credits 
attributable to exchange differences on those borrowings are also 
dealt with in equity. 
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost 
in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the 
date of the initial transaction. Non-monetary items measured at 
fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange 
rate at the date when the fair value was determined.
Pensions
The Company is the principal employer of the Ladbrokes  
Pension Plan, a funded defined benefit group plan. The pension 
cost relating to the plan is assessed in accordance with the  
advice of independent qualified actuaries using the projected  
unit credit method.
Any actuarial gains or losses are taken to equity in the period  
in which they arise. Any past service costs are recognised 
immediately to the extent that benefits have already vested and, 
otherwise, are amortised on a straight line basis over the average 
period until the benefits vest.
The defined benefit asset recognised in the balance sheet 
represents the fair value of plan assets less the present value  
of defined benefit obligations as adjusted for unrecognised past 
service cost. If necessary, the net defined benefit surplus is limited 
to the amount that can be recovered through reduced Company 
contributions in the future plus any refunds that have been agreed 
at the balance sheet date.

Share-based payments
The cost of equity settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which they are granted. 
The fair value is determined using a binomial model, further details of which are given in note 32 of the consolidated IFRSs financial 
statements. In valuing equity settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to  
the price of the shares of Ladbrokes plc (market conditions). 
The cost of equity settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the 
performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award (vesting 
date). The cumulative expense recognised for equity settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent 
to which the vesting period has expired and the number of awards that, in the opinion of the directors of the Company at that date, 
based on the best available estimate of the number of equity instruments, will ultimately vest. 
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, 
which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance 
conditions are satisfied.
ESOP trusts
Where the Company holds its own equity shares through an ESOP trust these shares are shown as a reduction in equity.  
Any consideration paid or received for the purchase or sale of these shares is shown in the reconciliation of movements in shareholders’ 
funds and no gain or loss is recognised within the profit and loss account or the statement of total recognised gains and losses on the 
purchase, sale or cancellation of these shares.
Treasury shares
Own equity instruments that are reacquired (treasury shares) are deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss  
on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company’s own equity instruments.
4 Proﬁt and loss account of the parent Company
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the profit and loss account of the parent Company has not been separately 
presented in these financial statements. The parent Company loss for the year was £206.2 million (2009: loss of £532.4 million).

Financial guarantee contracts
The Company has given guarantees to third parties in respect of lease liabilities of former subsidiaries within the disposed hotels 
division. The Company received an indemnity from Hilton Hotels Corporation (HHC), at the time of the hotels disposal, in relation to any 
loss the Company may subsequently incur under these third party guarantees. The guarantees expire between 2010 and 2042 and the 
lease liabilities comprise a combination of minimum contractual and turnover based elements.
The undiscounted maximum liability exposure in respect of the guarantees for all periods up to 2042 is £901.2 million (31 December 
2009: £933.0 million), with a maximum indemnity receivable of the same amount. Included in the maximum liability exposure is £505.9 
million (31 December 2009: £517.2 million) in relation to the turnover based element of the hotel rentals and £395.3 million (31 December 
2009: £415.8 million) in relation to the minimum contractual based element. The undiscounted maximum liability represents the total of  
all guaranteed rentals under the non-cancellable agreements into which the Company has entered.
The net present value of the maximum exposure at 31 December 2010 is £385.9 million (31 December 2009: £407.7 million). Included in 
the net present value of the maximum exposure is £193.4 million (31 December 2009: £201.0 million) in relation to the turnover based 
element of the hotel rentals and £192.5 million (31 December 2009: £206.7 million) in relation to the minimum contractual based element.
The Company monitors its exposure under these guarantees on a regular basis and seeks, where appropriate, to novate its obligations. 
The financial guarantees liability has been valued using a probability based model to estimate the net present value of the liabilities payable  
in the event of a default by the hotels covered by the guarantees, and the probability of such a default and new tenants being identified.
At 31 December 2010 the Company has recognised a financial liability of £8.1 million (31 December 2009: £9.3 million) in respect of  
these guarantees.
No asset has been recognised in respect of the indemnity at 31 December 2010 (2009: £nil).
The key assumption in the probability model is the hotels default rate. A rate of 2.2% has been used at 31 December 2010 (2009: 2.2%). 
A 0.5 percentage point increase in the default rate would increase the financial liability by £1.5 million.

15 Pensions
The Company’s main pension plan is the Ladbrokes Pension Plan.
The last formal actuarial valuation of the plan was carried out with an effective date of 30 September 2007, with the next valuation as at 
30 June 2010 currently in process.
The latest actuarial valuation was updated to 31 December 2010 by an independent qualified actuary in accordance with FRS 17.  
The defined benefit obligations and current service cost have been measured using the projected unit credit method.
In July 2010, the Government announced that in future statutory indexation for pensions would be linked to the Consumer Prices Index 
(CPI) rather than the, historically, higher Retail Prices Index (RPI). On the basis of legal advice, the Company has assessed that this 
change will act to reduce the Company’s pension liabilities. To reflect this, in 2010 the Company has recognised an actuarial gain of  
£8.6 million outside profit and loss through the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The following table sets out the key FRS 17 assumptions used for the plan. The table also sets out at 31 December 2010, 31 December 
2009 and 31 December 2008, the fair value of assets, a breakdown of the assets into the main asset classes, the present value of the 
FRS 17 liabilities, the surplus (or deficit) of assets compared to the FRS 17 liabilities, the related deferred tax liability (or asset) and the net 
pension asset (or liability).

Related deferred tax liability £(9.3)m £(4.2)m £(5.8)m
Net pension asset £25.2m £10.8m £15.0m
The overall expected return on plan assets was derived as an average of the expected rates of return on each of the major asset classes 
invested in, weighted by the allocations of assets among the classes at the balance sheet date, using the figures shown above. The 
sources used to determine the expected rates of return include: bond yields, inflation and investment market expectations derived from 
market data and analysts’ or government’s expectations.
The contributions made by the employers in 2009, in respect of the Ladbrokes Pension Plan, were £6.7 million (2009: £7.0 million).
The currently agreed level of employer contributions is 20.5% of pensionable payroll, plus an additional £133,333 per month to remove 
the shortfall in funding identified at 30 September 2007 and £62,500 per month towards the regular expenses of maintaining the plan. 
These lead to an expected contribution of £6.6 million in 2011. As the plan is closed to new entrants and, under the method used to 
calculate pension costs in accordance with FRS 17, the service cost as a percentage of covered pensionable payroll will tend to increase 
over time as the average age of the membership increases.

The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report  
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors 
have elected to prepare the Company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable 
law). Under company law the directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit 
or loss of the Company for that period. In preparing these financial 
statements, the directors are required to:
  select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
  make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
  state whether the applicable UK Accounting Standards have 
been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained by the financial statements;
  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity  
of the Company’s website and legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ statement pursuant to the Disclosure and  
Transparency Rules
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed in 
pages 30 and 31 of this Annual Report, confirm that, to the best  
of each person’s knowledge and belief:
  the financial statements, prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and 
profit of the Company; and
  the Directors’ Report contained in the Annual Report includes a 
fair review of the development and performance of the business 
and the position of the Company, together with a description of 
the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Ladbrokes plc for the year ended 31 December 2010 which 
comprise the Company Balance Sheet and the related notes  
1 to 18. The financial reporting framework that has been applied  
in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body,  
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state 
to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state 
to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the 
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the statement of directors’ 
responsibilities set out on page 111, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the parent Company financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.  
Our responsibility is to audit the parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require 
us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of 
significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the 
overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on ﬁnancial statements
In our opinion the parent Company financial statements:
  give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as 
at 31 December 2010;
  have been properly prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
  have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies  
Act 2006
In our opinion:
  the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006; and
  the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial 
year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the parent Company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
  the parent Company financial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or
  we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements 
of Ladbrokes plc for the year ended 31 December 2010.

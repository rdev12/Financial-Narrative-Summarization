Talented people are the key to Premier
Farnell's future. Last year the quality of our
business, and its readiness for the future,
were materially improved by the many
achievements of our senior leaders and their
teams across the Group. Some of these
achievements are listed here.
Over the last five years, Premier Farnell has
invested in leading edge information systems
upon which to develop its business. The
benefit of this investment is being recognised
by customers, suppliers and technology
partners alike.
“With a vision of leveraging product information
as a strategic asset, Premier Farnell has gained
huge benefits by creating a global product
repository across all InOne companies. It is
a prime example of innovative thinking within
its industry.
“By creating a clear data structure and global
data synchronisation, the InOne companies
are now enabled to provide customers with
access to a global offering and identity across
a multitude of channels. In print, on CD and
in electronic channels, their ability to deliver
information in a fast, flexible and effective
manner results in a best-in-class solution that
continues to evolve.” 
Dan Korsgaard, CEO, Stibo Catalog
“Premier Farnell has proved itself a flexible
partner with an excellent eProcurement
solution. The fully customised web site provided
for us is delivering clear benefit, enabling us
to control spending better and allowing our
staff to focus on their core job responsibilities
rather than the ordering process. Selecting
BuckHickman InOne alongside Farnell InOne
made perfect sense as the service from both
can be integrated into the same procurement
solution.” 
Fiona Digby-Grant, Head of Corporate
Commercial, UK Atomic Energy Authority
“Premier Farnell is an approved supplier of MRO
and electronics products to BAE SYSTEMS.
Working together with them to develop a ‘round
trip’ eT rading solution has provided us with a
controlled, customised environment with all
the advantages of Premier Farnell's web site
technology . Although in its early stages of use
within our business, it is already proving
beneficial in terms of process savings and the
ability to view real-time information. Premier
Farnell has been a supportive and effective
supplier to our business over the last twelve
months and we look forward to growing our
relationship in the future.”

“As a preferred supplier to UK universities and
the Research Councils, Premier Farnell has not
only recognised the unique requirements of this
sector but also worked closely in partnership
with NUWPEC to develop this unique service
offering that links Farnell InOne, CPC and
BuckHickman InOne.
‘ ‘The state of the art bespoke Onecall web site
is a ‘one-stop shop’ solution. It provides vendor
reduction cost efficiencies and a dedicated
Onecall contact centre, demonstrating the
capabilities and flexibility of Premier Farnell as
a true purchasing partner .” 
David Johnson, Chairman, National
Universities Working Party on Electronic
Components (NUWPEC)
“Premier Farnell’ s deployment of Endeca’ s
Search and Guided Navigation platform is
world-class. Premier Farnell uses Endeca to
bring together their exceptionally broad and
deep product catalogue and rich technical
content to deliver unparalleled value through
the online channel.
“Using Endeca, Premier Farnell’ s customers
get easy online access to over 2 million
products, their attributes and related product
information, enabling the entire purchasing
process for their demanding customer base.
On the back-end Premier Farnell leverages
Endeca’s flexible architecture to power their
online presence globally on a single, efficient
platform that will scale as their business
continues to grow.” 
Steve Gurney , Director of Sales Europe,
Endeca T echnologies Inc.
“BuckHickman InOne’ s ability to provide a
tailored eProcurement solution, and fulfilment
using its local branch network, was key to
them winning this supplier agreement. Since 
its implementation, the individual branch
managers have been working very closely with
our sites to suggest and help them manage
their own tooling requirements and help prevent
inappropriate purchasing.
“Using the solution developed by BuckHickman
InOne has given us vital management
information to help us manage a diverse cost
centre. This allows us to plan future efficiencies
and cost-down programmes.”

T otal Service
Premier Farnell is a service business. It is the
foundation on which customer loyalty is built.
We ship over 6 million orders each year . Each
order is like a relay race, with the order being
passed from sales (order entry and product
availability), to warehouse (pick accuracy), to
forwarder (on time delivery), to name but a few.
T o deliver our service standards, we require
excellence in every leg of that race, and in the
handovers.
Across the Group, we measure a variety of
service metrics that cover all aspects of our
customers' experience. This year , across our
major businesses, Newark InOne in North
America and Farnell InOne in Europe,
error rates have been reduced.
Our Industrial Products Division also recognises
the importance of service and measures it
closely: TPC Wire & Cable sets our internal
benchmark with the lowest error rate anywhere
in the Group; and KENT achieved the greatest
improvement in the Group, reducing its error
rate by 57 per cent.
Premier Farnell aims consistently to offer
service in line with the best available in our
markets. This year we have launched a
programme to set new standards in service
for ourselves and for the industry .
We were delighted that a continuous
improvement auditor at one of our major
customers recently reported that the spare
parts management systems that we run for
them was almost perfect. The better our
service, the more opportunities we unlock as
customers gain the confidence to rely on us.

“As a preferred supplier to UK universities and
the Research Councils, Premier Farnell has not
only recognised the unique requirements of this
sector but also worked closely in partnership
with NUWPEC to develop this unique service
offering that links Farnell InOne, CPC and
BuckHickman InOne.
‘ ‘The state of the art bespoke Onecall web site
is a ‘one-stop shop’ solution. It provides vendor
reduction cost efficiencies and a dedicated
Onecall contact centre, demonstrating the
capabilities and flexibility of Premier Farnell as
a true purchasing partner .”

“Premier Farnell’ s deployment of Endeca’ s
Search and Guided Navigation platform is
world-class. Premier Farnell uses Endeca to
bring together their exceptionally broad and
deep product catalogue and rich technical
content to deliver unparalleled value through
the online channel.
“Using Endeca, Premier Farnell’ s customers
get easy online access to over 2 million
products, their attributes and related product
information, enabling the entire purchasing
process for their demanding customer base.

Endeca’s flexible architecture to power their
online presence globally on a single, efficient

Steve Gurney , Director of Sales Europe,
Endeca T echnologies Inc.
“BuckHickman InOne’ s ability to provide a
tailored eProcurement solution, and fulfilment
using its local branch network, was key to
them winning this supplier agreement. Since 
its implementation, the individual branch
managers have been working very closely with
our sites to suggest and help them manage
their own tooling requirements and help prevent
inappropriate purchasing.
“Using the solution developed by BuckHickman
InOne has given us vital management
information to help us manage a diverse cost
centre. This allows us to plan future efficiencies
and cost-down programmes.”

T otal Service
Premier Farnell is a service business. It is the
foundation on which customer loyalty is built.
We ship over 6 million orders each year . Each
order is like a relay race, with the order being
passed from sales (order entry and product
availability), to warehouse (pick accuracy), to
forwarder (on time delivery), to name but a few.
T o deliver our service standards, we require
excellence in every leg of that race, and in the
handovers.
Across the Group, we measure a variety of
service metrics that cover all aspects of our
customers' experience. This year , across our
major businesses, Newark InOne in North
America and Farnell InOne in Europe,
error rates have been reduced.
Our Industrial Products Division also recognises
the importance of service and measures it
closely: TPC Wire & Cable sets our internal
benchmark with the lowest error rate anywhere
in the Group; and KENT achieved the greatest
improvement in the Group, reducing its error
rate by 57 per cent.
Premier Farnell aims consistently to offer
service in line with the best available in our
markets. This year we have launched a
programme to set new standards in service
for ourselves and for the industry .
We were delighted that a continuous
improvement auditor at one of our major
customers recently reported that the spare
parts management systems that we run for
them was almost perfect. The better our
service, the more opportunities we unlock as
customers gain the confidence to rely on us.

Talented people are the key to Premier
Farnell's future. Last year the quality of our
business, and its readiness for the future,
were materially improved by the many
achievements of our senior leaders and their
teams across the Group. Some of these
achievements are listed here.
Over the last five years, Premier Farnell has
invested in leading edge information systems
upon which to develop its business. The
benefit of this investment is being recognised
by customers, suppliers and technology
partners alike.
“With a vision of leveraging product information
as a strategic asset, Premier Farnell has gained
huge benefits by creating a global product
repository across all InOne companies. It is
a prime example of innovative thinking within
its industry.
“By creating a clear data structure and global
data synchronisation, the InOne companies
are now enabled to provide customers with
access to a global offering and identity across
a multitude of channels. In print, on CD and
in electronic channels, their ability to deliver
information in a fast, flexible and effective
manner results in a best-in-class solution that
continues to evolve.” 
Dan Korsgaard, CEO, Stibo Catalog
“Premier Farnell has proved itself a flexible
partner with an excellent eProcurement
solution. The fully customised web site provided
for us is delivering clear benefit, enabling us
to control spending better and allowing our
staff to focus on their core job responsibilities
rather than the ordering process. Selecting
BuckHickman InOne alongside Farnell InOne
made perfect sense as the service from both
can be integrated into the same procurement
solution.” 
Fiona Digby-Grant, Head of Corporate
Commercial, UK Atomic Energy Authority
“Premier Farnell is an approved supplier of MRO
and electronics products to BAE SYSTEMS.
Working together with them to develop a ‘round

the advantages of Premier Farnell's web site
technology . Although in its early stages of use
within our business, it is already proving
beneficial in terms of process savings and the
ability to view real-time information. Premier
Farnell has been a supportive and effective
supplier to our business over the last twelve
months and we look forward to growing our
relationship in the future.”

T otal Service
Premier Farnell is a service business. It is the
foundation on which customer loyalty is built.
We ship over 6 million orders each year . Each
order is like a relay race, with the order being
passed from sales (order entry and product
availability), to warehouse (pick accuracy), to
forwarder (on time delivery), to name but a few.
T o deliver our service standards, we require
excellence in every leg of that race, and in the
handovers.
Across the Group, we measure a variety of
service metrics that cover all aspects of our
customers' experience. This year , across our
major businesses, Newark InOne in North
America and Farnell InOne in Europe,
error rates have been reduced.
Our Industrial Products Division also recognises
the importance of service and measures it
closely: TPC Wire & Cable sets our internal
benchmark with the lowest error rate anywhere
in the Group; and KENT achieved the greatest
improvement in the Group, reducing its error
rate by 57 per cent.
Premier Farnell aims consistently to offer
service in line with the best available in our
markets. This year we have launched a
programme to set new standards in service
for ourselves and for the industry .
We were delighted that a continuous
improvement auditor at one of our major
customers recently reported that the spare
parts management systems that we run for
them was almost perfect. The better our
service, the more opportunities we unlock as
customers gain the confidence to rely on us.
Premier Farnell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 11 Premier Farnell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 09 John Hirst
Group Chief Executive
In recent years, the focus of Premier Farnell’ s
business has evolved from managing just the
physical flow of goods from supplier to
customer to exploiting the vast amount of
knowledge and data available to us through the
use of sophisticated information technology .
Many of our activities are increasingly integrated
with those of our customers and suppliers and
together we are creating seamless purchase
and supply processes.
We now offer all our customers greater
ease of doing business and more reliable
service. For example, we enable customers to
reduce significantly the expense of managing
sometimes hundreds, or even thousands, of
small orders placed with us. For many , we can
now offer a new source of value: visibility and
confidence in what is being purchased by
designers, maintenance engineers and
procurement professionals across their
organisations.
The understanding of customer needs is
enabling us to offer suppliers a clearer view of
their markets. We can help new products find
their target market quicker and more effectively .
Major suppliers now consider us an extension
of their marketing activities.
Thus our potential depends, more than ever ,
upon the quality of our relationships with
customers and suppliers. The talent of our
people, our use of information technology and
our total service will determine our success.
These three areas have been the focus of our
investment over recent years.
Talent
T alent provides the only basis for long-term
success. Month by month, we improve the
quality and effectiveness of our operations
through disciplined management and the
sharing of expertise across the Group.
We work hard to attract and retain the very best
people. We have transformed many of our
practices for recruitment, development and
reward. We share four core values – totally
reliable, resourceful, intuitive and with
integrity – that underpin everything we do in the
organisation. Identified by our customers, they
are an enduring point of reference for all
employees.
Technology
Over several years we have invested some
£40 million in leading edge information systems.
– Customer relationship management
systems give us insight into the composition
of our customer base and the needs and
behaviours of individual customers and
groups. We give them better service because
the information that we need is at our
fingertips.
– Global product database and publishing
systems make the management of our
portfolio of some 400,000 individual products
far more effective; we can now add new
products weekly . A single system now
manages publication of product details to our
catalogues, flyers, CDs and to the web. The
process is fast, accurate and flexible –
essential attributes in the dynamic markets
in which we operate.
Chief Executive’s Review
Strategy for growth
12 Premier Farnell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005
  – Robust back office systems now give us
complete visibility of the inventories that we
carry . They enable us to improve our service
and are crucial in the effective management of
our inventories and logistics processes.
– A single eCommerce platform. We are
progressively migrating all our eCommerce
services onto a single platform. As the
platform develops, it supports all of our
web sites, as well as a growing number of
bespoke eProcurement solutions. The roll-out
of a common web search engine across the
Group was an important step this year .
The rapid growth in our eCommerce sales,
up 56 per cent this year in the Marketing and
Distribution Division, is testament to the
quality of the service that we can already offer .
In the fourth quarter of the year , eCommerce
accounted for 17 per cent of sales in that
Division.
T otal service
T otal service is the core of our proposition.
Having an enormous range of products in
stock, coupled with quick and reliable delivery ,
is only the start.
Premier Farnell aims consistently to offer service
in line with the best available in our markets.
This year we have launched a programme to
set new standards in service for ourselves and
for the industry . The programme is based upon
a variety of metrics that cover all aspects of our
customers’ experience. We expect this
programme to create a new benchmark within
our industry .
We are also building our value-added services
for customers. Of particular focus this year , we
aim to be the first place our customers turn to
for help to navigate through the complexities
arising from the European Directive restricting
the use of certain hazardous substances in
electrical and electronic equipment (RoHS
Directive) and similar requirements in a number
of our other key markets.
The better our service, the more opportunities
we unlock as customers gain the confidence to
rely on us.
Market opportunities
Most markets in which we currently operate
are highly fragmented. Although one of the
leaders, we typically have small market shares
and considerable opportunity for market
share growth.
The growing insight we have into our customer
base enables us to define and target new
market segments, tailoring the right product
range and service to appeal to them. For
example, in the UK we have captured a large
share of the higher education market through a
bespoke service for that market. In North
America we have dramatically increased
product ranges to meet the needs of electronic
design engineers.
Our international distribution networks
mean that we can build a presence in new
geographic markets without heavy investment
in further warehousing and inventory . The ability
to utilise existing assets across a growing
business has been demonstrated through the
opening of our offices in Italy and Spain in
recent years.
Increasingly , our largest customers want us to
support their operations internationally . We are
happy to help. Servicing their needs is helping
us create a foundation from which to expand
into growth markets such as China.
Acquisitions
Whilst organic growth is fundamental to our
strategy, we will use selected acquisitions to
accelerate our growth and develop our
proposition. We look for acquisitions that
increase our capability in selected countries,
add valuable product and service knowledge or
reach attractive market segments.
The measures of our success
We aim to:
– grow our market share consistently in order
to achieve the number one or two position in
our markets
– operate only in markets that value high
service sufficiently to sustain our pricing
proposition
– establish global coverage to support our key
customers and suppliers
– deliver a superior return on sales sufficient to
provide investment to fuel growth
– act as responsible corporate citizens.
In this way , we are confident that we will deliver
superior growth, profitability and shareholder
value.

The Group has continued to make good progress this year. We achieved growth in sales, and profit before
tax has increased by 10 per cent on last year, despite the continued weakness of the US dollar and
the disappointing performance of BuckHickman InOne. The North American electronics market was
strong in the first half of the year, but the rate of growth started to slow in the third quarter and
was very limited by the year-end. Nonetheless, we grew sales in our Marketing and Distribution
Division in North America by 11.7 per cent in the year and continued to improve gross margins. Sales
at Farnell InOne reached record levels, despite the slow down of European markets in the second half.
Sales were particularly strong in mainland Europe. BuckHickman InOne had a difficult trading year,
but sales levels stabilised towards the end of the year.
Profit before tax in the year was £60.3 million (2004: £54.8 million). Profit
before tax and goodwill amortisation was £63.0 million (2004: £57.3 million
before goodwill amortisation and gain on business disposal).
Earnings per share for the year were up 22 per cent to 11.0 pence
(2004: 9.0 pence). Adjusted earnings per share for the year (before
amortisation of goodwill) were 11.7 pence (2004: 10.2 pence before
amortisation of goodwill, rebranding costs and gain on business disposal).
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 5.0 pence (2004: 5.0 pence)
making a total for the year of 9.0 pence (2004: 9.0 pence). The dividend is
covered 1.2 times by profit attributable to ordinary shareholders and
1.3 times by profit attributable to ordinary shareholders before goodwill
amortisation. The final dividend is payable on 22nd June 2005 to
shareholders on the register on 27th May 2005.
Financial results
Group sales for the year were £776.7 million (2004: £764.6 million).
This comprised sales of £680.0 million in the Marketing and Distribution
Division and sales of £96.7 million in the Industrial Products Division.
Operating profit for the year was £73.8 million (2004: £69.0 million),
producing an operating margin of 9.5 per cent (2004: 9.0 per cent).
Adjusted operating profit for the year was £76.5 million before goodwill
amortisation of £2.7 million (2004: £74.0 million before rebranding costs
of £2.4 million and goodwill amortisation of £2.6 million), producing an
adjusted operating margin of 9.8 per cent (2004: 9.7 per cent). Operating
profit was affected by a reduction in the net pension credit of £1.3 million
and a £0.8 million increase in depreciation following the roll-out of the
customer relationship management software. Premier Farnell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 15

Balance Sheet and Cash Flow
The Group’ s financial position is sound. Net debt at 30th January 2005
was £200.7 million (1st February 2004: £201.9 million) and interest was
covered 5.7 times by operating profit before goodwill amortisation. Net
cash flow from operating activities was £72.5 million (2004: £70.0 million).
Working capital increased by £19.9 million, driven by investment in
inventory to support an expansion of our product range and sales
growth in the year . Net cash outflow, after dividends and £2.6 million
of acquisitions, was £7.0 million.
Acquisition
In February 2004, we acquired the business of GFE Manufacturing Inc.,
an Illinois-based supplier of lighting systems and water flow test
equipment for the fire-fighting industry , for £2.6 million. This acquisition,
which expanded Akron Brass’ s product range, has exceeded
expectations for sales and profit.
Business progress
We continue to make good progress on our strategic priorities. During the
year , we have focused on developing our business with larger corporate
accounts, expanding our presence with smaller customers, improving
product ranges and providing industry-leading service through our
eCommerce capability and our more traditional marketing channels.
The Operating Review on pages 16 to 20, provides the details of our
achievements in these areas.
Staff
Since joining the Board in June 2004, I have been impressed by the
quality and excellent commitment of our staff. On behalf of the Board,
I would like to thank all our employees for their continued hard work
during another demanding year .
Sir Malcolm Bates retired as Chairman in February after eight years during
which he steered the Group through significant change and led the
transformation of the business. On behalf of all the Group’ s shareholders,
Directors and employees, I would like to thank him for his wise advice,
counsel and guidance and wish him a long and happy retirement.
Outlook
We have prepared our plans for the coming year in the expectation that
the North American market will show no growth in the first half and may
only begin to strengthen in the second half of the year . Despite weaker
underlying markets in the UK and mainland Europe there are specific
opportunities for the Group to grow market share. The actions we have
taken should lead to a better performance from BuckHickman InOne.
The impending legislation on the Restriction of the use of certain
Hazardous Substances (RoHS) will have a significant impact in a number
of our main markets. Premier Farnell has been working closely with
suppliers to provide leadership in assisting customers prepare for the
legislation. We believe that we are well placed to offer our customers and
suppliers the information, support and product choice they require to
comply with the legislation.
The quality of our service to both customers and suppliers is increasingly
underpinned by the technology infrastructure that has been put in place.
The significant operational improvements and increased marketing
effectiveness built into the business over recent years give us confidence
that we can continue to improve our performance and our market shares.
Sir Peter Gershon
Chairman 16 Premier Farnell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005
The Marketing and Distribution Division
comprises five closely related businesses.
T ogether they represent 88 per cent of the
Group’ s sales and 84 per cent of the Group’ s
operating profit. T ypically , these businesses
distribute a wide range of electronic components
and other maintenance, repair and operations
products into private and public sector markets.
Our businesses are high service, small order
distributors. They buy from a large number of
suppliers (some 3,000 in total), perform the
traditional role of managing the physical flow of
goods and, increasingly , add significant value to
customers and suppliers alike through the
management of information flows.
They serve the lower volume and highly mixed
needs of designers, small scale production
units, procurement specialists and maintenance
and repair engineers in industry and the public
sector. In these areas, service is the key
differentiator . They are not positioned to supply
the high volumes of components that are fed
into mass production processes.
We have over 2 million customer contacts who
are attracted by a common need for a broad
product range, met by our inventory of around
400,000 stocked products, fast and reliable
delivery and specialist technical support.
Geographical reach
Although the majority of our sales are currently
in the Americas (43 per cent) and the UK
(39 per cent), we are increasingly a global
business. This year , sales in the rest of Europe
and Asia Pacific represented 18 per cent of the
Division’ s total sales. We are able to deliver
products to anywhere in the world in a
few days.
Most of the markets in which we operate are
highly fragmented and while market shares are
relatively small, Newark InOne in the US and
Farnell InOne in the UK are well known names in
the markets they serve. Both businesses are
leaders in the high service distribution markets
for electronic components.
Our assets
We have sales offices in 21 countries and the
capability to distribute products worldwide.
We hold around 400,000 products in stock,
available for same day despatch.
Our multiple sales channels – paper catalogues,
transactional web sites, inbound and outbound
call centres, field sales and branch networks –
provide customers with a choice to suit their
specific needs.
We offer technical information and support via
our technical data sheets, web sites and teams
of engineers.
We hold supplier franchises for market leading
product brands and offer ranges of our own
brand products.
Our market proposition
T o our customers, we offer real economic
benefit and peace of mind:
– reduced stockholding costs through easy
access to a huge range of products in the
quantities required
– reduced transaction costs through
eProcurement, efficient processes and
supplier reduction
– secure, reliable and rapid supply of products,
which are easy to identify , select and order
– technical information and support
through technical data sheets and our
technical helplines
– wide choice of sales channels to match
their needs
– supply chain management solutions.
T o our suppliers, we represent the most
effective means of reaching a valuable and
diverse customer base:
– effective multi-channel marketing to
customers they wish to reach
– market intelligence and feedback
– product launches
– reliable and swift global distribution
– product and application related technical
support to their customers.
T rends in our market
Customers require a variety of product ordering
channels to suit their specific needs, along with
fast and easy access to products and services.
Increasingly they are reducing inventory and
ordering closer to their point of need – so
requiring reliable supply , late order capability
and next day service.
Many large and small manufacturing
companies are focusing on their core
processes and streamlining or outsourcing
the procurement of their maintenance, repair
and operations (MRO) product requirements to
reduce costs of purchasing and manage the
supply chain more effectively.
The consolidation of electronic component
manufacturers and reduction in the number of
distributors they want to work with is favouring
companies like us with high brand recognition
and global reach.
As manufacturing migrates to low cost
economies such as China, Mexico and Eastern
Europe and the infrastructure grows in these
countries, the requirement for the MRO
products we supply will continue to increase in
these regions. However , the requirements of
researchanddesign,small-scalemanufacturing,
and maintenance also continue to create
demand for our products and services in our
traditional geographic markets.
European Directives restricting the use of
certain hazardous substances (RoHS) and
imposing obligations in respect of waste
electronic and electrical equipment (WEEE) are
currently being implemented. The RoHS
Directive prohibits the use of substances such
as lead, mercury and cadmium in electronic and
electrical products unless specific exemptions
apply. Similar legislation is also pending in a
number of states in the US and in China.
Managing within the supply chain, the
introduction of compliant products, which in
many cases will replace current products, is
creating significant demands upon, and
opportunities for , suppliers, distributors and
customers alike.
Operating Review
Marketing and Distribution Division  Premier Farnell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 17
Sales strategy
We have a wider choice of channels than many
of our competitors and continue to invest to
ensure that we stay ahead of customer needs.
We are increasingly serving larger national and
international customers with the combined
product and service offer of our major brands.
We have improved our capabilities in the
provision of eProcurement solutions for our
large customers. We have created clear
differentiation in our market through our ability
to link to almost any purchasing or enterprise
resource planning system our customers may
have. The flexibility and robustness of our
solutions has won us valuable and important
agreements with many large companies.
eProcurement, which enables the automation
of most of the commercial mechanics from the
ordering process to invoicing and payment,
delivers significant customer benefits including:
– reducing the cost of administering and
processing orders
– shortening the purchasing process
– reducing errors in ordering
– eliminating rogue purchasing and ensuring
only approved or contracted suppliers are
used
– minimising the risk of buying inferior products
off-contract
– increasing transparency of purchasing data.
We have 378 live eProcurement agreements;
and eProcurement sales grew by 73 per cent
year on year and accounted for 6 per cent of
total Division sales by the end of the year .
The customer relationship management
system, which has now been fully operational
in Newark InOne in the US and Farnell InOne in
the UK for some 18 months has significantly
strengthened our marketing capabilities. These
have helped increase catalogue distribution,
stimulate customer recruitment and drive sales
campaigns. T argeted telemarketing campaigns
helped us stimulate growth in sales amongst
our smaller customers and contributed to the
5.5 per cent growth in the active customer base
in these businesses year on year .
Our customers rely on our ability to supply
products quickly and accurately . Farnell InOne
customer Metropolis AV & FX Ltd were
approached by Cartier , the world famous
watchmakers and jewellers, as part of their
150th anniversary celebrations, to make the
exterior of their New Y ork store glitter with
replica tiaras and a giant bow. Metropolis
specialises in the design and installation of
audiovisual equipment, lighting and special
effects. Farnell InOne supplied them on time
and in full with the many thousands of light
emitting diodes needed to make their design
a reality.
MCM, an InOne company , continues to
develop its business through market
segmentation. Success has been achieved
by utilising customer relationship management,
eProcurement solutions and customised
web sites.
Major wins
We have been selected again by the National
Universities Working Party on Electronic
Components (NUWPEC) to be the preferred
supplier for the UK higher education sector
and research councils. The NUWPEC
agreement covers a new three-year period with
an anticipated sales value of £20 million over
that time. We have retained the agreement
through two reviews since we first won it in
1999. The service provides a single point of
ordering for over 250,000 products and
significantly cuts administration time and
costs, reduces paperwork and assists in the
reduction of rogue purchasing within
participating institutions.
Farnell InOne has won an agreement with
Robert Bosch GmbH for the supply of
electronic and electromechanical components
to all of Bosch’ s European sites. Major benefits
to Bosch include an online eProcurement
solution to increase purchasing control, as well
as supplier reduction. Bosch purchasers have
access to a specifically tailored product range of
80,000 electronic and electromechanical
components.
BuckHickman InOne has won a contract to
supply the UK Atomic Energy Authority
(UKAEA) with all their tooling requirements.
This is in addition to the existing contracts with
UKAEA for the supply of personal and
protective equipment from BuckHickman
InOne, and for electrical and electronic
equipment from Farnell InOne. UKAEA are
provided with a tailored online catalogue and a
bespoke web site of approximately 100,000
products enabling them to streamline
purchasing, better control spending and ensure
their employees buy from approved suppliers.
BuckHickman InOne has secured a supplier
agreement with RWE Thames Water , providing
them with a tailored eProcurement solution and
the fulfilment of the BuckHickman InOne local
branch network. Branch managers have been
working very closely with the RWE Thames
Water sites to assist in the management of their
tooling requirements. The benefits to the
customer are better management information
and cost control.
Newark InOne’ s five year agreement (secured in
2002) from the General Services Administration
(GSA) means the company is eligible to provide
US government agencies with more than
400,000 products. Sales to the government
sector grew in the year by 16 per cent.
Service to customers
We have developed additional services to
strengthen our basic proposition, which enable
us to build stronger and deeper relationships
with our customers.
A major area of concern for design engineers
is the speed with which components become
obsolete and the risk of designing these into
new products. Our ProductWatch service
alerts the customer if the components they
have specified or are using are scheduled to
become obsolete and advises them of a
suitable replacement.
We have developed software and systems
which enable us to extend our inventory
management skills into our customers’
premises. Vauxhall outsourced the supply of all
the MRO product requirements of its Ellesmere
Port manufacturing plant to BuckHickman
InOne in 2002. We have established a sales
branch on site, and supply direct to the
production line through 150 cabinets located
throughout the plant.
Newark InOne has expanded its technical
support capability. It now has a team of
engineers able to provide design customers
with expert product and application-related
assistance.
Farnell InOne has developed a dedicated
web site to assist customers in understanding
the impact of the RoHS and WEEE legislation.
Monthly updates have been emailed to the
85,000 customers who receive our regular
news alert service. The industry’ s first
Step-by-Step guide to the RoHS legislation
has been published in conjunction with
ERA T echnology and the first catalogue of
RoHS compliant product was distributed to
customers early in 2005. Customers can also
search on the web site using RoHS as the
attribute to locate any of the 12,000 compliant
products listed. This number will be added to
continuously throughout the coming year . Farnell InOne’ s Head of Product Market
Strategy chairs the RoHS sub-committee
of the UK’ s principal trade association, the
Association of Franchised Distributors of
Electronic Components (AFDEC) and has
spoken at a number of major international
conferences. Through an active public relations
campaign the Group has successfully raised
the profile of the issues around RoHS and
WEEE in the industry .
Working with our suppliers
T o our suppliers, we represent a very effective
means of reaching a valuable and diverse
customer base. Our multi-channel marketing
facilitates the launch of new products targeted
at specific types of customers. This year we
have run global product launches for electronics
suppliers Molex, targeted at the industrial sector
and Microchip targeted at electronic design
engineers. The Microchip launch was
supported by Newark InOne and Farnell
InOne’ s technical support teams.
Product range
Our InOne businesses keep around 400,000
products in stock and make a further 4.3 million
available to our customers via our supplier
relationships.
As we use our customer relationship
management systems to understand better the
specific requirements of our customers, we are
increasing the depth and relevance of our
product offer .
At Newark InOne, in order to compete more
effectively in the design engineers’ segment, we
added 28,000 new products to the catalogue
published in September .
We were the first catalogue distributor in North
America to offer a free of charge re-reeling
service on custom length reels of passive
component tape with same day shipping –
a service which is of particular value to
manufacturers of small quantities – saving them
time and money.
Upgrading our systems
We are constantly improving the effectiveness
of our marketing and levels of service through
our increasing understanding of our customers’
buying patterns and requirements.
The prime source of this market intelligence is
the millions of transactions and other contacts
with our customers and suppliers. Our
investment in information technology enables
us to take our product and customer data,
interpret it and identify new ways in which to
improve and differentiate our offer from that of
our competitors.
Our new publication management system
enables the global management of product
data and allows new products to be added and
launched weekly . It also makes the publication
of web pages, catalogues, flyers and other
marketing materials faster , more accurate and
more responsive to market changes.
Our new web site search engine has been rolled
out successfully . It is easy to use and gives fast
online access to over 2 million products. The
intelligent searching enables customers to
‘search as they think’, drilling down into
information logically , using specific product
attributes to find what they need. A
‘breadcrumb trail’ means buyers can retrace
one or more steps without having to begin an
entirely new search, invaluable when looking for
products with similar characteristics. T otal
eCommerce sales through our web sites
and eProcurement arrangements increased
56 per cent over last year and now account
for 18 per cent of sales in the Americas and

Operating Review
Industrial Products Division continued Premier Farnell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 21
At its heart Premier Farnell is essentially a
people business. It is a business that is
dependent upon ongoing and effective
relationships between our employees and our
customers and suppliers. It is our employees
who translate our product and service offering
into reality every day by meeting and exceeding
both customer and supplier expectations. The
key is the consistent delivery of our proposition
through the appropriate behaviours and actions
of all employees. It is for this reason that the
Group places so much emphasis on the need
to have an appropriate talent base.
In 2003 the Group began a programme of
familiarisingall5,000employeeswithcorevalues
essential to the provision of good service. These
values, totally reliable, resourceful, intuitive
and with integrity, were identified by our
customers. This introductory phase was
completed in 2004 and is being reinforced by
new recruitment, appraisal and development
processes designed to embed the requisite
behaviours into the organisation.
Members of the Human Resources function,
together with a wide range of managers and
supervisors, have been trained in competency
based interviewing techniques. This is helping
to ensure that only new recruits who can
demonstrate behavioural patterns consistent
with our core values are hired. The introduction
of these techniques in parts of the Group has
already demonstrated they can have a dramatic
effect on labour turnover .
Employees throughout the Group receive
feedback on their performance and over
60 per cent of employees are covered by the
annual Group Performance Review Process
which serves three vital purposes:
– it ensures that employees are clear about their
responsibilities and that their objectives for the
year are aligned with the business strategy.
– it addresses the technical, professional and
managerial development needs of each
employee. For the first time, the identification
of developmental needs has been augmented
by the introduction of formal 360-degree
feedback in 2004. This enables participants
to receive direct feedback on how their
behaviours are perceived by their peers and
subordinates in addition to their manager .
Although restricted to some 60 managers this
year , we intend to increase the number of
employees covered by this process
significantly over the next two years.
– performance reviews form the basis for
functional, regional and Group ‘People Days’ –
a process for matching our skill base with the
strategic needs of the business. In 2004, one
result of this annual process was the
intercontinental transfer of three senior
managers as part of our aim to build a truly
global operation.
The Group places strong emphasis on
individual and team performance. This is
reinforced by pay for performance. In 2004
not only were field sales staff covered by
incentive plans, but almost half of non-sales
staff had an element of variable, performance
related, remuneration.
An analysis of development needs highlighted in
performance reviews provides the raw data
upon which two major training programmes are
based. During the year more modules were
added to the Management and Supervisory
Programme and over 1,500 man days of
training were delivered in 2004. In addition,
the Premier Farnell OnLine Learning Centre
now makes 26 programmes available to
4,000 employees directly over their
personal computers.
Another successful initiative incorporating the
OnLine Learning Centre was the creation this
year of a consistent Group-wide induction
process, the Premier Farnell Welcome
Programme.
Management continues to focus on reducing
labour turnover , particularly in the typically high
incidence areas of distribution centres and call
centres. During the year the labour turnover rate
was reduced by 11 per cent on a year on year
basis. This year’ s target of achieving an
86 per cent retention rate at management and
supervisory levels was exceeded. It is our
intention to improve further our performance in
this area by setting ourselves the challenging
target of filling over 70 per cent of managerial
and professional vacancies from internal
sources by 2007.
The Group is actively encouraging open
communications at all levels. During the year
a bespoke diagnostic technique to measure
the degree of employee commitment and
engagement with the Company was piloted in
seven departments. This diagnostic enables
employees to express clearly their views on
aspects of their working environment that
aid or hinder performance. Then, working
with local management, solutions to issues
raised are identified and implemented. As a
result of these pilot exercises, we are now
making the diagnostic technique available
across the Group.
Building on the positive experience of working
with employee members of the Premier Farnell
European Forum established in 1999, the Group
is establishing a UK Forum in accordance with
the Information and Consultation of Employees
Regulations 2004. The UK Forum will meet for
the first time in 2005.
Operating Review
Human Resources Report This is the fourth consecutive year we have prepared a Social
Responsibility Report. Every year we find that the Report helps raise
awareness of relevant issues within the Group. We were pleased to win
the PricewaterhouseCoopers Y orkshire Annual Report Award for last
year’s Report, the second year in succession we have won this award.
References to years throughout this Social Responsibility Report are to
calendar years, rather than the Company’ s financial year .
Health and safety
Our health and safety commitment remains the simple one of minimising
workplace injuries and illnesses. Our occupational injury and illness rate in
2004 was 0.90 per 100,000 hours worked. While this rate is 46 per cent
lower than the average for our industry (see figure 1), it represents an
increase on the previous year due to relatively poor results from
BuckHickman InOne and our Liège warehouse. The management
focus on health and safety in these areas will therefore be increased
for 2005.
While we will continue to strive for improvement in the absolute rate, our
immediate aim will be to meet our long-term goal of an injury and illness
rate less than 50 per cent of our industry average.
In our next Social Responsibility Report we intend to provide information
on the number of injuries and illnesses that result in absence from work.
We believe this is becoming the more commonly used measure and gives
a better indication of the effect of injuries and illnesses on the Group.
Our occupational injury rate remains very low when compared to rates for
other industries (see figure 2).

2004 Business segment safety risks and actions routinely taken
to address them
The Group’ s principal business activity is the distribution of electronic
components and other maintenance, repair and operations products.
Primary activities at our distribution centres include product receiving,
put-away , order picking, packing, shipping, and maintenance. Common
accidents and injuries known to occur at these types of facilities include
cuts, contusions, muscle strains, slips/trips/falls, forklift truck and
maintenance related accidents.
The acquisition of BuckHickman InOne in 2001 brought with it a
fleet of company-owned trucks used in transporting products. This
transport fleet brings with it the usual safety risks, principally from road
traffic accidents.
The Group also has a small number of manufacturing facilities located
in the US. Each manufacturing facility has its own unique activities
where a potential for injury exists and these are assessed and
addressed accordingly.
Our major distribution and manufacturing facilities are required to chart
both ‘near miss’ and ‘actual’ workplace injuries. They must also conduct
regular health and safety audits. Our goal is to identify and address any
safety concerns before accidents occur . Each major facility has a Health
and Safety Committee. These committees meet regularly to discuss
(and respond to) ‘near miss’ incidents, workplace injuries, and safety
audit findings.
In the US, where large numbers of safety regulations impact our
operations, our facilities are required to prepare annually and follow
site-specific safety compliance calendars. The calendars list the safety
compliance and employee training activities each facility must take during
the year . These calendars not only help to assure compliance, but also
provide a safety focus throughout the year .
In the UK and at our warehouse in Liège in Belgium, we conduct risk
assessments, risk surveys, and health and safety audits.
Safety training is provided to all affected employees in an effort to prevent
and reduce injuries. T ypes of training provided include injury/illness
reporting, first aid, safe lifting, ergonomics, chemical awareness,
transportation of dangerous goods, spill clean up, use of fire
extinguishers, forklift operation, emergency evacuation, confined space
entry , electrical isolation, and the use of personal protective equipment. In
the UK, our logistics management team also undergoes training in health
and safety responsibilities, including risk assessment.
During the year driver assessment and training, where required, was
provided to almost 400 users of Group vehicles.
A large proportion of the Group’ s employees are office-based and training
is provided in the correct use of display screens and workstations.
Performance against 2004 safety targets
Target Result
Additional actions planned in 2005 to prevent and minimise injuries
Actions planned in 2005 to emphasise safety, encourage pro-safety
attitudes, and reduce injuries:
1. T o achieve a recordable injury and illness rate of less than 50 per cent
of our industry average.
2. T o ensure that employees at all Group business units are aware of and
begin utilising the safety (and environmental) training and compliance
materials provided on the Company’ s new OnLine Learning Centre. We
will seek input on what additional items we can add to meet the needs of
business units.
3. T o implement safety training in the UK as part of the induction process
for all new employees, temporary staff and colleagues on secondment.
Refresher training will also be provided in first aid, forklift truck use,
ergonomic lifting and awareness of hazardous materials. Essential fire
safety training will be provided for fire wardens and risk assessment
training for all first line managers.

Premier Farnell has 
been a member of the
FTSE4 Good Index
since July 2001 The environment
We are committed to reducing the impact of our activities on the
environment.
We collect data on the amount of energy used, employee business travel,
waste disposed, waste recycled, water used, and greenhouse gas
emitted by Group operations in order to assess our environmental impact.
The data is presented in this Report in two ways: total quantity of
usage/generation, and unit rates based on sales turnover (i.e. quantity
per £1,000 of sales).
In order to ensure that we have representative and reliable environmental
data, we review new data each quarter and compare it to data from prior
years. This continual review and comparison allows us to detect and
correct any errors. We have restated some of the figures for earlier years
for energy use, business travel, solid waste and water use totals. This
data has been restated in this year’ s Report.
Business segment environmental concerns and actions routinely
taken to address them
As previously stated, the Group’ s principal business activity is the
distribution of electronic components and other maintenance, repair
and operations products. Significant environmental concerns associated
with this activity include the proper handling, storage, shipping, and
disposal of the chemical products we distribute and the creation of
packaging waste.
Returned, damaged and discontinued chemical products (e.g. electrical
cleaners, solders, batteries) must be properly handled and disposed of.
Supplier packaging must also be properly disposed of. Chemical
products must be packaged and shipped in compliance with hazardous
materials transportation laws. All UK business units are fully compliant
with the User Responsibility (Packaging Waste) Regulations and
submit all relevant information to the Environment Agency via a
compliance scheme.
The Group’ s small number of manufacturing facilities in the US generate
industrial process waste that must be properly handled and disposed of.
One of these facilities is a brass foundry that requires special air handling
equipment and air emission permits.
We provide environmental training to affected employees to assure they
comply with relevant laws and act in an environmentally responsible
manner . This includes hazardous waste, spill prevention, and hazardous
materials transportation training.
In the US, where large numbers of environmental regulations impact our
operations, our operations are required to prepare annually and follow
business unit environmental compliance calendars. The calendars list the
environmental compliance and employee training activities that must be
undertaken during the year .

Performance against 2004 environmental targets
Target Result
As part of the process for improving our environmental performance, last
year we introduced the concept of ‘green’ offices and facilities. A rating
sheet covering the main environmental impacts of our business enables
individual sites (be they offices, distribution centres or sales branches) to
self-assess their performance. Points are earned for environmental
practices that conserve energy, minimise waste disposal, encourage
recycling, and minimise water use. Sites achieving a target score are
recognised and awarded a certificate confirming their ‘green’ status.
Three sites achieved green status in 2004. We will challenge additional
facilities to achieve green status in 2005. We believe that encouraging our
facilities to take responsibility for their own environmental performance will
capitalise on the enthusiasm of individuals within Premier Farnell for
sound environmental practices.
T wo significant pieces of European environmental legislation will affect the
Group’ s electronic component distribution businesses in the near future.
These are the European Directives dealing with the restriction of the use
of certain hazardous substances (RoHS), and the disposal of waste
electronic and electrical equipment (WEEE). The Directives require
implementation into the national laws of the EU member states.
The RoHS Directive effectively prohibits the use of certain undesirable
substances (including lead, cadmium and mercury) in electronic and
electrical products beginning in July 2006. The WEEE Directive imposes
obligations relating to the collection, recycling and disposal of waste
electronic and electrical equipment. The primary purpose of both
Directives is the protection of human health and the environment.
Similar legislation has been proposed in some US states, Canadian
provinces, Japan and in China. A large number of the items distributed by
the Group will be affected, as will the products manufactured or
assembled by many of the Group’s customers.
The Group has dedicated areas of its web sites that provide more
information regarding RoHS and WEEE requirements and these can be
accessed via www.farnellinone.com and www.newarkinone.com.

Premier Farnell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 25 Additional actions planned in 2005 to manage environmental
concerns
We will take four additional actions in 2005 to manage environmental
concerns and reduce environmental impacts:
1. We intend to role out our green facility programme across the Group
and target the achievement of ‘green’ status at three additional facilities
during the year .
2. We plan to achieve a five per cent reduction in energy use at our main
distribution centre in Leeds.
3. We will introduce battery recycling facilities for employees at our
Leeds site.
4. We will continue to take a pro-active stance regarding the
implementation of the RoHS and WEEE Directives.
Contribution to the community
The Group contributes to the wider community in a number of ways.
Cash donations are made each year to a number of charities and this
year these amounted to £38,000. Equally important are the contributions
in kind which are made by the Group. Employees are encouraged to
participate in charitable fundraising events and to give time, both in and
outside working hours, to good causes. This has been formalised during
the year in the form of a Group policy on charitable giving. This policy
covers the provision of matching funds from the Company where
employees raise money for charity , the donation of stock to good causes
and the opportunity for employees to use limited amounts of time during
the working day for fundraising activities.
The following are just a few of many examples of the Group’s involvement
in the community.
In the UK, Farnell InOne has been a long-term sponsor of the Great
Yorkshire Bike Ride which has now raised over £1.2 million for a variety
of charities. As well as the Group’ s sponsorship, a number of employees
take part every year . This year the event raised £110,000 for a variety of
charities and the Farnell InOne team taking part raised the highest group
total in sponsorship.
The Group regularly donates equipment to various charitable and
educational organisations to assist in training programmes. These have
ranged from the provision of an oscilloscope to the science department
of a local school in Y orkshire to the donation of a range of components to
enable a group of Dutch students to participate in a project for the design
of a racing car .
In the US, all of the Group’ s businesses participate in United Way , a
community-based umbrella organisation supporting various human
services organisations. Group employees have taken leadership roles
in United Way’ s fundraising activities. Newark InOne was specifically
recognised by United Way this year for reaching total donations in
excess of $20,000.
Akron Brass and Newark InOne managers are involved in a junior
achievement programme by teaching business practice to local high
school students. Newark InOne also participated in the American Cancer
Society’ s Relay for Life, raising $21,000 through a combination of
employee donations and a company contribution.
Many Group employees responded to the tsunami disaster in Asia with
imaginative and effective ways of providing cash or products to assist in
the aid efforts. The Company matched funds raised by employees.
Significant awards and achievements in 2004
We are delighted to report that the US National Safety Council again
presented its Green Cross for Safety Excellence Achievement Awards
to five Premier Farnell companies. These awards recognised exemplary
safety records at Newark InOne, MCM, Akron Brass, TPC Wire & Cable
and Cadillac Electric sites.
We are also pleased to report that we were presented with the
PricewaterhouseCoopers Social Responsibility reporting award for
Yorkshire for last year’ s Social Responsibility Report.
We remain a member of the FTSE4 Good Index of Corporate and Social
Responsibility. We are also among a small number of companies that
have participated in the Business in the Environment survey of Corporate
Environmental Engagement for every year since its inception and shown
continual progress, increasing our overall score by seven per cent in the
latest survey.
Audit of this Report
As part of the process of ensuring that we have robust data as a
reference point, our Internal Audit Department assessed the processes
used to collect and collate the information contained in this Report last
year and their proposals for improvement were taken into account in its
production this year . The Internal Audit department have also carried out
a review of the key data presented in this year’ s Report.

At constant exchange rates the Group generated a 9.3 per cent increase
in operating profit from a 6.5 per cent increase in sales, reflecting an
improvement in gross margins and effective cost control. This was
achieved notwithstanding a reduction in profit contribution from
BuckHickman InOne. On the same basis, adjusted earnings per share
rose 20.6 per cent, assisted by a low tax charge and the existence of the
fixed preference dividend which adds gearing to the earnings attributable
to ordinary shareholders.
Group sales for the year , based on year on year sales per day for
continuing businesses and at constant exchange rates, increased
by 6.4 per cent, peaking at 9.4 per cent in the second quarter assisted by
strong market conditions, particularly in North America, and slowing to
4.7 per cent in the fourth quarter .
Group year on year sales growth rates (%)*
*based on sales per day for continuing businesses at constant exchange rates
The Marketing and Distribution Division contributed 87.5 per cent of the
Group’ s sales. In the Americas, sales per day were 11.7 per cent above
prior year , with sales per day increasing by 13.6 per cent in the first half
and 9.8 per cent in the second half. Notwithstanding the softening of the
market in the second half of the year , sales growth was maintained in the
third and fourth quarters at 9.8 per cent representing a stronger
performance in the fourth quarter relative to the market. This has been
achieved through effective use of the Group’ s customer relationship
management systems, increased targeted catalogue distribution and
extension of the product range over the last two years.
In Europe and Asia Pacific, year on year sales per day increased by
2.4 per cent.
UK sales declined 1.5 per cent in the year reflecting a strong performance
from Farnell InOne, which continued to develop good growth from
Corporate Accounts, eProcurement and web sales, and weaker
performances from CPC and BuckHickman InOne. Farnell InOne UK
sales growth slowed from a peak of 6.0 per cent in the second quarter to
parity in the fourth quarter , outperforming a market which deteriorated
through the second half and showed a year on year decline in the fourth
quarter . CPC experienced a sales decline of 1.6 per cent in the year
because of weak demand from those customers exposed to the
consumer electronics retail market. Sales at BuckHickman InOne were
down 5.8 per cent in the year , reflecting the deterioration in customer
service following the rapid expansion of its business in 2003/4. Service
levels were restored at the end of the first half and the fourth quarter year
on year decline in sales was reduced to 0.6 per cent.
Mainland Europe and Asia Pacific year on year sales grew 10.7 per cent.
Although markets slowed during the second half, fourth quarter sales
were up 7.3 per cent because of continued market share gain with little
or no assistance from the market.

Group sales and operating profit
Group sales for the financial year were £776.7 million (2004: £764.6 million).
Profit before taxation in the year was £60.3 million (2004: £54.8 million,
restated from £54.6 million to reflect the impact of the adoption of
UITF 38, Accounting for ESOP T rusts). Profit before taxation and goodwill
amortisation was £63.0 million (2004: £59.7 million before the one-off
rebranding cost of £2.4 million, profit on disposal of business and
goodwill amortisation).
The Group’ s results were impacted by the continued weakness of the
US dollar and Euro against sterling. The impact of exchange rates is
illustrated in the following table which compares the year on year results
at constant exchange rates.

Group Finance Director The Industrial Products Division achieved year on year sales per day
growth for continuing businesses of 7.4 per cent. Sales at Akron Brass,
which manufactures and distributes high-performance fire-fighting
equipment, increased 12.8 per cent assisted by the acquisition of
GFE Manufacturing Inc. Sales at TPC Wire & Cable, a distributor of
high specification cable to the North American automotive and steel
industries, increased by 10.3 per cent through the introduction of new
products and expansion into Mexico and Canada. Sales at KENT , which
distributes high-performance consumable products to the automotive
repair industry , increased by 2.8 per cent.
The Group’ s gross margin has improved steadily during the year reflecting
the impact of tight management control and margin improvement
initiatives, notwithstanding the upward cost pressure from certain
product categories and global freight rates.

Acquisition
On 6th February 2004 the Group acquired the business and assets of
GFE Manufacturing Inc., a company based in Illinois, US, involved in the
manufacture of lighting rigs for the fire-fighting industry , for a cash
consideration of £2.6 million. This acquisition extends the product range
available to Akron Brass customers in North America. GFE contributed
sales of £3.1 million in the year .
Interest and fixed charges
The net interest charge of £13.5 million (2004: £14.3 million) was covered
5.7 times by operating profit before goodwill amortisation.
Fixed charge (interest plus preference dividends) cover was 3.4 times.
Interest payments relate predominantly to fixed rate US dollar borrowings.
The effective interest rate on the Group’ s fixed rate borrowings was
6.3 per cent (2004: 6.6 per cent).
Taxation
The Group’ s effective tax charge represented 21.9 per cent
(2004: 27.2 per cent) of the profit before tax and goodwill amortisation.
The underlying tax rate, excluding the impact of tax credits arising from
the favourable settlement of earlier years’ liabilities, was 26.0 per cent
(2004: 29.1 per cent). This rate compares favourably with the corporate
tax rates of 30.0 per cent in the UK and 35.0 per cent in the US, the
territories in which the Group earns most of its profits.
Dividends
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 5.0 pence which,
together with the interim dividend, amounts to a total dividend per share
of 9.0 pence, unchanged from the previous year , at a total cost for
the financial year of £32.6 million. The dividend is covered 1.3 times
(2004: 1.1 times) by attributable profits adjusted for goodwill amortisation.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share were 11.0 pence (2004: 9.0 pence). Adjusted
earnings per share (before amortisation of goodwill) were 11.7 pence
(2004: 10.2 pence before rebranding costs, amortisation of goodwill and
gain on disposal of business).
Cash flow and net debt
Free cash flow attributable to ordinary shareholders is summarised

Free cash flow 28.1 17.1
Cash flow from operating activities represented a conversion rate of
95 per cent (2004: 98 per cent) of operating profit before goodwill
amortisation and reflects continued tight control of working capital
across the Group. Inventories increased by £8.8 million in the year to
support expansion of the product ranges throughout the Marketing and
Distribution Division. Receivable days have been maintained at similar
levels to last year , with a year end Group average of 51 days.

T reasury operations
The Group is exposed to a number of different market risks, including
movement in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The
Group has established policies and procedures within the treasury
function to monitor and manage the exposures arising from volatility in
these markets, with derivative instruments being entered into when
considered appropriate by management.
The Group T reasury function is responsible for sourcing and structuring
borrowing requirements, managing interest rate and foreign exchange
exposure and managing any surplus funds, which are invested mainly in
short-term deposits with financial institutions that meet the credit criteria
approved by the Board. In addition, monthly reports are produced by the
Group T reasury function which are used to monitor treasury activities.
Important treasury management decisions are approved by the Board
and an annual report detailing the Group’ s debt, cash and hedging
activity is reviewed by the Board.
Group policy prohibits speculative arrangements in that transactions in
financial instruments are matched to an underlying business requirement,
such as forecast debt and interest repayments and expected foreign
currency revenues. The Group uses derivatives only to manage its foreign
currency and interest rate risks arising from underlying business activities.
The Group T reasury function is subject to periodic independent reviews
by the Internal Audit Department. Controls over interest rate and foreign
exchange exposures and transaction authenticity are in place and
dealings are restricted to those banks with the relevant combination of
geographic presence and suitable credit rating.
The Group monitors the credit ratings of its counterparties and credit
exposure for each counterparty .
The Group hedges transactions primarily related to the purchase and
sale of inventories denominated in foreign currencies through foreign
exchange forward contracts. These contracts reduce currency risk from
exchange rate movements with respect to these transactions and cash
flows. Gains and losses are deferred and accounted for as part of the
underlying transactions.
The Group does not hedge profit translation exposure, unless there is a
corresponding cash flow, since such hedges provide only a temporary
deferral of the effect of movements in exchange rates. Similarly , whilst a
significant proportion of the Group’ s borrowings is denominated in
US dollars, the Group does not specifically hedge all of its long-term
investments in overseas assets.
Pension accounting
The Group accounts for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24.
The Group’ s net assets include a pension asset of £81.9 million
(2004: £79.6 million) which is included in debtors due after more than
one year. The consolidated profit and loss account includes a net
pension credit of £1.6 million (2004: £2.9 million) in relation to all of
the Group’ s pension schemes.

Gross debt at 30th January 2005 The Group operates defined benefit schemes in the UK, which was
closed to new entrants in 1998, and North America. As a result of the
April 2002 triennial valuation of the UK scheme, contributions are made at
a rate of £0.7 million per annum. A contribution holiday will continue for
the foreseeable future in relation to the over-funded US scheme.
The results do not reflect the full adoption of FRS 17, Retirement Benefits,
because, under UK GAAP , this is not required until the Group’ s financial
year ending 29th January 2006. If the standard had been fully adopted in
2005, profit before tax would have been reduced by £1.3 million
(2004: £2.2 million) representing the net of £6.8 million which would be
charged to operating profit and £5.5 million which would be credited to
interest. The credit to interest reflects the income attributable to the
substantial surplus which exists in the US scheme.
Consolidated net assets would have been reduced by £33.4 million and
the value of the net surplus of the UK and US defined benefit schemes
would have been £30.9 million (2004: £44.1 million), based on the market
value of scheme assets at 30th January 2005, comprising a surplus in the
US scheme of £49.1 million and a deficit in the UK scheme of £18.2 million.
Restriction of the use of certain Hazardous Substances (RoHS)
The European Directive dealing with the restriction of the use of certain
hazardous substances (RoHS) takes effect from July 2006 and effectively
prohibits the use of certain substances, including lead, cadmium and
mercury, in electronic and electrical products from July 2006. The Group
has been working closely with suppliers to provide leadership in assisting
customers to prepare for the legislation and to establish its precise impact
on the Group’ s sales potential and inventory position. This is likely to
become clearer as the year progresses and an update will be included as
part of the Group’ s quarterly announcements.
Post balance sheet events
At an Extraordinary General Meeting held on 9th February 2005, the
Company amended its Articles of Association to give the Company’ s
Directors the ability to limit the number of US residents holding ordinary
or preference shares in the Company . In particular , the Directors are now
able to require US shareholders, whether holding directly or through
nominees, to sell their ordinary shares or preference shares in order to
be satisfied that the number of US shareholders is less than 300 in
respect of each of the ordinary shares and preference shares.
On 9th December 2004, the Company applied to de-list its ordinary
shares and preference shares from the New Y ork Stock Exchange and
the de-listing took effect by SEC order on 16th February 2005. Notice
of termination of the American depositary receipt, or ADR, programmes
in respect of Premier Farnell plc’ s ordinary shares and preference
shares was given to American depositary share, or ADS, holders on
9th December 2004. T ermination of the ADR programmes has taken
effect and on 18th April 2005 the Bank of New Y ork (as depositary for
the ADR programmes) will commence selling the shares underlying any
ADSs not surrendered by the relevant ADS holders and distribute the
net proceeds of sale to the relevant ADS holders.
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
In June 2002, the European Union approved the application of IFRS for all
listed groups for periods commencing on or after 1st January 2005. As a
result, the Group will apply IFRS in its financial statements for the year
ending 29th January 2006. The primary effects of IFRS on the Group are
expected to be the following:
– the re-classification of the Company’ s preference shares from
shareholders’ funds to debt
– the introduction of pension accounting rules which broadly follow
FRS 17
– the requirement to reflect a charge in the profit and loss account relating
to share-based incentives
– the cessation of amortisation of goodwill which will become subject to
an annual test for impairment
– the requirement to account for ordinary dividends in the period in which
they are approved as opposed to the period to which they relate.
The Company will announce the impact of the transition to IFRS,
including a restatement of its financial results for the year ended
30th January 2005 in accordance with IFRS, on 4th May 2005.

Operating Review
Finance Director’s Report continued
30 Premier Farnell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Premier Farnell is committed to establishing a frequent and open
dialogue with the investment community . The senior management
team, in particular John Hirst, Group Chief Executive, Andrew Fisher ,
Group Finance Director , and James Garthwaite, Group Director ,

with financial audiences by means of results presentations, meetings, site
visits, conference calls and its corporate web site, which is updated daily .
Quarterly reporting
Premier Farnell has reported its results quarterly since 1999 to ensure the
market is informed of progress in a regular and timely manner .
First quarter and third quarter announcements: the day we announce
our first and third quarter results, we host a conference call for US and
European investors. Recordings of these calls are also made accessible,
via audio webcasts, on the Group’ s web site.
Interim (second quarter) and preliminary (fourth quarter and full year)
announcements: presentations for investors and broking analysts are
held in London on the mornings that the Group’ s interim and preliminary
results are announced. These are typically attended by over 50 analysts
and investment managers. In addition, the Group hosts a conference call
on the afternoon of the results to ensure that US investors have the
opportunity to interact directly with senior management; many UK
investors also participate. Webcasts of the presentation and conference
calls are made available later the same day on the Group’ s web site.
Investor meetings
Immediately after the announcement of interim and preliminary results,
the Group conducts a programme of investor meetings. During the
financial year ended 30th January 2005, over 120 one-to-one meetings
were held with investors and potential investors in London, Edinburgh,
Frankfurt, Paris and in North America.

hosted five visits which were attended by a total of 21 institutional
investors and analysts.

As at 30th January 2005, Premier Farnell was actively covered by
15 sell-side analysts. During the year , the senior management team
presented at three investor conferences hosted by leading banks.
In addition, the team regularly presents to the equity sales teams of
such institutions.
Annual Report
Premier Farnell’ s Annual Report is posted in May in preparation for the
Annual General Meeting, this year to be held on 14th June at the Mayfair
Conference Centre in London.

less than two thirds of the register .
The market for Premier Farnell’ s shares remains very liquid; during the
year ended 30th January 2005, the average daily trading volume in
Premier Farnell’ s ordinary shares on the London Stock Exchange was
4.2 million shares. This represents a year on year rise of 24 per cent.
Closure of the American Depositary Receipt (ADR) programme
and de-registration from the SEC
During the financial year , the Board undertook a review of the cost and
benefits of Premier Farnell’ s listing on The New Y ork Stock Exchange and
its registration with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
It concluded that the expense of complying with US reporting and
registration obligations was out of proportion to the benefits derived by
the Company . In December , it therefore announced the closure of the
Group’ s ADR programmes with The Bank of New Y ork for both ordinary
and preference shares. The ADR programmes were closed and
Premier Farnell was de-listed from the New Y ork Stock Exchange on
16th February 2005.
In addition, the Board intends to terminate the Company’ s reporting
obligations under the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by
de-registering from the SEC. Further details regarding this intention are
set out in Shareholder Information on page 68.

London EC2M 4AA Principal activities and business review
A detailed review of the Group’ s activities, the development of its
business and an indication of likely future developments are dealt with
on pages 16 to 20.
The principal activity of the Group remains unchanged and is the
distribution of electronic, electrical and industrial products to the design,
maintenance and repair sectors.
Profit and dividends
The profit for the financial year attributable to ordinary shareholders was
£39.9 million (2004: £32.6 million (restated)). The Directors recommend
that a final dividend of 5.0 pence (2004: 5.0 pence) per ordinary share be
paid on 22nd June 2005 to those shareholders on the register of
members at the close of business on 27th May 2004. An interim dividend
of 4.0 pence per ordinary share was paid on 22nd October 2004, making
a total for the year of 9.0 pence (2004: 9.0 pence) per ordinary share.
Acquisitions
In February 2004 the Group purchased the business and certain
assets of GFE Manufacturing Inc., a supplier of lighting systems and
water flow test equipment for the fire-fighting industry for a consideration
of £2.6 million.
Further details of the acquisition are given in note 2 to the Financial
Statements.
Share capital
Details of changes in the issued share capital of the Company during the
year are set out in note 20 on page 58.
At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, the Company will be seeking
authority to purchase its ordinary and preference shares. Authorities were
previously granted at the Annual General Meeting in 2004, but expire at
the close of the forthcoming meeting.
Directors
The names and biographical details of the Directors who held office at the
date of this report appear on page 32. Sir Robert Horton and Sir Malcolm
Bates retired from the Board on 15th June 2004 and 28th February 2005
respectively.
In accordance with the Company’ s Articles of Association, Mr Michael
Lester and Mr John Hirst will retire at the forthcoming Annual General
Meeting of the Company and offer themselves for re-election. Sir Peter
Gershon, who was appointed during the year, will retire and offer
himself for election. Mr Hirst is an Executive Director and has a service
contract with the Company , further details of which are provided in the
Remuneration Report on page 39. Sir Peter Gershon and Mr Michael
Lester are Non-Executive Directors and do not have service contracts.
Following a formal Board evaluation process that was carried out during
the course of the year , the Board considers that the performance of
Mr Lester and Mr Hirst continues to be effective and that they each
continue to demonstrate commitment to their respective roles.
Additional information relating to Directors’ remuneration, service
contracts and interests in the Company’ s shares is given in the
Remuneration Report on pages 37 to 42. The details of Directors’
interests in the Company’ s shares form part of this report.
Supplier payment policy
The Group’ s operating companies are responsible for agreeing terms
and conditions under which business transactions with their suppliers are
conducted. Payments to suppliers are made in accordance with those
terms, provided that suppliers also comply with all relevant terms and
conditions. At 30th January 2005, the amount the Group owed its
suppliers represented 33 working days’ purchases (2004: 36 working
days). The Company is a holding company and does not have any
trade creditors.
Research and development
The Group’ s research and development activities are restricted to the
development of new or enhanced products for Akron Brass and are not
significant in the context of the Group as a whole.
Charitable and political donations
In the US, the Group has an ongoing policy of donating certain items of
stock to charitable organisations. In addition, during the year the Group
made charitable donations in cash of £38,000 (2004: £24,000). Further
details of the Group’ s charitable activities appear in the Social
Responsibility Report on page 26.
The Group continues its policy of not making contributions to
political parties.
Employment
The Group places great emphasis on optimising the contribution made
by employees at all levels around the world. A Group-wide Performance
Review and annual Management Audit process are in their sixth year of
operation. The Group continues to develop new people development
programmes. During the year the management skills programme was
enhanced with a custom made module in competency based
interviewing aimed at improving managers’ and supervisors’ selection
skills. Access to the highly successful OnLine Learning Centre was
increased to enable 4,000 employees to participate in the range of
programmes it provides.
A formal job grading system exists across the Group to assist
remuneration practices as well as career development and organisational
planning processes.
Employees are informed of the performance of the Group and a
structured communication programme allows factors affecting their
employment to be discussed.
Working in close co-operation with elected representatives from its
European operating companies, the Group’ s European Works Council
(The Premier Farnell European Forum) is in its fifth year of operation. The
Forum provides an arena for the exchange of relevant and appropriate
information and constructive dialogue between management and
employees on European issues. A similar forum, specific to the UK, has
been negotiated and will meet for the first time in 2005.The UK Forum has
been established in accordance with the Information and Consultation of
Employees Regulations 2004.
The Group gives full and fair consideration to applications for employment
from disabled persons, with regard to their particular aptitudes and
abilities. Efforts are made to continue the employment of those who
become disabled during their employment. T raining, career development
and promotion are, as far as practicable, identical for all employees
according to their skills and abilities. The Group consistently seeks to
recruit, develop and employ throughout the organisation suitably
qualified, capable and experienced people, irrespective of age, race,
religion or sexual orientation.
Employees’ participation in the Group’s performance is encouraged
through the Group’ s UK savings-related share option scheme.

Directors’ Responsibilities
The following statement, which should be read in conjunction with the
Auditors’ Report, is made with a view to distinguishing for shareholders
the respective responsibilities of the Directors and of the Auditors in
relation to the accounts.
The Directors are required by the Companies Act 1985 to prepare
accounts for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state
of affairs of the Company and the Group as at the end of the financial year
and of the profit or loss of the Group for the financial year . The Directors
consider that in preparing the accounts on pages 43 to 66 the Company
has used appropriate accounting policies, consistently applied and
supported by reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates and
that all applicable accounting standards have been followed.
The Directors have responsibility for ensuring that the Company keeps
accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy the financial
position of the Company and the Group and which enable them to
ensure that the accounts comply with the Companies Act 1985.
The Directors have general responsibility for taking such steps as are
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Company and
the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
The 2005 Annual Report and Accounts will be published on the
Company’ s web site (in addition to the normal paper version). The
maintenance and integrity of the Company’ s web site is the responsibility
of the Directors and the work carried out by the Auditors does not involve
consideration of these matters.
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of
financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. The Company is committed to high standards of corporate governance
throughout the Group. The Board is accountable to the Company’ s
shareholders for good governance and this statement describes how the
principles identified in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance
issued in July 2003 are applied by the Company .
The Board confirms that the Company has complied with all of the
provisions set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code throughout the
year apart from the Chairman discussing governance and strategy with
major shareholders and the attendance of other Non-Executive Directors
at meetings with major shareholders. This point is explained below.
Directors
The Board consists of a Non-Executive Chairman, four Non-Executive
Directors, all of whom are considered by the Board to be independent,
and three Executive Directors. John Roques is the Company’ s Senior
Independent Non-Executive Director and is available to shareholders if
they have concerns which contact through the normal channels cannot
resolve or where the normal channels are inappropriate.
Biographies of the Board members appear on page 32. These indicate
the high level and broad range of experience that they possess. The
Directors’ knowledge of the Group’ s business and of legal, accounting
and market developments is frequently updated by presentations made
at Board and Board Committee meetings.
The appointment letters for Non-Executive Directors include the time
commitment expected of Non-Executive Directors and confirmation
that they have sufficient time available to meet this commitment.
Non-Executive Directors are required to inform the Board of any
changes to their other appointments.
After the date of his appointment to the Board, Sir Peter Gershon
became Chairman of Symbian Software Limited and a member of
BT plc’ s European Advisory Board.
The Board
The role of the Board is to maximise the long-term performance of the
Group through the development of a strategy designed to create
shareholder value. The Board reviews strategic issues on a regular basis
and exercises control over the performance of each operating company
within the Group by agreeing budgetary targets and monitoring
performance against those targets.
The roles of the Chairman and Group Chief Executive are separate and
clearly defined. The Group Chief Executive is responsible for the
executive management of the Group’ s business while the Chairman, who
has no executive management responsibilities, runs the Board.
The Board has five scheduled meetings each year and others as
required. The Board has a schedule of matters reserved to it for decision,
including major capital expenditure, significant investments or disposals
and treasury policy . In certain areas, specific responsibility is delegated to
committees of the Board within defined terms of reference.
The Audit and Remuneration Committees have, respectively, five and four
scheduled meetings each year , although additional meetings may be held
where required. The Nominations Committee meets as required.
During the year , all Directors attended the five Board meetings that were
held, apart from Sir Robert Horton and Michael Lester , who were each
absent for one meeting. All of the members of the respective committees
attended the five Audit Committee and five Remuneration Committee
meetings that were held, except for one meeting each of the Audit and
Remuneration Committees that Mr Lester was unable to attend.
Complete copies of the terms of reference of the Audit, Remuneration
and Nominations Committees are available on the Company’ s web site at
www.premierfarnell.com. The membership of the Committees appears
on page 32.
There is an agreed procedure for Directors to take independent
professional advice at the Company’ s expense if necessary in the
performance of their duties. This is in addition to the access which every
Director has to the Company Secretary . The Company Secretary is
charged by the Board with ensuring that Board procedures are followed.
The Board has adopted a number of corporate governance policies,
including a Group Code of Ethics covering issues such as conflicts of
interest, fraud, whistleblowing and share dealing. A copy of the Code is
also available on the Company’s web site. The Company has implemented
arrangements with an independent organisation to receive information
from employees for whistleblowing purposes.
T o enable the Board to function effectively and assist Directors to
discharge their responsibilities, full and timely access is given to all
relevant information. In the case of Board meetings, this consists of a
comprehensive set of papers, including regular business progress reports
and discussion documents regarding specific matters. In addition,
individual Directors meet with senior management and are encouraged to
make periodic site visits, including overseas where appropriate. Senior
managers are regularly invited to Board meetings and make business
presentations.
A formal and comprehensive induction process is in place for new
Directors. This includes presentations from management and site visits.
During the year a performance evaluation was carried out covering the
Board, each of the principal Board Committees and individual Directors.
The evaluation process consisted of the completion by each Director of a
questionnaire devised for the purpose. The responses were collated by
the Company Secretary . The results were considered by the Chairmen of
the Board and the relevant Committees and by the Board as a whole. The
evaluation of individual Directors was considered by the Chairman and
the evaluation of the performance of the Chairman was considered by the
Senior Independent Director . In each case, appropriate action was taken
during the year .
Any Director appointed during the year is required, under the provisions
of the Company’ s Articles of Association, to retire and seek election by
shareholders at the next Annual General Meeting. The Articles also
require that every Director must retire and seek re-election at least every
three years.
Remuneration
The composition and role of the Remuneration Committee is set out in
the Remuneration Report on pages 37 to 42.
Full details of Directors’ remuneration and a statement of the Company’ s
remuneration policy also appear in the Remuneration Report.
Each Executive Director abstains from any discussion or voting at full
Board meetings on Remuneration Committee recommendations where
the recommendations have a direct bearing on his own remuneration
package. The details of each Executive Director’s individual package are
fixed by the Remuneration Committee in line with the policy adopted by
the full Board.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee, comprising the Chairman, the Senior
Independent Director and Mr Lester , meets as necessary .
The Committee’ s principal function is to provide advice and
recommendations to the Board on any appointments to the Board.
The Committee also keeps the composition and balance of the Board
under review.
During the year the Committee was involved in the appointment of
Sir Peter Gershon to the Board and his subsequent appointment as
Chairman. As well as making recommendations to the Board as a whole,
Committee members consulted Non-Executive and Executive Directors
individually on these appointments. Sir Peter’ s other commitments
appear in his biography on page 32.
Premier Farnell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 35
Corporate Governance 36 Premier Farnell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005
Audit and internal control
The primary role of the Audit Committee is to keep under review the
Group’ s financial and other systems and controls and its financial
reporting procedures. In fulfilling this role, the Committee receives and
reviews work carried out by the Internal and External Auditors and their
findings. The Company’ s Internal Audit department works to an annual
programme developed in consultation with the Committee, as well as
covering specific matters arising during the year .
The Audit Committee’ s terms of reference are available on the
Company’ s web site. In addition, and following a recommendation from
the Smith Report, the Committee has also adopted and implemented a
Group-wide policy restricting the appointment of former employees of the
external auditors.
The Committee keeps the scope and cost effectiveness of both the
internal and external audit functions under review. This now includes an
annual review of the effectiveness of the External Auditors, including their
quality control procedures. During the year an independent review of the
Internal Audit function was carried out by Deloitte & T ouche and the
results reported to the Committee. These were regarded by the
Committee as very satisfactory .
The independence and objectivity of the External Auditors is also
considered on a regular basis, with particular regard to the level of
non-audit fees. The split between audit and non-audit fees for the year to
30th January 2005 and information on the nature of the non-audit fees
incurred appear in note 5 to the Financial Statements. The non-audit fees
were paid in respect of assurance work (including taxation) and are
considered by the Committee not to affect the independence or
objectivity of the auditors.
The External Auditors’ appointment is subject to review every two years
by the Committee and the lead audit partner is rotated at least every
five years. The Committee also maintains a formal policy on the provision
of non-audit services by the Auditors, which is reviewed each year . This
policy prohibits the provision of certain services and requires that others
are subject to prior approval by the Committee or its Chairman. This
policy allows specific tax compliance services within defined monetary
limits to be pre-approved by the Committee at the beginning of the year .
All other permitted non-audit services are considered on a case by case
basis.
At each of its meetings, the Committee is provided with information on
all non-audit services provided by the Auditors and the estimated cost
of such services. The Committee monitors such costs, in the context of
the audit fee for the year, in order to ensure that the value of non-audit
services does not increase to a level where it has the potential to affect
the Auditors’ objectivity and independence.
The Committee also receives an annual confirmation of independence
from the auditors.
Throughout the year, the Group has been in full compliance with the
applicable provisions on internal control contained in the Combined Code.
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’ s system of internal
controls and risk management. The Audit Committee reviews and
monitors the system’ s effectiveness on behalf of the Board at least
annually , while responsibility for the system rests with the Executive
Directors. The system includes an ongoing process for identifying,
evaluating and managing significant business risks. However, any system
can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance of meeting
internal control objectives.
The Board regularly reviews the Group’ s strategic direction. At the
business unit level, strategic objectives, annual plans and performance
targets are set by the executive team in the context of the Group’ s overall
objectives. There is a defined process for identifying and evaluating the
significant risks faced by the Group.
In addition to this process, businesses are subject to:
– a quarterly , comprehensive review by the executive team
– independent internal and external audits which focus on areas of high
risk which are reported to the executive team and the Audit Committee
– an extensive budget and target-setting process
– a monthly reporting and forecasting process reviewing performance
against agreed objectives
– appropriate delegated authority levels which prescribe the limits to
which the Group can be committed
– established financial policies and procedures, including a detailed
quarterly checklist completed as part of the Company’ s quarterly
financial reporting process
– other risk management policies and procedures such as health and
safety , environmental and quality assurance.
An executive management committee, the Disclosure and Risk
Committee, monitors and reviews disclosure and risk management
processes and reports to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee
considers these reports, alongside other reports from the Internal Audit
department and the External Auditors, to arrive at a balanced
assessment of control effectiveness across the Group. The Disclosure
and Risk Committee also reviews disclosures made by the Company to
regulators and the investment community before they are considered by
the Board. The Audit Committee reports to the Board on its activities and
all Board members receive copies of the minutes of Audit Committee
meetings.
The statement of the Directors’ responsibilities in relation to the accounts
appears on page 34.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that
the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Communication with stakeholders
The Company places a great deal of importance on communication with
its stakeholders.
There is regular dialogue with individual institutional shareholders as well
as general presentations after the interim and preliminary results. In 1999
the Company introduced quarterly financial reporting in order to improve
the level of information available to all shareholders. All Company
announcements are published on the Company’ s web site, together with
presentation materials.
The Board regards the discussion of the Company’ s strategy as primarily
part of the role of the Chief Executive and this forms part of his regular
meetings with institutional shareholders. Feedback from these meetings
is provided to the Board, both by the Group Director , Communications
and by the Company’ s financial public relations advisers. The Board also
regularly receives copies of analysts’ reports on the Company .
The Chairman is available to shareholders at any time to discuss strategy
and governance matters. While other Non-Executive Directors do not
ordinarily attend meetings with major shareholders, they would do so if
this was requested by shareholders.
All ordinary shareholders have the opportunity to ask questions at the
Company’ s Annual General Meeting, at which the Group Chief Executive
makes a business presentation summarising the progress of the Group
during the year . All Directors are usually available to take questions at the
meeting.
As discussed in the Directors’ Report, employee communication is given
high priority . This has included the establishment of European and
UK Works Councils. The UK Works Council was established in
accordance with the Information and Consultation of Employees
Regulations 2004.
Corporate Governance continued Remuneration Report
This report provides information on Directors’ remuneration. A resolution
will be put to shareholders at the Company’ s Annual General Meeting
inviting them to approve this Report.
Remuneration policy
The Company’ s overall policy aims are to:
– attract, develop, motivate and keep talented people at all levels
throughout the Group
– pay competitive salaries and benefits to all of its people
– encourage the holding of shares in the Company as an effective way
of aligning the interests of employees with those of shareholders
– focus remuneration arrangements to help each business in the Group
meet its specific targets.
The Board’ s policy for executive remuneration is to:
– pay a basic salary which is competitive with other companies of similar
size and complexity
– give executives the opportunity to increase their basic earnings by
meeting and outperforming key short-term and long-term measures,
thereby linking executive rewards to the Group’ s performance and
shareholder interests
– encourage executives to hold shares in the Company
– reward executives fairly and responsibly for their contribution to the
Group’ s performance, without paying more than is necessary to
achieve this objective.
In framing this policy , the Board has given full consideration to the
provisions of the Combined Code, as updated in July 2003.
It is the Company’ s policy that Executive Directors be permitted to hold
one non-executive directorship with another company. The fees payable
in respect of this directorship are retained by the Executive Director .
Mr Hirst is currently a Non-Executive Director of Hammerson plc for
which he receives an annual fee of £43,500.
This report sets out the Company’ s policy on Directors’ remuneration for
2005 and, so far as practicable, for subsequent years. The Committee
considers that a successful remuneration policy needs to be sufficiently
flexible to take account of future changes in the Group’ s business
environment and remuneration practice. Any changes in policy for
years after 2005 will be described in future Remuneration Reports.
All statements in this Report in relation to remuneration policy for years
after 2005 should be read in the light of this paragraph.
The Remuneration Committee and its role
The Remuneration Committee consists of Mr Michael Lester (Chairman),
Mr William Korb, Mr Cary Nolan and Mr John Roques. All members of the
Committee are independent Non-Executive Directors. The Committee
met five times during the year covered by this report. The Chairman will
continue to ensure the Company maintains contact, as necessary , with
its principal shareholders about remuneration.
The Chief Executive attends meetings of the Committee to discuss the
performance of other executives and to make proposals where
necessary , but is not present when his own position is discussed.
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board on the Group’ s
framework of executive remuneration and its cost. The Committee
determines the specific remuneration packages for Executive Directors
and the other senior executives who form the Group Leadership T eam.
During the year the Committee received advice from the Chief Executive
in respect of the remuneration arrangements for other senior executives
and from Mr Brian Lewis, Group HR Director , in respect of remuneration
arrangements generally . The Committee has also appointed KPMG
People Services, a division of KPMG LLP , to provide independent advice
to the Committee. During the year KPMG People Services carried out a
comprehensive review of the remuneration arrangements for Executive
Directors and other senior executives. This review concluded that the
arrangements in place are consistent with the Company’ s
remuneration policy.
KPMG LLP provide other services to the Company , principally in relation
to tax matters.
The current remuneration package
The current elements of remuneration for Executive Directors and senior
executives are as follows:
Salary and benefits
The Committee reviews salaries each year taking account of Group and
personal performance and against the salaries of companies of similar
size and complexity . The Committee also takes account of the levels of
pay awarded elsewhere in the Group
The value of non-cash benefits for Executive Directors is included in the
table of remuneration on page 40 and, for Mr Hirst and Mr Fisher , consists
of a fully expensed car and life and health insurance. Mr Bain does not
have a company car , but instead receives a cash allowance which is
included in the salary figure disclosed in the table. Mr Bain does receive
life and health insurance, the values of which are included in benefits in
kind. The value of these benefits is not pensionable for any Executive
Director , but is assessable to income tax
Short-term incentives
The Company operates an annual performance-related bonus scheme
for Executive Directors and senior executives. The maximum bonus
payment under the scheme is 100 per cent of base salary for Mr Hirst
and 70 per cent of base salary for Mr Fisher and Mr Bain. T o reach this
maximum requires that the Company exceeds its budgeted profit as
well as achievement of clearly defined individual objectives. The
Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the performance conditions
for the annual bonus are relevant and stretching and designed to
enhance shareholder value
Long-term incentives
The Company operates a long-term incentive plan and the share option
schemes described below.
Remuneration Report
Premier Farnell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 37 Long-term incentives
Under the long-term incentive plan, Executive Directors and senior
executives are awarded rights to acquire ordinary shares. Each award
made under the plan is subject to performance conditions which will
determine how many (if any) of the shares under the award the participant
is entitled to acquire after the three year performance period. The
maximum award which can be made to a participant in any year is equal
to 100 per cent of base salary .
The main performance condition compares the growth of the Company’ s
total shareholder return or TSR (share price growth and reinvested
dividends) over a three year period to that of the companies in the FTSE
mid-250 Index (excluding investment trusts). The Company’ s ranking
amongst the comparator companies determines the percentage of
shares which a participant can acquire. No shares may be acquired
where the Company’ s ranking is below median and, to acquire the full
number of shares awarded, the Company must rank in the top quartile of
the comparator group. Between these two points, vesting is on a
straight-line basis, with 20 per cent of any award vesting where the
Company’ s performance is at the median. Where performance over the
three year period does not reach the median ranking, the relevant award
lapses and there is no re-testing of performance.
In addition, shares can only be acquired under any award if the
Committee is satisfied that the underlying performance of the Company
during the performance period justifies the exercise of an award.
The TSR performance condition was chosen as the Committee believes
that TSR is an appropriate method of comparing the performance of
the Company to that of its peers. The FTSE mid-250 Index (excluding
investment trusts) was chosen as the comparator group as there are a
limited number of companies which are directly comparable to the
Company and the index was therefore felt to be a suitable yardstick of
relative performance.
In assessing whether such performance condition has been met, the
Committee will rely on calculations of the Company’ s TSR and that of
the FTSE mid-250 Index carried out on their behalf by New Bridge
Street Consultants. The requirement that the Committee must be
satisfied that the underlying performance of the Company during the
performance period justifies the exercise of an award is intended to give
the Committee a discretion as to whether or not to allow a particular
exercise, notwithstanding the achievement of at least a median TSR
ranking. The Committee’ s view is that such circumstances are likely to be
exceptional and therefore they are difficult to determine before they have
arisen. In addition, the Committee does not wish to limit its discretion in
any way by attempting to pre-determine the circumstances in which it
might be exercised. If the Committee exercised this discretion it would be
in respect of all awards made on a particular date and not in respect of a
particular individual or individuals.
Benefits under the long-term incentive plan are not pensionable.
The Company currently operates an executive share option scheme,
under which both Inland Revenue approved and unapproved options
may be granted, and an SAYE option scheme. Benefits under these
plans are not pensionable.
Annual grants are made under the executive share option scheme with a
maximum grant equal to 100 per cent of the individual’ s annual salary .
Exercise of options granted under the scheme is subject to a performance
condition. This condition is that the growth in the Company’ s adjusted
earnings per share (EPS) over the three consecutive financial years
starting with the year of grant exceeds the growth in the UK Retail Price
Index (RPI) over the same period by at least 9 per cent. At this level of
performance half of the options granted are exercisable. Exercise of all
options granted requires that the Company’ s EPS growth exceeds RPI
over the period by at least 15 per cent, with a sliding scale for performance
between 9 per cent and 15 per cent. If the performance condition is not
met over this three year period, options may also be exercised if the
Company’ s EPS growth exceeds RPI by a minimum of 12 per cent over
the four financial years starting with the year of grant. The same sliding
scale for exercise applies for performance between 12 per cent and
20 per cent. If the performance target is not met by the fourth year , the
relevant options lapse.
EPS was chosen as the appropriate measure of performance as it
provides an absolute benchmark of the Company’ s performance and is
therefore a suitable balance with the relative performance measurement
used in the Company’ s long-term incentive plan.
Options granted under earlier schemes operated by the Company
remain outstanding. Executive options granted under such schemes
after 13th March 2001 may not be exercised unless the growth in the
Company’ s EPS over a period of three consecutive financial years
exceeds the growth in the UK Retail Price Index (RPI) over the same
period by at least 9 per cent. For options granted after 20th June 1996,
but before 14th March 2001, exercise is subject to the growth in EPS
over three consecutive years exceeding the growth in RPI over the same
period by at least 6 per cent. For options granted before 20th June 1996
EPS growth over three consecutive years must match the growth in RPI
over the same period before options can be exercised. EPS was chosen
as the appropriate measure of performance at the time the executive
share option schemes were first introduced and is the most common
measure used in traditional option schemes. The Company’ s EPS
performance is reported quarterly in the Company’ s results
announcements.
The implementation of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
will affect the calculation of the Company’ s EPS and the Committee is
working to ensure a successful transition from UK GAAP to the new
standards. Further details will be included in the next annual
Remuneration Report.
In common with all eligible employees of the Group, Executive Directors
are entitled to participate in the Company’ s SAYE option scheme. These
options are not subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition as
this scheme is not restricted to Executive Directors and senior executives.
The Company’ s executive shareholding policy requires Executive
Directors and other senior executives to retain a number of the shares
acquired as a result of the exercise of executive share options or awards
under the long-term incentive plan until a shareholding with a value equal
to the executive’ s annual base salary is reached. This level of shareholding
is then to be maintained.
Remuneration Report continued
38 Premier Farnell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Pension arrangements
The final salary section of the Premier Farnell UK Pension Scheme (the
UK Scheme) was closed to new entrants during 1998. Employees who
were entitled to final salary benefits as members of the UK Scheme at
31st December 1998 now receive benefits through a combination of final
salary benefits funded by the UK Scheme and the Premier Farnell Corp.
Master Pension Plan (the US Plan). In addition, contributions are made to
the money purchase section within the UK Scheme. Employees joining
the UK Scheme since 1st January 1999 are entitled to money purchase
benefits only , and the UK Scheme is no longer contracted out.
Mr John Hirst and Mr Andrew Fisher are each entitled to a combination
of final salary and money purchase benefits under the arrangements set
out above up to the limit of the Inland Revenue earnings cap (currently
£102,000). Company contributions payable into the money purchase
arrangement on their behalf amount to 20.4 per cent of the earnings cap
for Mr Hirst and 15.8 per cent of the earnings cap for Mr Fisher , with each
making an employee contribution equal to 3 per cent of the earnings cap.
The Company makes further contributions on behalf of Mr Hirst and
Mr Fisher to funded unapproved retirement benefit schemes (FURBS),
determined by reference to the excess of their salaries over the earnings
cap. The cost to the Company of these further contributions was £194,292
(2004: £208,542) for Mr Hirst and £87,523 (2004: £83,842) for Mr Fisher .
Mr Bain is entitled to money purchase benefits from a combination of the
UK scheme and an unapproved scheme (FURBS). T otal contributions are
5 per cent of basic salary from Mr Bain (all paid to the UK scheme) and
27 per cent of basic salary from the Company , of which 4 per cent of
basic salary is paid into the UK scheme and 23 per cent of basic salary
into the FURBS. The total cost to the Company of these contributions
was £68,378.
The Remuneration Committee is currently reviewing pension policy in
the light of the proposed changes to pension legislation from April 2006.
Further details will be included in the next annual Remuneration Report.
Relative importance of remuneration elements
The Committee’ s view is that the performance related elements of the
remuneration package for Executive Directors should be a significant
element of the total. This serves to align the interests of such Directors
with shareholders. Assuming full payment of all elements, more than
two-thirds of the total remuneration of Executive Directors (ignoring
pension contributions) would be performance related.
Service contracts
In accordance with the Company’ s policy , Mr Hirst, Mr Fisher and
Mr Bain have service agreements which are terminable by the Company
on twelve months’ notice. Mr Hirst’ s and Mr Bain’ s service agreements,
dated 13th November 1998 and 23rd April 2004 respectively , allow the
Company to make a payment of salary in lieu of the whole or part of their
notice periods and Mr Fisher’ s agreement, dated 24th November 1994,
contains provisions entitling him to a payment equal to 12 months’ salary
and benefits in the event of early termination. The Company’ s policy is
generally not to include a provision providing for payment of a fixed
sum on termination and to endeavour to minimise any payment on
early termination by insisting on mitigation of any loss. The provisions
in Mr Fisher’ s agreement were included as part of the reduction in his
notice period from 24 months during 2001.
Non-Executive Directors
The fees for the Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board
as a whole. Fees for the Chairman are determined by the Remuneration
Committee. Business expenses are also reimbursed. In addition to the
base fee, an additional £5,000 per annum is paid to the Chairmen of the
Audit and Remuneration Committees and an additional £2,500 to the
Senior Independent Director .
The Non-Executive Directors do not have contracts of service, but are
appointed pursuant to letters of appointment. Such appointments are
initially for a three-year term. It is normal that the appointment is renewed
for a second three-year period. Thereafter , the Company’ s policy is for
re-appointments to be on an annual basis, with expiry dates coinciding
with the Company’ s Annual General Meeting in the relevant year .
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any incentive
plans, share options schemes or Company pension arrangements and
are not entitled to any payment in compensation for any early termination
of their appointment.
The commencement dates for the current appointments of
Non-Executive Directors are:
Sir Peter Gershon 21st June 2004 (three-year)
W Korb 21st January 2003 (three-year)
M Lester 14th June 2005 (annual)
C Nolan 14th June 2005 (annual)
D J S Roques 14th June 2005 (annual)
Any Director appointed by the Board during the year holds office only
until the next Annual General Meeting and may then stand for election.
Thereafter , each Director must retire from office at every third Annual
General Meeting since he last retired, at which meeting he will be eligible
for re-election.

* No contribution is made by Directors to the final salary pension arrangements
For each of the Directors the main terms applying to their final salary pensions are:
– payable from normal retirement age of 60
– the Directors do not make any contribution to the final salary pension arrangements
– spouse’ s pension of 50 per cent of the Director’ s pension payable on death
– pensions in payment increase in line with inflation, to a maximum of 5 per cent each year
Mr Hirst is aged 52 and Mr Fisher is aged 47.
The accrued final salary pension shown at 30th January 2005 is the combined figure for the UK Scheme and US Plan defined benefit accruals and is
the amount that the Director would be entitled to from normal retirement age if he left service at the end of the year.
The increase in final salary pension during the year is the increase over the figure disclosed in last year’ s accounts both including and excluding an
allowance for inflation during the year.
All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice. The transfer values of the accrued entitlement represent the value of assets
that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the scheme’ s liability in respect of the Director’ s final
salary pension benefits. They do not represent sums payable to individual Directors and therefore they cannot be added meaningfully to annual
remuneration.
The table above shows transfer values at the beginning and the end of the year . As the transfer values are linked to investment market conditions, a
slight fall in investment yields over the year has been a factor in the increase in transfer values which is shown. Members’ contributions paid during
the year were paid into the money purchase arrangement within the UK Scheme and as such are not included in the transfer value.

In addition to the above beneficial interests in the Company’s ordinary shares, the Executive Directors are regarded for Companies Act purposes
as being interested in 304,000 ordinary shares held by the Premier Farnell Executive Trust. All employees (including Executive Directors) are
potential beneficiaries of the trust. It is not anticipated that any employee or Executive Director will be entitled to receive from the trust a greater
number of shares than that to which they are entitled on exercise of awards made to them under the long-term incentive plan.

Performance graph
The graph below shows the total shareholder return for a holding of the Company’s ordinary shares for the five financial years of the Company of
which the year to 30th January 2005 is the last. This is compared to the total shareholder return for a hypothetical holding in the FTSE mid-250
Index (excluding investment trusts). This was chosen as it is the index of which the Company is a constituent and the index used for the purposes
of the long-term incentive plan. Total shareholder return is the growth in value of a share plus the value of dividends paid, assuming that the
dividends are reinvested in the Company’s shares on the day on which they are paid.

Premier Farnell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 47 Premier Farnell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 47
Basis of accounting
The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention
and in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards. A summary
of the more important Group accounting policies, which the Directors
consider to be the most appropriate for the Group, is set out below,
together with an explanation of where changes have been made
to previous policies on the adoption of new accounting standards in
the year.
Changes in accounting policies
The Group has adopted UITF 17 (revised 2003), Employee Share Schemes,
and UITF 38, Accounting for ESOP T rusts, in these accounts. The
adoption of UITF 17 did not require any change in comparative figures.
The adoption of UITF 38 represents a change in accounting policy and
the comparative figures have been restated accordingly (note 22).
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated accounts incorporate the accounts of the Company
and each of its subsidiary undertakings for the financial year ended
30th January 2005. Results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or
disposed of are consolidated from or up to the date on which control
passes. Inter-group transactions are eliminated on consolidation.
T urnover and revenue recognition
T urnover comprises the value of sales to outside customers, excluding
value added and sales taxes. T urnover is recognised when the risks and
rewards of ownership have passed to the customer .
Expense classification
Cost of sales comprises the cost of goods delivered to customers
including the cost of freight, packaging and inventory adjustments.
Distribution costs represent all operating company expenses including
sales, marketing, product and purchasing, warehousing, information
technology and eCommerce.
Administrative expenses comprise the cost of central head office and the
Group Board.
Goodwill
Goodwill, comprising the amount by which the consideration for
acquisitions exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired, is
capitalised and amortised through the profit and loss account on a
straight line basis over its estimated useful life, which has been
determined as 20 years.
As permitted by FRS 10, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, goodwill arising
on acquisitions prior to 1999 remains written off against reserves. Such
goodwill would be charged in the profit and loss account on subsequent
disposal of the related business.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is reviewed for impairment in accordance
with FRS 10 and FRS 11, Impairment of Fixed Assets and Goodwill, at
the end of the first full year after an acquisition and in other years if
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may
not be recoverable, any impairment arising being charged to the profit
and loss account.
T angible fixed assets and depreciation
Fixed assets are stated at cost. Interest is not capitalised.
With the exception of motor vehicles, which are depreciated on a
reducing balance basis at 25% per annum, depreciation is calculated to
write off the cost of individual fixed assets from the time they become
operational by equal annual instalments over their estimated useful lives,
which are principally as follows:
Plant and equipment: between 5 and 10 years.
Computer equipment: between 3 and 5 years.
Freehold buildings: 50 years.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
Fixed assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with FRS 11 if
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may
not be recoverable, any impairment arising being charged to the profit
and loss account.
Financial instruments
Gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts, entered into as
hedges of future purchases and sales denominated in foreign currency ,
are carried forward and taken to the profit and loss account on maturity to
match the underlying transactions.
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate hedges are
recognised as adjustments to interest payable or receivable over the life
of the hedge.
Exchange gains and losses arising on foreign currency borrowings and
related financial instruments used to finance the Group’ s foreign currency
investments are taken to reserves and reported in the statement of total
recognised gains and losses.
Stocks
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Provision is
made against slow moving and obsolete stock based on analysis of
historical data.
Deferred taxation
Full provision is made, on an undiscounted basis, for deferred taxation
resulting from timing differences between profits computed for taxation
purposes and profits stated in the accounts to the extent that there is an
obligation to pay more tax in the future as a result of the reversal of those
timing differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent they are expected to be
recoverable.
Pensions and similar obligations
The Group operates defined benefit and defined contribution schemes.
Pension schemes are accounted for in accordance with SSAP 24.
Accordingly , the expected cost of providing pension benefits under
defined benefit schemes and other post-retirement benefits is amortised
in the profit and loss account over the period benefiting from the
employees’ services. Costs with respect to defined contribution schemes
are charged to the profit and loss account as they fall due.
The Group has adopted the transitional arrangements of FRS 17,
Retirement Benefits, details of which are given in note 28.
Foreign exchange
The results of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated into
sterling at the average exchange rate ruling during the year . Foreign
currency assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at the rates of
exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Gains or losses arising in the
ordinary course of business are dealt with in arriving at operating profit.
Those arising on the translation of the assets and liabilities of overseas
subsidiary undertakings, together with the exchange differences arising
when the profit and loss accounts are translated at average rates and
compared to the rate ruling at the balance sheet date, are dealt with as
movements in reserves.
The principal exchange rates used to translate the Group’ s overseas
subsidiaries were as follows:
2005 2004
Average Year-end Average Year-end
US dollar 1.84 1.88 1.66 1.82
Euro 1.47 1.45 1.44 1.47
Catalogue and advertising costs
Catalogue costs are expensed over the life of the catalogue up to a
maximum period of one year. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
Leased assets
Payments under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss
account as they fall due.
Long-term incentive plan
The consolidated profit and loss account includes the costs relating to the
Premier Farnell Performance Share Plan and the Consolidated and
Company balance sheets include the appropriate assets and liabilities of
the plan. Shares in the Company held by the trust established to
administer the plan are deducted in arriving at shareholders’ funds.
Where options over shares are awarded to employees, the value of the
expected award is charged on a straight line basis over the performance
period to which the award relates.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are included at cost. Provision is
made where, in the opinion of the Directors, a permanent diminution in
value has occurred.
Research and development
Research and development costs are expensed in the profit and loss
account in the year in which they arise. 48 Premier Farnell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005

2 Acquisition
On 6th February 2004, the Group acquired the business and certain assets of GFE Manufacturing Inc., a US company involved in the manufacture
of lighting rigs for the fire-fighting industry, for a cash consideration, including costs, of £2.6 million. The book and fair value of net assets acquired
was £1.0 million, comprising tangible fixed assets of £0.6 million and working capital of £0.4 million, with the resulting goodwill of £1.6 million being
amortised over a period of 20 years, which management considers to be the best estimate of its useful economic life.
GFE Manufacturing contributed £3.1 million of sales and £0.7 million of operating profit to the Industrial Products Division in the year since
acquisition.

10 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share are based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders for the year and the weighted average number of ordinary
shares in issue during the year, excluding those shares held by the Premier Farnell Executive Trust (note 21). For diluted earnings per share, the
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume issue of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, being those share options
granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’ s ordinary shares during the year.

16 Financial instruments and derivatives
An explanation of the Group’s objectives, policies and strategies in the use of derivatives and other financial instruments is included in the Finance
Director’ s Report under the heading Treasury operations on page 29. The following detailed disclosures with regard to the use of financial
instruments and derivatives exclude short-term trade debtors and creditors where permitted by FRS13, Financial Instruments.
1) Foreign currency risk
The Group hedges transactions primarily related to the purchase and sale of inventories denominated in foreign currencies through foreign
exchange forward contracts. These contracts reduce currency risk from exchange rate movements with respect to these transactions and related
cash flows. Gains and losses are deferred and accounted for as part of the underlying transactions.
The Group does not hedge profit translation exposure, unless there is a corresponding cashflow, since such hedges provide only a temporary
deferral of the effects of movements in exchange rates. Similarly, whilst a significant proportion of the Group’ s borrowings are denominated in
US dollars, the Group does not specifically hedge all of its long-term investments in overseas assets. Currency translation gains, amounting to
£1.7 million (2004: £9.8 million) in the year ended 30th January 2005, have been credited to reserves in relation to the translation of net assets in
foreign currencies.
At 30th January 2005, the gross notional amount of foreign exchange forward contracts to sell foreign currencies, all of which had maturities of less
than one year, totalled £72.2 million (2004: £64.2 million) and can be analysed as follows:
Commitments to sell foreign currency
Sterling equivalent Unrecognised/deferred
gains and (losses)
2005 2004 2005 2004
£m £m £m £m
Euros 17.6 10.9 0.1 0.1
Australian dollars 3.5 0.6 – –
US dollars 51.1 52.7 – –
72.2 64.2 0.1 0.1
The commitment to sell US dollars and approximately half of the commitment to sell euros are linked to the Group’ s US dollar and euro denominated
borrowings referred to below, which provide a hedge against the Group’ s US dollar and euro investments. The unrealised exchange gains on these
commitments have been reflected in the Statement of T otal Recognised Gains and Losses.
In addition, at 30th January 2005, the Group had entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to buy £0.9 million (2004: £0.9 million) of
US dollars on which there was no unrecognised loss (2004: loss of £0.1 million).
The unrecognised/deferred gains and losses in respect of foreign exchange forward contracts are estimated by reference to the amounts not yet
recognised that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the contracts based on year end rates.
During the financial year, the Group has not used any other financial instruments to hedge trading foreign exchange rate exposures.
54 Premier Farnell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Notes to the Accounts continued
Note 16 continued
The Group’ s primary translation exposure relates to the relative values of the pound sterling and US dollar. Although the US business generates
significant US dollar trading cash flows, the Group’ s borrowings are predominantly US dollar denominated. Management anticipates that the
ongoing US dollar interest and dividend obligations, together with US dollar trade payments in the UK, should continue to preclude the need to enter
into any significant hedging of US dollar cash flows.
At 30th January 2005, the Group had the equivalent of £9.0 million (2004: £4.5 million) of predominantly euro denominated net financial assets in
non-functional currencies in relation to which future movements in foreign currencies could have a limited impact on consolidated profit.
2) Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a combination of retained cash flow, equity and non-equity shares and short and medium-term borrowings.
Procedures are in place to monitor and manage interest rate risk with derivatives being entered into when considered appropriate by management.
Financial liabilities
The maturity profile of the Group’ s borrowings is as follows:
2005 2004
Fixed Floating Total Fixed Floating Total
£m £m £m £m £m £m
Due within one year 0.1 0.7 0.8 0.1 2.8 2.9
Due between one and two years 82.5 23.6 106.1 0.1 – 0.1
Due between two and five years 0.2 – 0.2 85.5 20.0 105.5
Due over five years 121.0 0.5 121.5 124.9 0.2 125.1
203.8 24.8 228.6 210.6 23.0 233.6
The Group’s borrowings are denominated in US dollars with the exception of the floating rate debt due within two years of £24.3 million, of which
£18.5 million is denominated in euros and £5.8 million is denominated in sterling.
The Group has multi-currency bilateral bank facilities of £121.6 million, which are committed until mid 2006. The facilities carry a LIBOR based
floating rate of interest. At the year end, £23.6 million was drawn on these facilities (2004: £20.0 million).
The weighted average interest rate attributable to fixed rate borrowings was 6.3% (2004: 6.6%) and the weighted average duration of fixed rate
borrowings was 5.0 years (2004: 6.0 years).
The Group’ s other financial liabilities comprise provision for dilapidation costs of £1.0 million (2004: £1.5 million) (note 19).
Non-equity shares
A proportion of the Group’ s share capital is attributable to non-equity interests, in the form of cumulative convertible redeemable preference shares.
The rights and restrictions attaching to the preference shares are described in note 20.
Financial assets
Cash at bank and in hand of £27.9 million (2004: £31.7 million) relates principally to overnight deposits and current account balances held in
trading operations worldwide and comprises £nil (2004: £3.4 million) in sterling, £15.7 million (2004: £14.5 million) in euros, £5.2 million
(2004: £7.4 million) in US dollars and £7.0 million (2004: £6.4 million) in other currencies. All significant balances earn interest based on local
market rates appropriate for the currency concerned.
3) Fair value of financial assets and liabilities

The fair value of borrowings is based on estimates of the current fixed interest rates available for debt of the same remaining maturity. The fair value
of non-equity interests is based on the quoted market price as at the financial year end.

4) Credit risk
The Group monitors its positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions which are counterparties to its forward exchange contracts
and does not anticipate non-performance by the counterparties. The Group would not realise a material loss in the event of non-performance by
counterparties. At 30th January 2005, neither the Group nor the counterparties were required to collateralise their respective obligations under

Allotments during the year
On various dates during the year, allotments were made under the Company’ s Executive Share Option Schemes totalling 37,000 ordinary shares
(nominal value: £1,850) for a cash consideration of £64,140.
The rights and restrictions attaching to the US$1.35 cumulative convertible redeemable preference shares of £1 each
(the ‘US preference shares’) and the 89.2p cumulative convertible redeemable preference shares of £1 each (the ‘sterling preference
shares’ and, together with the US preference shares, the ‘preference shares’) are as follows:
1) Currency
Holders of preference shares are entitled to receive a preferential dividend, a distribution on a winding up and a payment on redemption. Holders of
US preference shares receive such payments in US dollars. Holders of sterling preference shares receive such payments in sterling.
2) Changeover
A holder of US preference shares may serve notice on the Company requiring that some or all of his US preference shares be changed to sterling
preference shares.
3) Income
a) Each holder has a right to receive a fixed cumulative preferential dividend at the rate of US$1.35 per annum for every £1 of nominal value for the
US preference shares and at the rate of 89.2p per annum for every £1 of nominal value for the sterling preference shares. Dividends on the US and
sterling preference shares are payable half-yearly in arrears in equal amounts, on 26th January and 26th July.
b) The fixed cumulative preferential dividends payable in respect of the US preference shares and sterling preference shares are paid in priority to any
dividend payable to the holders of ordinary shares and in priority to or pari passu with the holders of any other class of preference shares in the
capital of the Company.
c) If a holder of US preference shares has elected to changeover his US preference shares to sterling preference shares then the fixed cumulative
preferential dividend and any arrears payable after the changeover date will be paid at the sterling rate set out above.
4) Conversion
a) Each holder of US preference shares and sterling preference shares is entitled to convert all or any of his fully paid preference shares into fully paid
ordinary shares at the rate of 10.3432p in nominal amount of ordinary share capital for every £1 in nominal amount of preference share capital so
converted (the ‘conversion rate’).
b) The preference shares may be converted on any date at the option of the holder on and from the date of issue up to and including 22nd April 2016.
c) If at any time 75 per cent or more of all the preference shares have been converted into ordinary shares (but assuming, for this purpose only, that
any preference shares which have been converted into ordinary shares pursuant to the special conversion right referred to above had never been
issued or converted), the Company may give written notice to the remaining holders of US preference shares and sterling preference shares to
convert the remaining US preference shares and sterling preference shares into ordinary shares.
d) The conversion rate may be subject to adjustment if, inter alia, the Company makes an issue of ordinary shares by way of capitalisation of profits
or reserves, a rights issue or another offer to ordinary shareholders or if there is a change of control in the Company following a take-over offer or if a
capital distribution is made.
58 Premier Farnell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Notes to the Accounts continued
Note 20 continued
5) Redemption
The Company shall (subject to any statutory restrictions) on 29th April 2016 redeem all the US preference shares in issue at US$25 for every £1 of
nominal value and all the sterling preference shares in issue at £16.518 for every £1 of nominal value.
6) Voting
Each preference share entitles the holder to receive notice of but not to attend or vote at general meetings of the Company save in limited
circumstances. Subject to being entitled to vote on any resolution, each holder of preference shares has one vote on a show of hands and on a poll
every such holder has one vote for every ordinary share to which he would be entitled on conversion of his preference shares.
7) Winding up
Subject to the rights attached to any shares issued on any special terms and conditions, on a return of capital on a winding-up of the Company the
assets available for distribution will be applied, first, in paying to each holder of a preference share any arrears and accruals of the preferential
dividend; second, in repaying US$25 for every £1 of nominal value for the US preference shares and £16.518 for every £1 of nominal value for the
sterling preference shares; third, in repaying the capital paid up on each ordinary share; and fourth, in distributing the remainder rateably among the
members of the Company according to the amounts paid up on their respective holdings of shares in the Company, each preference share being
treated for this purpose as if converted at the conversion rate applicable into fully paid ordinary shares immediately prior to the commencement of
the winding-up.

The Premier Farnell Executive Trust acquires ordinary shares in the open market in order to meet anticipated obligations under the Premier Farnell
Performance Share Plan. The costs of administering the plan are charged to the profit and loss account of the Company. The Trustees have waived
the right to receive dividends in respect of the ordinary shares held by the Trust. At 30th January 2005 and 1st February 2004, the Trust held
234,000 ordinary shares and 35,000 ADRs (representing 70,000 ordinary shares) with a total nominal value of £15,200. The market value of these
shares at 30th January 2005 was £530,000 (1st February 2004: £806,000). After the year end and as a result of the closure of the Company’ s ADR
programmes (note 30), the Trustees surrendered the ADRs held in the Trust in return for the underlying ordinary shares, giving the Trust a total
holding of 304,000 ordinary shares.

Prior year adjustment
UITF 38, Accounting for ESOP Trusts, has been adopted with effect from 2nd February 2004. UITF 38 requires that investments in own shares
made in order to meet anticipated obligations under performance share plans be accounted for as a deduction from shareholders’ funds. Prior to
2nd February 2004, the Group’ s accounting policy was to classify such investments as fixed assets and to amortise the cost over the performance
period of the plan to which they relate.
The adoption of UITF 38 has been accounted for by way of a prior year adjustment. The net impact on shareholders’ funds at 2nd February 2004
was nil, reflecting the reversal of the cumulative amortisation charge at that date of £1.1 million and the re-presentation of the cost of the ESOP
shares of £1.1 million as a deduction from shareholders’ funds. The reversal of the cumulative amortisation charge is disclosed on the face of the
statement of total recognised gains and losses. The re-presentation of the ESOP shares as a deduction from shareholders’ funds is not a
recognised gain or loss.
The prior year adjustment is analysed below.

28 Pension commitments and other post-retirement obligations
1) Pensions
The Group operates pension plans throughout the world covering the majority of its employees. These plans are devised in accordance with local
conditions and practices in the countries concerned and include defined contribution and defined benefit schemes. The assets of the plans are
generally held in separately administered trusts. The contributions to the plans are assessed in accordance with independent actuarial advice
principally using the projected unit method of valuation.
The net credit for the year relating to all of the Group’ s pension plans amounted to £1.6 million (2004: £2.9 million).
The Group’ s two principal plans operate in the UK and the US. Further disclosures of these plans are set out below:

T otal pension cost/(credit) 0.7 (5.0)
Level of funding, being the actuarial value of assets expressed as a percentage
of the accrued service liabilities 94% 262%
The principal assumptions used in the actuarial valuation of the UK Plan were a weighted average projected investment return of 6.4% per annum,
salary inflation of 4.3% per annum and pension increases of 2.8% per annum. For the US Plan, the principal actuarial assumptions were a weighted
average projected investment return of 8.5% per annum and salary inflation of 5.0% per annum.
Variations from regular cost are spread over the remaining service lives of current employees in the plans.
The final salary section of the UK Plan was closed to new entrants in 1998 as a result of which, under the projected unit method, the current service
cost of the scheme will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement. Members at that date now receive benefits funded through a
combination of the US Plan and the UK Plan, including contributions to the money purchase section within the UK Plan. Employees joining the UK
Plan since 1st January 1999 are entitled to money purchase benefits only.
An asset of £81.9 million (2004: £79.6 million) is included in debtors due after more than one year, representing the excess of the actuarial value of
the assets over the accrued service liabilities of the US Plan.

The UK defined benefit pension plan includes certain employees of Premier Farnell plc. However , the contributions by Premier Farnell plc are
accounted for as a defined contribution scheme, as the Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the plan.
2) Post-retirement medical benefits
In the US, the Group provides unfunded post-retirement medical benefits to certain US employees. The method of accounting for these obligations
is similar to that used to account for pension obligations. The principal assumptions used in the most recent actuarial valuation undertaken at
30th January 2005 were a discount rate of 6.25% per annum and healthcare costs increasing by 9.0% per annum in the short term, reducing to an
increase of approximately 5.0% per annum in the longer term. At 30th January 2005, the provision for post-retirement medical benefits based on
this valuation was £5.5 million (2004: £4.7 million).
Disclosures in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 17, Retirement Benefits
The following information is provided for disclosure purposes only in accordance with FRS 17.
The financial assumptions at 30th January 2005 used to calculate liabilities for post-retirement medical benefits under FRS 17, were as follows:
Discount rate 6.25% (2004: 7.0%)
Medical inflation 9.0% decreasing by 0.5% each year to 5.0% over eight years (2004: 9.0% decreasing by 0.5% each year to 5.0%
over eight years)

Had the provision for post-retirement medical benefits been calculated in accordance with FRS 17, reported net assets and the profit and loss
reserve, as at 30th January 2005, would not have been affected (2004: reduction of £0.1 million).
29 Related party transactions
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under FRS 8, Related Party Transactions, from disclosing transactions between the Company
and other Group undertakings as all such transactions have been eliminated fully on consolidation in these financial statements.
30 Post balance sheet events
At an Extraordinary General Meeting held on 9th February 2005, the Company amended its Articles of Association to give the Company’ s Directors
the ability to limit the number of US residents holding ordinary or preference shares in the Company . In particular, the Directors are now able to
require US shareholders, whether holding directly or through nominees, to sell their ordinary shares or preference shares in order to be satisfied that
the number of US shareholders is less than 300 in respect of each of the ordinary shares and preference shares.
On 9th December 2004, the Company applied to de-list its ordinary shares and preference shares from the New York Stock Exchange and the
de-listing took effect by SEC order on 16th February 2005. Notice of termination of the American depositary receipt, or ADR, programmes in
respect of Premier Farnell plc’ s ordinary shares and preference shares was given to American depositary share, or ADS, holders on 9th December
2004. T ermination of the ADR programmes has taken effect and on 18th April 2005 the Bank of New York (as depositary for the ADR programmes)
will commence selling the shares underlying any ADSs not surrendered by the relevant ADS holders and distribute the net proceeds of sale for the
relevant ADS holders.

Independent Auditors’ report to the members of
Premier Farnell plc
We have audited the financial statements which comprise the
consolidated profit and loss account, the statement of total recognised
gains and losses, the balance sheets, the consolidated statement of cash
flows, related notes and the accounting policies set out in the statement
of accounting policies. We have also audited the disclosures required by
Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 contained in the
Remuneration Report (‘the auditable part’).
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the
financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law
and accounting standards are set out in the statement of Directors’
Responsibilities on page 34. The Directors are also responsible for
preparing the Remuneration Report.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the auditable
part of the Remuneration Report in accordance with the relevant legal
and regulatory requirements and United Kingdom Auditing Standards
issued by the Auditing Practices Board. This report, including the opinion,
has been prepared for and only for the Company’ s members as a body in
accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no
other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this
report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly
agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a
true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the auditable
part of the Remuneration Report have been properly prepared in
accordance with the United Kingdom Companies Act 1985. We also
report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ report is not consistent with
the financial statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting
records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we
require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’
remuneration and transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report and
consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any
apparent mis-statements or material inconsistencies with the financial
statements. The other information comprises only the Chairman’ s
Statement, the Chief Executive’ s Review, the Operating Review, the
Finance Director’ s Report, the Directors’ Report, the unaudited part of the
Remuneration Report, the Corporate Governance Statement and the
Social Responsibility Report.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects the
Company’ s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 FRC
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority , and we report if it does not. We are not
required to consider whether the Board’ s statements on internal control
cover all risks and controls, or to form an opinion on the effectiveness of
the Company’ s or Group’ s corporate governance procedures or its risk
and control procedures.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards issued
by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test
basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements and the auditable part of the Remuneration Report. It also
includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements
made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and
of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’ s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information
and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us
with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial
statements and the auditable part of the Remuneration Report are free
from material mis-statement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity
or error . In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of
the presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
– the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of
the Company and the Group at 30th January 2005 and of the profit and
cash flows of the Group for the year then ended
– the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985
– those parts of the Remuneration Report required by Part 3 of Schedule
7A to the Companies Act 1985 have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Additional information for US investors
The Company applied to de-list its ordinary shares and preference shares
from the New Y ork Stock Exchange on 9th December 2004, and the
de-listing took effect by SEC order on 16th February 2005. Notice of
termination of the American depositary receipt, or ADR, programmes in
respect of Premier Farnell plc’ s ordinary shares and preference shares
was given to American depositary share, or ADS, holders on
9th December 2004. T ermination of the ADR programmes has taken
effect, and, on or about 18th April 2005, the Bank of New Y ork (as
depositary for the ADR programmes) sold the shares underlying any
ADSs not surrendered by the relevant ADS holders and is in the course of
distributing the net proceeds of sale to the relevant ADS holders.
The Company intends, when it is permitted by applicable SEC regulation
to do so, to terminate the registration of the ordinary shares and
preference shares with the SEC. The Company will not be able to file
for de-registration from the SEC unless and until the number of
US shareholders, whether holding directly or through nominees, falls
below 300 with respect to each of the ordinary shares and the preference
shares as separate classes. Furthermore, the number of US shareholders
must remain below the 300 limit with respect to each of the ordinary
shares and the preference shares after de-registration, to avoid
re-commencement of SEC reporting requirements. De-registration will
occur 90 days after filing a certification with the SEC that the number of
US shareholders is below 300 with respect to each of the ordinary shares
and the preference shares.
At its Extraordinary General Meeting held on 9th February 2005, the
Company amended its Articles of Association to give the Company’ s
Directors the ability to limit the number of US residents holding ordinary or
preference shares in the Company . In particular , the Directors are able to
require US shareholders, whether holding directly or through nominees,
to sell their ordinary shares or preference shares in order to be satisfied
that the number of US shareholders is less than 300 in respect of each of
the ordinary shares and preference shares.
The Company will continue to file with and submit to the SEC an annual
report on Form 20-F and certain other reports on Form 6-K, unless and
until its ordinary shares and preference shares are each de-registered.
After such de-registration and for so long as the Company remains
de-registered, the Company will be exempt from these reporting
requirements and will no longer file any reports with the SEC.

statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future. Actual expenditures
made and actions taken as well as expected results may differ materially from the Group’ s expectations contained in the forward-looking statements
as a result of various factors, many of which are beyond the control of the Group. These factors include, but are not limited to, the effect of legislative or
regulatory enactments, the implementation of cost saving initiatives to offset current market conditions, integration of new personnel, employee
training programs and new information systems, continued use and acceptance of eCommerce programs and systems and the impact on other
distribution systems, the ability to expand into new markets and territories, the implementation and customer acceptance of new sales and marketing
initiatives, changes in demand for electronic, electrical, electro-magnetic and industrial products, rapid changes in distribution of our products and
customer expectations, product availability , the ability to introduce and customers’ acceptance of new services, products and product lines, the
impact of competitive pricing, fluctuations in foreign currencies, changes in interest rates and the impact of changes in worldwide and national
economies. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events or otherwise, after the date of this Annual Report to conform them to actual results.

Filtronic plc Annual Report 2009 1 Chairman’s Statement
The year ended 31 May 2009 produced revenue from continuing operations of £28.8m and operating proﬁt before
exceptional items of £2.1m compared with the prior year revenue of £40.1m and £2.5m operating proﬁt. The group proﬁt
for the period was £11.7m compared with a £14.6m loss in the prior year. Cash at the year end was £16.2m compared
with £31.5m at 31 May 2008. A full breakdown of the year is shown in the ﬁnancial statements, notes and narrative which
follow.
The UK Defence business was sold to Teledyne on 15 August 2008 for proceeds of £12.2m (net of costs). The group also
received £1.9m before tax from the onward sale of its Australian wireless infrastructure business, originally disposed of
in 2005.
A second special dividend of 40p (£29.7m) was paid to shareholders on 24 November 2008. The Board has decided to
recommend a ﬁnal dividend of 1.00p payable on 30 November 2009, to shareholders on the register at 30 October 2009
subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Overhead and other cost reductions were implemented as a response to the lower levels of customer demand
experienced in the second half of the year. These prompt actions enabled the business to trade above breakeven on a
broadly cash neutral basis in the second half of the year. Expenditure on new product development and core technology
was maintained.
The underlying market drivers for Point to Point backhaul market growth remain intact, although the immediate outlook
is subdued. The group continues to invest in R&D in order to position the company with competitive products to
respond to market demand.
I should like to thank Stephen Mole, Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, who will be leaving the group at the end of September. The
process of appointing a successor is well advanced. As previously announced, I will be stepping down as Chairman at
the Annual General Meeting on 18 September 2009 to be succeeded by Howard Ford who joined the Board in
December 2008 and has considerable experience in the telecommunications equipment and services market.
Finally, I should like to thank all staff in the business for their contribution over the past year.

– Chief Executive Officer’s
Operating Review
Summary
The period saw further changes for the group with the disposal of the UK Defence business to Teledyne. The remaining
Point to Point business experienced a signiﬁcant reduction in demand in the second half of the year which was mitigated
by prompt cost reduction initiatives. The group structure and central costs have been streamlined with the consolidation
of the ﬁnance function alongside the Newton Aycliffe operations.
Continuing operations
Filtronic now comprises solely the Point to Point business which designs and manufactures customised microwave
electronic sub assembly components that are integrated by OEM’s into Point to Point (PTP) radios. These radios provide
the backhaul links for telecom networks, particularly the mobile base station market. Filtronic is the leading merchant
supplier of transceivers and diplex ﬁlters to this market.
The business achieved a strong revenue performance in the ﬁrst half of the year (£18.3m) but there was a signiﬁcant
weakening of demand in the second half (revenue £10.5m) due to general destocking and one customer who
experienced a signiﬁcant downturn in sales in Asia. This necessitated a prompt initiation of overhead and other cost
reduction measures which enabled trading in the second half to be maintained just above breakeven and cash neutrality.
Overall revenue for the year was £28.8m, down from £40.1m in the previous year with an operating proﬁt before
exceptional items of £2.1m compared with £2.5m in 2008. Operating proﬁt before exceptional items in the second half
was £0.3m compared with £1.8m in the ﬁrst half year. Operating margins moved up from 6% to 7% in the year.
Network expansion in developing regions and capacity upgrades in developed regions continue to drive demand for
PTP products. Filtronic is well placed to exploit these markets opportunities as well as extending into adjacent market
sectors.
The ﬁrst order has been received from SELEX Airborne Systems Limited (operating on the markets as SELEX Galileo)
under the long-term strategic supply agreement. This order initiates the development of Filtronic’s volume capability
to manufacture SELEX’s microwave modules for their current generation of active electronically scanned array airborne
radars.
Discontinued operations
UK Defence
Sale of this business to Teledyne was completed in August 2008 producing net proceeds after costs of £12.2m and a gain
on disposal of £8.4m.
Wireless Infrastructure
A gain of £1.3m after taxation was made on the receipt relating to the sale of the Wireless Infrastructure business in
Australia.
Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure was £0.9m, of which £0.8m related to continuing operations.
Employees
At 31 May 2009, the group employed 152 people (2008 392 people of which 227 were in continuing operations).

Results
Continuing operations generated revenue of £28.8m (2008 £40.1m), resulting in an operating proﬁt before exceptional
items of £2.1m (2008 £2.5m). The group proﬁt for the period was £11.7m (2008 £14.6m loss) reﬂecting the gains on
disposal of the UK Defence business and the receipt relating to the Australian wireless infrastructure disposal. The
operating results are discussed in the Chief Executive’s Operating Review, along with a review of the business.
Disposal of UK Defence business
On 15 August 2008, the sale of the UK Defence business to Teledyne was completed. The disposal generated a gain
of £8.4m.
Australian Wireless Infrastructure disposal
A sum of £1.9m before tax was received in July 2008 relating to the sale of the Wireless Infrastructure business in Australia
to its management in 2005. Provision for the tax due on this amount of £0.6m has been made in the balance sheet.
Net finance income
The group ended the year with net cash of £16.2m (2008 £31.5m) and generated net ﬁnance income of £1.1m
(2008 £7.4m), reﬂecting the interest received on cash deposits.
Taxation
No current tax is due on continuing operations, reﬂecting available losses. No deferred tax asset was recognised at
31 May 2009 due to uncertainty in future recoverability. Full provision for the £0.6m tax due on the Australian Wireless
Infrastructure receipt was made in the year ended 31 May 2009. It is expected that this amount will be paid in the
six months ending 30 November 2009.
Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure was £0.9m, of which £0.8m related to continuing operations in the Point to Point business
(2008 £1.9m total, £1.2m continuing operations).
Research and development costs
Research and development costs of £2.3m, which represented 7.3% of total revenue were expensed. No research and
development costs were capitalised in the balance sheet. Research and development costs relating to continuing
operations were £1.8m (6.4% of revenue).
Working capital
At 31 May 2009 net working capital was £5.3m (2008 £6.5m). Net working capital comprised inventories of £4.5m
(2008 £6.2m), receivables of £4.8m (2008 £13.0m) and payables of £4.0m (2008 £12.7m).
Cash flow
Cash inﬂow from operating activities was £0.7m (2008 outﬂow £16.1m), cash inﬂow from investing activities was £13.7m
(2008 £17.9m) and net cash outﬂow from ﬁnancing activities was £29.7m (2008 £89.2m outﬂow). The closing cash balance
as at 31 May 2009 was £16.2m (2008 £31.5m).

The wind up of the deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme is nearing completion with the issue of annuity policies to individual
members by Paternoster.
Dividend
On 24 November 2008 a second special dividend of 40p per share was paid to shareholders.
Based on the full year results for 2009 a ﬁnal dividend of 1.00p per share has been recommended by the Board and,

– Directors’
Assessment of Risk
Introduction
Filtronic supplies microwave products for the wireless telecommunications market. The business is in a fast-changing
sector with a small number of sophisticated customers, demanding performance standards and international
competition; all of which pose risks to the business.
Market
We supply a niche range of products to a small number of large OEM customers. With the rapid evolution of product
technology and other corporate decisions the size of our addressable market may be affected. We may also fail to
forecast market movements correctly so missing opportunities or wrongly predicting product longevity.
Manufacturing
In most of the products, production is demand led and customers may vary their requirements from the business at short
notice, which also impacts inventory management. Customers in these businesses expect consistent high quality product
and reducing prices, hence we depend on control of our operating environment, including management of security of
supply in our supply chain, and the provision of correctly designed technological solutions including the achievement
of target cost reduction plans. Non performance in these areas risks a diminished market position.
All our products are provided to customers after detailed qualiﬁcation testing. However, this may not test all aspects of
the product’s design and manufacturing process or may not ensure that the product is viewed as ﬁt for purpose in its
intended use. Identiﬁcation of these types of problem after release of product to customers creates the risk of being
required to rectify such product defects. Historically such work has not had a substantial impact on the ﬁnancial
performance of the business, although a major defect, leading to a ﬁeld recall could do so in future.
We operate two leased manufacturing locations, the larger of which is located within the facility of our major
semiconductor supplier.
Technology
Our product competitiveness is strongly inﬂuenced by technology choices at product concept stage and throughout
execution of design to product launch. For products in the production cycle, technology insertion is often required as a
means of achieving price reductions, which underpin sales. The market is time sensitive and opportunities may be lost if
the technology we develop is not appropriate or ready for exploitation to match market demand, so having an adverse
effect on business performance.
Our ability to remain competitive in terms of technology and product design is also underpinned by retaining key staff,
the loss of whom could seriously impact the rate of introduction of new products and technologies.
Financial management
A large proportion of sales is denominated in euros with the cost base substantially in sterling, which may therefore
create margin risks that may not be recoverable through price changes. This risk is mitigated to some extent by
purchasing some input materials in euros.
We have sold four divisions of the group in the past four years. We have provided warranties in support of these
transactions, covering areas including product liability for an initial period and usually environment risks on freehold
property and tax risks for longer speciﬁed periods. We have received claims on the sale of the Wireless Infrastructure
and Defence Electronics business, which have been settled, and may receive claims in future related to these current and
future commitments.

Supplier payment policy
It is the group’s policy to abide by the terms of payment agreed with suppliers in respect of the goods and services
properly invoiced to the group. At 31 May 2009 trade payables of £2.7m represented 42 days’ purchases, calculated in

Disclosure of information to the auditors
The directors who held office at the date of approval of this directors’ report confirm that, so far as they are each aware,
there is no relevant audit information of which the company’s auditors are unaware; and each director has taken all the
steps that he ought to have taken as a director to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish
that the company’s auditors are aware of that information.
Auditors
A resolution to re-appoint KPMG Audit Plc as auditors will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
Remuneration report
Pursuant to the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the Board proposes the remuneration report which is
set out on pages 17 to 22, for approval (resolution 2 in the notice of Annual General Meeting). No entitlement of a
director to remuneration is conditional on the resolution being passed but the result of the vote will be taken into
account in considering the development and operation of the company’s remuneration policy.
Authority to allot shares
The Companies Act 1985 requires that the authority of the directors to allot relevant securities shall be subject to the
approval of shareholders in general meeting or to an authority set out in the company’s Articles of Association.
Accordingly, an ordinary resolution (resolution 8 set out in the notice of Annual General Meeting) will be proposed at
the Annual General Meeting to renew the authority granted at the Annual General Meeting held on 19 September 2008
and thereby authorise the directors to allot unissued ordinary shares of the company up to a total nominal value of
£2,477,436 (representing one third of the nominal value of the company’s issued share capital).
The Companies Act 1985 also requires that any equity shares issued wholly for cash must be offered to existing
shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings. This requirement was disapplied to a limited extent by a resolution
passed at the Annual General Meeting held on 19 September 2008 and a special resolution (resolution 10 set out in the
notice of Annual General Meeting) will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting to renew the directors’ authority to
allot equity shares for cash other than on a pro rata basis. This will be limited to equity shares having a nominal value of
up to £371,165 (representing 5% of the issued share capital of the company). This authority will terminate no later than
fifteen months after the passing of the special resolution.

Filtronic plc Annual Report 2009 11 Corporate Governance
Statement
The Combined Code on Corporate Governance
The Board operates high standards of corporate governance. The Board has prepared this report with reference to the
Combined Code on Corporate Governance issued by the Financial Reporting Council as revised in June 2008. For
the year ended 31 May 2009 the directors conﬁrm that the company has been in compliance with the provisions of the
Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
The company has three non-executive directors excluding the Chairman, two of whom, Reginald Gott and Howard Ford,
meet all of the speciﬁc criteria for independence set out in the Combined Code. The other non-executive director,
Graham Meek, does not meet all of the requirements for independence set out in the Code since he has been a director
for more than nine years but is considered to be independent and to provide valuable advice to the company as well as
continuity in the context of the recent corporate activity and Board changes.
Internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining the company’s system of internal control. Internal
control systems are designed to be relevant to the company and the risks to which it is exposed and, by their nature, can
provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. The key procedures established
by the directors with a view to providing effective internal control are as follows:
(a) Control environment and monitoring systems
The Board usually meets each month and has adopted a schedule of matters which are required to be brought to it
for decision, thus ensuring that it maintains full and effective control over appropriate strategic, ﬁnancial, operational
and compliance issues. The Board has put in place an organisational structure with clearly deﬁned lines of
responsibility and delegation of authority. Additionally, the Board has established an Executive Management
Committee that is responsible for operational matters within the company.
The division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer has been set out in writing
and agreed by the Board.
The audit committee, which comprises all of the non-executive directors, reviews the effectiveness of the system of
internal control. The external auditors are engaged to express an opinion on the company’s annual ﬁnancial
statements. They test the system of internal ﬁnancial control and the information contained within the annual report
and ﬁnancial statements to the extent necessary for expressing their opinion.
(b) Major information systems
The directors have delegated to executive management implementation of the system of internal control
throughout the company. This includes ﬁnancial controls that enable the Board to meet its responsibilities for the
integrity and accuracy of the company’s accounting records.
The Board approves, in aggregate, budgets and other performance targets, the components of which form the
ﬁnancial objectives for individual operating units. Performance against these targets is reported monthly. Financial
forecasts are updated and reviewed monthly and include cash ﬂow forecasts.
12 Filtronic plc Annual Report 2009 Corporate Governance
Statement
(c) Main control procedures
In addition to matters reserved for Board decisions, the company has established a system whereby authority to take
decisions is distributed throughout the company. This distribution of authority deﬁnes procedures for authorisation
and approval and sets appropriate levels of responsibility.
An accounting policies and procedures manual sets out the company’s declared statement of policy in all ﬁnancial
areas and establishes the control procedures, including segregation of duties, to ensure that these policies are
implemented.
(d) Identiﬁcation and evaluation of business risks
The company has clear principles and procedures that are appropriate to an electronics business of its size. These
principles are designed to provide an environment of central leadership but with devolved operating responsibility
as the framework for the exercise of accountability and control by the Board, its committees and executive
management. The Board directs activities in and allocates resources to the key areas of business development,
product strategy, research and development, manufacture and ﬁnancial practice.
Through these ongoing procedures, the Board is able to identify, evaluate and manage the signiﬁcant risks that the
group faces from time to time.
The Board has reviewed its approach to the identiﬁcation and evaluation of business risks and has put in place a
programme to review the main areas of risk identiﬁed for the company on an annual basis at the Board.
The Board conﬁrms that it has carried out a review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control as it operated
during the year. The Board undertakes, on an ongoing basis, a review of all aspects of the company’s internal control
procedures. The review is undertaken by the Board through the receipt and consideration of regular monthly and
other reports prepared by management on operational, strategic, organisational and ﬁnancial issues. All areas of
operations are audited periodically either by external agencies or through peer review to ensure compliance with
group policies.
Constitution of the Board
The Board comprises the Chairman, two executive and three independent, non-executive directors. Short biographies
of all of the directors are set out on page 7. The Board considers that its constitution brings both independence and an
appropriate balance of experience in judging matters of strategy, performance, resources, investor relations, internal
control and corporate governance. Graham Meek is the senior non-executive director. Each of the directors is proposed

Filtronic plc Annual Report 2009 13 Corporate Governance
Statement
Graham Meek joined the company in 1999 and the Board has carefully considered his independence. He contributes
signiﬁcantly through his ﬁnancial expertise and considerable knowledge of the company. He has provided continuity
as well as contributing to the overall balance of the Board. The Board has decided that Graham Meek is an independent
non-executive director.
A formal performance review of the Board, its committees and the directors was undertaken during the year. This has
been implemented in the year by way of a written questionnaire completed by all Board members, and the resulting
report has been reviewed by the Board. The performance of individual directors was reviewed by the Chairman. The
senior non-executive director led an evaluation of the performance of the Chairman. Each director had the opportunity
to review the outcome of the evaluation of the Board and its committees. This year the review highlighted the
importance for all directors to refresh their knowledge and skills, particularly in relation to the corporate governance
framework and succession plans.
Board committees
The Board has a nominations committee, a remuneration committee and an audit committee. The remuneration and
audit committees comprise all of the independent non-executive directors. Each of these committees operates under
terms of reference which have been established by the Board.
The nominations committee
The nominations committee is chaired by John Poulter, and the other members are the independent non-executive
directors: Graham Meek, Reginald Gott and Howard Ford. The nominations committee’s duties are conﬁned to the
nomination of appointments, re-appointments and termination of employment or engagement of directors and the
company secretary.
The nominations committee met three times during the year to consider Board composition and balance of skills.
The remuneration committee
The remuneration committee is chaired by Reginald Gott. The other members are the other independent non-executive
directors: Graham Meek and Howard Ford. The remuneration committee’s responsibilities include ensuring that the
remuneration and service contract terms of the executive directors and senior management are appropriate. The
committee approves the grant of all share options and bonus arrangements.

auditors in the context of the ﬁnancial statements
 the effectiveness of internal controls and the group’s internal controls manual
 authorisation of the amount and purposes of non-audit fees

 the external auditors’ year end report and the ﬁndings of their work and conﬁrmation that all signiﬁcant matters had
been satisfactorily treated
 a full and careful consideration of the performance of the external auditors, which involved a competitive tendering
process, as a result of which the committee resolved to recommend the re-appointment of KPMG Audit Plc as
auditors to the company

recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience.

Relations with investors
Communications with investors are given high priority. There is regular dialogue with institutional investors including
presentations after the company’s preliminary announcement of the year-end results and at the half year, which are
attended by non-executive directors. Analyst reports and feedback from shareholders are discussed at Board meetings.
The Board uses the Annual General Meeting to communicate with private and institutional investors and welcomes their
participation. The Chairman aims to ensure that the chairmen of the audit and remuneration committees are available
at the Annual General Meeting to answer questions. Information is also available to all investors by way of the company’s

Going concern
The group’s business, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set
out in the Business Review on pages 3 to 6. The ﬁnancial position of the group, its cash ﬂows, and its liquidity position
are described in the Financial Review on pages 4 and 5. Note 52 to the ﬁnancial statements describes and quantiﬁes
exposures to liquidity, credit, interest rate and foreign currency risk and how they are managed. Also in note 52 capital
management is described.
At 31 May 2009 the group had a cash balance of £16.2m.
The directors have reviewed the budgeted cash ﬂow and other relevant information and have a reasonable expectation
that the group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason,
the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the ﬁnancial statements.

Composition of the remuneration committee

directors:
Reginald Gott (Chairman)
Graham Meek
Howard Ford (appointed 5 December 2008)
Professor Stephen Burbank (retired 19 September 2008)
Ian Hardington (retired 19 September 2008)
The committee receives advice in its deliberations concerning the remuneration of the executive directors from the
Chairman, John Poulter and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, Hemant Mardia. The committee’s recommendations have been
accepted by the Board without amendment.
Compliance
The company has complied with the provisions in the Code of Best Practice relating to Directors’ Remuneration. In
preparing this report, the provisions in Schedule B to the Combined Code have been followed.
Policy on remuneration of executive directors and senior executives
(a) Total level of remuneration
The committee aims to ensure that remuneration packages offered are competitive and designed to attract, retain
and motivate executive directors and senior executives.
(b) The main components
The company’s policy is to structure remuneration packages to align the interests of employees with those of
shareholders.
The main components of remuneration are:
(i) Salary
Salary for each executive is determined by the remuneration committee taking into account the performance and
responsibilities of the individual. Electronic and electrical engineering is an international industry within which there
is a clear market in executive talent. The overriding factor in determining executive remuneration is market forces.
Salaries are normally reviewed on 1 July each year.
(ii) Executive directors bonuses
The executive directors were participants in an annual bonus scheme during the year under which a maximum of
30% of salary was payable in the case of Hemant Mardia, subject to proﬁt and cash targets and personal targets, and
a maximum of 30% of salary was payable in the case of Stephen Mole, subject to proﬁt and cash targets and personal
targets, the achievements of which have been assessed by the remuneration committee.
Under the scheme, the executive directors were not awarded any annual bonuses for the year ended 31 May 2009
as the proﬁt and cash targets were not met.
In the previous year Hemant Mardia was awarded a bonus of £52,000, being 30% of salary and Charles Hindson was
awarded a bonus of £128,000 being 50% of salary.
Filtronic plc Annual Report 2009 17 Remuneration Report
for the year ended 31 May 2009
No non-recurring bonus arrangements were put in place in the year ended 31 May 2009. However the non-recurring
bonus put in place in July 2007 fell for assessment at 31 May 2009. The remuneration committee considered that
the relevant performance targets had been met in full. The performance targets for Hemant Mardia included the
creation of one new product line which generated business with meaningful revenue and proﬁt in the two years
ended 31 May 2009. The performance targets for Stephen Mole included the completion of the disposal of the
Defence Electronics business and the wind-up of the deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme. The performance targets for
Charles Hindson included the completion of the disposal of the Defence Electronics business.
Hemant Mardia was awarded a non-recurring bonus of £53,000 (2008 £37,000), being 30% (2008 30%) of his salary.
Stephen Mole was awarded a non-recurring bonus of £36,000 being 30% of his salary.
Charles Hindson was awarded a non-recurring bonus of £77,000 (2008 £180,000), being 30% (2008 70%) of his salary.
(iii) Defence Electronics bonus arrangements
Special bonus arrangements were put in place for management in the Defence Electronics business with the aim
of retaining key staff while options for the sale of this business were being explored. Those bonuses paid out a
maximum of 50% of salary for general managers and 25% for senior managers on completion of the sale of this
business in August 2008.
(iv) Bonus scheme
The remuneration committee has agreed an approach for management incentives for the year ending 31 May 2010
of an annual bonus for performance in the year, based on proﬁt and cash targets. The level of up to 30% of annual
salary for executive directors and up to 15% of annual salary for senior managers has been agreed for each of these
bonuses. The annual bonus will be assessed against the achievement of proﬁt and cash targets in the year ended
31 May 2010.
(v) Performance share plan
A performance share plan was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in September 2008.
However no awards were made under the plan during the year ended 31 May 2009 as the company was in a
prohibited period at all relevant times. It is anticipated that the remuneration committee will make awards under the
plan after 27 July 2009 to Hemant Mardia and the new Chief Financial Ofﬁcer up to a maximum of 60% and 40% of
salary respectively.
The vesting of the awards is subject to performance targets based on growth in earnings per share (EPS) over a three
year period. If growth in EPS exceeds growth in the Retail Price Index (RPI) by 3% per year (on a compound basis)
then 25% of the awarded shares will vest. If growth in EPS exceeds growth in RPI by 10% per year (on a compound
basis) then 100% of the awarded shares will vest. If growth in EPS falls between these two targets, then the awarded
shares will vest on a sliding scale between 25% and 100% of the awarded shares.
(vi) Sharesave plan
A sharesave plan was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in September 2008. All employees
including executive directors are eligible. The ﬁrst offer under the sharesave plan was made in February 2009, which
resulted in 45% of employees joining the scheme.
(c) Company policy on contracts of service
Hemant Mardia and Stephen Mole, the executive directors, both have rolling service contracts. Under Hemant
Mardia’s service contract the notice period for termination by either party is twelve months. Under Stephen Mole’s
service contract the notice period for termination by either party is six months. There are no speciﬁc compensation
commitments for early termination in either service contract.
Charles Hindson had a service contract, the notice period for termination by the company was twelve months. On
termination of his employment as Chief Executive and director on 19 September 2008 he was paid £262,000 salary
in lieu of notice.
18 Filtronic plc Annual Report 2009 Remuneration Report
for the year ended 31 May 2009
(d) Company pensions policy
The company’s policy is to offer executives membership of the Filtronic plc Stakeholder Pension Plan on the same
basis as all other employees of the company. The plan is a deﬁned contribution scheme. The maximum contribution
the company makes to the plan is 8% of pensionable salary, if the member makes a contribution of 6% of
pensionable salary. Members of the plan are also entitled to death in service beneﬁt of four times pensionable salary
and long term disability insurance.
In the case of Stephen Mole, under the terms of his service contract, instead of joining the Filtronic plc Stakeholder
Pension Plan, the company pays 10.5% of his pensionable salary into a personal pension plan of his choice.
(e) Company policy on external appointments
The remuneration committee reviews any request by an executive director with regard to a proposed external
appointment and deals with each request on its individual merits. The overriding requirement is for each executive,
as a term of his contract, to devote substantially the whole of his time, skill and attention to the affairs of the group.
Non-executive directors agreements for services and remuneration
The non-executive directors have rolling agreements for services with the company. These are terminable by the company
or the non-executive director on six months notice for the Chairman and on three months notice for the other
non-executive directors and are reviewed annually by the Board.
The Board determines the remuneration of the non-executive directors. Non-executive directors are not entitled to any
share options, performance shares, bonuses or pension beneﬁts.

broad equity market index over the past ﬁve years. The FTSE All Share is considered to be the most appropriate index
against which to measure performance, as the company has been a constituent of the FTSE All Share throughout the
ﬁve-year period and the index is widely used. TSR is the measure of the returns that a company has provided for its
shareholders, reﬂecting share price movements and assuming reinvestment of dividends.

Responsibilities
Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the annual report and the financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the group and parent company ﬁnancial statements in

Company law requires the directors to prepare group and parent company ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year.
Under that law they are required to prepare the group ﬁnancial statements in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRS) and applicable law and have elected to prepare the
parent company ﬁnancial statements on the same basis.
Under company law the directors must not approve the ﬁnancial statements unless they are satisﬁed that they give a true

a) select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
b) make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
c) state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRS; and
d) prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group and
the parent company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufﬁcient to show and explain the parent
company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of the parent company
and enable them to ensure that its ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have a general
responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent
and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a directors’ report, directors’
remuneration report and corporate governance statement that comply with that law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and ﬁnancial information included on
the company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Filtronic plc Annual Report 2009 33 Notes to the
Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 May 2009
1 Accounting policies
Reporting entity
Filtronic plc is a company registered in England and Wales, domiciled in the United Kingdom, and is listed on the
London Stock Exchange.
Basis of accounting
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as
adopted by the European Union (IFRS).
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for forward foreign
exchange contracts that are accounted for on a fair value basis.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the group.
Basis of consolidation
The ﬁnancial statements consolidate the income statements, balance sheets and cash ﬂow statements of the
company and all of its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the group has the power to govern the ﬁnancial and operating policies.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the group, and are not consolidated
from the date that control ceases. Intra group transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.
Foreign currency translation
The functional currency of each group company is the currency of the primary economic environment in which
the group company operates. The ﬁnancial statements are presented in sterling which is the functional and
presentational currency of the company.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency of each group company
at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into the functional currency at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Foreign exchange gains and losses arising on the settlement of such transactions and translation of monetary assets
and liabilities are recognised in the income statement.
Forward foreign exchange contracts are recognised in the balance sheet at their market value at the balance sheet
date, and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement.
On consolidation, the ﬁnancial statements of subsidiaries with a functional currency other than sterling are translated
into sterling as follows:
– The assets and liabilities in their balance sheets plus any goodwill are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at
the balance sheet date.
– The income statements and cash ﬂow statements are translated at the average rate of exchange for the period,
which approximates the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transactions.
Currency translation movements arising on the translation of the net investments in foreign subsidiaries are
recognised in the translation reserve, which is a separate component of equity.

Financial Statements

1 Accounting policies (continued)
Segment reporting
The business segments are the primary segments and the geographical origin segments are the secondary
segments. Each reportable segment is subject to risks and returns that are different from the other segments.
Revenue
Revenue is recognised for goods and services provided to customers during the period. Revenue excludes any
related value added or sales tax.
Research and development
All research costs are expensed as incurred.
Development costs chargeable to the customer are recognised as an expense in the same period as the associated
customer revenue.
Development costs incurred on projects requiring product qualiﬁcation tests to satisfy customer speciﬁcations
are generally expensed as incurred, reﬂecting the technical risks associated with meeting the resultant product
qualiﬁcation test.
Development costs incurred on projects are capitalised where ﬁrstly the technical feasibility can be tested against
relevant milestones, secondly the probable revenue stream foreseen over the life of the resulting product can
support the development and thirdly sufﬁcient resources are available to complete the development. These
capitalised costs are amortised on a straight line basis over the expected life of the associated product.
Once a new product is qualiﬁed, further development costs are expensed as they arise because they are incurred in
response to continual customer demand to enhance the product functionality and to reduce product selling prices.
Operating leases
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Share-based payments
The group operated share option schemes, under which share options were granted to certain employees. The
granting of the share options was a share-based payment.
The fair value of the share options at the date of grant was calculated using an option pricing model, taking into
account the terms and conditions applicable to the option grant. The fair value of the number of share options
expected to vest was expensed in the income statement on a straight line basis over the expected vesting period.
Each reporting period these vesting expectations were revised as appropriate.
A credit was made to equity, equal to the share-based payment expense in the period.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those signiﬁcant items which are separately disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence to
enable a full understanding of the ﬁnancial results.
Filtronic plc Annual Report 2009 35 Notes to the
Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 May 2009
1 Accounting policies (continued)
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisitions over the fair value of the net identiﬁable assets of the
subsidiary acquired at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill, which is allocated to cash generating units, is tested for impairment annually and when there is an
indication of impairment. If impaired, the goodwill carrying value is written down to its recoverable amount.
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are stated in the company’s ﬁnancial statements at cost less any accumulated impairment
losses.
Investments in subsidiaries are tested for impairment when there is an indication of impairment.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and less any accumulated
impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:
Land Not depreciated
Buildings 50 years
Plant and equipment 3 to 10 years
Property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment when there is an indication of impairment. If impaired, the
carrying values of the assets are written down to their recoverable amounts.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises weighted average cost of
materials and components together with attributable direct labour and overheads. Net realisable value is the
estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion and sale.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are stated net of any provision for doubtful debts.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances and bank deposits with an original maturity of three months
or less.

Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 May 2009
1 Accounting policies (continued)
Defined contribution pension schemes
Deﬁned contribution pension schemes are operated for employees. Contributions are recognised as an expense in
the income statement as incurred.
Defined benefit pension scheme
A deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme was operated for United Kingdom employees. The deﬁned beneﬁt pension
liability was the present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation less the fair value of the pension scheme assets. The
deﬁned beneﬁt obligation was calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit measure. The discount
rate used to calculate the present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation was the yield on AA credit rated corporate
bonds that had maturity dates approximating the terms of the beneﬁt obligations.
Service costs were spread systematically over the working lives of the employees, and were recognised within
operating costs in the income statement. Financing costs were recognised in the periods in which they arose within
ﬁnance costs in the income statement.
Settlement losses were recognised within operating costs in the income statement in the period when settlement
occurred.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions were
recognised immediately in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method. Provision is made for temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the ﬁnancial statements and the amounts for taxation
purposes.
Temporary differences are not provided for the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting
nor taxable proﬁt. No provision is made for differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that
they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying
amount of the assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable proﬁts will be available
against which the asset can be utilised.
Warranty provision
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of
a past event, and it is probable that an outﬂow of economic beneﬁts will be required to settle the obligation. A
warranty provision is recognised when products are sold. The provision is based on historical warranty data. The level
of warranty provision required is reviewed on a product by product basis and adjusted accordingly in light of actual
experience.
Filtronic plc Annual Report 2009 37 Notes to the
Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 May 2009
1 Accounting policies (continued)
Share capital
Ordinary shares issued are classiﬁed as share capital in equity.
Dividends
Interim dividends are recognised in equity in the period they are paid. Final dividends are recognised in equity in
the period they are declared by shareholders.
Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale
Non-current assets and disposal groups classiﬁed as held for sale are recognised at the lower of carrying amount
and fair value less costs to sell. No depreciation is provided on property, plant and equipment once they are
classiﬁed as held for sale.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classiﬁed as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered
through a sale transaction rather than continuing use. The condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly
probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition. The directors must
be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year
from the date of classiﬁcation.
Discontinued operations
A discontinued operation is a component of the group’s activities that represents a separate business operation.
Classiﬁcation as a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or if earlier when the operation meets the criteria
to be classiﬁed as held for sale.
During the year ended 31 May 2009 the Defence Electronics business in the United Kingdom and Australia was sold.
Consequently the result of this business has been reclassiﬁed as discontinued operations for the current and
comparative period.
New IFRS and amendments to IFRS
There are a number of new standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, that are effective for
ﬁnancial statements after this reporting period, which have not yet been adopted by the group.
IAS 1 (Amendment) Presentation of Financial Statements, Presentation of performance (effective for periods
commencing on or after 1 January 2009).
IFRS 2 (Amendment) Share-based Payment – Vesting Conditions and Cancellations (effective for periods
commencing on or after 1 January 2009).
IFRS 8 Operating Segments (effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009).
The application of these standards is not anticipated to have a material effect on the group’s ﬁnancial statements
except for changes in the format of the presentation of performance and additional disclosure.
38 Filtronic plc Annual Report 2009 Notes to the
Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 May 2009
2 Accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of the ﬁnancial statements requires the use of accounting estimates and judgements, that affect
the application of accounting policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The
accounting estimates and judgements are continually evaluated. They are based on historical experience and other
factors, including expectations of the future, that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual
results may differ from the expected results.
The accounting estimates and judgements that have a signiﬁcant effect on the ﬁnancial statements are considered
below.
Property, plant and equipment
The carrying amount of property, plant and equipment assets is tested for impairment when there is an indication of
impairment. The recoverable amount of the assets is determined based on value in use calculations using cash ﬂow
forecasts. The cash ﬂow forecasts require the use of estimates and judgements about the future performance of
the related business.
Inventory
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The assessment of the net realisable value of
inventory requires forecasts of the future demand and selling prices of inventory.
Group receivables
At least annually an assessment is made of the recoverability of group receivables in the company’s balance sheet.
As a result of this assessment group receivables are provided for if impaired. The assessment of the recoverability
for certain group receivables is determined based on the cash ﬂow forecasts for the respective subsidiary. The cash
ﬂow forecasts require the use of estimates and judgements about the future performance of the subsidiary.
Deferred tax asset
The recognition of the deferred tax assets relating to tax losses carried forward depends on forecasts of the future
taxable proﬁts of certain subsidiaries. These forecasts require the use of estimates and judgements about the
future performance of the respective subsidiaries.
Defined benefit pension liability
The carrying amount of the deﬁned beneﬁt pension liability is based on actuarial valuations. The valuations are
based on estimates and judgements about the future, in particular the average life expectancy of pensioners.
Warranty provision
Warranties are given to customers on products sold to them. A warranty provision is recognised when products are
sold. The provision is based on historical warranty data. Actual warranty costs in the future may differ from the
estimates based on historical performance. The level of warranty provision required is reviewed on a product by
product basis and adjusted accordingly in light of actual experience.

40 Defined benefit pension scheme
A deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme was operated for United Kingdom employees. The scheme provided beneﬁts on
a career average revalued earnings basis.
The assets of the scheme were held in a separate trust fund which was managed by independent professional
investment managers. Contributions to the scheme were determined by a qualiﬁed actuary on the basis of annual
actuarial valuations using the projected unit measure. Employer’s regular contributions were 10.5% of pensionable
salary and employees’ contributions were 6.0% of pensionable salaries.
An enhanced transfer value offer was made to deferred members of the pension scheme during the period 1 June
2007 to 31 January 2008. This resulted in a pension settlement charge of £3,206,000. The company paid £6,027,000
of additional contributions to the pension scheme to fund the settlement of the enhanced transfer value.
Pension beneﬁts ceased accruing from 29 February 2008, and the deﬁned beneﬁts scheme is in the process of being
closed. The past service liabilities at 29 February 2008 have been settled by purchasing annuities from an assurance
company. This resulted in a pension settlement charge of £21,662,000. The company paid £21,000,000 of additional
contributions to the pension scheme to fund the settlement of past service liabilities with annuities.
The past service cost of £850,000 for the year ended 31 May 2008 was the cost of providing for the equalisation of
retirement ages for male and female members of pension schemes that were transferred into the deﬁned beneﬁt
pension scheme. This was part of the process of transferring all the residual liabilities of the scheme to the assurance
company providing the annuities.
At 31 May 2008 there were residual assets of £993,000 and residual liabilities of £1,995,000 remaining in the deﬁned
beneﬁt scheme.
The company had to pay an additional contribution of £100,000 to the scheme in the year ended 31 May 2009.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 1 July 2006. The results of that valuation have been
projected to 31 May 2007 and 31 May 2008 and then recalculated based on the following assumptions:
2009 2008
Liability discount rate – 6.6%
Expected return on scheme assets – 8.0%
The average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at the age of 65 was as follows:
2009 2008
Male – 21.9
Female – 24.8

Under the Executive Share Option Schemes the remuneration committee had a discretion to invite any full time
employee who was required to devote substantially all of his time to the business of the group to participate in the
scheme. Options granted under this scheme were generally exercisable in ﬁve equal annual tranches over a ﬁve year
period and, except in certain circumstances, only if certain performance targets had been satisﬁed. The exercise
price for an option was the average middle market quotation of Filtronic plc’s ordinary shares as derived from the
Ofﬁcial List of the United Kingdom Financial Services Authority for the three dealing days prior to the date of grant
of the option.
All outstanding share options vested and became exercisable on the completion of the sale of the Wireless
Infrastructure business on 16 October 2006. All outstanding options were cancelled on 16 October 2007.

The share options granted during the year have an exercise price of 25p and have an exercise period from 1 April
2012 to 1 October 2012.
The Sharesave Plan was offered to employees in February 2009. Under the plan employees who join the plan save
up to £250 per month for three years. The members of the plan were granted a number of share options based on
the amount they would save over the three years. At the end of the three years the members have a six month period
in which they can exercise the share options. The exercise price for an option was the middle market quotation of
Filtronic plc’s ordinary shares as derived from the Ofﬁcial List of the United Kingdom Financial Services Authority on
the dealing day immediately prior to the plan offer date.

Fair value
The carrying amount of all the ﬁnancial assets and liabilities approximate to their fair value as described below.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise bank balances and bank deposits with a maturity of three months or less.
Trade and other receivables are all receivable in less than one year. Trade receivables are generally receivable within
60 days.
Trade and other payables are all payable in less than one year. Trade payables are generally payable within 60 days.
Liquidity risk
The group and company hold substantial cash balances and have no debt. Cash is held on bank deposit for varying
periods from overnight to six months to ensure all liabilities can be met as they fall due. The amount of the cash
balances results in liquidity risk being very low.
Credit risk
The exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents and trade and other
receivables in the balance sheet as follows:

During the year ended 31 May 2009 signiﬁcant deposits were made with the Royal Bank of Scotland. In the future
signiﬁcant deposits will be made with Barclays and may be made with the other three major United Kingdom
clearing banks. The credit risk related to cash and cash equivalents is considered to be low due to the banks being
large with high credit ratings.

Credit risk is primarily related to trade receivables. The group’s businesses are concentrated on long term
relationships with a small number of larger and long established original equipment manufacturers. Overdue
receivables are regularly monitored and appropriate action is taken to collect payment. The group has historically
incurred only low levels of unrecoverable receivables. Therefore credit risk is considered to be low.
The company has no trade receivables.
Trade receivables included the following amounts for the group’s largest customers.

Interest rate risk
Cash is held on short term bank deposits which earn interest at variable money market deposit rates. At 31 May 2009
£15,500,000 was held on short term bank deposit with an interest rate of 0.3%. Sterling interest rates are very low and
therefore interest rate risk is considered to be low.
The interest rate sensitivity of the expected annual interest income assuming a balance on deposit of £16,000,000 is
as follows:
Interest rate Expected annual interest income
£000
1.5% 240
1.0% 160
0.5% 80
Foreign currency risk
The group’s and company’s reporting currency is sterling, which is also the company’s functional currency. The
functional currencies of the subsidiaries are sterling, Australian dollar and US dollar.
The group’s results and ﬁnancial position are affected by ﬂuctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
A signiﬁcant proportion of continuing revenues are denominated in euros. A surplus of euros has been generated
over the last two ﬁnancial years, and this situation is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. The nature of
the group’s businesses means that there is limited visibility of future revenues in euros. Therefore when forward
foreign exchange contracts are used to reduce the currency risk on the surplus euros expected to be generated, they
are usually only for short term periods of no more than six months. If sterling were to strengthen signiﬁcantly against
the euro this could materially reduce the group’s revenue and operating result.
Forward foreign exchange contracts may also be used to reduce the foreign currency risk on other transactions, for
example the income tax payment resulting from the sale of the Australian Wireless Infrastructure business.
At 31 May 2009 there was an outstanding forward foreign exchange contract to buy AUD 1,250,000 for £565,000,
which matured on 30 June 2009. The market value of this outstanding forward foreign exchange contract at 31 May
2009 was an asset of £55,000 which was recognised in the balance sheet. The forward foreign exchange contract was
taken out to eliminate the foreign exchange risk on the payment of Australian income tax resulting from the sale of
the Australian Wireless Infrastructure business.
At 31 May 2008 there were no outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts.
Nearly all cash is held in sterling.

Net exposure 673 938 (165) 2,324 901 (342)

The sensitivity of the group operating proﬁt from continuing operations to the euro to sterling exchange rate,
assuming all other variables remain constant, is as follows:
If the euro had been one per cent stronger/weaker against sterling throughout the year ended 31 May 2009 then the
group operating proﬁt from continuing operations would have been £51,000 higher/lower.
The company has no signiﬁcant exposure to foreign currency risk.
Capital management
The group’s and company’s capital is the total equity which comprises ordinary share capital and retained earnings.
The group and company have no debt or undrawn debt facilities. At 31 May 2009 the group had a cash balance of
£16,218,000 and the company had a cash balance of £15,766,000. The group and company have sufﬁcient cash to
cover working capital requirements and capital expenditure plans.
The group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the group’s ability to continue as a going concern
in order to provide future returns for shareholders. Surplus cash has been returned to shareholders, and was done
by the two special interim dividends of £29,729,000 in the year ended 31 May 2009 and £89,188,000 in the year ended
31 May 2008.

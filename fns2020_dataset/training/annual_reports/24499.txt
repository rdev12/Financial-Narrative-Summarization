in a one-off profit contribution of £4.9m 
for the year. This and the additional gold 
purchasing profit has in part been invested 
into the Group’s core pawnbroking 
activities through continued new store 
development. The Group opened 13 new 
stores in the year taking its portfolio to 
135 stores at the year end (2009: 122). 
While pawnbroking remains at the core 
of the current new store programme, 
the early profitability of new stores has 
been assisted by the strength of gold 
purchasing at these locations. New stores 
are carefully scrutinized by the board for 
the development of their pawnbroking 
business, as well as gold purchasing.  
On average, these new stores continue  
to meet our expectations for the future.
A key highlight is the material 
strengthening of the Group’s balance 
sheet, from both the working capital 
contribution and the cash generated by 
gold purchasing. As a consequence, net 
debt at 31 December 2010 is £27.0m, 
down from £42.3m a year earlier. 
Basic earnings per share are up from 
37.75 pence in 2009 to 48.77 pence  
in 2010.
Economic 	and	mar k e t 	bac k g r ound
Against the continued uncertainty of world 
currencies and the prevailing low interest 
rates in many countries we have seen a 
significant rise in the sterling gold price.  
In a fundamental way this change, 
together with the marketing of gold 
purchasing, mostly by competitors, has 
led to a much wider recognition in the U.K. 
of gold as a store of value and as a source 
of cash whether by its sale or its use as 
loan collateral. Though inevitably the gold 
price will remain volatile it is likely that its 
increasing role in meeting many people’s 
financial needs will continue. 
Final dividend
Subject to shareholder approval, a final 
dividend of 6.00 pence per ordinary  
share (2009: 5.60 pence) will be paid on  
2 June 2011 to shareholders on the 
register at the close of business on  
6 May 2011. The shares will be marked 
ex-dividend on 4 May 2011. This will bring 
the full year dividend to 9.50 pence per

It 	is	pleasing 	t o	r epor t 	
t hat	t he 	Gr oup	has 	
had another successful 
year in 2010 and has 
achieved both year on 
y ear 	s t or e	e xpansion 	
and 	EPS 	g r o wt h 	of 	
29.2%.	
The business has shown that despite the 
long standing nature of its pawnbroking 
business it has the entrepreneurial skills 
to have become a major participant in the 
gold buying market in the U.K. In addition 
the development of a new jewellery centre 
with improved processes will enable  
us to strengthen our position in U.K. 
jewellery retailing.
f inancial 	per f or mance
The Group has delivered a further year  
of profit growth. Since its flotation in 2006, 
pre-tax profits have risen from £5.1m in 
2006 to £25.5m in the current year. During 
this time the Group has also achieved 
estate growth from 77 stores to 135 at 
the year end, and has increased the gross 
pledge book from £25.2m to £39.5m.
The core pawnbroking business continues 
to perform well with a record level of 
lending in 2010. The Group has also 
seen an improvement in redemption 
as well as strong disposition profits; 
this improvement is important as it 
demonstrates our ability to develop long 
term relationships with our customers.  
The fact that the business has 
outperformed our expectation at the 
beginning of the year is due to gold 
purchasing being more profitable 
through the price increases in this 
fundamental commodity. Working capital 
improvements and new processes at 
the jewellery centre have also resulted 
share, including a 1.00 pence special 
interim dividend paid during the year. This 
represents an increase of 17% over the 
2009 total dividend of 8.10 pence.
The growth in dividend reflects the good 
performance of the Group in 2010 and the 
Board’s view in future prospects.
Prospects
The Group continues to hold good 
prospects for organic growth across 
its core pawnbroking business. 
Recent experience has shown that the 
development of greenfield sites achieves 
this growth in a satisfactory manner 
which has made it less attractive to 
make acquisitions though we continue to 
seek good opportunities that fit into our 
business model of pawnbroking, gold 
purchase and jewellery retailing.  
The Board expects to open 15-20 
greenfield sites in 2011. Gold purchasing 
volumes remain satisfactory and while 
margins are expected to be lower in 2011, 
we still anticipate that this business sector 
will continue to be a significant contributor 
to profits in 2011. 
Finally I would like to thank our staff and 
customers for their loyalty; and all our staff 
for their hard work and contribution to 
these excellent results.

As a business H&T has existed in some 
form since the late 1800’s and over the 
years has built or acquired some of the 
oldest and largest pawnbrokers in the 
U.K. Indeed the store in Edinburgh has 
operated from the same building for over 
150 years serving the same community.
Pawnbroking 
A pawnbroking loan is secured on an item of value with a term of up to six months. 
H&T value the item(s) based on weight and the precious metal or stones used in its 
manufacture. The customer agrees on a loan amount and enters into a consumer 
credit agreement. The agreement is for a period of 6 months and the customer can 
redeem the goods at any point during this time providing that they repay the original 
loan amount plus any interest due. At the end of the contract, they also have the 
option to extend the loan for a further six months. If the customer chooses not to 
redeem or renew the loan, H&T then take action to dispose of the goods.
Gold	pur c hasing
H&T buy jewellery direct from customers through all of our shops and more recently 
through our GoldBar units located in shopping centres throughout England and 
Scotland. Gold buying has become more widely understood during 2010 and  
a key part of H&T’s success has been to capture this heightened profile and  
to drive significant increases in volume in recent years.
The transaction is simple with the store agreeing a price with the customer  
and purchasing the goods for cash on the spot.
Pa y 	 Da y 	A dv ance	
A Pay Day Advance (PDA) loan is a short term cash loan repayable on the 
customer’s next pay date. The service is used in a similar manner to a bank 
overdraft and in fact the costs are similar to a number of high street facilities.  
The customer writes out cheques to H&T for the value of up to £750 and is  
given the value of the cheques less a 13% charge in cash. 
The customer then has the option to: 
•	 Allow 	 the	cheques 	 to	 be 	 banked;	
•	 Pay	them	 of f 	 in 	 cash;	 or	
•	 Extend	the 	 cheques	 for 	 a	further 	30	days 	by	paying 	the	charge	 owed.
More recently H&T has accelerated its 
development by adding new products 
and services and expanding the store 
network. On 8 May 2006 H&T floated 
on the Alternative Investment Market 
(“AIM”) providing the group with access to 
new sources of finance and allowing the 
provision of equity based incentivisation 
to employees. Since then, H&T has 
opened or acquired 65 stores.
H&T operates in a fast moving, 
competitive environment and will continue 
to succeed by focussing on customer 
needs, the development and retention 
of staff and the ongoing development 
of existing and new products together 
with expansion in locations.

Kwikl oan
KwikLoan is a simple way for customers to obtain an unsecured loan of up to £750 
which is repaid over 12 months by direct debit. Before issuing a loan we establish 
the customer’s identity, confirm their income and employment, and ensure that 
they manage their bank account in a reasonable way. If approved then the customer 
enters into a consumer credit loan agreement and we will collect the repayments on 
the date agreed with the customer. This product provides a useful way for customers 
who are unable to repay a PDA in full to manage down their loan with us. Customers 
can have either a KwikLoan or a PDA, but not both at the same time.
c heq ue 	cashing
Cheque cashing is a service that allows customers to get cash for their cheques 
in a few minutes, rather than banking the cheque. Most cheques are wages 
cheques, although other types such as personal, lottery, building society and Giro 
are considered. Customers use H&T to speed up the cheque clearance (some 
building societies can take almost two weeks to clear a cheque) or to avoid banking 
the cheque into an overdrawn account. Customers are required to provide proof of 
identity and address in order to use the service.
Jewellery retail 
H&T offer a unique range of new and second-hand jewellery sourced from our 
pledge book, purchased over the counter or purchased from suppliers. The vast 
majority of items sold are from forfeited items and all are professionally cleaned and 
restored at the company’s refurbishment centre in Kent. They are then re-distributed 
for sale to stores across the country. H&T staff are able to use their extensive product 
knowledge to assist customers to choose individual pieces to suit their requirements, 
a skill which of course enables them to make the right loan in the first place.
Pre-paid debit card
A pre-paid debit card is an ideal way for customers to have the functionality of a 
MasterCard without the associated credit, giving them the freedom to shop online, 
over the phone or in store. As there is no loan or credit involved the application 
process is simple and the acceptance rate is 100%. Customers leave the store 
with an ATM only card and the personalised MasterCard arrives in the post shortly 
after. Cash can then be loaded to the card at over 14,000 locations across the U.K., 
including any H&T store or Post Office branch. 6

The customer brings in the item(s) of value to the store and 
is asked to give an indication of how much they want to 
borrow. This is done in order to establish how realistic the 
customer’s expectation is, as the high margins charged by 
the high street jewellers can give an inflated perception of the 
value of the goods. The store staff then use a combination 
of their expertise and training, together with the point of sale 
system to determine if there is adequate security for the loan. 
Assuming that there is, the customer and H&T then enter into 
a credit agreement regulated by the Consumer Credit Act.  
This is a contract for 6 months and carries interest of 8% flat 
rate per month. 
During the contract the customer can:
•	 Redeem the pledge. This means they pay H&T the 
value of the loan, plus the interest accrued to date; or
•	 Renew the pledge. This means they pay H&T the 
interest only and a new loan agreement is issued  
for a further six months.
Approximately five months after the date of the loan we will 
write to the customer explaining that the contract is almost 
due and reminding them of the final date to redeem. We write 
again once the contract is expired to give the customer one 
more chance to redeem or renew their pledge.
If the customer does not redeem or renew then we have to 
attempt to realise the value of the pledge to repay the loan. 
The Consumer Credit Act sets out a different treatment for 
pledges over £75 and those £75 and under.
•	 Over 	£75: 	These	pledges	ar e 	 sent	to	public 	auction	with	 a	
reserve price. In the event that the pledge is sold then H&T 
retains the value of the loan, interest to date plus a small 
administration fee. Any surplus is repaid to the customer.
•	 £75 	and	 under:	These	pledges	become	 the 	 pr operty	of 	
H&T immediately; the rules relating to the surplus do not 
apply due to the lower value of the items concerned.
Regardless of the outcome H&T does not pursue the 
customer in the rare circumstances when there is a shortfall 
between the amount due under the agreement and the 
amount recovered when the item is sold. Therefore if the 
customer is unable to redeem there will be no further 
consequences and their credit rating is unaffected.

2. Our staff ask the customer 
how much they would like to 
borrow and perform a visual 
examination of the item. Using 
the weight and metal type we 
now have a good idea of what 
the item is worth based on our 
general lending guidelines.
1. H&T’s pledge book is almost 
entirely gold and diamond set 
jewellery, as those items are 
relatively easy to value and in 
the event of default they can 
be sold either through the retail 
window or as a commodity.
4. The customer details and a 
full description of the item are 
entered to the computer system 
which calculates a range of 
loan values in accordance with 
Group policy. A credit agreement 
is produced and the cash issued 
to the customer.
3. If we can meet the customer’s 
expectations then the item is 
tested with a range of acids  
to determine the metal type  
and carat, while diamonds  
are verified using electronic 
testing equipment.  H&T Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 8

The single factor that unites them is the 
ownership of an asset and a requirement 
for short term cash.
Use of funds
Generally our customers use the funds 
obtained for day to day living expenses. 
The number of customers using the cash 
for this purpose has almost doubled since 
our 2009 survey. A small number also 
borrow to solve the short term cash needs 
of their businesses or for more leisure 
based needs.
The 	h &T	dif f er ence
H&T has a long established culture of 
customer service and our staff strive to 
help and empathise with our customers.  
It is common to hear first names being 
used in the stores and equally the 
customer to call our staff by their first 
name. This is not the result of scripts or 
training but rather an expectation that they 
are there to help the customer during what 
may be a difficult time. The key to this 
relationship is the autonomy given to the 
store managers in their management of 
the customer relationship. This maintains 
the customer relationship and provides 
that flexibility and helpfulness that is  
so often missing from the rest of the  
high street.
2010 research
During May 2010 we conducted 350 
customer interviews to better understand 
what is important to them and to assess 
our customer service standards. Over 
86% of those surveyed rated their 
satisfaction with H&T 8 or more out of 10.

National Pawnbroker’s Association 
Employer of the Year award
In October 2010 H&T was awarded 
the NPA Employer of the Year 2010. 
This was for our commitment to the 
development and motivation of our 
people, how we reward and recognize 
our people and because our culture was 
recognised as one that is positive and 
where employees feel valued and want 
to work.
H&T operates in a competitive 
environment and the ability 
to deliver the right level of 
service, whether on loans, 
cheques or in retail is vital 
to the future development 
of our business. In order to 
achieve that level of service 
we need the right people 
in our stores, well trained, 
motivated and managed. 
The store manager is the 
key to that success and 
we pride ourselves on the 
experience and ability of our 
field management team.
T r aining 	and	de v elopment
Over 70% of our Deputy Mangers 
and Store Managers are promoted 
from within our business and this has 
been made possible by the development 
opportunities created. 2010 has seen the 
introduction of a Management Development 
Programme (MDP) focussing on the technical 
and behavioural competencies required in a 
management position. The MDP incorporates 
a personal individual development plan, 
a number of workshops to develop 
skills in management, organisation and 
communication and an opportunity to run  
and manage a shop and create an action  
plan to develop the business. 
Rewards and appraisals
As well as being competitive regarding 
our pay and benefits structure, H&T seek 
to recognise and reward exceptional 
performance within the business through 
further incentives and awards. This includes 
quarterly and annual bonuses as well as 
seasonal incentives for all employees and 
profit share for out performance of targets. 
H&T also rewards its Managers by offering 
them an annual share option scheme to help 
them participate in ownership of the company.
Our average length of service is nearly 7 years 
for store managers and 50% of them have 
over 5 years service.

Gross profit has risen 30.5% to £66.8m 
(2009: £51.2m) and profit before 
tax is up 37.8% to £25.5m (2009: 
£18.5m). One off working capital 
improvements and a reduction in aged 
pledge balances have also contributed 
£4.9m to gross profits in the period.
The Group’s core pawnbroking business 
has performed well, achieving a record 
level of lending in the period and again 
delivering good underlying growth in 
the gross pledge book to £39.5m. 
This is a pleasing result given the 
increased availability of gold purchasing 
as an option for the consumer.
Gold purchasing itself has remained a 
strong source of profit and cash flow 
for the Group as H&T has retained 
a strong presence and continues to 
benefit from seizing an early initiative in 
this market. The Group has reduced its 
net debt significantly in the year, down 
from £42.3m at 31 December 2009 
to £27.0m at 31 December 2010.
Another benefit to profitability and 
cash flow has been the rising gold 
price during the year. The average gold 
price in 2010 of £794 per troy ounce 
was 28% higher than in 2009 and has 
allowed the Group to enjoy higher than 
expected disposition margins. It has 
also supported an increased average 
loan ensuring that the Group remains 
competitive on the high street.
The Group continues its strategy of 
expansion, adding a further 13 greenfield 
sites in 2010 and completing 1 relocation. 
It is a credit to our staff that the core 
estate continues to perform well, while 
over the period since IPO 70 new stores 
have either been opened or acquired 
by the Group. This has provided 
additional valuable experience to the 
management team. At 31 December 
2010 the Group had 180 branded 
outlets of either H&T Pawnbrokers 
or H&T GoldBar across the U.K.

Pawn Service Charge (PSC) represents all income earned up to the completion  
of a pledge. The main items are interest and net profit from auctions after returning 
any surplus to the customer.
In 2010 PSC represented 35% of total gross profits (2009: 44%) and 57% of total 
pawnbroking income (2009: 68%). The reduction of PSC as a percentage of the 
total group gross profit is due to the strong gold purchasing volumes experienced 
during the year and higher gold price increasing the Group’s scrap margins
The average loan in 2010 was £151 (2009: £136) and the yield on the pledge book 
was 59% (2009: 61%). The recently increased average loan has impacted the yield 
due to the lag in interest collections.

Pawnbroking remains the Group’s core 
business and is the largest and most 
resilient component of Group profit, 
contributing £23.2m in 2010, a headline 
increase of 3.9% (2009: £22.3m). 
Removing auction profits, as these were 
impacted by exceptional proceeds in 
H1 2009, reveals stronger underlying 
growth in interest collections of 7.7%.
This growth has been achieved by 
a record level of lending during the 
year, itself driving an increase in the 
gross pledge book to £39.5m at 31 
December 2010 (2009 reported: £38.2m, 
2009 pre-aged pledge: £36.6m).
Lending growth at the Group’s newer 
stores and an increased average loan 
has offset competitive pressure in some 
of the Group’s more mature stores.
The increased average loan size of 
£151 (2009: £136) has ensured the 
Group remains competitive on the 
high street, whether in relation to 
competition from other pawnbrokers 
or the increased availability of gold 
purchasing as an option to the consumer. 
The Group has marginally improved 
its redemption rate during 2010.
Retail jewellery sales
Retail turnover increased by 19.2% 
to £19.6m (2009: £16.4m) driven by 
expansion in the store estate. On a 
like-for-like basis retail turnover was 
flat year-on-year which given the 
challenging high street environment and 
the underlying price point and therefore, 
affordability of gold is a pleasing result.
This reflects the excellent value proposition 
offered by the Group in relation to other 
retailers and the continued investment 
into both staff training and store design.

Disposition refers to the entire process to dispose of forfeited 
pledges. The key routes are retail through the stores and 
scrap. Given the higher margin our preferred route is via retail.
Retail
The Company’s retail proposition is primarily gold and 
jewellery and the large majority (>90%) of retail sales are items 
sourced from pawnbroking or purchasing operations. We also 
complement our retail offering with a small amount of new 
jewellery to maximise customer draw to our windows.
We have incorporated the retail offering into all but one H&T 
branded outlet and all new H&T Pawnbrokers now have a 
dedicated retail window, most including an internal display 
with a separate retail counter.
Profitability in this area is driven by sound valuation at the 
point of purchase or lending and also by the management  
of appropriate stock. Our preference is to retail the stock  
that is produced from forfeited loans to maximise our returns.
The advantage of H&T over other retailers is that the cost of 
our supply is relatively low and we can scrap surplus items 
and still make a profit. This offsets the fact that we have little 
choice over our supply and therefore must retail what we have 
available to sell.
As almost all items retailed come from pawnbroking or 
purchasing operations we are able to offer an excellent value 
proposition that is extremely hard to beat on the high street.
S c r a p
Items that are damaged beyond repair, slow moving or surplus 
to retail requirement, may be smelted and sold at the current 
gold spot price less a small commission. The point of sale 
system reduces the amount lent or paid on items identified as 
scrap or low quality so we are still able to make a reasonable 
margin on scrap sales.

H&T Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Improved management information 
from the Group’s new I.T. system, 
combined with improved distribution 
capabilities as a result of the relocation 
of the Group’s jewellery centre has also 
led to an improved sales/stock mix.
The Group continues to focus on retail 
as an important revenue stream as it can 
act as a valuable means of disposition 
in the event of a fall in the gold price.
Pawnbroking scrap
H&T has a natural hedge to offset any 
potential fall in jewellery sales as its 
alternative disposition method is to 
scrap the gold for the then current gold 
price. Scrap profits from the disposition 
of items forfeited from the Group’s 
pledge book contributed £9.0m in 2010 
(2009: £2.1m). Of the total one off profit 
contribution of £4.9m, £2.1m has been 
realised within Pawnbroking Scrap as a 
result of the disposal of the aged pledge 
balances held at the end of 2009.
G o l d 	 p u r c h a s i n g
Gold purchasing profit rose significantly 
in 2010 as a result of strong purchasing 
volumes at stores, a full year contribution 
from the Group’s GoldBar operation 
and the rising price of gold.
Total gold purchasing profit of £20.1m 
(2009: £13.5m) has also benefited 
from an improvement in the Group’s 
working capital processes, delivering an 
estimated £2.8m of the £4.9m one-off 
gross profit contribution in the year.
The Group has benefited from heightened 
public awareness of both gold purchasing 
as a service and the value inherent 
in their jewellery. Purchase volumes 
across the store estate, while down from 
their peak in H2 2009, have remained 
relatively stable throughout 2010. This 
is a pleasing result given the changing 
competitive environment and reflects 
the competitive pricing offered. The 
Group’s first mover advantage and 
hence longevity in this market has also 
helped build brand recognition and trust 
among our customers. H&T’s GoldBar 
retail mall units remain a profitable 
and flexible business with 45 units in 
operation at the year end (2009: 54).
The sterling gold price has also benefitted 
performance in this highly cash generative 
segment. The higher absolute price 
benefits scrap proceeds, but also a rising 
price environment helps sustain higher 
than expected margins due to the time 
lag between purchase and disposition.
c h e q u e 	 c a s h i n g
Revenues net of bad debt and 
provisions from the Group’s Third 
Party Cheque Cashing and Pay Day 
Advance products increased to £5.1m 
(2009: £4.8m) and now contribute 
7.7% of gross profit (2009: 9.4%).
Commission earned from third party 
cheque cashing declined by 8.2% in 
the year, affected by both the current 
economic climate and gradual withdrawal 
of cheques from the banking system. 
Improved debt collection rates offset 
this decline however, resulting in broadly 
flat net revenues year-on-year.
Net revenues from the Group’s Pay 
Day Advance product increased by 
6.1% during the year with new stores 
and further improved debt collections 
offsetting increased competition 
from on-line providers. The Group is 
currently developing more sophisticated 
credit scoring models in order to 
widen acceptance criteria and grow 
this product, whilst maintaining the 
current strong debt performance.
K w i k l o a n
The KwikLoan loan book has benefited 
from the gradual withdrawal of the 
cheque guarantee card resulting in 
some customers converting from the 
Pay Day Advance product to KwikLoan. 
The loan book increased to £1.0m 
at the year end (2009: £0.6m).
c hief	Ex ecutiv e ’ s 	r e vie w 	continued c heq ue 	cashing
Cheque cashing is the provision of cash in exchange for a 
cheque payable to our customer for a commission fee based 
on the face value of the cheque. The average cheque value in 
2010 was £318 (2009: £316), with the average fee being £20 
(6.4%) (2009: £20 (6.5%)).
The cheques are normally in respect of wages and the  
service is used as a quick and convenient alternative to  
a bank overdraft. The product simply serves a short term  
need for cash.
In order to manage the risk associated with cashing third party 
cheques we have access to a variety of information, from 
credit reference agencies to internet directories, as well as our 
own point of sale system and database of customer activity. 
Pa y	Da y	A dv ance
Pay Day Advance is a simple form of credit, where the advance 
is repaid by cheques presented by the customer at the point of 
the loan. The contract allows for 30 days credit and the average 
advance in 2010 was £465 (2009: £462), with a typical charge 
of 13% (2009: 13%) per 30 days.
The customer will agree a date for the cheque to be banked, 
then either:
•	 Pay additional fees for another 30 days (Extend); or
•	 Pay the face value of the cheque in cash (Settle); or
•	 Allow the cheque to be deposited into our account
Kwikl oan
H&T identified the need for an unsecured loan product that 
had a longer duration than a Pay Day Advance. The principle 
is that some customers are unable to repay the lump sum of 
a Pay Day Advance after 30 days and prefer a smaller regular 
repayment. The underwriting criteria are essentially the same 
as for a Pay Day Advance although we do more verification to 
ensure that the customer is likely to be a reasonable risk for 
the duration of the loan.
KwikLoan is currently offered over a 12 month period for loan 
values up to £750, although the average is closer to £600. We 
earn approximately £300 gross interest on a £500 KwikLoan 
over a 12 month period.
Pre-paid debit card
H&T offer a pre-paid debit card on behalf of Advanced 
Payment Solutions (APS) under the CashPlus brand. The 
card is an instant issue Cirrus card (which allows ATM access 
immediately), with a personalised MasterCard issued to the 
customer in the post within 10 days. For further product 
information refer to www.apsgroup.com.
H&T were the first national chain to provide the CashPlus card 
in the U.K. and we remain one of the largest customers of APS.
The card is the ideal vehicle to provide funds to our customers 
in a more convenient form than cash. The card is the natural 
extension to each of our cash based products, with the store 
staff cross selling the benefit as part of our pawnbroking and 
cheque cashing transactions. We expect the card to enhance 
our relationship with customers, increasing retention and 
loyalty as they will use our outlets to load additional funds on 
to the card.
The customers value the status of having a MasterCard 
and the ability to use the card online, with over half the 
transactions on the card being for internet purchases.

Customers have two choices when seeking to raise finance from gold jewellery in our 
stores. They may either pawn the gold, from which H&T earn a Pawn Service Charge,  
or they may select to sell their gold as a one-off transaction.
Gold purchasing was introduced by the Group in 2007 to attract a different customer 
base as well as to avoid the issue of customers pledging goods with no intention of 
redemption. Understanding the customers needs and motives is therefore a key element 
to our staff training to ensure the correct result for both the customer and the Group. 
Nor does the Group seek to influence behaviour by differentiating on price between 
purchasing and lending rates. 
After a holding and processing period, the majority of purchased items will be smelted 
and sold at the current gold price less a small commission. In 2010, gold purchasing 
represented 30% of total gross profit (2009: 26%).

data collected over the last four years. 
Developing new products and services 
remains a key focus for the Group. 
During the year, the Group bought a

The pawnbroking market continues 
to evolve with higher potential returns 
attracting more players into the industry 
and in reaction to new dynamics 
introduced by the rise in gold purchasing. 
Both factors have raised awareness of 
pawnbroking as a service, and drawn 
more customers into H&T’s stores. 
Still however, only a small minority 
of the population have ever visited a 
pawnbrokers and the Board believe 
that the potential market is considerably 
greater. One of the first obstacles 
to securing this market is to change 
people’s perceptions of pawnbrokers 
and the Group continues to drive this 
with its open and modern store layouts.
The pawnbroking market remains 
fragmented providing the opportunities 
for organic and acquisitional growth. 
Although there are no official statistics, 
the Board estimate there to be 500 – 
750 locations around the U.K. where 
pawnbroking is offered as a core service, 
with an additional 1,000 – 1,500 locations 
where it is offered as an ancillary service.
c ur r ent 	tr ading 	and	outlook
The Group still holds good prospects 
for organic growth as the store estate 
is still relatively immature with respect 
to pawnbroking activities. Of the 
Group’s total pledge book, 11% is 
accounted for by the 47 greenfield 
sites opened in the last four years.
As determined by market conditions, 
future growth is also likely to be 
driven via expansion of the Group’s 
geographical footprint. The Board 
currently expect to open 15-20 greenfield 
sites in 2011, with provisional lease 
terms having been agreed on 14 sites 
as at 23 February 2011. Potential 
acquisitions, given the Group’s balance 
sheet strength, will continue to be 
assessed on a case by case basis.
Current trading remains in line with market 
expectations, and while gold purchasing 
volumes remain relatively constant, the 
Board is mindful of the sustainability  
of the margin in this business segment.  
The Board believes that current consensus 
forecasts represent a reasonable 
expectation of financial performance for 
the year ending 31 December 2011.
I would also like to thank all our people 
whose skills, commitment and enthusiasm 
continue to drive our success, and 
give us confidence in the future.

H&T’s geographical development 
follows a clustering model. This 
is principally due to the need to 
support new stores with existing 
operational management and 
staff to maximise returns.
Practically, this means that where 
we enter a new market there are 
two main phases of development. 
The first is the initial acquisition 
or greenfield store followed by a 
period of development to provide 
a stable and successful team. 
The second phase is the 
consolidation of that market 
through the creation of a discrete 
area containing 8 to 10 stores.
This strategy has been demonstrated 
on the maps with focussed 
development in Glasgow, the 
North East and the North West.
We believe that there is significant 
capacity in the market to develop 
additional units both around existing 
sites and in completely new areas.

f inance 	Dir ect or ’ s 	 r e vie w
Net debt at 31 December 2010 was 
£27.0m, down from £42.3m twelve 
months earlier.
The Group’s gold purchasing activities 
and working capital improvements 
made during 2010 have contributed 
significant cash inflows, resulting in a 
material strengthening of the Group’s 
balance sheet. At 31 December 2010, 
the Group had £17.1m of available 
funds upon which it is able to draw 
under its current credit agreement. 
The Group is well placed to fund any 
suitable acquisitions and hence deliver 
earnings accretion to shareholders.
Another highlight is the proposed final 
dividend of 6.0p, which takes the full 
year dividend to 9.5p – a 17% increase 
year on year. It also maintains our track 
record of dividend growth in every year 
since the Group’s flotation in 2006, 
despite the capital expenditure required 
to fund the Group’s store expansion 
programme and the dilutive earnings 
profile of a new store in its early years.
Earnings per share covers the dividend 
by 5.2x and even excluding the working 
capital and one off gains of £4.9m, 
cover is 4.1x. Cash flow dividend cover, 
defined as available cash flow for either 
equity distribution or debt repayment 
divided by the actual dividend paid in 
the year, is 5.7x, even post substantial 
capital expenditure payments during 
the year.
Other key areas of note include:
Ot her 	dir ect	and	adminis tr ativ e	e xpenses	
Other direct and administrative 
expenses rose from £30.1m in 2009 
to £38.1m in 2010. The increase was 
driven by the full year effect of stores 
opened in 2009, the 13 new stores 
opened in 2010 and the full year effect 
of the GoldBar retail mall units during 
the year.
Finance costs
Interest on bank loans fell during 2010 
to £2.1 million (2009: £2.2 million), 
reflecting a lower average loan balance 
during the year but a higher average 
margin following the Group’s refinancing 
in 2009.
H&T’s interest cover ratio (EBITDA to 
interest) was 15.1x (2009: 10.6x). The 
Group’s net debt to EBITDA ratio fell to 
0.86x (2009: 1.8x). 
Pr ofit 	bef or e	t ax ation
Profit before taxation, and fair value 
movement in interest rate swaps 
increased by £7.7 million from £18.3 
million in 2009 to £26.0 million in 2010.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share for 2010 
was 48.77 pence compared with 
37.75 pence in 2009. Diluted earnings 
per share for 2010 was 47.52 pence 
compared with 37.54 pence in 2009.

Capital expenditure during the year 
on property, plant and equipment was 
£3.7 million (2009: £3.9 million) of 
which £2.4 million related to the 13 new 
greenfield stores opened during the 
year and the relocation of the Group’s

from 28.4% in 2009 to 37.7% in 2010. 
Excluding the working capital 
contribution of £4.9m, the ROCE in 
2010 is 32.9%.

of adopting good corporate governance 
practices in the best interests of all 
shareholders. Although the Company is 
not required to report on compliance with 
the Combined Code (“the Code”) since its 
shares are traded on the AIM market, the 
Company complies, so far as practical, 
with the Code in the following ways:
DIRECTORS
The Board
The Board comprises three executive 
directors and three non-executive 
directors. Their biographies appear on 
page 19. A review of these shows a range 
of experience and expertise sufficient to 
bring independent judgement on issues 
of strategy, performance, resources 
and standards of conduct which is vital 
to the success of the Group. The three 
non-executive directors hold shares 
as disclosed on page 25. However, 
because the number of shares held is 
small and there are no cross directorships 
between executive and non-executive 
directors, the non-executive directors 
are considered to be independent. 
Board meetings
The Board is responsible to the 
shareholders for the proper management 
of the Group. A statement of 
directors’ responsibilities in respect 
of the financial statement is set out 
in this Annual Report on page 29. 
The Board meets 10 times during the  
year. To enable the Board to discharge  
its duties, all directors receive appropriate 
and timely information. Briefing papers 
are distributed to all directors in advance 
of the Board meetings. There is a formal 
schedule of matters reserved to the 
Board which include the determination 
of strategy, approval of new stores 
and acquisitions, approval of budget 
and major capital expenditure. 
At Board meetings, the agenda 
normally comprises a review of the 
management accounts, a CEO review 
of operations, a review of new store 
proposals and potential acquisitions 
and an update on the progress of the 
Group’s other strategic objectives. 
The Board meetings in August and March 
cover the approval of the interim and 
preliminary financial results respectively 
and the November meeting deals with 
the approval of the annual budget.
The following committees deal with the 
specific aspects of the Group’s affairs:
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee 
comprises three independent non-
executive directors of the Company. 
The members of the Committee are:
•	 Malcolm 	Berryman	(Chairman)

The Committee meets at least once in 
each year and at such other times as the 
Chairman of the Committee sees fit.
The Chairman of the Committee 
is appointed by the Board on the 
recommendation of the Nomination 
Committee. The quorum for 
the Committee is two.
 
The duties of the Committee are to:

determine individual remuneration 
packages including bonuses, incentive

on termination and individual 
termination payments, ensuring 
that the duty of the individual to 
mitigate loss is fully recognised;
•	 in 	 determining	individual 	 packages 	
and arrangements, give due regard to 
the comments and recommendations 
of the Combined Code;
•	 be 	told	of	 and 	 be 	 given 	 the

changes in employee benefit 
structures in the Company;
•	 r ecommend	 and 	 monitor 	 the 	 level	
and structure of remuneration 
for senior managers below 
Board level as determined;
•	 agr ee 	the	 policy 	for 	 authorising	
claims for expenses from the 
Chief Executive and from the 
Chairman of the Board; and
•	 r ecommend 	 an 	 annual	 r eport 	 for	
the Board to put to Shareholders 
on executive remuneration 
compliant with relevant legal 
and regulatory provisions.
The Committee is authorised 
by the Board to:
•	 seek 	 any	 information 	 it	 r equir es 	
from any employee of the Group 
in order to perform its duties;
•	 be 	 r esponsible 	 for 	 establishing 	
the selection criteria and then 
for selecting, appointing and 
setting the terms of reference for 
any remuneration consultants 
providing advice to the Committee, 
at the Group’s expense; and
•	 obtain, 	 at	 the	 Gr oup’ s 	 expense, 	
outside legal or other professional 
advice where necessary in 
the course of its activities.

three independent non-executive 
directors of the Company. The 
members of the Committee are:
•	 Andr ew 	 J	 Br own 	 (Chairman) 	
– Chartered Accountant

•	 Peter 	 D 	 McNamara
The Audit Committee reviews each

results and cost-effectiveness of internal 
and external audit, and has delegated 
power from the Board to exercise the 
power from shareholders to agree 
fees for external auditors. The Audit 
Committee is responsible for satisfying 
itself on the independence of internal 
auditors and on the independence 
and objectivity of external auditors. 
The Committee reviews the operation 
of internal controls and reports to the 
Board on the annual review of the 
internal control and risk management.
 
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee comprises 
three independent non-executive 
directors of the Company. The 
members of the Committee are:
•	 Peter 	 D 	 McNamara	 (Chairman)

Corporate governance
H&T Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 20 The function of the Nomination Committee 
is to provide a formal, rigorous and 
transparent procedure for the appointment 
of 	new 	Dir ectors 	to 	the	 Boar d.	 In	
carrying out its duties, the Nomination 
Committee is primarily responsible for:
•	 identifying 	and 	 nominating	
candidates to fill Board vacancies;
•	 evaluating	 the	structur e 	and	
composition of the Board with regard 
to the balance of skills, knowledge 
and experience and making 
recommendations accordingly;
•	 r eviewing 	the	 time	 r equir ements 	
of non-executive directors;
•	 giving 	full 	 consideration	to	
succession planning; and
•	 r eviewing	the	 leadership	of 	the	 Gr oup.
Internal control
The Board acknowledges that it is 
responsible for the Group’s system of 
internal control and for the continuing 
process of reviewing the effectiveness 
of the internal controls. Internal control 
systems are designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. The 
directors confirm that they have reviewed 
the effectiveness of the systems of internal 
control that have been in operation during 
the year. The Group has an internal audit 
function principally for periodic store visits. 
lnternal control: financial
The internal control process has been 
reviewed and its main features are:
•	 Financial 	Reporting:	 ther e	is 	 a	
comprehensive budgeting system 
with an annual budget approved by 
the Board. Monthly trading results are 
reported against the corresponding 
figures for the budget and previous 
year. The Board also reviews  
re-forecasts on a regular basis.
•	 Capital 	Expenditur e:	 ther e 	is 	a	
comprehensive budgeting system 
for capital expenditure with an 
annual budget approved by the 
Boar d. 	 The	Finance 	 Dir ector	
authorises individual items of capital 
expenditure and material items are 
also authorised by the Board or CEO.
•	 Cash 	 flow: 	an	annual 	 cash	flow	
forecast is drawn up and approved 
by the Board and actual cash flow is 
reviewed monthly against this forecast.
•	 Organisational	Structur e:	a	 clear 	
organisational structure with 
defined responsibilities and clear 
authority levels has been set.
•	 Stor e 	 Audits:	 a 	Stor es	Audit	
function exists to ensure that 
Group procedures regarding 
cash, pledges and stock handling 
are being adhered to.
Internal control: risk management 
During 	 the 	year , 	the 	 Gr oup	had	in	
place formalised procedures to identify, 
evaluate and manage significant risks 
and to enable management to assess 
and regularly report to the board on 
issues relating to business, operational, 
financial and non-compliance risks.
Relations with shareholders
The board recognises the importance 
of communications with shareholders. 
The Chief Executive’s statement and 
the operational review on pages 10 
to 15 include a detailed review of the 
business and future developments. 
There is a regular dialogue with 
institutional shareholders including 
presentations after the Group’s 
preliminary announcement of the year 
end results and at the half year results.
 
Going concern
The Group has continued to improve 
its financial performance year on year, 
delivering profit after tax of £17.2m for 
the 	year	ended	 31 	 December	2010 	(year 	
ended 	31	 December	2009:	£13.3m). 	
Together with benefit of working capital 
improvements delivered in 2010, these 
results have enabled the Group to repay 
£13.5m of its loan balance during the 
year, reducing the year end outstanding 
balance to £31.0m. Consequently, 
the Group has increased its net 
assets to £61.7m (2009: £47.1m).
The Board has approved a detailed 
budget for 2011, which indicates a robust 
performance with surplus cash generated 
from operations after accounting for 
the Group’s forecast levels of capital 
expenditure. In addition, the Group has 
access to its current £50.0m revolving 
facility, which is not due to expire until 
June 	2013.	 As 	at 	 31	December	 2010,	
the Group had £17.3m of available 
financing by which to finance both current 
operations and future growth. This strong 
balance sheet position provides a high 
level of confidence that the Group will 
be able to repay all liabilities as they fall 
due during 2011, as well as funding the 
planned expansion in the store estate. 
The Board is also confident of meeting 
all covenant tests during the year.
Longer term forecasts are also reviewed 
by the Board, with the ‘base case’ 
financial forecasts revealing no inability 
to meet financial covenants or repay 
liabilities. Sensitivity analysis under 
less favourable scenarios designed to 
test the point at which the Group will 
either have insufficient headroom or 
breach financial covenants has also 
been prepared and reviewed. The 
Board considers the selected scenarios 
as remote, and is comfortable that 
mitigating strategies are available to the 
Group to offset liquidity constraints. 
This anticipated performance for 
FY11 	r eflects	the	fundamentals	of 	our 	
markets and products. We believe that 
pawnbroking is a non-cyclical business 
and therefore the current economic 
climate should have no significant 
negative impact to our business model. 
The Group offering is principally through 
secured lending against pledges. The 
Group policies on pawn lending remain 
rigorous and prudent, such that the Group 
has very limited exposure to loss in the 
event of customers not redeeming their 
pledges, due to the value of the pledge 
collateral held, principally being gold and 
precious stones. These commodities 
have exhibited increasing values in the 
current environment, and the Group has 
no reason to believe that the value will 
not be maintained in the near future. 
Further 	details	 ar e 	pr ovided 	 in 	 note	 26.
Based on the above considerations and 
after 	 r eviewing 	in	detail	 FY	2011 	 for ecasts,	
the directors have formed the view that 
the Group has adequate resources to 
continue as a going concern for the 
foreseeable future and has prepared 
the financial statements on this basis. 
Principal 	risks	and 	uncertainties	to 	 the	
Group’s business are discussed in 
mor e 	 detail	in	the	Dir ectors’	Report.

Principal activities and review of  
the business
The principal activity of the Company is 
that of a non-trading holding company 
for Harvey & Thompson Limited and H&T 
Finance 	Limited. 	 The	main 	activities 	 of	
the Group continue to be pawnbroking, 
gold purchasing, retail of jewellery, cheque 
cashing, unsecured lending and other 
related services operated through Harvey 
& Thompson Limited. 
A review of the business and its future 
development (including the information 
that fulfils the relevant requirements of 
section 417 of the Companies Act 2006) is 
given in the Chairman’s Statement, Chief 
Executive’ s 	Review	and	 Finance	 Dir ector’ s	
Review on pages 10 to 18.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The directors continually identify, 
evaluate and manage material risks 
and uncertainties faced by the Group 
which could adversely affect the Group’s 
business, operating results and financial 
condition. It is unfortunately inevitable 
in a business that has a stock in trade 
consisting of cash and gold that fraudulent 
losses occur from time to time. We have 
in place both ethical requirements for our 
staff, continually refined and improved 
procedures, together with an internal 
audit team to address this risk. The list 
below details what the directors consider 
to be the principal risks and uncertainties 
and the actions taken, or to be taken, to 
mitigate the adverse consequences. This 
list is not intended to be exhaustive and 
other risks may emerge over time:

Financial risk management objectives  
and policies
The Group’s activities expose it to a 
number of financial risks including interest 
rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and 
price risk. The use of financial derivatives 
is governed by the Group’s policies 
approved by the board of directors, 
which provide written principles on the 
use of financial derivatives to manage 
these risks. The Group does not use 
derivative financial instruments for 
speculative purposes.

H&T Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 23 swap contract to hedge this exposure on 
a notional value of £34,000,000 (2009: 
£ 3 4 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 ) . 	 A s 	 a t 	 3 1 	 D e c e m b e r 	 2 0 1 0 , 	
the Group had outstanding bank loans of 
£31,000,000 such that it was exposed 
to interest rate risk on the £3,000,000 
difference between the notional value of 
the derivative contract and the amount of 
its outstanding bank loans.
Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets 
are bank balances and cash, trade and 
other receivables. The Group’s credit 
risk is primarily attributable to its trade 
receivables, the most significant of which 
are the pledge book, the KwikLoan 
l o a n b o o k , 	 P a y 	 D a y 	 A d v a n c e s 	 a n d 	
Cheque Cashing balances. In all cases, 
exposure on trade and other receivables 
is spread over a large number of 
counterparties and customers.
The risk attributable to the pledge book 
is further mitigated due to the presence 
of collaterals (the customer’s pledges) 
which can be easily liquidated in almost 
all cases at a profit. 
The risks attached to the KwikLoan  
l o a n 	 b o o k 	 a n d 	 P a y 	 D a y 	 A d v a n c e s , 	 
both of which are unsecured lending,  
are mitigated by the continual monitoring 
of bad debts and a possible modification 
of lending criteria. With respect to  
the KwikLoan product, the Group 
performs an external credit check prior  
to lending. Similar procedures mitigate 
the risks associated with Cheque  
Cashing activities.
The amounts presented in the balance 
sheet are net of allowances for doubtful 
receivables. An allowance for impairment 
is made where there is an identified 
loss event which, based on previous 
experience, is evidence of a reduction  
in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The credit risk on liquid funds and 
derivative financial instruments is 
considered to be low as funds are  
held with financial institutions with high 
credit-ratings assigned by international 
credit-rating agencies to the Group’s 
bankers as shown:
 Moody’s credit rating
Barclays Bank plc Aa3
The Royal Bank of Scotland plc Aa3
The Group has no significant 
concentration of credit risk other than 
on bank balances of £656,000 (2009: 
£539,000) with Royal Bank of Scotland 
plc and £1,630,000 with Barclays Bank 
plc (2009: £nil). 
l iquidity risk
In order to maintain liquidity to ensure that 
sufficient funds are available for ongoing 
operations and future developments, the 
Group uses a mixture of long-term and 
short-term 	 debt	finance.	At	31	December	
2010, the Group had sufficient headroom 
on its current borrowings and remains in 
full compliance with all loan covenants.
Furthermor e, 	the	 Company 	 will 	 r eview 	 
at the appropriate time, the possibility  
of raising future equity finance or  
refinance existing banking facilities  
to expand activities.
Price risk
With regard to the current balance sheet 
position, the Group is not exposed to price 
risk, as the majority of its jewellery and 
all of its scrap gold is obtained through 
unredeemed pledges, which have a cost 
to the Group which is lower than the resale 
value. The Group is however exposed 
to adverse movements in the price of 
gold in its gold scrap activities and the 
value of the pledge collaterals. The Group 
considers this risk to be limited due to the 
current margin on scrap gold. Should the 
price of gold drop significantly, the Group 
can mitigate that risk by changing its 
lending policy on pawnbroking pledges or 
by entering hedging instruments. Currently 
the Group has no gold hedge in place, 
although this is reviewed by the Board on 
a regular basis.
Exchange rate risk
While the Group’s activities are wholly 
conducted in Great Britain, the Group is 
impacted by foreign currency exchange 
rates affecting the gold price exchange 
fr om 	 USD	to	GBP .
Capital structure 
Details 	 of 	 the	authorised	shar e	capital	
are shown in note 27 to the consolidated 
financial statements. The company has 
one class of ordinary shares which carry 
no right to fixed income. Each share 
carries the right to one vote at general 
meetings of the Company. As disclosed in 
note 27, during the period 241,663 new 
ordinary shares (2009: 50,974) of £0.05 
each were issued, called up and fully paid 
as part of the Group’s share option and 
long term incentive plans.
As a result of the above the nominal 
issued share capital has increased from 
£1,769,508 	as	at	31	December	2009	to	
£1,781,591	as	at	31	December	2010.
On 	8 	February	2010,	the	company	has	
been notified of the following voting rights 
by major shareholders of the Company:
 Percentage of voting 
 rights and issued 
 share capital
Artemis Investment Management 18.11%
BlackRock 9.75%
Henderson Global Investors 6.77%

D e t a i l s 	 o f 	 e m p l o y e e 	 s h a r e 	 s c h e m e s 	 a r e 	
set out in note 28. Under these share 
schemes, there are currently a potential 
1,667,642 number of shares that will be 
issued to current option holders at the call 
of the option holder. Under its Articles of 
Association, the Company has authority to 
allot under these share schemes, for cash, 
up to a maximum of 3,563,183 ordinary 
shares without being required to offer such 
securities to all shareholders in accordance 
with statutory pre-emption rights.
 
On any date, no option may be granted 
under any share option scheme or long 
term incentive plan, if (as a result) the 
aggregate nominal value of ordinary 
shares issued or issuable pursuant to 
options granted during the previous 10 
years under any share option scheme 
would exceed 10% of the nominal value  
of the share capital of the Company in 
issue on that date.

are taken into account when decisions are 
made that are likely to affect their interests 
and that all employees are aware of the 
financial and economic performance

weekly information bulletins, a quarterly 
newsletter and every year through a store 
managers’ conference.
Employment of the disabled
It is the policy of the Group to give  
full and fair consideration to the 
employment of disabled persons in jobs 
suited to their individual circumstances

possible, arrangements are made for  
the continuing employment of employees 
who have become disabled whilst in the 
Group’s employment.
Supplier payment policy
The Group’s policy is to settle terms of 
payment with suppliers when agreeing 
the terms of each transaction, ensure that 
suppliers are made aware of the terms 
of payment and abide by the terms of 
payment. Trade creditors of the Group 
at 	31	December 	2010	wer e 	equivalent	
to 29 (2009: 29) days’ purchases, based 
on the average daily amount invoiced by 
suppliers during the year.

made donations to registered local and 
national charities of £4,800 (2009: £nil). 
No political contributions were made 
during the year (2009: £nil).
Independent auditors and statement 
of provision of information to the 
independent auditors
Deloitte 	LLP	have	expr essed 	 their	
willingness to continue in office as auditors 
and a resolution to reappoint them will 
be proposed at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting.
Each of the persons who is a director  
at the date of approval of this report 
confirms that:
(1) so far as the director is aware, there is 
no relevant audit information of which 
the Company’s auditors are unaware; 
and
(2) the director has taken all the steps that 
he ought to have taken as a director 
in order to make himself aware of 
any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s auditors 
are aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should 
be interpreted in accordance with the 
provisions of s418 of the Companies  
Act 2006.

H&T Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 28 The directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial. Under that law the directors 
are required to prepare the group 
financial statements in accordance 
with 	Inter national	 Financial	 Reporting 	
Standar ds	(IFRSs)	as	adopted	by 	the	
European Union. The Group financial 
statements are also required by law to be 
properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006 and The AIM Rules. 
The directors have chosen to prepare 
the parent company financial statements 
in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally 	 Accepted	Accounting 	Practice	
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
and applicable law). Under that law the 
directors must not approve the accounts 
unless they are satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of 
the Company and of the profit or loss of 
the Company for that period.
In preparing these financial statements, 
the directors are required to:
•	 select 	 suitable 	accounting 	policies	 
and then apply them consistently;
•	 make 	judgments	and 	estimates 	 that	
are reasonable and prudent;
•	 state 	 whether 	applicable	UK	
Accounting Standards have been 
followed; and
•	 pr epar e 	 the	financial	statements	on 	
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
In preparing the Group financial 
statements, International Accounting 
Standard 1 requires that directors :
•	 pr operly 	select	 and 	 apply 	 accounting 	
policies;
•	 pr esent	 information,	including	
accounting policies, in a manner that 
provides relevant, reliable, comparable 
and understandable information;
•	 pr ovide 	 additional 	disclosur es	
when compliance with the specific 
r equir ements 	 in 	 IFRSs	ar e 	insuf ficient 	
to enable users to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, 
other events and conditions on the 
entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and 
•	 make 	an 	assessment	 of 	 the	
Company’s ability to continue  
as a going concern. 
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that 
are sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and 
enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for 
the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the 
United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions.

are responsible for the preparation of 
the group financial statements and for 
being satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view. Our responsibility is to audit

applicable law and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the

to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud 
or error. This includes an assessment 
of: whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the group’s circumstances 
and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness 
of significant accounting estimates 
made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the group financial 
statements:
•	 give 	a 	 true	and	 fair	view 	 of	 the	 
state of the group’s affairs as at  
31 	December	 2010	 and 	 of	 its	 pr ofit 	 
for the year then ended;
•	 have 	been	pr operly 	 pr epar ed 	 in 	
accor dance	 with 	 IFRSs	 as	 adopted 	 
by the European Union; and
•	 have 	been	pr epar ed 	 in 	 accor dance 	
with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by 
the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in 
the 	 Dir ectors’ 	 Report	 for 	 the	 financial	
year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the group 
financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to 
report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of 
the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion:
•	 certain 	 disclosur es	 of 	 dir ectors’	
remuneration specified by law are not 
made; or
•	 we 	 have	 not 	 r eceived 	 all 	 the 	
information and explanations we 
require for our audit.

1. General information
H&T Group plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Acts. The address of the registered office is 
given on page 19. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in note 6 and in the Chairman’s Statement, 
Chief	Executive	Of ficer’ s	 Review ,	the 	Finance	 Dir ector’ s	Review	 and	the	 Dir ectors’	 Report.
The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which 
the group operates. 
2. Changes in accounting policies
adoption of new and revised standards
In the current year, the following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted.
IFRS	2	 Amended 	2009	 Shar e 	 based	payments
IFRS	3	 Amended	2008	 Business 	combinations
IAS 27 Amended 2008 Consolidated and separate financial statements
IAS 28 Amended 2008 Investments in associates
IFRIC 	17	 	 Distributions 	of 	non-cash	assets	to	owners
The	Impr ovements 	to	IFRSs	(May	 2009)
No amendments to these financial statements have been made as a result of adopting these new and revised Standards and 
Interpretations. 
Standards and interpretation in issue but not yet effective 
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied  
in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective:
IFRS 	9	 	 Financial 	 instruments	–	classification	 and	measur ement
IAS 24 (Amended 2009) Related party disclosures
IAS 32 (Amended 2009) Classification of rights issues
IFRIC 	14	 (Amended	 2009)	 Pr epayments 	 of 	 a	minimum	funding 	r equir ement
IFRIC 	19	 	 Extinguishing 	 financial	liabilities	with	equity	instruments
All amendments have arisen from the IASB’s 2010 annual improvement process. 
The directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have a material impact  
on the financial statements of the Group.
3. Significant accounting policies
basis of accounting
The	financial	statements	 have	been	pr epar ed	 in 	 accor dance	with 	Inter national	Financial	Reporting	Standar ds 	(IFRSs)	adopted 	 
by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with The AIM Rules.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company  
(its 	subsidiaries)	made	 up 	 to	 31 	 December	each	year . 	 Contr ol 	is 	achieved	wher e 	the	Company	has 	the	power	to	 gover n 	the	financial	 
and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. Subsidiary undertakings have been included in  
the Group financial statements using the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income includes the results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year from the effective date of acquisition or up to the 
effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with 
those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
notes to the consolidated financial statement
f or the year ended 31 December 2010 H&T Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 36
3. Significant accounting policies (continued)
Going concern
The directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis 
of 	 accounting	in	pr eparing	 the	financial	 statements.	Further	detail	 is	contained 	 in 	 the 	 Corporate 	 Gover nance 	 r eport 	 on 	 pages 	 20 	 and	21.
business combinations 
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each acquisition  
is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity 
instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss  
as incurred.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration 
arrangement, measured at its acquisition-date fair value. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of 
acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments (see below). All other subsequent changes in the fair value of 
contingent 	 consideration	 classified 	as 	 an	asset 	 or	liability 	 ar e 	accounted	 for 	 in 	 accor dance 	 with 	 r elevant	 IFRSs. 	 Changes 	 in 	 the	 fair	 
value of contingent consideration classified as equity are not recognised.
Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously-held interests in the acquired entity are remeasured to fair 
value at the acquisition date (i.e. the date the Group attains control) and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in profit or loss. 
Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been recognised in other comprehensive 
income are reclassified to profit or loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest were disposed of.
 
The 	 acquir ee’ s	identifiable	assets,	liabilities 	and 	 contingent	liabilities 	 that	 meet	 the	 conditions 	 for 	 r ecognition	 under 	 IFRS	 3(2008) 	 ar e	
recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that:
•	 deferr ed 	tax 	 assets	or	 liabilities 	 and	liabilities	 or	assets 	 r elated 	to	 employee 	 benefit 	 arrangements	 ar e	 r ecognised	 and 	 measur ed	 
in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively;
•	 liabilities 	 or	 equity	 instruments	 r elated	to 	the	r eplacement	 by	 the	Gr oup 	 of 	 an	 acquir ee’ s 	 shar e-based	 payment 	 awar ds 	 ar e 	 measur ed	
in 	accor dance 	with	IFRS 	 2	Shar e-based	Payment;	and
•	 assets	(or	 disposal	 gr oups) 	that	ar e	 classified	 as	held	 for	 sale	 in 	 accor dance 	 with 	 IFRS	 5 	 Non-curr ent	 Assets 	 Held 	 for 	 Sale	 and	
Discontinued 	 Operations	ar e 	 measur ed 	 in 	 accor dance 	with	that	Standar d.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the 
Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during 
the measurement period (see below), or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts 
and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and 
circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of one year.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities 
of a subsidiary, or trade and assets previously operated through either sole partnerships in limited companies with no audited accounts 
at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any 
accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment 
is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired (the acquisition date). Goodwill 
is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and 
the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest (if any) in the entity over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the 
identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
If, after reassessment, the Group’s interest in the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets exceeds the sum of the consideration 
transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest  
in the acquiree (if any), the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.

3. Significant accounting policies (continued)
Goodwill (continued)
For 	the	 purpose	of	impairment	testing,	goodwill	 is 	 allocated	to	 each	of	the	Gr oup’ s	 cash-generating 	units	(‘CGU’)	expected	to 	benefit 	
from the synergies of the combination. CGU’s to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more 
frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying 
amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then  
to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for 
goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period. The Group considers each of its stores to be a CGU with the exception of the goodwill 
arising on the acquisition of Harvey & Thompson Limited by the Group in September 2004, where the subsidiary undertaking as a whole 
is the cash generating unit.
Goodwill 	arising	on	acquisitions	befor e 	the 	date	of 	transition	to 	IFRS	 has	been 	r etained	at 	the 	pr evious 	UK	 GAAP 	amounts 	subject 	 to	
being tested for impairment annually as described above.
 
Intangible assets
Intangible assets with a finite useful life are carried at cost less amortisation less impairment losses. Intangible assets represent 
intangibles 	 which	have	 been	separately	 identified	 under	 IFRS	3 	 arising 	in	business	combinations, 	or 	meet	the	r ecognition	criteria 	 
of IAS 38, “Intangible Assets”, being principally computer software assets.
Amortisation of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is calculated using the expected life of the intangible assets 
acquired.
Amortisation of other intangible assets (computer software) is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of the asset 
less its assessed realisable value over its estimated useful life (6 to 8 years).
Property, plant and equipment
Pr operty ,	 plant 	and 	equipment	is	 stated 	at 	cost 	less	accumulated	depr eciation 	 and	any	impairment	 in 	 value.
Depreciation
Depr eciation	is	 pr ovided 	on	all	 pr operty , 	plant	and 	equipment,	 at	 rates	calculated	to	write 	of f 	 the 	 cost,	less 	estimated	r esidual	 
value of each asset evenly over its expected useful life, as follows:
Short leasehold premises 
Leasehold improvements Shorter of 7 years or life of lease
 
Computer equipment 
Computer hardware 3 to 5 years
 
Fixtures and fittings 10 years
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate  
the carrying value may not be recoverable.
The asset’s residual values, useful lives and methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each financial year end.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether  
there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount  
of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash  
flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (‘CGU’)  
to which the asset belongs. 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (CGU) 
is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as an 
expense immediately.

Inventories
Inventories 	ar e	stated	at	 the	lower 	of	 cost	 and 	 net	r ealisable	value. 	 For 	stock 	acquir ed	 for	r etail 	sale	the 	cost	r epr esents 	the	pur chase 	
price plus overheads directly related to bringing inventory to its present location and condition and is measured on a first in first out 
basis. 	For	stock	arising	 fr om 	unr edeemed 	 pledges	the	 cost	r epr esents 	the 	amount	originally	loaned, 	plus 	 overheads	dir ectly 	r elated 	 
to bringing inventory to its present location and condition. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated 
costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Where necessary provision is made for obsolete, slow moving and damaged stocks.
f inancial instruments
Financial	assets	and 	financial	liabilities 	ar e	 r ecognised	on	 the	Gr oup’ s	balance	sheet	at	fair	 value	when	the	Gr oup	becomes 	a	party	 
to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
f inancial assets
In 	 accor dance 	with	IAS	39,	 ‘Financial	Instruments:	Recognition	 and	Measur ement’ 	 financial	assets	ar e 	classified	 into 	 the	following	
specified categories: 
•	 financial	assets	‘at	 fair	value	thr ough	pr ofit 	or	 loss’	(FVTPL);
•	 ‘held-to-maturity’	 investments;
•	 ‘available-for -sale’	 (AFS)	 financial	assets;	and
•	 ‘loans 	and	r eceivables’. 	
The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition. Currently 
the Group has financial assets classified as ‘loans and receivables’ and financial assets at ‘fair value through profit and loss’. No financial 
assets are classified as ‘held to maturity’ or ‘available-for-sale’.
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are 
classified as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any 
impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition 
of interest would be immaterial.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset and of allocating interest income over the 
relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts (including all fees on points 
paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the 
expected life of the financial asset, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
The principal financial assets included in this measurement category are:
Trade receivables
Trade receivables represent amounts due from customers in the normal course of business. Trade receivables include certain amounts, 
namely pledge receivables and KwikLoan debtors which are interest bearing. The accrued interest arising on these interest bearing 
assets is included in prepayments and accrued income using the effective interest method. All other amounts which are not interest 
bearing are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts, which are charged 
to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash at hand and deposits held with banks with original maturities of three months or less.
Financial assets at FVTPL 
Financial 	assets	ar e	classified	as	 FVTPL	wher e	the 	financial	asset 	 is	either	 held 	for 	trading	or	it	is 	designated	as	FVTPL.	The	Gr oup	has	
not	 designated	any	financial	assets 	as	 being	FVTPL 	and	accor dingly 	only	holds	 financial	instruments	in	this	category	that	ar e 	deemed 	 to	
be held for trading under the provisions of IAS 39. All financial assets deemed to be held for trading are derivative instruments that are 
not designated and effective as hedging instruments (see the derivative accounting policy below).
Financial 	assets	at 	FVTPL	ar e 	stated	at	 fair	 value,	with 	any	r esultant 	gain	 or	loss	r ecognised 	in	pr ofit 	or	loss.	Fair 	value	 is	determined	in	
the manner described in note 26.

Impairment of financial assets
Financial 	assets,	 other	than 	those	 at	FVTPL,	 ar e 	 assessed	for	 indicators	of	impairment 	at	 each	balance	sheet	date.	Financial 	assets 	 ar e 	
impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the 
financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been reduced. 
Objective evidence of impairment could include:
•	 significant 	 financial	dif ficulty 	of	 the	 counterparty;	or
•	 default	on 	 payments;	or
•	 it 	becoming	 pr obable	 that 	 the 	counterparty	will 	enter	 bankruptcy 	or 	financial	r e-organisation.
For	certain 	categories	 of	 financial	asset,	such	as	 trade 	 r eceivables, 	assets	that	ar e	assessed	not	to	be	impair ed	individually 	ar e	
subsequently assessed for impairment on a collective basis. 
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade 
receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable is considered 
uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount  
of the allowance account are immediately recognised in profit or loss.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event 
occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income to the extent that the carrying amount of the financial asset at the date the impairment is reversed 
does not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised. 
De-recognition of financial assets
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire; or it transfers  
the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group neither transfers 
nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises  
its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks  
and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises  
a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.
f inancial liabilities and equity
Financial 	liabilities	and	 equity	instruments	ar e 	 classified 	accor ding	to 	 the	substance	of	the	contractual 	arrangements 	enter ed 	into.	
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.  
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities 
Financial 	liabilities	ar e 	 classified	 as	either	 financial	liabilities	 ‘at 	 FVTPL ’ 	 or 	 ‘other	 financial	liabilities’.
Financial 	liabilities	at	FVTPL
Financial 	liabilities	ar e 	 classified	 as	FVTPL	 wher e	the	financial	liability	is	either 	held 	 for 	trading 	or 	it 	is 	designated	as	FVTPL.	The	Gr oup	
has 	not 	designated	 any 	financial 	liabilities	 as	being	 at	FVTPL 	 and 	 accor dingly	only	holds	 financial	instruments	in	this	category	that	 ar e	
deemed to be held for trading under the provisions of IAS 39.
With respect to the Group, all financial liabilities that are held for trading are derivative instruments that are not designated and effective 
as hedging instruments (see the derivative accounting policy below).
Financial 	liabilities	at	FVTPL 	ar e	stated 	at	 fair	 value, 	with	any	 r esultant 	 gain	 or	 loss 	r ecognised 	 in 	 pr ofit 	or	 loss.	The 	net 	 gain 	 or 	 loss 	
recognised in profit or loss incorporates any interest paid on the financial liability. 
Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. All other financial liabilities are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield 
basis. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense 
over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the 
expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period. H&T Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 40

The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in interest rates. The Group uses interest rate swap contracts 
to hedge the economic exposure to this risk. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The Group has elected not to adopt the hedge accounting provisions of IAS 39, and accordingly derivative financial instruments are 
initially measured at fair value on the date that the contract is entered into and subsequently re-measured to fair value at each reporting 
date. The gains and losses on re-measurement are taken to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and included 
adjacent to finance costs.
A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than  
12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets  
or current liabilities.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years  
and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferr ed 	tax 	 is	the 	tax	expected	 to 	be	payable	 or	r ecoverable	on	dif fer ences 	 between	 the	 carrying	 amounts 	 of	 assets	 and 	 liabilities	 
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the 
balance 	sheet	 liability	method.	 Deferr ed 	 tax	liabilities 	ar e	generally	r ecognised	 for 	 all 	 taxable 	 temporary	 dif fer ences 	 and 	 deferr ed	 tax 	
assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of 
goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects 
neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferr ed 	tax 	 is	calculated	at 	the	 tax	 rates	that	ar e	expected 	to	 apply 	in	the	 period	 when 	 the	 liability	 is	 settled 	 or	 the 	 asset	 is	 r ealised.	
Deferr ed	tax 	 is	charged 	or	cr edited	 in	 the 	 Consolidated	 Statement 	of	Compr ehensive 	 Income, 	 except 	 when	 it 	 r elates	 to	 items	 charged 	
or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferr ed	tax 	 assets	and 	 liabilities	ar e	 of fset 	when	ther e	 is 	 a	 legally 	enfor ceable	 right 	 to	 set	 of f 	 curr ent	 tax 	 assets	 against 	 curr ent 	 tax	
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis.
l eases
Leases taken by the Group are assessed individually as to whether they are finance leases or operating leases. Leases are classified  
as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other 
leases are classified as operating leases.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. 
Operating lease rental payments are recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income on a  
straight-line basis over the lease term. The benefit of lease incentives is spread over the term of the lease.
The Group currently has no finance leases.

Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, 
and 	it	is	pr obable	that	 an	outflow	of 	economic	 benefits	will	be	r equir ed 	 to	settle	the	obligation. 	Pr ovisions	ar e	 measur ed	at	the	dir ectors’	
best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where 
the effect is material.
All the Group’s premises are leased under operating leases. The majority of the leases include end of lease rectification clauses which 
impose certain requirements on the Group to complete repairs and maintenance, or re-decoration activities if required. The Group 
provides for repairs and maintenance obligations as it becomes aware of any significant amounts that will be required.
 
Share capital and share premium account
There is one class of shares. When new shares are issued, they are recorded in share capital at their par value. The excess of the issue 
price over the par value is recorded in the share premium account.
Incremental external costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are recorded in equity as a deduction, net of tax, to the share 
premium account.
Employee benefit Trust shares
Under 	the 	terms	of	the	Gr oup	Long	T erm	Incentive 	Plan	(‘L TIP’) 	 for	the	 dir ectors,	the	 par ent	Company	issued	certain	shar es	to	an	
Employee	Benefit	T rust, 	paid	 for	thr ough 	 the	issuance 	of	 a	loan	to	the 	T rust 	fr om 	the	 Gr oup. 	The	awar d 	of	shar es 	 under 	the	 L TIP 	 
is conditional upon certain vesting criteria, as outlined in note 28. The fair value of the awards made is measured under the policy 
disclosed below for Share Options.
The Group presents the conditional shares as an adjustment to own equity at the balance sheet date through the Employee Benefit 
Trust shares reserve, until the point that the shares are awarded, and cease to be conditional awards of shares.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods  
and services and interest income provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably 
measured. The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:
•	 Retail 	 comprises	r evenue 	 fr om	r etail 	 jewellery 	 sales,	of	both	pur chased 	stock	and 	fr om 	the	sale 	of	pledged 	 security 	fr om	
unredeemed pawn loans and is recognised at the time of sale;
•	 Pawnbr oking, 	 or	Pawn	 Service	 Charge	 (PSC),	 comprises	inter est 	 on	pledge 	 book 	 loans,	plus	auction	 pr ofit 	and	loss,	 less	any	
auction commissions payable and less surplus payable to the customer. Interest receivable on loans is recognised as interest 
accrues by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that discounts the 
estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount;
•	 Pawnbr oking 	Scrap	and	Gold	 Pur chasing	 comprises	pr oceeds	 fr om	gold	scrap	sales	 and	is	 r ecognised 	 at 	 the	time	of	sale;
•	 Cheque 	cashing	comprises	 r evenues 	fr om 	thir d 	party	Cheque	 Cashing	and	Pay	Day	 Advances. 	The	commission 	r eceivable 	on	
cheque cashing is recognised at the time of the transaction; and
•	 Other	financial	services	 comprise	r evenues 	 fr om	other	 unsecur ed	lending,	 for eign	exchange	income, 	pr epaid	car d 	and	other	
income. Interest receivable on unsecured loans is recognised as interest accrues by reference to the principal outstanding and 
the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that discounts the estimated future cash receipts through the expected life 
of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount. Any other revenues are recognised on an accruals basis.
The Group recognises interest income arising on secured and unsecured lending within trading revenue rather than investment revenue 
on the basis that this represents most accurately the business activities of the Group.
The Group recognises revenue and bad debt expenses (both impairments and movements on allowance accounts) on pawnbroking, 
cheque cashing and other financial services on a portfolio approach. The Group considers that the bad debts arising on the loans and 
receivables balances are a direct function of the revenue earned due to the nature of the activities, and accordingly records the net 
amount of interest or commissions due and bad debt expenses within revenue.

Gross profit
Gross profit is stated after charging bad debt expenses and the direct costs of stock items sold or scrapped in the period.
Other direct expenses
Other direct expenses comprise all expenses associated with the operation of the various shops and collection centre of the

Employee share incentive plans
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees (including directors). These payments are measured  
at fair value at the date of grant by use of a Black-Scholes model or a Stochastic model depending on the vesting conditions attached  
to each scheme. This fair value cost of equity-settled awards is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on  
the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of any non market-based vesting conditions.  
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, 
exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations. A corresponding credit is recorded in equity.
No cost is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest.

4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 3, the directors are required to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The 
estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual 
results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the 
revision affects both current and future periods.

4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (continued)
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations (which are dealt with separately below), that the 
directors have made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the  
amounts recognised in financial statements.
Revenue recognition
Interest receivable on pawnbroking loans is recognised as interest accrues by reference to the percentage of the pawn loans that are 
estimated to be redeemed and the effective interest rate applicable. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the estimated 
future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount. The estimated future cash 
r eceipts 	 ar e	based	on	 the	historical 	cash	 r eceipts	experience	(the	“Pledge	Redemption”)	of	the	 business	which	vary	fr om	month	 to 	
month.	The	Gr oup	monitors	 the	Pledge	 Redemption 	on 	a	monthly	basis.
The Group does not recognise interest income on the pawn loans that are not expected to be redeemed. The Group recognises income 
on these loans when the related collateral that supports the loan is disposed of, through either the scrap or retail operations of the 
Group. The Group is of the opinion that the revenue earned on the unredeemed pledges is only realised from the Group perspective at 
the point at which the stock, or scrap item that the Group obtains from the pledge collateral is disposed of. In arriving at this treatment, 
the Group also considers that the transfer value from pawn loans to inventory of the unredeemed pledge collateral cannot exceed the 
cost to the Group of the inventory item which is represented by the underlying loan amount provided on the unredeemed pledge item.
Inventories 
The majority of the inventory balance is obtained as a result of default by pawn loan customers. The inventory is stated at cost to the 
Group, being the amount initially lent on the pawn loan, plus overheads directly related to bringing the inventory to its present location 
and condition. As stated above, the Group does not allocate any interest that would have been earned on the pawn loans to the cost 
of inventory. Accordingly, the profit that arises on the subsequent disposal of the inventory, through either retail or scrap, includes an 
element which relates to the appropriation by the Group of collaterals supporting pawn loans that have a higher market value, than the 
pawn loan amount. 
Dilapidations provisions
All the Group’s premises are leased under operating leases. The majority of the leases include end of lease rectification clauses which 
impose certain requirements on the Group to complete repairs and maintenance, or re-decoration activities if required. The Group 
provides for repairs and maintenance obligations as it becomes aware of any significant amounts that will be required. The Group 
does not provide for amounts where the potential exposure cannot be reliably measured and accordingly does not anticipate potential 
repairs and maintenance on the portfolio of stores. Additionally, the Group maintains the stores to a high standard and completes any 
necessary repairs and maintenance on a timely basis, addressing any events that require expenditure throughout the lease period as 
and when required. Such costs are expensed as incurred.
 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have 
a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are 
discussed below.
Pawnbroking loans interest accrual estimation
The Group recognises interest on pawnbroking loans as disclosed in the Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies 
section above. The pawn loans interest accrual (‘pledge accrual’) is material to the financial statements and is dependant on the 
estimate that the Group makes of the expected level of redeemed pawn loans. The Group estimates the expected redemptions based 
on the historical redemption rates achieved. There is a risk that the actual redemption rate may vary significantly from the historical rate 
used 	to 	estimate	 the	 pledge	accrual	 at	the 	balance	 sheet	date.	The	Dir ectors 	assess	the 	pledge	 accrual	estimate	made	at	the	 prior	
balance sheet date annually to determine if the actual redemption differs significantly to the previous estimate. No significant differences 
were noted for 2009 or 2010. The sensitivity of the pledge accrual to reasonable changes in the redemption rate is shown in note 26.  H&T Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 44
4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (continued)
Impairment of goodwill
Determining 	 whether	goodwill 	 is 	 impair ed	r equir es	 an	estimation	 of	 the	 value 	 in 	 use 	 of	 the	 cash-generating	 units 	 to	 which	 goodwill 	 
has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the Group to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the  
cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. The review is conducted annually, in the final 
quarter of the year. The impairment review is conducted at the level of each cash generating unit, which for acquisitions represents 
the 	specific	stor e 	 acquir ed.	 For	 disclosur e 	 purposes,	the	Gr oup	aggr egates	 the	 acquisitions 	 in 	 each	 period 	 to	 simplify 	 the	 overall	
presentation. The carrying value of each aggregated set as described above, including the amount of goodwill included in each cash 
generating unit, is as follows:

Stores acquired in 2007 2,094 1,516
Stores acquired in 2008 1,041 391
Stores acquired in 2010 168 19
There were no impairments recorded in the current or preceding year. The principal assumptions applied by management in arriving at 
the value in use of each cash generating unit are as follows:
1. The Group prepares cash flow forecasts over a five year period for each cash generating unit. The year one cash flows are 
derived from the most recent financial budget, with cash flows in subsequent years reflecting management’s estimate of the 
expected growth of the revenue in the relevant cash generating unit, based on the specific characteristics of the store, and the 
stage of development of the core product offerings, being principally the pledge book and the cheque cashing activities. This 
reflects both past experience of the Group, and store specific factors. A terminal value is then calculated for periods thereafter.
2. The Group has discounted the cash flows at a post tax, risk adjusted rate of 9.5%. The terminal value cash flows are forecast to 
increase at between 0% and 2% dependent on the cash generating unit.
3. The directors have considered reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions and are of the opinion that no change to the 
impairment review conclusions would arise from such changes. This reflects the prudent acquisition policy applied by the Group, 
the integration of the acquisitions within the overall portfolio of stores that the Group operates, and the growth obtained through 
the introduction of the Group’s products in newly acquired stores.
While the impairment review has been conducted based on the best available estimates at the impairment review date, the Group notes 
that actual events may vary materially from management expectation.
f air value of derivatives
The directors use their judgement in selecting an appropriate valuation technique for financial instruments not quoted in an active 
market. 	V aluation 	techniques 	commonly	used	 by 	 market 	 practitioners	ar e 	 applied. 	 For 	 derivative	 financial 	 instruments,	 assumptions	ar e 	
made based on quoted market rates adjusted for specific features of the instrument. This requires estimation of the future interest rates, 
and also the appropriate discount rate. Actual events may vary materially from management expectation.
Trade receivables provisioning
Trade and other receivables are stated at their nominal amount less expected impairment losses. 
The impairment losses on the pledge book only relate to pledges seized by the police and shrinkage. The pledge book items seized by 
the police are impaired on an item by item basis since the Group tracks the status of each pledge individually. The shrinkage provision is 
based on an estimate of the pledge book missing at the reporting date using historical shrinkage experience.
No other impairment losses are provided on the pledge book since the value of the collaterals is greater than the pledge book  
nominal value.

4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (continued)
Trade receivables provisioning (continued)
The 	impairment 	of	Pay	Day	Advance 	loans 	 is	subject	to	a	 portfolio 	appr oach,	 based 	 on	an	estimate	 of 	historical 	bad	debt 	 experience	
and expected recoveries.
The impairment of KwikLoan loans is subject to individual assessment based on the number of payments missed. If one payment  
has been missed, a third of the remaining balance is impaired, if two payments have been missed, two-third of the remaining balance  
is impaired and if three payments or more have been missed, the whole remaining balance is impaired.
With respect to all provisions that are based on estimates, there is a risk that actual losses incurred will vary significantly from 
management expectation at the balance sheet date, if historical loss rates are not a good indicator of the actual credit risk profile  
of the year end receivables.

and the sensitivity at the balance sheet date to changes in the key assumptions with respect to impairment losses.
Stock provisioning
Where necessary provision is made for obsolete, slow moving and damaged stock or stock shrinkage. The provision for obsolete, slow 
moving and damaged stock represents the difference between the cost of the stock and its market value. The stock shrinkage provision 
is 	based	on 	an	estimate	of	 the	inventory 	missing	at	 the	r eporting	 date 	using	historical 	shrinkage	experience.	For	further	details	on	the	
provisions for inventory, refer to note 7.

6. Business and geographical segments
business segments 
For	r eporting	purposes, 	 the	 Gr oup 	 is	curr ently	 organised 	 into	 six	 segments 	 –	 Pawnbr oking,	 Gold 	 pur chasing,	 Retail, 	 Scrap, 	 Cheque	
cashing and Other financial services. The principal activities by segment are as follows:
Pawnbroking: 
Pawnbr oking 	is	a	loan	secur ed	against	 a 	collateral	 (the	pledge). 	In	the	 case	 of 	 the	 Gr oup 	 over	 95%	 of	 the	 collaterals 	 against 	 which	
amounts are lent is jewellery made of gold, precious metals and/or diamonds. The pawnbroking contract is a six month credit 
agreement bearing a monthly average interest rate of 8%. The contract is governed by the terms of the Consumer Credit Act 2008 
(previously the Consumer Credit Act 2002). If the customer does not redeem the goods by repaying the secured loan before the end of 
the contract, the Group is required to dispose of the goods either through public auctions if the value of the pledge is over £75 (disposal 
proceeds being reported in this segment) or, if the value of the pledge is £75 or under, through public auctions or the Retail or 
Pawnbr oking 	scrap 	activities 	 of	 the	Gr oup.
Gold purchasing: 
Jewellery	is	bought	dir ect	 fr om	customers	thr ough	all	 of	the	 Gr oup’ s 	 stor es	 and 	 mor e 	 r ecently 	 thr ough	 45 	 GoldBar	 units 	 located 	 in 	
shopping centres throughout England and Wales. The transaction is simple with the store or unit agreeing a price with the customer and 
pur chasing 	the 	goods	for	cash 	on	the 	spot. 	 Gold	Pur chasing	 r evenues	 comprise	 pr oceeds 	 fr om 	 scrap 	 sales	 on 	 goods	 sour ced 	 fr om	the	
Group’s purchasing operations.
Retail: 
The Group’s retail proposition is primarily gold and jewellery and the majority of the retail sales are forfeited items from the pawnbroking 
pledge book or purchased second-hand jewellery. The retail offering is complemented with a small amount of new jewellery purchased 
from third parties by the Group.
Pawnbroking scrap: 
Pawnbr oking 	scrap 	comprises 	 all	 other	pr oceeds	 fr om	gold 	 scrap	sales	 other	 than 	 those 	 r eported	 within	 Gold	 pur chasing. 	 The 	 items	ar e 	
either damaged beyond repair, are slow moving or surplus to the Group’s requirements, and are smelted and sold at the current gold 
spot price less a small commission.
Cheque cashing: 
This segment comprises two products:
•	 Thir d 	Party	Cheque	Encashment 	which	 is	the	pr ovision	 of 	cash 	in 	 exchange 	 for 	 a	 cheque	 payable	 to	 our 	 customer	 
for a commission fee based on the face value of the cheque.
•	 	 Pay 	 Day 	 Advance	 which	 is 	a	 simple	 form	 of	cr edit 	wher e 	 the	 advance 	 is	 r epaid 	 by	 post 	 dated 	 cheques	 pr esented	 by	 the 	
customer at the point of the loan. The Group applies a 13% charge per 30 days on the value of the advance. At the end of the 
30 days, the customer has a choice to either extend the advance for another 30 days, repay the advance or allow the cheques 
to be deposited in the Group’s bank account.
Both products are subject to bad debt risk which is reflected in the commissions and fees applied.
  
Other financial services: 
This segment comprises:
•	 KwikLoan 	pr oduct	which	 is	an	unsecur ed	loan 	 r epayable	 over 	12 	 months 	 of	 up 	 to	 £750. 	 The 	 Gr oup	 ear ns 	 appr oximately	 £300	
gross interest on a £500 loan over 12 months.
•	 The 	 Pr epaid	debit	car d	pr oduct	 wher e	 the 	 Gr oup 	 ear ns	a	commission	 when 	 selling	 the	 car d 	 or	 when	 the	 customer	 is	 topping 	 
up their card.
•	 The 	 for eign 	exchange	 curr ency 	(Eur o	 and 	US	 Dollar)	 service	wher e 	 the	 Gr oup 	 ear ns	 a	 commission 	 when	 selling	 or	 buying	 for eign 	
currencies. This service is currently on trial in a limited number of stores.
Only the KwikLoan product is subject to bad debt risk which is reflected in the interest rate offered.

As disclosed in note 3, Gross profit is stated after charging bad debt expenses and the direct costs of stock items sold or scrapped in 
the period. Other operating expenses of the stores are included in other direct expenses. The Group is unable to meaningfully allocate 
the other direct expenses of operating the stores between segments as the activities are conducted from the same stores, utilising the 
same assets and staff. The Group is also unable to meaningfully allocate Group administrative expenses, or financing costs or income 
between the segments. Accordingly, the Group is unable to meaningfully disclose an allocation of items included in the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income below Gross profit, which represents the reported segment results. 
The Group does not apply any inter-segment charges when items are transferred between the pawnbroking activity and the retail  
or scrap activities. H&T Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 48

(b) f actors affecting the tax charge for the year
The tax assessed for the year is higher than that resulting from applying a blended standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 28% 
(2009 – 28%). The differences are explained below:
 2010 2009
 £’000 £’000

  Adjustments to tax charge in respect of previous periods  158 (31)
Total actual amount of tax charge 8,316 5,168
In addition to the amount charged to the income statement, £31,000 (2009: £110,000) relating to tax has been recognised in other 
comprehensive income. This is relating to the deferred tax on share options taken directly to equity.
13. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
For 	diluted 	 ear nings	per	shar e, 	 the	 weighted	average	 number	of	or dinary	 shar es	 in 	 issue 	 is	 adjusted 	 to	 assume 	 conversion 	 of	 all 	 dilutive 	
potential ordinary shares. With respect to the Group these represent share options and conditional shares granted to employees where 
the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the year.
Reconciliations of the earnings per ordinary share and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below:

Stores acquired in 2010 19 –
 16,825 16,806
  
The Harvey & Thompson Ltd CGU was created when H&T Group plc acquired Harvey & Thompson Limited in September 2004. 
Management is unable to allocate this goodwill by store and accordingly, tests this for impairment at the subsidiary entity level, 
adjusted for the recoverable amount of CGU’s acquired after September 2004. All assets acquired after September 2004 are reviewed 
for impairment at the related store level. The stores are grouped for financial reporting purposes by year of acquisition to facilitate 
presentation and comparability on a year by year basis. Additionally, store performance is monitored by management based on  
the year of acquisition as the historic performance of an individual store is linked to its acquisition date. This approach is reflected  
in the way management has presented the above CGUs. 
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.  
The impairment review was conducted as described in note 4. H&T Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 54

The customer relationships intangible assets arise from the acquisition of trade and assets of sole partnerships or limited companies 
with no audited accounts and reflect the repeat business associated with the pawnbroking and pay day advance industry from existing 
customers at the acquisition date of the relevant assets. 
The amortisation period for customer relationship intangible assets is between 6 and 8 years and the amortisation period for software 
intangible assets is 7 years. These amortisation periods reflect the directors’ best estimate of the estimated useful economic lives of 
these intangible assets.

f air value
The assumptions used by the Group to estimate the current fair values are summarised below:
(i)	 	 For 	 trade	r eceivables	r elating 	to 	Pawnbr oking,	 the 	 fair	 value	has	 been 	 calculated	 by 	 adding:
•	 The 	principal 	outstanding	 on	pawn 	loans; 	
•	 The	inter est 	r eceivable	accrued	using 	 the 	 ef fective	 inter est 	 rate	method; 	 and
•	 Assumed 	 scrap	pr ofits	on	 the 	 pr oportion	 of	 the	 Gr oup’ s 	 pledge	 book 	 that	 is	 not 	 expected	 to	 be 	 r edeemed, 	 i.e. 	 those 	 loans	 
upon which the Group does not recognise interest due to the uncertainty of recovery.
(ii) Other trade receivables and other assets are considered to have fair values which are the same as their book values due to the 
short period over which they will be recovered. Book values for both cheque cashing and financial services trade receivables are 
calculated net of provisions, and hence represent the Group’s best estimate of recovery values based upon recent debt collections 
experience.
(iii) Cash and cash equivalents are all held on interest bearing bank accounts are considered to have a fair value the same as their  
book value. 
(iv)	 For 	 derivative	instruments,	the	 fair 	value 	has	been	calculated	 by	discounting	 the	 futur e 	 estimated 	 cash	 flows 	 based	 on 	 the	 applicable	
yield curve derived from quoted interest rates. 
(v)	 For 	 borr owings 	 and	trade	 and	other 	payables,	 the 	 book	value 	 appr oximates 	 to	 fair 	 value	 because 	 of	 their	 short	 maturities	 and	
interest rates where applicable. None of the trade or other payables are interest bearing. The borrowings are all held at floating 
interest rates which approximate market rates, and accordingly, the book value and fair value are the same.
The fair value of the interest rate derivative is determined by reference to a valuation model where the inputs are derived from publically 
available sources. This valuation therefore falls within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy in IAS39. The fair value of the pawnbroking trade 
receivables is determined using a model where the inputs are derived from historical trends monitored by the group. This valuation 
therefore falls within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy in IAS 39. The fair value of all other financial instruments is equivalent to their book 
value due to their short maturities.
f inancial risks
The Group monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the financial instruments held. The principal risks include credit risk on 
financial assets, and liquidity and interest rate risk on financial liability borrowings. The key risks are analysed below.
Credit risk
Pawnbroking trade receivables
The Group is exposed to credit risk through customers defaulting on their loans. The key mitigant to this risk is the requirement for the 
borrower to provide collateral (the pledge) in entering a pawnbroking contract. The collateral acts to minimise credit risk as a customer’s 
pledge becomes the property of the pawnbroker on default of the loan. 
In addition to holding collateral, the Group further mitigates credit risk by:
i) Applying strict lending criteria to all pawn loans
	 Pledges	 ar e	rigor ously 	 tested	and 	 appr opriately 	 valued.	In 	 all 	 cases	 wher e 	 the 	 Gr oup	 lending 	 policy 	 is	 applied, 	 the	 value	 of	 the	
pledge items is in excess of the pawn loan.
The Group estimate that the current fair value of the collaterals value is £71,794,000 (2009: £54,764,000), which compares with the 
total book value of the pledge book plus associated accrued interest of £45,025,000 (2009: £43,496,000).
ii)  Seeking to improve redemption ratios:
	 For 	 existing	 customers,	loan	 history	 and	r epayment	 pr ofiles	ar e 	 factor ed	 into 	 the	 loan 	 making 	 decision. 	 The 	 Gr oup	 has	 a	 high 	
customer retention ratio and all customers are offered high customer service levels.
Given the current price of gold, a fall in redemption ratios is forecast to result in higher scrap profits more than offsetting the lost interest 
received. A 2% increase / decrease in the Group’s redemption ratio (i.e. default ratio) is estimated to impact the pre-tax profit by 
(£480,000) / £501,000. This does not account for lost repeat business however, and as such the Group sees more value in retaining  
a high redemption ratio.

26. Financial instruments (continued)
Credit risk (continued)
Pawnbroking trade receivables (continued)
Additionally, the Group is exposed to risk in recovery of the loan amounts, which is considered to be similar to credit risk, due to:
(i) assets being pledged as security against loans, which are subsequently seized by the police; 
(ii) assets being pledged as security against loans which are subsequently lost or stolen, resulting in the borrower being relieved  
of the liability to the Group.
The legal title that the Group can enforce on these items, and their ongoing security are therefore vital to the Group to ensure that the 
credit risk is mitigated to an acceptable level. The Group continually reviews and monitors, at both store and at Board level, its internal 
controls to ensure the adequacy of the pledged items. The key aspects of this are:
•	 Appr opriate 	details	ar e	kept 	on	all	 customers	 the 	 Gr oup 	 transacts	with;
•	 All 	pawn 	 contracts 	 comply	with 	the	 Consumer	Cr edit	 Act 	 2006;
•	 Appr opriate	physical	security 	measur es	ar e	 in 	 place	 to 	pr otect 	pledged 	 items;

The Group has not provided for the £10,131,000 (2009 – £10,369,000) contractually overdue receivables (i.e. loans where the pawn 
agreement has terminated but the customer has not redeemed the assets) at the reporting date since the realisable value of the 
collaterals held is greater than the carrying value of the pledge loan as disclosed above. The Group does not start the disposition 
process of the unredeemed pledges until three months after the end of the credit agreement since it is commercial practice to allow 
additional time for the customers to come and redeem their pledged items, for an additional fee. 
The maximum exposure to credit risk would be £45,025,000 (2009 – £43,496,000), being the gross carrying amount net of any 
amounts offset and any impairment losses. H&T Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 62

including credit checks, obtaining legal security provided and appropriate staff recruitment and training policies. The Group monitors the 
ongoing risk associated with this class of financial assets through a continual review of bad debts, modifications to the lending policy, 
and internal audit activities. In the event of default by the customer, the Group has also developed a debt collection department to 
recover any outstanding debt.

The Group has no overdue receivables at the reporting date (2009: none). Trade receivables not overdue are provided for based on 
estimated irrecoverable amounts determined by reference to past default experience. 
Cash and cash equivalents
The cash and cash equivalents balance comprises both bank balances and cash floats at the stores. The bank balances are subject to 
very limited credit risk as they are held with banking institutions with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies. 
The cash floats are subject to risks similar to any retailer, namely of theft or loss by employees or third parties. These risks are mitigated 
by the security systems, policies and procedures that the Group operates at each store, the Group recruitment and training policies and 
the internal audit function. 
The concentration of bank balances by counterparty financial institution are as follows:
 Credit 2010 2009

Cash at stores –  1,743 1,687
  4,029 2,221
Derivative financial instruments 
The credit risk on derivative financial instruments is limited because of the high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating 
agencies to the Group’s bankers.
The Group has no exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date on the derivative financial instruments as the fair value positions  
are payable.

26. Financial instruments (continued)
Market risk
Pawnbroking trade receivables
The collateral which protects the Group from credit risk on non-redemption of pawn loans is 96% (2009 – 99%) comprised of gold and 
jewellery items. The value of these items as security is directly linked to the price of gold. The Group is therefore exposed to adverse 
movements in the price of gold on the value of the security that would be attributable for sale in the event of default by the borrower. 
The 	Gr oup 	 considers	this	 risk	to 	be	limited 	for	a	 number	of	r easons. 	 First	of	all,	the	Gr oup 	applies 	conservative	lending	policies	 in 	
pawnbroking pledges reflected in the margin made on scrap gold when contracts forfeit. The value of gold for our customers is also 
much greater than the price of gold since jewellery items contain a retail margin. The Group is also protected due to the short term value 
of the pawn contract (6 months). In the event of a significant drop in the price of gold, the Group could mitigate this risk by reducing its 
lending policy on pawnbroking pledges or by entering gold hedging instruments. Management monitors the gold price on a constant 
basis. 	Based	on 	the	price	 of	gold 	on	2	February 	2011,	the	 Gr oup 	 estimates	that	a	36% 	 fall	in	the	price	of	gold	would	 be 	 r equir ed 	for	 the	
pledge collateral to no longer support the value of the pawn loans and associated accrued interest. The directors are of the opinion that 
a decrease of this magnitude is highly unlikely.
Considering areas outside of those financial assets defined under IAS 39, the Group is subject to higher degrees of pricing risk.  
The price of gold will affect future Group profitability in three key ways:
i) A lower gold price will adversely affect the scrap disposition margins on existing stock, whether generated by pledge book forfeits or 
via the Group’s purchasing operations. While scrap profits will be impacted immediately, retail margins may be less impacted in the 
short term. 
ii) While the Group’s lending and purchasing rates do not track gold price movements in the short term, any sustained fall in the price 
of gold is likely to cause lending and purchasing rates to fall in the longer term thus potentially reducing future profitability as:
a. the size of the pledge book and associated yield is directly linked to lending rates, and
b. assuming constant disposition margins, absolute disposition profits would decrease as lending and purchasing rates decrease 
iii) A lower gold price may reduce the attractiveness of the Group’s gold purchasing operations.
Conversely, a lower gold price may dampen competition as lower returns are available and hence this may assist in sustaining margins.
Liquidity risk
Borrowings & derivatives
The Group has significant borrowings exposing it to liquidity risk in both repayment of borrowings and availability of finance.  
In order to mitigate this risk, the Group uses a mixture of short-term and long-term debt finance with banking institutions with high 
credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies. The current borrowings are disclosed in detail in note 22, which shows 
that the Group has arrangements in place to ensure sufficient funding is in place until 2013 under the current agreements. At 31 
December 	2010,	the	 Gr oup	 also 	has	 available 	 £17,146,000	(2009:	£2,215,000)	of 	 undrawn 	 committed 	borr owing 	facilities	in	r espect 	 
of which all conditions precedent had been met. This level of headroom is considered sufficient to finance operations at the current level, 
and as described in note 22, the Group is able to draw increased debt toward the £50 million total facility size dependent on the pledge 
balance. 	 Furthermor e,	as	 shown	 in 	 note	30,	 the	business	 generates	a	positive 	cash	flow	fr om	 operating	activities	and	has 	discr etion 	 in 	
its expansion programme should the Group need to improve short term cash flow.

The amounts reported above for floating rate borrowings include the principal amount of borrowings as well as the interest payable on 
these borrowings. The floating rates used to predict the interest cash flows are based on the relevant LIBOR yield curve derived from 
quoted interest rates. The above amounts are contractual, undiscounted cash flows. 
Interest rate risk
Borrowings
The Group is funded based on a combination of equity and bank borrowings. The bank borrowings are all held at floating rates based 
on LIBOR. Accordingly the Group is exposed to cash flow risk through changes in the LIBOR rate impacting cash flows. 
The Group mitigates exposure to this interest rate risk through the use of a financial derivative instrument that fixes the 1 month LIBOR 
element of the interest cost of a portion of the bank loans to 2.63%. This swap was transacted with Barclays Bank plc on 19 August 
2009 	 and 	terminates	 on	31	 August	2012.	The	swap 	has	 a	 notional 	value	of	£34,000,000,	and	hence	 as	at 	 31	December	2010,	the	
Group was exposed to 1 month LIBOR movements on £3,000,000 of this amount which exceeds the borrowing figure at the year end. 
The 	fair	 value 	 of	the	 instrument	 at	31	 December	2009	 is	a	liability	of	£972,000	(see	note	23).	
Interest rate derivatives
As required by IAS 39, the Group measures the interest rate swaps at fair value at each balance sheet date. The Group does not apply 
hedge accounting. Accordingly, while the Group mitigates cash flow interest rate risk arising on the borrowings class through these 
instruments, the Group is exposed to fair value risk on the revaluation of the instrument. The sensitivity analyses below have been 
determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both the borrowings class and the interest rate derivatives class, as these are 
intrinsically 	linked.	For	floating	 rate 	 liabilities	(the	borr owings	class),	 the	analysis	is	pr epar ed 	 assuming	the	amount	 of 	liability	outstanding 	
at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year. A 1.0% increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk 
internally to key management personnel and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.

The impact of a change in interest rate has no material impact on finance costs due to the interest rate swap which covers the loan 
balance. The principal movements reflect the movement in fair value of the interest rate swap. Management intends to retain the interest 
rate swaps to maturity and replace them with similar instruments, as required under the loan agreements. Accordingly, the positive or 
adverse movements on the fair value of the hedging instrument will offset over the life of the instrument, though this may be in different 
financial reporting periods.
Financial assets
The Group is not exposed to significant interest rate risk on the financial assets, other than cash and cash equivalents, as these are  
lent at fixed rates, which reflect current market rates for similar types of secured or unsecured lending, and are held at amortised cost.
Cash and cash equivalents are exposed to interest rate risk as they are held at floating rates, although the risk is not significant  
as the interest receivable is not significant. H&T Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 66

Expected volatility 26.0% 24.7 %
Expected life 6.5 years 6.5 years
Risk-free rate 3.1% 2.7 %
Expected dividends 3.3% 3.3 %
The expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the share price of the H&T Group plc shares as an 
estimate of future votality. The expected life used in the model for both years has been adjusted, based on management’s best 
estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.

the 	r elated	 notes 	A	to	F . 	 The	 financial 	
reporting framework that has been applied 
in their preparation is applicable law and 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting 	Practice).
This report is made solely to the 
Company’s members, as a body, in 
accor dance 	with 	 Chapter	 3 	 of	Part 	16	 
of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we 
might state to the Company’s members 
those matters we are required to state 
to them in an auditors’ report and for 
no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other 
than the Company and the Company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work,  
for this report, or for the opinions we  
have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors  
and auditors
As 	 explained	 mor e 	fully 	in	the	Dir ectors’	
Responsibilities 	 Statement, 	the 	Dir ectors 	
are responsible for the preparation  
of the parent company financial 
statements and for being satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit and to express 
an opinion on the parent company 
financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing 	 Practices 	Boar d’ s	 (APB’ s)	Ethical	
Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial 
statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence 
about the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements sufficient 
to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud 
or error. This includes an assessment 
of: whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the parent company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently

A. Accounting policies
basis of preparation
The Company financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards. They have all 
been applied consistently throughout the current and preceding financial year.
The 	 financial	 statements 	 have	been 	 pr epar ed	on	a 	going	concer n 	 basis 	 as	 discussed 	 in 	 the 	 Dir ectors’ 	 Report.
The particular accounting policies adopted are described below.
accounting convention
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention.
Taxation
Current UK corporation tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Where tax losses are surrendered to, or received from, group companies, 
the amount received/surrendered is charged/credited to the profit and loss account and treated as payable to/receivable from the 
related group party that has surrendered/received the losses.
Deferr ed 	tax 	 is	r ecognised	 in 	 r espect 	 of 	 all	timing	dif fer ences 	 that	 have	 originated 	 but 	 not 	 r eversed	 at	 the	 balance 	 sheet	 date 	 wher e	
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred 
at the balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the Company’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the 
financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are 
recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only to the extent that, on the basis of all available 
evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the 
underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferr ed 	tax 	 is	measur ed	 at	the 	 average 	 tax	 rates 	that 	ar e	 expected	to	 apply	 in 	 the	 periods	 in 	 which	 the	 timing 	 dif fer ences 	 ar e	 expected	
to 	r everse,	based	on 	tax	 rates 	and	 laws	 that 	have	 been 	 enacted	or	substantively 	 enacted 	 by 	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date.	 Deferr ed 	 tax	 is	
measured on a non-discounted basis. 
Investments
Fixed	assets	investments	ar e	 shown	at 	cost	 less 	 pr ovision	 for	impairment.
f inancial liabilities and equity
Financial	liabilities	and	equity	 instruments	ar e 	 classified 	accor ding	to	 the	 substance	 of	 the	 contractual	 arrangements	 enter ed 	 into. 	 
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Dividends 
Dividends 	r eceivable	fr om	subsidiary 	undertakings 	 ar e 	r ecor ded 	 in 	 the	 pr ofit 	 and 	 loss 	 account 	 on 	 the	 date 	 that	 the	 dividend 	 becomes	
a 	binding	liability	on 	the 	subsidiary	 company .	 Under	 the 	 terms 	 of	FRS 	 6	 ‘Acquisitions	 and 	 mergers’,	 the	 Company	 r ecor ds 	 dividends 	
arising from pre-acquisition profit and loss reserves of its subsidiary undertaking in the profit and loss account and considers whether 
the distribution affects the carrying value of the investment in the subsidiary undertaking.
Dividends 	payable	ar e	 r ecor ded 	 as	 a 	 distribution 	fr om 	 r etained	ear nings	 in 	 the	 period	 in 	 which	 they 	 become 	 a 	 binding	 liability	 
on the Company.
Related party transactions
The 	 Company 	has	taken	 advantage 	 of	the 	 exemption	 contained	 in 	 FRS	 8,	 ‘Related 	 Party	 Disclosur es’,	 available 	 to	 par ent 	 Company’ s	
presenting single company financial statements together with the consolidated Group financial statements of the Group headed by 
the Company, not to disclose transactions with entities that are part of the group headed by H&T Group plc or investees of the group 
qualifying as related parties. 
There are no other related party transactions of the Company that require disclosure.
Cash flow statement
The Company is the parent company in the H&T Group plc group, which prepares consolidated financial statements, including a cash 
flow 	statement,	 which	ar e	publicly	available. 	Consequently , 	under 	the	 terms	 of	 FRS	 1,	 ‘Cash	 Flow	 Statements’,	 the	 Company 	 has	not	
prepared a cash flow statement. H&T Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 77

A. Accounting policies (continued)
Share options 
The Company’s trading subsidiary, Harvey & Thompson Limited issues share options to employees in that Company, which are equity 
settled in shares of H&T Group plc. Harvey & Thompson Limited determines the fair value of the options granted measured at the date 
of grant by use of a Black-Scholes model or a Stochastic model depending on the vesting conditions attached to each scheme. This 
fair value cost of equity-settled awards is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period in the financial statements of Harvey 
& Thompson Limited, based on the estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of any non market-based 
vesting conditions. 
The Company receives a payment each period, equal to the annual expense recorded in Harvey & Thomson Limited calculated  
on the basis described above. This amount is credited to the profit and loss account each period and is treated in a similar manner  
to a distribution of dividends from Group companies.
B. Company profit and loss account
No profit and loss account is presented for the parent company pursuant to section 408 of Companies Act 2006.
The Company made a loss after taxation of £210,000 in 2010 (2009 – £12,751,000 profit). The key movement, year on year,  
r elates 	to 	dividend 	income 	 of	 £13,000,000 	 r eceived	 fr om 	 H&T	Finance	Ltd	in	2009.
The auditors’ remuneration for the current and preceding financial years is borne by a subsidiary undertaking, Harvey & Thompson 
Limited. Note 8 to the Group financial statements discloses the amount paid in respect of the Company.
The directors did not receive any emoluments for their services to the company (2009 – £nil). Other than the directors, the Company 
has no employees in either financial year.

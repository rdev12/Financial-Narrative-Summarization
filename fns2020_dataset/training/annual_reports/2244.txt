Trade publishing continued to perform well including record US 
performance.  Retail is changing with more titles sold online or

and seven hardback UK bestsellers.  Operation Mincemeat was 
No 1 in both hardback and paperback fiction and Eat, Pray, 
Love was No 1 bestselling non-fiction book for 2010.  In the US, 
My Horizontal Life was in the top 10 of the New York Times non-
fiction bestseller list for e-books and remained during 2010 in 
the top 20 list for paperbacks.

Chairman’s Statement
The world, particularly in the West, is inching its way back to 
recovery, weighed down by public debt and fiscal imbalances 
in the aftermath of a financial crisis which has done lasting 
damage to business confidence. In the aftermath of the 
economic earthquake, a new world is emerging. 
At the same time, the publishing world is handling its own 
revolution. Digital competence is undermining old business 
models, spawning new ones and allowing major new forces to 
transform – or render irrelevant – traditional relationships.
Charles Darwin observed that “It is not the strongest of the 
species, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is 
the most adaptable to change”. Bloomsbury is undergoing one 
of the most significant periods of adaptation in its 25 year history. 
The Chief Executive’s Report covers the re-organisation 
of the Group to exploit the global horizons opened in the 
publishing industry by digital technology; the continued 
pace of acquisitions; the move into new premises later this 
year; the overhaul of key internal systems; and Bloomsbury’s 
adaptation to meet the needs of the growing population of 
e-readers who are provoking one of the most profound re-
assessments of the conventional publishing industry since the 
development of the printing press.
The Board of Bloomsbury Publishing Plc has also been  
re-positioned. 
Ian Cormack and Sarah Jane Thomson have joined the Board 
as non-Executive Directors following the retirement of Charles 
Black and Mike Mayer, and Wendy Pallot has joined the Board 
as Group Finance Director replacing Colin Adams. 
Ian Cormack has had a successful City career in leading 
international and UK roles at AIG, Citigroup and Citibank, 
where he spent over thirty years. A former member of the 
Chancellor’s City Advisory Panel, he has served on committees 
for the London Stock Exchange, CHAPS, APACS, the European 
Securities Forum, Cedel and the Bank of England. Ian Cormack 
is Senior Independent Director of Bloomsbury and Chair of 
the Audit Committee. He brings to Bloomsbury the experience 
and discipline of a career with some of the finest corporate 
institutions in the world. 
Sarah Jane Thomson founded Thomson Intermedia Plc in 
1997 (now Ebiquity Plc), a media information business using 
internet and technology to capture and deliver real-time 
advertising creatives and expenditure data for businesses. The 
company was floated on AIM in 2000 and she remains on the 
Board. In 2006 she founded First News, the weekly newspaper 
for children which has become the most widely read children’s 
“The publishing world is handling 
its own revolution. Digital 
competence is undermining old 
business models, spawning new 
ones and allowing major new forces 
to transform – or render irrelevant 
– traditional relationships.”

publication in the UK and she continues to be actively involved 
in driving the business forward. Her other roles include: 
founder of Priority One, an IT outsourcing business, serving 
medium size businesses in Central London and joint CEO of 
Addictive Interactive a newly launching Social Network for 
brands. Sarah Jane Thomson is Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee. She brings to Bloomsbury the experience, 
forward-looking vision, and sure intuition of a successful 
entrepreneur in the digital world. 
Wendy Pallot has joined the Board as Group Finance Director. 
Wendy Pallot is a graduate Chartered Accountant who 
qualified with Coopers & Lybrand with whom she spent 8 
years. She was Group Finance Director for GCap Media plc, the 
UK’s leading commercial radio operator and formerly listed 
on the UK Main Market, from 2005 until its takeover by Global 
Radio in 2008. She was Group Finance Director of GWR Group 
plc, a leading UK radio operator formerly listed on the UK Main 
Market, from 2001 until its merger with Capital Radio plc in 
2005 to form GCap Media plc. She brings to Bloomsbury a fresh 
perspective and a capacity for change.
This mix of new talent and experience on the Board – three 
new members on a Board of six – should not be under-
estimated. It will be invaluable. 
The departure of Colin Adams as Group Finance Director 
deserves special comment. His firm, steady and comprehensive 
grasp of the financial reins, and his understanding of the 
business, saw the Group through a momentous period of 17 
years in its history. The Board and the entire complement of 
Bloomsbury wish him well in his new job.
Charles Black and Mike Mayer stepped down from the Board 
during 2010 after a long service, during which they both 
contributed immensely to the success of the Group.
With the injection of new blood to our senior and middle 
management through acquisitions and recruitment, and 
the depth of the Group in a well-established and long-
serving work-force, Bloomsbury and its stakeholders are 
well equipped for the continued transformation in the next 
stage of the revolution in this industry and the geo-political 
upheaval in the world in which it operates.
The people who work for Bloomsbury are amongst the best 
in the business. The success of the Group in meeting the 
formidable challenges of the past, and in ensuring a profitable 
future, is down to them. The whole team are focused on the 
challenge and opportunities the group now faces. They have 
the thanks and gratitude of the Board, its shareholders and all its 
stakeholders for their untiring and enthusiastic commitment.
Jeremy Wilson 
Chairman

Chief Executive’s Statement
Overview
Bloomsbury has changed its year end to 28 February 2011 
as previously reported, so these results are in respect of the 
fourteen months ended on that date. We reported interim 
results for the twelve months ended 31 December 2010 on  
28 February 2011. Figures given below in relation to the twelve 
months ended 31 December 2010 are unaudited.
Bloomsbury’s results for the fourteen month period ended  
28 February 2011 demonstrate not only the strength of our 
revenue streams but also the adaptability of Bloomsbury 
which allows the Group to continue to grow in a difficult, but 
dynamic and opportunistic, external environment. This ability 
is largely centred on our small but strong, proactive and 
entrepreneurial management team, who not only continue to 
excel in traditional publishing but are also establishing a highly 
successful digital strategy. 
A good performance during the fourteen month period was 
particularly strengthened by an excellent final quarter of 2010. 
The two months ended 28 February 2011 were, as forecast, 
seasonally quiet months delivering a small trading loss in line 
with expectations and our experience in previous years.
In 2010 and into 2011 we have, in particular, seen significant 
growth in e-book sales. The US market continues to lead this 
trend, although since the last quarter of 2010, the UK has 
also begun to experience a surge in demand. Bloomsbury’s 
e-book sales rose from £79,000 in 2009 to £1.5m in 2010 and 
sales in January to March 2011 were £1.1m. UK and US e-book 
sales are both growing apace, and with the Kindle now 
firmly established in the UK market and recently launched 
in Germany, there is now a focused effort to sell e-books 
throughout the world.
Financial Performance
On 1 March 2011, Bloomsbury reorganised its structure into 
four worldwide publishing divisions: Adult; Children’s & 
Educational; Academic & Professional; and Information. We 
have also created two global service divisions for Sales & 
Marketing and Production. These changes were made in order 
to align the Group’s structure with the increasing globalisation 
of the publishing business and the growing demand for digital 
content. For the fourteen months to 28 February 2011, the 
Group was managed on the previous geographic lines, so this 
report reflects that configuration, reviewing performance 
within Trade and Specialist divisions across the UK, North 
America and Continental Europe. 
“Bloomsbury’s results for the 
fourteen month period ended 
28 February 2011 demonstrate 
not only the strength of our 
revenue streams but also the 
adaptability of Bloomsbury which 
allows the Group to continue to 
grow in a difficult, but dynamic 
and opportunistic, external 
environment.”

Chief Executive’s Statement
Chief Executive’s Statement
Revenue for the Group for the fourteen month period to  
28 February 2011 was £103.4m (12 months ended 31 December 
2009: £87.2m). Revenue for the year to 31 December 2010 was 
up 4% to £90.7m (2009: £87.2m). Revenues from the UK for the 
fourteen month period were £70.6m (2009: £58.9m). Revenues 
from the US were £21.7m (2009: £18.8m). Revenues from 
Continental Europe generated by Berlin Verlag were £10.1m 
(2009: £9.6m). Revenues from Bloomsbury Australia, which was 
launched on 1 January 2011, were £1.0m.
Profit before tax for the Group was £4.2m (2009: £7.1m). Profit 
before tax and highlighted items was £7.7m (2009: £7.7m). 
Highlighted items include the amortisation of intangible 
assets of £1.1m (2009: £0.6m), impairment of goodwill for 
Berlin Verlag of £1.5m (2009: £nil), costs of £0.3m (2009: £nil) 
relating to an aborted class one acquisition, restructuring 
costs of £0.2m (2009: £nil) and costs of £0.2m (2009: £nil) in 
relation to the relocation of the London offices as part of the 
Group’s reorganisation. We are due to move to a new London 
headquarters building in August 2011. This will enable the 
majority of Bloomsbury staff in the UK to operate from one 
building and bring the benefits of better integration of the 
publishing teams. The impairment of the goodwill in Berlin 
was made following a review of economic factors affecting the 
business. A new management team and structure is in place 
there now and a subsequent rationalisation of the publishing 
programme and reduction of the cost base has put the 
business on a firmer footing for the future. 
Basic earnings per share were 3.02 pence (2009: 6.77 pence). 
Basic earnings per share before highlighted items were 7.70 
pence (2009: 7.56 pence). Diluted earnings per share were 3.02 
pence (2009: 6.74 pence). Diluted earnings per share before 
highlighted items were 7.70 pence (2009: 7.53 pence).
At the period end the Group had net cash balances of £36.9m 
(2009: £35.0m). We continue to invest in future growth through 
acquiring new authors and titles as well as specialist publishing 
companies. Our strong balance sheet puts us in an excellent 
position to take advantage of these opportunities as they arise. 
As at 28 February 2011, the Group had 1,329 titles (31 December 
2009: 1,073) under contract for future publication, with a gross 
investment of £23.2m (2009: £23.7m). After payment of the initial 
tranches of advances to authors, our commitment for future 
cash payments on these contracted titles was £13.2m (2009: 
£13.4m).

In July 2010 Bloomsbury Academic won the contract to 
digitise and publish online on a subscription model the 
archive of Sir Winston Churchill. This nearly one million page 
archive will be launched in the second half of 2012. In April 
2011 we purchased the National Archive Book publishing 
programme from the National Archive, that includes an 
academic as well as a trade history list. 
The acquisition of Bristol Classical Press and Duckworth 
Academic in November 2010 has made Bloomsbury Academic 
a major player in the field of classical scholarship by publishing 
important new research in Archaeology, Classics, Ancient 
History and Ancient Philosophy. 
Bloomsbury Professional published a number of major 
reference works in the period. Foremost of these were The 
Law and Practice Relating to Charities 4th ed., by Hubert 
Picarda QC which is the first major book to cover the sweeping 
new reforms in charities law, and Personal Injury Schedules 
– Calculating Damages 3rd ed. Our loose-leaf, Norfolk and 
Montagu on the Taxation of Interest and Debt Finance, 
was re-launched to great acclaim and this has led to a 24% 
increase in these loose-leaf subscribers and a more than 100% 
increase in revenue owing to the delivery of higher value 
content. Important to our success in 2011/12 is the launch of 
our new online service, and loose-leaf titles such as Norfolk 
and Montagu, with their established subscriber base, regular 
income stream and fast-changing content, which are ideally 
placed to capitalise on online delivery.
Our Core Tax Annual series continued to grow in 2010, 
with revenue up by 20% on the previous year. It will form 
the backbone of our new tax online service, which will be 
launched later in the year. The change of government in 2010, 
combined with an extra Finance Act, created significant tax 
publishing opportunities. As complex tax reforms are set to 
continue over the next few years, we can expect a continuing 
uplift for our tax publishing programme.
In 2011/12 we launch a new online professional service in 
the Republic of Ireland. The first modules will provide a 
comprehensive reference service for professionals specialising 
in tax and company law, with further modules in other core 
subject areas to follow.
Under Bloomsbury’s ownership, Berg Publishers produced 
the best performance in its trading history in the period. Sales 
were strongly boosted by the US co-publication of the Berg 
Encyclopedia of World Dress and Fashion with Oxford University 
Press. Along with the on-line Berg Fashion Library, it won three 
major awards. The first was the 2011 Dartmouth Medal, awarded

by the American Library Association who deemed it a “landmark 
of scholarship.” The second was the 2011 Frankfurt Book Fair 
Digital Award from the Independent Publishers Guild and the 
third the 2011 Bookseller FutureBook Award for Best Website.
In September 2011 Berg will relocate from Oxford to the new 
London head office, with clear advantages from reduced 
overheads and synergies from the closer integration of the 
Berg business with Bloomsbury’s visual arts list.
Methuen Drama and Faber & Faber Limited have just announced 
a new partnership to develop a drama digital content platform 
for libraries, teachers, students and researchers. Launching in late 
2012, Drama Online is the ultimate online resource for plays, critical 
analysis and performance. Drawing on the pre-eminent titles from 
Methuen Drama, Arden Shakespeare and Faber, Drama Online 
will offer a complete digital library of the most studied, performed 
and critically acclaimed plays from the last two and a half thousand 
years. In addition, it will provide expert student guidance in the form 
of scholarly notes, annotated texts, critical analysis and contextual 
information. Performance and practitioner texts from theory 
to backstage and acting guides, coupled with video and audio 
material, will make this an essential study tool meeting the full range 
of drama teaching needs.
Bloomsbury Information had an excellent financial period 
which saw the delivery of our key management services 
contracts with the Qatar Foundation through the successful 
launch of two new divisions of the Foundation: Bloomsbury 
Qatar Foundation Publishing (BQFP) and Bloomsbury Qatar 
Foundation Journals (BQFJ). BQFP publishes books in English 
and Arabic and was launched in April 2010 at a reception 
at Windsor Castle hosted by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II 
and attended by Her Highness Sheikha Mozah bint Nasser Al 
Missned, Consort of the Emir of Qatar and Chairperson of the 
Qatar Foundation. Since its launch, BQFP has published over 
40 titles including the Arabic translation of the worldwide 
bestseller The Gruffalo. It has acquired English language and 
translation rights to a number of novels from Arab writers 
including the two most recent winners of the International 
Prize for Arab Fiction, known as the ‘Arab Booker’ prize. 
In December the astronaut Buzz Aldrin’s inspiring talk to scientists 
meeting in Qatar marked the lift-off of BQFJ, the open-access, 
online, peer-reviewed, research journals publishing portal (www.
qscience.com). The launch journals include Sir Magdi Yacoub’s 
Aswan Heart Centre: Science and Practice, and journals about 
healthcare, librarianship, education and Islamic Studies.
The online financial best practice and information resource 
(www.qfinance.com) also saw sustained growth through the 
period achieving over 186,000 unique visitors per month by 
the end of February 2011.

Chief Executive’s Statement
Prospects for 2011/12 are positive as the new businesses 
develop. From 1 July, BQFP will take over the sales of 
Bloomsbury Group titles in the Arab World from Penguin 
Group. Other international business development 
opportunities are under active pursuit with additional internal 
resource being devoted to this aspect of the Division’s 
activities since the Group restructure in March 2011. 
UK Trade 
The Trade division continues to perform well. The strategy 
for the division has been to focus strongly on the titles with 
maximum commercial potential whilst keeping tight controls 
on the level of advance investment, continuing to identify new 
talented writers and promoting the “long tail” by acquiring 
established authors’ backlists in print and e-book format and 
moving titles to print on demand. 
In Adult the growth of our food list has been considerable 
with books published by high profile authors such as Hugh 
Fearnley-Whittingstall and Heston Blumenthal but also 
innovative new authors such as Niki Segnit with The Flavour 
Thesaurus. We continue to look for markets that are showing 
good growth and we have embarked on building a crime list 
of high quality writers who will deliver a book a year. Our ten-
year strategy of building a serious non-fiction list has matured. 
Concentration on the growth of our paperback list has paid 
off with a wide variety of bestselling books from the novels of 
Khaled Hosseini to The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie 
Society to Eat, Pray, Love and the books of Ben McIntyre.
The retail landscape is changing with more titles being sold 
online or through supermarkets, in e-book or print format. The 
impact of digitisation is becoming considerable and acquiring 
world English rights is of premier importance in the digital 
future. In the month of October 2010, e-books made up 42% of 
the US sales of our Man Booker Prize winner, The Finkler Question.
During the period we have had seven hardback bestsellers 
in the UK including Alex’s Adventures in Numberland by 
Alex Bellos, The Flavour Thesaurus by Niki Segnit, which was 
the winner of a design award, MI6: The History of the Secret 
Intelligence Service 1909-1949 by Keith Jeffery, Operation 
Mincemeat by Ben McIntyre, Just Kids by Patti Smith, River 
Cottage Everyday by Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and The 
Finkler Question by Howard Jacobson. We also had three 
paperback bestsellers, Eat, Pray, Love and Committed by 
Elizabeth Gilbert, and Operation Mincemeat, in the Sunday 
Times list. Operation Mincemeat was number one in both 
hardback and paperback and Eat, Pray, Love was the number 
one bestselling non-fiction book in the year of 2010, occupying 
first place for 23 consecutive weeks.

Chief Executive’s Statement
Chief Executive’s Statement
Howard Jacobson won the Man Booker Prize, and Patti Smith won 
the National Book Award. We continue to identify and acquire 
books that are adopted for the Richard & Judy and TV Bookclub 
promotions. No and Me, Operation Mincemeat and Major 
Pettigrew’s Last Stand were adopted as Richard & Judy picks and 
The Bed I Made and Even the Dogs as TV Bookclub choices.
The 2011/12 year started well with the paperback edition of 
Alex’s Adventures in Numberland and The Good Book: A Secular 
Bible by AC Grayling. Highlights of the year ahead include 
the paperback of The Finkler Question, a new book in the 
summer from Ben Schott, Schott’s Quintessential Miscellany, 
and Rip Tide, a thriller by the ex chief of MI5, Stella Rimington. 
Non-fiction highlights for the autumn include the new title in 
the River Cottage series, River Cottage Everyday Veg by Hugh 
Fearnley-Whittingstall, Heston Blumenthal’s Heston at Home 
and How to Bake by Paul Hollywood.
In Children’s & Educational The Graveyard Book by Neil Gaiman 
won the Carnegie Medal in June 2010 and was the first book to 
win both the Newbury and the Carnegie Medals. Chains by Laurie 
Halse Anderson was also shortlisted for the Carnegie medal – 
giving Bloomsbury Children’s two out of the eight shortlisted 
titles. Grass by Cathy McPhail won the 12–16 year category for 
the Royal Mail Scottish Book Award in February 2011. Mortlock by 
Jon Mayhew and A Beautiful Lie by Irfan Master were shortlisted 
for The Waterstone’s Children’s Book Prize in January 2011. Terry 
Deary’s Put Out the Light, published in September 2010, has been 
shortlisted for the Sheffield Children’s Book Award 2011. The 
Wombles made a successful return to print, 40 years after the first 
book by Elizabeth Beresford was published, in November 2010. 
A children’s publishing agreement was signed with London 
Zoo to create a bespoke book programme for them; the first 
books will be published in September 2011. 
J.K. Rowling won the Hans Christian Andersen Literature Prize 
in October. The Harry Potter series was reissued in paperback 
with a stunning new livery for a new generation of readers. It 
was published alongside the release of the film of Harry Potter 
and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 in November 2010. Sales of the 
boxed set continued to be particularly strong. Part 2 of this film 
will be released in July 2011. 
We have just announced the establishment of Bloomsbury 
Reader, a new digital global publisher, in partnership with 
the Rights House, one of Britain’s leading literary agencies. 
The aim of this business is to make available books that are 
in copyright but currently unavailable in print, as e-books 
and print-on-demand throughout the world. The first list 
to be published in September 2011 has 500 titles by authors 
including Alan Clark, Ivy Compton-Burnett, Monica Dickens, 
Angela Huth, Roy Jenkins, Edith Sitwell and Alec Waugh, most 
of whom have not been published by Bloomsbury before.

Chief Executive’s Statement
Bloomsbury’s Public Library Online project continues to 
help libraries offer to their communities cost effective online 
access to books from a wide range of publishers thereby 
helping them retain their valued place at the core of a literate 
society. The service has maintained a 100% renewal rate and is 
currently available through 18 UK library authorities reaching 
7.3m of the UK population. Based on the success of the service 
in the UK and its scalability, Public Library Online has now been 
launched in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Germany 
and Scandinavia.
US
The US turned in a record performance for the period and all 
divisions had marked success. With the addition of new e-book 
agreements, most notably with Barnes & Noble, e-book sales 
increased significantly throughout the year, and Bloomsbury 
had its first two e-book bestsellers on the newly established 
New York Times  e-book bestseller list.
In Adult, My Horizontal Life, by Chelsea Handler, remained in 
the top 20 on the New York Times trade paperback non-fiction 
bestseller list every week during 2010, while the e-book of My 
Horizontal Life was in the top 10 of the New York Times non-
fiction e-book bestseller list that was established in the last 
quarter of 2010. The US Adult division published The Finkler 
Question, and it became an immediate print and e-book 
bestseller when published in October, appearing each week 
thereafter in 2010 on the New York Times trade paperback fiction 
bestseller list, and several weeks on the e-book bestseller list. 
Professional and Academic sales grew solidly throughout the 
year in the US, and the Methuen and Arden Shakespeare lists 
are now well-established there as leading publishers of drama. 
A&C Black’s book on Alexander McQueen, the first book 
published following his death, was a big success. 
The Children’s list had numerous successes including Captivate, 
Carrie Jones’s sequel to her paranormal blockbuster Need. It 
reached number seven on the New York Times bestseller list. Rules 
of Attraction, the follow up to Simone Elkeles’s 2009 bestseller 
Perfect Chemistry, also appeared on the Times list – reaching the 
number three spot – and placed on the USA Today and Publishers 
Weekly bestseller lists as well. Hearts at Stake, by Alyxandra Harvey, 
the first in a paranormal romance series published in January, has 
shipped more than 50,000 copies, and with the subsequent 2010 
releases of Blood Feud in July and Out for Blood in December, the 
series now has over 100,000 copies in print.
Germany
The overall German retail book market showed no growth 
in 2010, and Berlin Verlag’s sales reflected that. A film tie-in 
paperback edition of Elizabeth Gilbert’s Eat, Pray, Love hit the 
top of the bestseller list, as did a biography of Berthold Beitz, 
one of Germany’s most important industrialists during the 
post-war era. Strong sales of Khaled Hosseini’s The Kite Runner 
and A Thousand Splendid Suns ensured that backlist sales 
remained significant.

Chief Executive’s Statement
Chief Executive’s Statement
Profitability improved considerably as a result of having 
moved the print contract for the paperback list to the UK, 
where costs are lower.
Berlin Verlag e-books were launched in the autumn, and 
following Amazon’s entry into the market in Germany in the 
spring of 2011 we expect significant growth in this area.
Berlin Academic was launched in the spring of 2010 with the aim 
of providing a digital platform for academic publishers, and has 
made good progress in negotiations with potential clients.
At the end of February 2011 Berlin Verlag was renamed as 
Bloomsbury Verlag as part of the corporate restructuring.
Management
On 28 May 2010 Sarah Jane Thomson was appointed as 
an Independent non-executive Director and Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee. Sarah replaced Charles Black who 
stepped down from the Board on 28 May 2010. Ian Cormack was 
appointed as Independent non-executive Director on 1 January 
2011 and also became the Senior Independent Director and 
Chair of the Audit Committee on that date. Ian Cormack replaces 
Mike Mayer who stepped down from the Board on 31 December 
2010. I would like to thank Charles and Mike for their long and 
distinguished service to the Board of Bloomsbury and their 
immeasurable contribution to the Company over many years. 
Wendy Pallot joined the Group as Group Finance Director on  
8 April 2011. We thank Colin Adams for his support and 
contribution over 17 years as Group Finance Director.
Current trading, developments and prospects
Since the period end, trading within the UK has remained 
strong, although overseas markets are currently weaker, 
in part reflecting the weakness in their respective retail 
book markets. The strength in the UK list at the moment is 
evidenced by titles such as Anthony Grayling’s The Good Book, 
the paperback editions of Howard Jacobson’s The Finkler 
Question and Kate Summerscale’s The Suspicions of Mr Whicher, 
Raymond Blanc’s Kitchen Secrets, The River Cottage Baby 
and Toddler Cookbook, and the Orange Prize shortlisted The 
Memory of Love by Aminatta Forna. 
This is an exciting time for Bloomsbury: e-book demand 
is increasing significantly; it will change the publishing 
business model creating one worldwide market. The recent 
organisational change is already bringing benefits to the Group, 
enabling us to better exploit that worldwide market as a global 
publisher in print and digital. During 2011/12 these benefits will 
be enhanced by the move into our new headquarters building 
in Bedford Square, London. We have a strong balance sheet and 
an excellent management team, so are well placed to exploit 
future opportunities as we enter our 25th anniversary year.

Financial Review
Results for the fourteen months ended  
28 February 2011
The figures given below are for the fourteen month period ended 
28 February 2011 unless otherwise indicated. Figures given below 
in relation to the twelve months ended 31 December 2010 are 
unaudited.
Profit before tax for the fourteen month period was £4.2m  
(2009: £7.1m). Profit before tax and highlighted items was £7.7m 
(2009: £7.7m). For the twelve month period to 31 December 
2010 profit before tax and highlighted items was £8.4m (2009: 
£7.7m). Due to the cyclicality of the business the operation 
typically makes a loss in January and February.
Revenue for the Group for the fourteen month period was 
£103.4m (2009: £87.2m). Revenue for the twelve month period 
ended 31 December 2010 was £90.7m (2009: £87.2m). 
Segmental analysis
Until March 2011 the Group was managed on a geographic 
basis and the segmental analysis presented in these financial 
statements reflects that structure. Revenue in the UK was 
£70.6m (2009: £58.9m). The revenue increase was primarily 
due to the success of the Adult list and the full period’s trading 
of Bloomsbury Professional which was acquired in July 2009. 
During the fourteen month period we enjoyed seven hardback 
bestsellers in the UK. Unadjusted profit before investment 
income, finance costs, tax and central cost recharge income 
in the UK was £4.9m (2009: £6.3m). Profit before highlighted 
items, investment income, finance costs, tax and central cost 
recharge income in the UK was £6.7m (2009: £6.9m). US revenue 
was £21.7m (2009: £18.8m). E-book sales continued to gather 
momentum into the new year along with re-orders of core 
backlist titles. Profit in the US before investment income, finance 
costs, tax and central costs recharged from the UK was £1.2m 
(2009: £0.5m). For Continental Europe, revenue, which was 
generated by Berlin Verlag, was £10.1m (2009: £9.6m). Berlin 
was operating in a difficult market during 2010 but generated 
a profit before highlighted items, investment income, finance 
costs, tax and central costs recharged from the UK in the six 
months to 31 December 2010. The loss in Berlin for the fourteen 
month period before highlighted items, investment income, 
finance costs, tax and central costs recharged from the UK was 
£0.5m (2009: loss £0.6m). 
Within the geographical locations, the Group’s divisional structure 
is split into three main operating areas: Children’s, Adult and 
Reference publishing. Under this structure Children’s and Adult 
form the Trade publishing division, and Reference the Specialist 
publishing division. All three divisions operated in the UK, US and 
Germany. For the fourteen month period the breakdown of 
revenue between the three areas was: Children’s 22% (2009: 26%), 
Adult 46% (2009: 44%) and Reference 32% (2009: 30%).
Revenue in Children’s was £22.8m (2009: £23.0m). Although 
there were fewer bestselling titles during the period, the 
backlist performed well on the back of the film Harry Potter 
and the Deathly Hallows part 1 and the release of the Harry 
Potter series with a new jacket design. The demand for the 
paperback box set over the Christmas period also continued 
into the New Year. Contribution before administrative 
expenses was £7.9m (2009: £8.4m). 
Adult revenue was £47.8m (2009: £37.9m). As previously 
mentioned, the Adult division performed well during the 
period from a broad selection of new titles and existing backlist. 
The division was also the main beneficiary of e-book revenues 
during the period. The increase in gross profit margin was 
mainly due to lower provisions against unearned advances, 
decreased stock provisions and lower return levels. Contribution 
before administrative expenses was £17.3m (2009: £11.0m). This 
increase was mainly due to higher revenues and margin. 
Reference revenue increased to £32.8m (2009: £26.4m). The 
revenue growth was primarily due to the full fourteen month 
impact of the 2009 acquisitions of Tottel Publishing, renamed 
Bloomsbury Professional, and Hodder Education’s Higher 
Education Humanities list. Bristol Classical Press and Duckworth 
Academic, which were acquired in November 2010, have now 
been integrated into the Academic operation. Contribution 
before administrative expenses was £10.4m (2009: £8.6m).
Rights revenue, which includes subsidiary rights, electronic 
database income, management contracts and income 
derived from third-party agencies, was £8.1m (2009: £9.2m). 
The contribution attributable to this revenue was £6.5m (2009: 
£6.6m). The decrease in contribution on a like for like basis was 
due to higher revenue recognised in 2009 on the delivery of 
content under the QFCA contract which was not repeated in 
2010. £5.0m (2009: £4.9m) of the profit was generated in the 
Specialist Publishing Division and £1.5m (2009: £1.7m) was 
generated in the Trade Publishing Division.

Gross profit
Gross profit for the Group for the period was £53.1m (2009: 
£43.4m). Gross profit margin increased to 51.3% (2009: 49.7%). 
The increase in the gross profit margin was due to a number 
of factors including the fourteen months’ trading of the 
higher margin Bloomsbury Professional, acquired in July 2009, 
lower book returns rates in the UK and moving the paperback 
printing of Berlin’s business to the UK where the costs are lower. 
Royalty rates vary according to the type of books published 
in the year. Provisions against unearned advances charged 
to the Income Statement were £3.7m (2009: £3.4m) and 
represented 3.6% of revenues (2009: 3.9% of revenues). Books 
returned by customers are credited to the returns provision. 
There was no overall change in the returns provision during 
the period. There was a write-back to the Income Statement 
in 2009 of £0.58m. The stock provision charged to the Income 
Statement in respect of obsolescence (excluding write downs 
for items such as wastage) increased to £2.6m (2009: £2.2m) 
and represented 2.5% of revenues (2009: 2.5% of revenues).
Costs
Marketing and distribution costs for the period were £17.5m. For  
the twelve month period to 31 December 2010 they were £15.2m 
(2009: £15.4m). Administrative expenses before highlighted items 
for the period were £28.2m. For the twelve month period to  
31 December 2010 they were £24.7m (2009: £21.2m). On a like 
for like basis with 2009, £1.2m of increased overhead costs before 
central cost recharges relate to the additional six months’ 
overhead of Bloomsbury Professional, which was acquired in 
July 2009. In addition, share option charges for the twelve month 
period to 31 December 2010 increased to £0.8m (2009: £0.1m) 
and there were higher premises costs and professional fees as a 
result of credits in the year ended 31 December 2009. 
Highlighted items
Highlighted items for the fourteen month period include 
the amortisation of intangible assets of £1.1m (2009: £0.6m), 
impairment of goodwill of Berlin Verlag of £1.5m (2009: £nil), 
costs of £0.3m (2009: £nil) relating to an aborted class one 
acquisition, restructuring costs of £0.2m (2009: £nil) and costs 
of £0.2m (2009: £nil) in relation to the relocation of the London 
offices as part of the Group’s reorganisation. The move to the 
new offices in London is due to take place in August 2011. The 
increase in the amortisation is due to the full fourteen months’ 
charge on the prior year’s acquisitions and acquisitions 
and other additions in the period. The impairment of the 
goodwill in Berlin was made following a review of economic 
factors affecting Germany, in particular the weakness of the 
retail book market there. With a new management team and 
structure, there has been a rationalisation of the publishing 
programme and reduction of Berlin’s cost base as part of the 
plan to increase profitability in the business.
Investment income
Investment income for the fourteen month period was £0.4m 
(2009: £1.1m) as a result of lower interest rates and, to a lesser 
extent, lower average cash balances held during the fourteen 
month period. 2009 benefitted from the overhang of longer-
term deposits made in prior years at significantly higher 
interest rates.
Taxation
The Group’s effective tax rate for the fourteen months ending  
28 February 2011 was 47.2% (2009: 30.1%). The increase in the 
rate is primarily due to certain significant one-off items which 
reduce the Group’s pre-tax profits but which are not considered 
allowable expenses for corporation tax purposes. These one-
off highlighted items principally relate to an impairment of 
goodwill in respect of the Group’s Berlin operations of £1.5m 
(2009: £nil), fees incurred on an aborted class 1 transaction 
of £0.3m (2009: £nil) and costs associated with relocating the 
Group’s London head office of £0.2m (2009: £nil). 
The corporation tax charge for the period also includes 
the impact of the Group recognising a deferred tax asset of 
£0.4m, relating to previously unrecognised losses arising 
from the Group’s US operation, which partially offsets the de-
recognition of the deferred tax asset (of £0.7m) on the Group’s 
Berlin operation’s tax losses in prior periods. The adjusted 
underlying corporation tax rate for 2011 excluding the impact 
of these one-off items is 31.3%.

Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share were 3.02 pence (2009: 6.77 pence). 
Diluted earnings per share were 3.02 pence (2009: 6.74 pence). 
Basic earnings per share before highlighted items were 7.70 
pence (2009: 7.56 pence). Diluted earnings per share before 
highlighted items were 7.70 pence (2009: 7.53 pence).
Dividend
The Directors are recommending a final dividend of 0.28 
pence per share, which, subject to shareholder approval at 
our Annual General Meeting, will be paid on 27 September 
2011 to shareholders on the register at the close of business 
on 26 August 2011. This dividend is a 5% increase, pro rata for 
two months, on the dividend paid for the six months ending 
30 June 2010. Together with the interim and second interim 
dividend, this makes a total dividend for the 14 month period 
ended 28 February 2011 of 5.00 pence per share, a 13.0% 
increase on the total dividend for the year ended 31 December 
2009 of 4.43 pence per share. 
Balance sheet 
Intangible assets
Intangible assets were £37.2m (2009: £37.6m). The change was 
primarily due to the acquisition of Bristol Classical Press and 
Duckworth Academic in November 2010 and other additions 
(mainly software and publishing rights) less amortisation and 
the impairment of the goodwill relating to Berlin Verlag. 
The businesses and net assets of Bristol Classical Press and 
Duckworth Academic were acquired for a cash consideration 
of £1,100,000. The acquisition has been accounted for using the 
acquisition method of accounting. The goodwill of £28,000 and 
intangibles of £930,000 arising on the acquisition have been 
capitalised in the Group balance sheet.
Current assets
Inventories increased 12.1% to £18.3m (2009: £16.4m). The 
increase mainly reflects the higher revenues particularly in the 
second half of the year, business seasonality and stock at the new 
Australian subsidiary. The underlying stock holding has remained 
relatively stable over the last twelve months. On a like for like 
basis with 2009 there was no significant exchange movement on 
overseas stocks (2009: positive exchange movement of £0.6m).
Trade and other receivables increased 2.5% to £48.7m (2009: 
£47.5m). Trade receivables were £21.4m (2009: £21.6m). 
Since books sold are generally returnable by customers, the 
Group makes a provision against books sold in the accounting 
period. The unused provision at the period-end is then carried 
forward as an offset to trade receivables in the balance sheet, 
in anticipation of further book returns subsequent to the year 
end. A provision for the Group of £6.5m for future returns 
relating to 2010/11 and prior year sales (2009: £6.5m relating 
to 2009 and prior year sales) has been carried forward in 
trade receivables at the balance sheet date. This provision at 
margin represents 6.3% (2009: 7.5%) of revenues. Within trade 
and other receivables, prepayments and accrued income 
increased 7.1% to £27.2m (2009: £25.4m) mainly as a result of 
higher paid advances. Net provisions of £3.7m (2009: £3.4m) 
against advances to authors on titles published were made 
during the period.
 
Equity and liabilities
As at 28 February 2011 total equity stood at £111.9m (2009: 
£112.7m). The reduction was due to retained earnings 
reduction of £1.3m (2009: £1.9m increase) as a result of 
the profit for the period of £5.6m before highlighted items 
(2009: £5.6m), the highlighted items of £3.4m (2009: £0.6m), 
dividends of £3.3m (2009: £3.1m) and share buy-back of £0.2m 
(2009: £nil), a decrease in the translation reserve due to the 
translation loss on consolidation of the assets and liabilities 
of overseas subsidiaries in other comprehensive income of 
£0.4m (2009: £3.0m loss), and an increase in the share-based 
payment reserve due to the share-based payment charge for 
the fourteen months of £0.8m (2009: £0.1m).
Current liabilities increased 20.6% to £29.1m (2009: £24.2m). Trade 
payables increased to £9.2m (2009: £5.9m) due to increased 
payables for work in progress and trade payable for the stock 
acquired by the new Australian subsidiary. Accruals and deferred 
income, which is included in trade and other payables, increased 
20.8% to £18.6m (2009: £15.4m). Accruals and deferred income 
includes increased deferred income on database contracts, 
higher deferred subscription revenues and increased royalty 
payments to authors, which vary from year to year depending on 
revenue and the authors’ royalty rates, which typically escalate on 
triggered thresholds as sales increase. 
Cash flow
The Group had a net cash inflow from operating activities 
before tax of £11.0m for the fourteen months (2009: £2.6m 
cash outflow). This was mainly attributable to increased 
payables more than offsetting increased receivables. 
Corporation tax paid during the fourteen months was £2.8m 
(2009: £1.7m). During the fourteen months £0.4m (2009: 
£1.4m) of interest was received from deposits, and £3.3m 
(2009: £3.1m) of dividends were paid. £1.1m, net of cash 
acquired, was spent on the business acquired during the 
period (2009: £10.3m). The Group’s cash on the balance sheet 
as at 28 February 2011 was £36.9m (2009: £35.0m).

Risk Factors
Outlined below is a description of significant risk factors that 
management considers affect the Group’s business. Not 
all the factors are within management’s control and other 
factors besides those listed below could also affect the Group. 
Actions being taken by management to mitigate risk factors 
should be considered in conjunction with the cautioning 
note to shareholders in the Directors’ Report on page 29 with 
regards to forward looking statements. Details on financial risk 
management are given on page 97 in note 22.
Evolution of the market
Book publishing is entering a period of change that we 
anticipate will be transformational as consumers worldwide 
migrate from printed books to digital formats. Other 
changes are also impacting on high street bookshops. 
Amongst the actions taken by management to exploit the 
potential opportunities, with effect from March 2011 we have 
restructured the business ahead of the anticipated changes in 
the market into four separate worldwide publishing divisions 
each capable of adapting quickly to their specific markets. 
Significant risk factors:
 ● Demise of high street bookshop chains: Generalist high 
street bookshop retail chains across the World are facing 
strong competition from internet retailers and, particularly 
in the UK, alternative high street retail outlets such as 
supermarkets and news agents. Bloomsbury is not solely 
dependent on any one sales channel or distributor for trade 
sales. We anticipate sales lost to bookshops being substituted 
by sales made through the other channels such as internet 
and the alternative high street retailers. Bloomsbury has 
limited financial exposure to trade receivables owned / 
book stocks held by the high street bookshops should any 
fail financially (as explained in more detail in note 22). The 
changes being experienced by high street bookshops have 
limited impact on sections of Bloomsbury’s other sales such 
as to educational establishments where Bloomsbury already 
sells directly to the customer.
 ● Ascendency of internet retailers: The increasing 
significance of internet retailers provides opportunities 
to generate additional revenues by selling a wider range 
of titles. Marketing must be tailored to maximise the sales 
of books through the internet retailers. Internet retailers 
react quickly to changes in consumer demand and 
minimise their stock levels so require shorter lead times for 
the fulfilment of book orders. Bloomsbury has publishing 
and marketing teams specialised in working with the 
internet retailers. The Group subcontracts printing of 
books to world class suppliers that have capacity to 
accommodate ‘on-demand’ ordering whilst maintaining 
low costs.
 ● Digital e-books: Worldwide sales of personal electronic 
e-book readers such as Amazon’s Kindle and Apple’s iPad 
have grown rapidly. The rising number of consumers 
owning these devices is driving a strong surge in the 
demand for downloads of e-books especially for adult 
fiction and general non-fiction titles. Risks include 
that e-book downloads could substitute printed book 
purchases and that authors might be unwilling to sell 
both the digital and print publishing rights to the same 
publisher. Bloomsbury is well prepared and has for a 
number of years published books as e-books so has 
the teams and knowhow in place to capitalise on any 
sudden increase in demand for downloads. The Group 
sells its e-books through robust third party platforms and 
distributors such as Amazon.
 ● Ascendency of alternative high street retail outlets:  
Alternative retain outlet chains (such as supermarkets 
and news agents in the UK) focus on high volume sales 
of adult and children’s titles. Compared to the generalist 
high street bookshops, alternative retail outlet chains 
concentrate on smaller lists of best seller books. The 
larger alternative retail outlet chains have a stronger 
bargaining position and can demand greater discounts 
from publishers offset by increased sales volumes. 
The opportunities to realise high sales volumes drives 
competition between publishers to acquire the best 
titles of leading authors and celebrities. Bloomsbury 
has publishing teams that specialise in working with 
the alternative retail outlet chains, publishing experts 
who are effective at finding bestselling titles and strong 
controls over the acquisition of titles to ensure margins are 
protected and the risk of making acquisitions that do not 
perform as well as expected is minimised.
 ● Globalisation: The advent of internet retailers and digital 
e-books increases the opportunities to sell books into a 
global market. With effect from 1 March 2011, Bloomsbury 
has structured its business into four worldwide publishing 
divisions supported by a global sales function. Sales 
and publishing teams based at Bloomsbury’s local 
country offices ensure the local needs of authors and 
customers are supported. For printed books, the Group 
has developed a multinational network of high quality 
printers, distributors and partners capable of delivering 
books to customers quickly and at low cost worldwide.

Risk Factors Corporate Responsibility
 ● Copyright protection: The advent of e-books increases 
the existing risk of revenue being undermined by the 
unauthorised copying and publication of Bloomsbury’s 
books by third parties. Wide scale file sharing experienced 
by the music industry has not arisen as a major problem so 
far with e-books. Bloomsbury monitors, as do other parties, 
unauthorised publication of e-books on the internet 
and where discovered employs external specialists who 
effectively use the existing protocols with Internet Service 
Providers and others to have offending web pages and 
content removed. This ensures that illegal downloading 
is limited to a small proportion of titles and has a limited 
impact on sales.
Business systems and infrastructure 
There is a risk that the business infrastructure – including 
management information, production & delivery workflow 
and the network infrastructure – might not be capable 
of supporting the growth of the business. In particular, 
globalisation and growth of the business together with the 
increasing number of its digital content dependent assets 
places increasing dependency on Bloomsbury’s IT systems. 
The Group is making significant investment in implementing 
a new centralised publishing and distribution workflow system 
to replace its disparate systems. It is also implementing a new 
accounting and management information system across the 
Group. The Executive Committee is monitoring the projects to 
replace these systems closely to minimise risk, and to ensure that 
the short and long term benefits of the new systems are realised. 
Title acquisition 
This risk encompasses the payment of advances to authors 
to acquire new titles that subsequently remain unearned. 
The risk is mitigated by strong controls when considering 
the acquisition of rights to new titles which includes an initial 
purchase evaluation process carried out and signed off at a 
senior level. New titles are supported by sales and marketing 
resources to ensure a successful launch. There is also a 
system of continuous review, analysis and feedback on title 
performance to better inform future acquisitions.

Corporate Responsibility
Risk Factors Corporate Responsibility
Bloomsbury’s core business is the 
worldwide publication of literature for 
readers of all ages which in itself has a 
high social value. We focus on integrity 
in all of our activities, consider our 
impact on society and the environment 
and maintain high ethical standards. 
The Company continues to be included 
in the FTSE4Good Index.
The Board recognises that the 
achievements of the Group have 
depended upon the high standards of 
social responsibility demonstrated by the 
directors and employees for more than 
twenty years. The Board takes account 
of the relevant social, environmental and 
ethical issues and associated risks and 
opportunities to the Group’s short-term 
and long-term value. 
Community
We encourage the involvement of staff worldwide in volunteer 
work and Bloomsbury is involved in a number of community 
based activities. Our publishing teams share a common passion 
for promoting the enjoyment of high quality literature which is 
often cutting edge and provides new authors with opportunities 
to establish themselves. We have a substantial children’s & 
educational division focused on promoting literacy for young 
readers of all abilities and ages including specialist ranges for ‘Hi-
Low’ pupils (High age, Low attainment) which provide parents and 
teachers with the tools needed to engage their children in reading.
 ● Support by Bloomsbury  
With a focus on promoting literacy we actively support 
numerous organisations and other good causes such as 
Booktrust, Oxfam, Barnados and other charities together 
with organisations including schools and libraries. We 
donate, or provide at a substantial discount, over 100,000 
books annually which include donations by our overseas 
and UK offices of main stream titles. We donate signed 
copies of books by leading authors for charity auctions 
and support the Booktrust ‘Booked Up’ scheme to give 
every child starting secondary school a free book. We 
are a sponsor and partner of World Book Day which was 
established in 1995 by the United Nations Educational, 
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) with the 
objective of promoting and celebrating books and 
reading amongst children and adults. 
 
We make minor cash donations to charities that support 
literary art, education and literacy which has included 
Book Aid International, The Charleston Trust and other 
charities that meet our specific criteria. In respect of the 
period we made donations totalling £10,000.
 ● Support by Employees of Bloomsbury 
Our employees are involved in a number of formal 
volunteer schemes, such as for the CSV charity, regularly 
attending state schools in deprived areas. These schemes 
provide supervised reading support to young readers often 
from backgrounds where their opportunities to develop 
reading skills may be hindered. Groups of employees 
around the business regularly participate in a wide range 
of fund raising events for good causes supporting charities 
through sponsored runs, cycling challenges, bake sales and 
other employee inspired activities.
Employees
We recognise that people are our greatest asset and 
employment policies are directed at creating a workplace that 
attracts, motivates, develops and retains high calibre employees. 
We have a diverse workforce and management team lead by a 
diverse board, of which one third of the members are women.
20234-02 BLOOMSBURY FRONT.indd   19 29/06/2011   09:14:40 20234.04   29/06/11   Proof 9
Bloomsbury Publishing Plc 20
Corporate Responsibility 
Key features of the Group’s employment policies and  
practices are:
 ● Openness: Bloomsbury provides a high degree of openness 
and transparency on its activities and performance through 
information provided to employees. Employees are kept 
updated daily, weekly and monthly on sales, book releases, 
project achievements, corporate news and feedback from 
external media and other sources. Weekly and other regular 
team meetings and internal annual conferences bring 
employees together from across the Group’s worldwide 
sites allowing team members to formally and informally 
share information about the business and develop strong 
working relationships. An intranet is used to provide 
employees with access to relevant corporate information 
and employees regularly arrange social events.
 ● Engagement: We promote a friendly collegiate culture 
in which employees are encouraged to discuss their 
concerns and issues with their line managers and 
senior colleagues. The senior management team meets 
frequently to discuss employee matters and is supported 
by regular operational meetings attended by managers 
covering all the Group’s worldwide sites.
 ● Ethical Behaviour: We expect employees, directors, 
subcontractors and others to exercise high ethical standards 
at all times in respect of the relationships and dealings 
Bloomsbury has with its customers, authors and agents, 
suppliers and other third parties. Bloomsbury has whistleblower 
procedures enabling employees to have their concerns 
confidentially addressed and has a formal policy on ethical 
behaviour which is included within employment terms.
 ● Employee development: Bloomsbury is acquisitive and 
has benefited from an intake of high calibre entrepreneurs 
who support the Group’s capacity to innovate. The Group 
develops its management structure to serve the changing 
needs of customers and authors. This creates opportunities 
for suitably high calibre individuals to progress to increasing 
levels of seniority as they gain capabilities and expertise. 
External recruitment is supported by a centralised Human 
Resources function enabling vacancies across sites 
worldwide to be filled internally where employees of an 
appropriately high calibre seek new opportunities.
 ● Performance and merit: Senior employees agree personal 
objectives and are rewarded based on performance 
determined by business results and appraisals. Senior 
managers are accountable for the performance of their 
teams and determine the most appropriate approach to 
performance management for each team. Promotions 
and external recruitment are based on merit and ensure 
that the most suitable person is selected for positions.
 ● Employee participation: As set out in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 39 to 45, the Company 
offers UK employees the opportunity to participate in an all 
employee HM Revenue and Customs approved Sharesave 
scheme to encourage employee participation in the 
performance and growth of the Group. High performing 
senior employees may also be eligible to participate in the 
Company’s Performance Share Plan (PSP).
 ● Flexible working: We have family friendly working 
practices such as flexible working hours and recognise 
that experienced employees returning to work following 
maternity, paternity or other career breaks are an asset.
 ● Equality of opportunity: Bloomsbury has a diverse 
workforce and follows a policy that no employee or other 
person receives more or less favourable treatment on 
the grounds of gender, sexual orientation, colour, race 
and ethnic origin, nationality, religion, disability or age. 
This extends to any person known to be HIV positive. The 
Human Resources function monitors compliance with 
the policy and with applicable legislative requirements 
to ensure the equality of opportunity in the recruitment, 
selection and promotion of employees. Grievance 
and disciplinary procedures protect employees from 
discriminatory behaviours and attitudes.
 ● Disabled persons: Group policy is to offer equal 
treatment in respect of the recruitment, training, career 
development and promotion of disabled persons. Where 
people become disabled during the course of their 
employment, the Group will seek to retain their services 
and to provide retraining where necessary.
 ● Health and safety: The Company Secretary reporting to 
the Chief Executive in respect of Health and Safety (“H&S”) 
heads an H&S team that ensures Group-wide compliance 
with H&S policy. H&S incident reports are reviewed by the 
Board and at senior team meetings. The H&S team works 
closely with management and employees  to ensure that 
the H&S policy is effectively communicated, implemented 
and maintained across the business. Managers of the 
worldwide sites are accountable for ensuring their areas of 
the business are in compliance with H&S policy.
Environment
The Board recognises that a responsible approach to the 
environment is attractive to its existing and prospective 
customers and authors. Customers can require Bloomsbury to 
demonstrate that the Group is a good corporate citizen during 
the tender process for new and existing contracts.
The impact to the environment from our business predominantly 
arises from the activities we subcontract to our suppliers including 
the printing, production, distribution, recycling and disposal 
of printed books. The Company also has office based design, 
editorial, sales and administrative activities which operate through 
an employee workforce based at offices in the UK, US (New York), 
Germany (Berlin) and Australia (Sydney).

of bottled water coolers and fit them with timer plugs, 
fit energy efficient lamps, ensure heating systems are 
regularly maintained and programmed efficiently, turn off 
unnecessary electrical equipment such as photocopiers out

Environmental Results and Targets
Our direct operations are predominately office-based and 
have been independently assessed as having a low impact 
on the environment. We monitor the normalised long term 
average greenhouse gas and waste production for our office 
based employees and our target is to reduce this average per 
employee over the long term. The Group’s consumption of 
natural resources, although relatively minor, is significantly 
impacted by ambient weather conditions beyond our control 
and by the buildings we lease.
Greenhouse Gases
Our independent external advisor, Trucost, has calculated the  
tables below based on the data we have provided to them. For  
ease of comparison, figures are reported for the 12 months to  
31 December for 2010 and 2009. We report on our waste 
production and greenhouse gas emissions aligning with the 
2006 Government Guidelines, Environmental Key Performance 
Indicators and Reporting Guidelines for UK Businesses. In 
respect of greenhouse gases, we report consumption of 
natural gas, vehicle fuel and electricity in kWh, converted to 
CO
2
-e following the protocols provided by the Department for 
Environment Food, and Rural Affairs (Defra). Emissions have 
been categorised against the Greenhouse Gas Protocol scopes 
of reporting. This information is unaudited.
Our policy is to reduce both the financial cost to the business 
and the impact of the business on the environment. We 
employ specialist independent external advisors, Trucost, to 
monitor our impact on the environment. Key areas where we 
are active in reducing the direct and indirect environmental 
impact of the business include:
 ● Book Printing: We monitor the impact of our major 
suppliers and engage with them to reduce the 
environmental impact where possible. We stipulate that 
the pulp used to produce the papers for our books comes 
from well-managed forests and encourage our suppliers 
to obtain Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) accreditation 
and use FSC certified papers. The majority of our UK and 
European suppliers are FSC Chain of Custody certified as 
are several of our main Far Eastern colour printers.
 ● Online print: We are increasingly moving to electronic 
media that will avoid using natural resources.
 ● Building and office facilities: Most of our employees travel to 
work by public transport and we support part time and home-
working. We intend to consolidate several of our UK offices into 
a single London premises during 2011 which should reduce the 
carbon footprint of our employees as the business continues 
to grow. For most employees we have implemented separate 
recycling bins for different waste materials so that a significant 
proportion of our office waste is recycled. Where practical, lights 
are fitted with motion detectors and our office policy is to turn 
off lights out of hours when not in use. 
 
We have previously taken advice from the Carbon Trust 
and implemented their recommendations to reduce our

registered office at 36 Soho Square, London W1D 3QY.
In accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act, 
the Company is required to produce a fair view of the business, 
including a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
facing the company. This is set out in the Overview, the Business 
Review and the Governance sections on pages 1 to 45, which 
provide information about the Group, all of which are incorporated 
into this Directors’ Report by reference.

Directors’ Report 
Details of Directors’ service contracts and Directors’ 
interests in shares and options are shown in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 39 to 45. Other than as 
disclosed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report, none of the 
Directors held any interest, either during or at the end of the 
financial period ending 28 February 2011, in any material 
contract or arrangement with the Company or any subsidiary 
undertaking. 
Company policy is to appoint Directors to the Board on the 
recommendation of the Nomination Committee. This may be as 
part of the progressive refreshing of the Board, to reappoint a 
Director retiring by rotation, to fill a vacancy arising as a result of 
a retiring director or as part of measures taken to enhance the 
skills, experience, capability and balance of the Board.
The effect of the Company’s Articles of Association is to require 
that at least approximately one third of Directors who have 
remained in office for the longest period since being elected 
or re-elected and any Director who did not stand for re-
election in either of the two proceeding AGMs must retire by 
rotation. The Articles also require that new Directors appointed 
by the Board must offer themselves for re-election at the next 
AGM. Accordingly, Jeremy Wilson and Nigel Newton retire by 
rotation at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. Both 
these directors, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election. 
Wendy Pallot, Ian Cormack and Sarah Thomson are new 
directors appointed by the Board during the period and, 
being eligible, offer themselves for election. The Nomination 
Committee has considered the performance of Jeremy Wilson, 
Nigel Newton, Wendy Pallot, Ian Cormack and Sarah Thomson 
and recommends each for re-election or election.
The terms of termination of the Directors’ contracts are described 
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report set out in pages 39 to 45 
which includes details of any agreements by which the Company 
would pay compensation to its directors for loss of office, for loss of 
employment or for a change of control of the Company.
Directors’ Indemnities & Insurance
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, 
Directors are granted an indemnity from the Company to 
the extent permitted by law in respect of liabilities incurred 
as a result of their office. The Group maintained insurance 
throughout the period for its Directors and officers against the 
consequences of actions brought against them in relation to 
their duties for the Group.
Charitable and political donations
The Group made charitable donations of £10,000 in respect of 
the period (2009: £100). Details of the non-cash support given by 
the charitable and voluntary activities of the Company are as set 
out in the Corporate Responsibility sections on pages 19 to 22. 
No political donations were made by the Group during the 
period or in the previous year.
Payment Policy for Suppliers
It is the Company’s policy that payments to suppliers are made 
in accordance with the terms and conditions agreed between 
the Company and its suppliers, provided that all trading terms 
and conditions have been complied with. The same policy is 
adopted for the subsidiaries of the Company. 
At 28 February 2011 the number of days’ credit taken for 
purchases by the Group was 55 days (2009: 50 days).
Financial Instruments
Treasury activities are controlled and monitored by the Finance 
Director and are carried out in accordance with policies 
approved by the Board. The Finance Director has delegated 
authority to approve financial transactions within agreed frames 
of reference and levels of authority.
The Group’s principal financial instruments, other than 
derivatives, comprise trade receivables, rights income 
receivables, trade payables, royalties payable, leases, cash and 
short term deposits. The purpose of the policies summarised 
below is to ensure that adequate cost effective funding is 
available to the Group and exposure to financial risk – interest 
rate, credit, liquidity and currency risk – is minimised. Group 
policy permits the use of derivative instruments but only for 
reducing exposures arising from underlying business activity 
and not for speculative purposes. 
Derivatives including foreign exchange forward contracts 
have not been used during the year. Derivatives and 
financial instruments are only entered into when there is a 
commercial justification and with counterparties which fulfil 
predetermined credit criteria.
a)  Interest Rate Risk
  The Group policy is to continuously monitor the rates of 
interest available on cash deposits and to place deposits at 
the best available rate using only low risk high grade bank 
deposit facilities.

Directors’ Report 
b) Credit Risk 
  Authorised credit limits are set for new corporate 
customers based on an assessment of credit worthiness 
and on reports from third party credit checking agencies 
where appropriate. 
c) Liquidity And Cash Flow Risks 
  The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between 
continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of 
its own resources, cash balances and leases. The policy is 
to ensure that the Group has adequate committed bank 
facilities available. 
d) Currency Risks 
  The receipts and payments of overseas trading operations 
are largely in their local currency and therefore only 
material transactions would be hedged. The Group is 
subject to currency exposure on the translation of the 
profits and net assets of overseas subsidiaries. It is policy 
not to hedge exposures arising from profit and net asset 
translation on consolidating overseas subsidiaries as these 
are not material to the Group; the Board keeps this policy 
under review. The main foreign currencies in which the 
Group operates are Euros, US Dollars and Australian Dollars.
Going Concern
After making enquiries the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing the Consolidated and 
Company financial statements in accordance with Going 
Concern and Liquidity Risk: Guidance for Directors of UK 
Companies 2009, published by the Financial Reporting Council 
in October 2009. Further going concern disclosure is given in 
the financial statements as noted in the Basis of Preparation 
section of the Accounting Policies on page 56.
Future developments
The Group intends to continue to develop the range of 
its publishing businesses and other services. Although the 
primary focus of the Group is on organic growth, acquisitions 
in these areas of business will be considered. Following the 
end of the period ended 28 February 2011, the Group was 
restructured into four publishing divisions. 
Share capital and rights attaching to the 
company’s shares
The share capital of the Company comprises a single class of 
ordinary 1.25p shares (“ordinary shares”). As at the date of 
this Directors’ Report, there were 73,844,724 fully paid issued 
shares, all listed on the London Stock Exchange, with a further 
17,844,224 ordinary shares that the directors are authorised to 
issue. Details of the issued share capital of the Company can be 
found in note 14 together with details of the shares issued and 
cancelled during the period.
No ordinary shares carry special rights with regard to control of the 
Company. At a general meeting of the Company every member 
has one vote on a show of hands and on a poll one vote for each 
share held. The notice of general meeting specifies deadlines for 
exercising voting rights either by proxy or present in person in 
relation to resolutions to be passed at a general meeting. 
Under the Articles of Association, any share in the Company 
may be issued with such rights or restrictions, whether in 
regard to dividend, voting, return of capital or otherwise as 
the Company may from time to time by ordinary resolution 
determine (or, in the absence of any such determination, as 
the Directors may determine).
No shareholder is, unless the Board decides otherwise, entitled 
to attend or vote either personally or by proxy at a general 
meeting or to exercise any other rights conferred by being a 
shareholder if he or she or any person with an interest in shares 
has been sent a notice under Section 793 of the Companies Act 
2006 (which confers upon public companies the power to require 
information with respect to interests in their voting shares) and 
he or she or any interested person failed to supply the Company 
with the information requested within 14 days after delivery of 
that notice. The Board may also decide to apply to the court for 
an order under section 794 of the Companies Act 2006 so that no 
dividend is payable in respect of those default shares and that no 
transfer of any default shares shall be registered. These restrictions 
end seven days after receipt by the Company of a notice of an 
approved transfer of the shares or all the information required by 
the relevant Section 793 notice, whichever is earlier. 
The Directors may refuse to register any transfer which is not a 
fully-paid share, although such discretion may not be exercised 
in a way which the Financial Services Authority regards as 
preventing dealing in the shares of that class from taking place 
on an open proper basis. The Directors may likewise refuse any 
transfer of a share in favour of more than four persons jointly.
The Company is not aware of any other restrictions in the 
transfer of ordinary shares in the Company other than certain 
restrictions that may from time to time be imposed by laws 
and regulations (for example, insider trading laws); and 
pursuant to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority 
whereby certain employees of the Group require approval of 
the Company to deal in the Company’s shares.

Directors’ Report 
The Company is not aware of any agreements between 
shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of the 
securities or voting rights.
Authorities to allot shares and  
pre-emption rights
Notice of the 2011 Annual General Meeting contained on pages 
106 to 110 sets out an ordinary resolution renewing the authority 
for the directors to allot shares under Section 551 of the 
Companies Act. If passed at the meeting, the resolution will give 
the directors the power to allot a maximum of 24,622,800 shares 
having a nominal value of £307,785 representing approximately 
33.3% of the issued share capital of the Company.
Notice of the 2011 Annual General Meeting sets out a special 
resolution renewing the authority given to the directors to 
disapply statutory pre-emption rights under Section 571 of that 
Act to allow shares to be issued for cash or Treasury Shares to 
be sold for cash on a non-pre-emptive basis. If passed at the 
meeting this resolution will give the directors the power to issue 
up to 3,692,160 shares having a nominal value of £46,152 being 
approximately 5% of the issued ordinary share capital.
Similar authorities that were given to the directors at the last 
Annual General Meeting to expire at the 2011 Annual General 
Meeting and it is now proposed such authorities be renewed 
until the 2012 Annual General Meeting.
Authority to purchase shares
Notice of the 2011 Annual General Meeting contained on 
pages 106 to 110 sets out a special resolution renewing the 
authority given to the directors to purchase the Company’s 
own shares on the stock market. This authority also permits 
the purchase of shares to hold as Treasury Shares. If passed at 
the meeting, the resolution will give the directors the power 
to purchase up to 7,384,472 shares having a nominal value of 
£92,306 being approximately 10% of the issued share capital.
Similar authorities that were given to the directors at the last 
Annual General Meeting to expire at the 2011 Annual General 
Meeting and it is now proposed such authorities be renewed 
until the 2012 Annual General Meeting.
Employee Benefit Trust
Throughout the 14 month period to 28 February 2011, Ogier 
Employee Benefit Trustee Limited (“Trustee”) as trustee 
of the Bloomsbury Employee Benefit Trust (“Trust”) held 
88,760 ordinary shares of 1.25 pence in the Company being 
approximately 0.1% of the issued ordinary share capital. The 
Trustee may vote on shares held by the Trust at its discretion, 
but waives its right to a dividend. 
As at the date of signing this report, the Trust held 1,600,610 
ordinary shares of 1.25 pence being approximately 2.2% of 
the issued ordinary share capital. The Trust made the following 
share purchases following the end of the period to the date of

* Based on 73,844,724 issued shares. 
All shares purchased during the period were cancelled and 
no shares were held as Treasury Shares. The purchase of 
shares was undertaken to take advantage of temporarily weak 
market conditions and to use cash favourably.
Changes of control
The Group has established close relationships over a long period 
within the publishing markets in which it operates. It relies heavily 
on its goodwill and reputation and in particular on its reputation 
as an autonomous independent publisher with authors, 
customers and key employees that could be affected by a change 
of control. The representatives of key authors would need to be 
consulted prior to any change of control taking place.
The Company’s share incentive schemes contain provisions 
relating to a change of control of the Company following 
a takeover bid (see note 18 for further details of the share 
incentive schemes). Under these provisions, a change of 
control of the Company would normally be a vesting event, 
facilitating the exercise of awards, typically subject to the 
discretion of the Remuneration Committee. 
Contracts and arrangements essential  
to the business
The Group has a diverse base of authors, customers and 
general suppliers so that its dependency on any one individual 
author, customer or supplier is reduced. Primarily for printed 
books, the Group develops longer term relationships with 
a reduced number of business partners, printers and 
distributors to maximise process efficiencies and economies 
of scale. Failure of a main supplier could disrupt the supply of 
books to market or result in increased cost of working whilst 
alternative arrangements are made.
The Group depends on its reputation as there is a tendency 
for its authors and customers to behave collectively in the 
selection of their publishing service provider.
Cautionary Statement
Under s417 of the Companies Act 2006, a company’s Directors’ 
Report is required, among other matters, to contain a fair review 
by the directors of the Group’s business through a balanced and 
comprehensive analysis of the development and performance 
of the business of the Group and the position of the Group 
at the period end, consistent with the size and complexity of 
the business. The Directors’ Report together with all sections 
incorporated into it by reference has been prepared only for the 
shareholders of the Company. Its sole purpose and use is to assist 
shareholders to exercise their governance rights. In particular, 
the Directors’ Report has not been audited or otherwise 
independently verified. The Company and its directors and 
employees are not responsible for any other purpose or use or to 
any other person in relation to the Directors’ Report.
The Directors’ Report contains indications of likely future 
developments and other forward looking statements that are 
subject to risk factors associated with, among other things, the 
economic and business circumstances occurring from time to 
time in the sectors, countries and business divisions in which 
the Group operates. These factors include, but are not limited 
to, those discussed under Risk Factors on pages 17 and 18 and 
in note 22 on pages 97 to 102. These and other factors could 
adversely affect the Group’s results, strategy and prospects. 
Forward looking statements involve risks, uncertainties 
and assumptions. They relate to events and/or depend on 
circumstances in the future which could cause actual results 
and outcomes to differ materially from those currently 
anticipated. No obligation is assumed to update any forward 
looking statements, whether as a result of new information, 
future events or otherwise.
Auditors
a) Reappointment of the Auditor 
  A resolution to reappoint Baker Tilly UK Audit LLP as 
auditor will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting.
b) Statement as to Disclosure of Information to the Auditor 
  The Directors who were in office on the date of approval 
of these financial statements have confirmed that, as far 
as they are aware, there is no relevant audit information 
of which the auditor is unaware. Each of the Directors 
have confirmed that they have taken all the steps that 
they ought to have taken as Directors in order to make 
themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that it has been communicated to the auditor.

Directors’ Report 
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ 
Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare group and 
company financial statements for each financial period. The 
Directors are required under the Listing Rules of the Financial 
Services Authority to prepare Group financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union (“EU”) and have 
elected under company law to prepare the company financial 
statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU.
The financial statements are required by law and IFRS adopted 
by the EU to present fairly the financial position of the group 
and the company and the financial performance of the group. 
The Companies Act 2006 provides in relation to such financial 
statements that references in the relevant part of that Act to 
financial statements giving a true and fair view are references 
to their achieving a fair presentation.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and the 
company and of the profit or loss of the group for that period. 
 
In preparing the group and company financial statements, the 
Directors are required to:
a.  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
b.  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
c.  state whether they have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs adopted by the EU;
d.  prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group 
and the company will continue in business;
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the group’s 
and the company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the group and 
the company and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply 
with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the group and 
the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Directors’ statement pursuant to the Disclosure 
and Transparency Rules
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed 
in the Directors’ Report confirms that, to the best of their 
knowledge:
a.  the financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRS 
as adopted by the EU give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit of the company and 
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a 
whole; and
b.  the Directors’ Report contained in the Annual 
Report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of 
the company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole together with a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the Company’s website, www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.

Directors’ Report 
2011 Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting will be held at 36 Soho Square, 
London W1D 3QY on 11 August 2011 at 12 noon.
The ordinary business to be proposed at the  
annual general meeting
Resolutions 1 to 3 (ordinary resolutions):  
The audited report and accounts of Bloomsbury Publishing 
Plc and a final dividend of 0.28 pence per Ordinary Share for 
the period ended 28 February 2011 are recommended by the 
Board for approval.
The Directors’ Remuneration Report, which includes 
details of the remuneration earned by, and paid to, the 
Directors in respect of the period ended 28 February 2011, is 
recommended to Shareholders for approval.
Resolutions 4, 5 and 6 (ordinary resolutions):  
The Articles of Association of the Company requires that any 
Director appointed by the Board during the year will only hold 
office until the next annual general meeting, when he or she 
must be re-appointed by the Shareholders in general meeting.
Sarah Jane Thomson, Ian Cormack and Wendy Pallot were 
respectively appointed on 25 May 2010, 1 January 2011 
and 8 April 2011 and therefore must be reappointed by the 
Shareholders at the AGM to continue in office. The Board has 
considered their performance since initially being appointed 
and recommends Sarah Jane Thomson, Ian Cormack and 
Wendy Pallot for re-appointment.
Resolution 7 (ordinary resolution):  
In compliance with the Articles of Association of the Company, 
one-third of the Directors who are subject to retirement by 
rotation are required to retire at the AGM. Jeremy Wilson, 
who was last re-appointed as a Director at the annual general 
meeting of the Company held in 2009, will retire at the AGM 
and, being eligible, offers himself for re-appointment. The 
Board has considered his annual performance evaluation and 
recommends the reappointment of Jeremy Wilson.
Resolution 8 (ordinary resolution):  
In compliance with the Articles, Directors who did not stand 
for re-election in either of the two proceeding AGMs who 
are subject to retirement by rotation are required to retire 
at the AGM. Nigel Newton, who was last re-appointed as a 
Director at the annual general meeting of the Company held 
in 2008, will retire at the AGM and, being eligible, offers himself 
for re-appointment. The Board has considered his annual 
performance evaluation and recommends the reappointment 
of Nigel Newton.
Resolution 9 (ordinary resolution):  
The Board recommends that the incumbent external auditor, 
Baker Tilly UK Audit LLP, is re-appointed for a further year so that 
they are able to audit the Company’s report and accounts for the 
year ending 28 February 2012 and the Board proposes that it be 
authorised to determine the level of the auditors’ remuneration.
The special business to be proposed at the  
annual general meeting
Resolution 10 – authority to allot Ordinary Shares  
(ordinary resolution):  
This replaces the general authority, last given at the Company’s 
annual general meeting held on 28 May 2010, for the Directors 
to allot Ordinary Shares. Resolution 10 would give the Directors 
the authority to allot up to 24,614,880 Ordinary Shares, 
representing approximately 33.3% of the issued ordinary 
share capital of the Company as at 19 June 2011 (being the last 
practicable date before the publication of this document). 
This authority, if granted, will expire on the earlier of the 
conclusion of the Company’s next annual general meeting 
and 15 months from the date of passing this resolution. The 
Board has no present intention of exercising this authority 
granted by Resolution 10 and intends to seek its renewal at 
subsequent annual general meetings of the Company. 
Resolution 11 – disapplication of statutory pre-emption 
provisions (special resolution):  
Resolution 11, which will be proposed as a special resolution, 
authorises the Directors to allot Ordinary Shares for cash 
without first offering them, pro rata, to existing Shareholders. 
The maximum nominal value of new Ordinary Shares which may 
be so allotted under this authority is £46,152, being equivalent to 
approximately 5% of the entire issued ordinary share capital of the 
Company as at 19 June 2011 (being the last practicable date before 
the publication of this document). This authority would expire on 
the earlier of the conclusion of the Company’s next annual general 
meeting and 15 months from the date of passing this resolution.

Directors’ Report  Corporate Governance
Resolution 12 – authority for the Company to purchase 
Ordinary Shares (special resolution): 
With the authority of Shareholders in general meeting, the 
Company is empowered by the Articles of Association to purchase 
Ordinary Shares subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 
2006. The Directors believe it is prudent to seek general authority 
from Shareholders to be able to act if circumstances arose in 
which they considered such purchases to be desirable. The 
Directors have no current intention to exercise this authority 
granted by Resolution 12 and it will only be exercised if and 
when, in the light of market conditions prevailing at that time, the 
Directors believe that such purchases would increase earnings per 
share and would be for the benefit of Shareholders generally. 
Resolution 12, which will be proposed as a special resolution, 
authorises the Company to purchase its own Ordinary Shares 
and either, depending on the circumstances at the time and 
subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, to hold 
these as treasury shares or to cancel them. This authority 
would, if granted, expire on the earlier of the conclusion of the 
Company’s next annual general meeting and 15 months from 
the date of passing this resolution.
The Company would be authorised to make market purchases 
of up to 7,384,472 Ordinary Shares, being equivalent to 
approximately 10% of the issued ordinary share capital 
(excluding treasury shares) of the Company as at 19 June 2011 
(being the last practicable date before the publication of this 
document). The maximum price (exclusive of expenses) shall 
be not more than 5% above the average market value of the 
Company’s equity shares for the 5 business days prior to the 
day the purchase is made. The minimum price (exclusive of 
expenses) that may be paid shall be the nominal value of an 
Ordinary Share (1.25 pence).
Resolution 13 – authority for the Company to purchase 
Ordinary Shares (special resolution): 
Changes made to the Companies Act 2006 by the 
Shareholders’ Rights Regulations increase the notice period 
required for general meetings of the Company to 21 days 
unless shareholders approve a shorter notice period, which 
cannot however be less than 14 clear days (AGMs will continue 
to be held on at least 21 clear days’ notice). 
Before the coming into force of the Shareholders’ Rights 
Regulations on 3 August 2009, the Company was able to call 
general meetings other than an AGM on 14 clear days’ notice 
without obtaining such shareholder approval. In order to 
preserve this ability, Resolution 13 seeks such approval. The 
approval will be effective until the Company’s next annual 
general meeting, when it is intended that a similar resolution 
will be proposed. 
Action to be taken
A reply-paid form of proxy for use at the AGM is enclosed. 
Whether or not you are able to attend the AGM, you are 
advised to complete and return the form of proxy in 
accordance with the instructions printed on it. The form of 
proxy should be completed and returned as soon as possible 
to Capita Registrars, Proxy Department, PO Box 25, Beckenham, 
Kent, BR3 4BR and, in any event, so as to reach such address 
no later than 48 hours before the appointed commencement 
time of the AGM (for which a prepaid business reply service 
has been provided). You may also deliver it by hand to Capita 
Registrars at The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, 
Kent, BR3 4TU during usual business hours, by such time. 
Recommendations
The Board considers that the passing of Resolutions 1 to 13 is 
in the best interests of the Company and of the Shareholders 
as a whole, and the Board unanimously recommends that 
you vote in favour of them, as each of the Directors intends 
to do in respect of his own beneficial holdings of shares in the 
Company, being in aggregate approximately 2.6% of the 
Ordinary Shares in issue.

Corporate Governance
Directors’ Report  Corporate Governance
The Board of Bloomsbury Publishing Plc (the “Board”) is 
committed to achieving the highest standards of corporate 
governance. The Listing Rules of the Financial Services 
Authority require a statement of how a UK company listed on 
the London Stock Exchange has applied the Main Principles 
set out in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance 
revised June 2008 (the “Code”) and whether the Company 
has complied with all relevant provisions set out in the Code 
throughout the accounting period up to the date of signing of 
the Directors’ Report.
Confirmation of Compliance with the Code
The Board confirms that it has applied the principles and 
complied fully with all provisions of the Code in respect of the 
period ending 28 February 2011 except for provisions:
 ● A.4.1 which requires that the Chairman of the Board or 
an independent non-executive director should chair the 
Nomination Committee. The Nomination Committee is 
formed of three independent non-executive directors, 
including the Chairman of the Board, and the Chief 
Executive who continued to chair the Committee. The 
Board considers that provision A.4.1 is complied with 
fully in all other respects and that the principle A.4 is 
applied effectively in that there is a formal, rigorous and 
transparent procedure for the appointment of new 
directors to the board. In particular, the Committee 
engages external recruitment consultants and during 
the period the Company replaced two long standing 
non-executive directors with two new independent non-
executive directors. Directors are appointed to the Board 
on merit and one third of the Board are women. 
 ● A.7.2 which requires that Non-Executive Directors should 
be appointed for a specified period. The current letter of 
appointment of Jeremy Wilson dated 31 October 2007 
does not specify a fixed date before requiring the renewal 
of his appointment and instead specifies a fixed notice 
period of 3 months by either party. The Board considers 
that provision A.7.2 has been complied with fully in all 
other respects and that principle A.7 is applied effectively 
in that all directors are submitted for re-election at regular 
intervals, subject to continued satisfactory performance. 
Further, the board ensures planned and progressive 
refreshing of the board.
Board
The directors are responsible to the shareholders for ensuring 
that the Company is appropriately managed and that it 
achieves its objectives.
The Board has met ten times during the period for main Board 
meetings to review the Group’s strategic direction, operating 
and financial performance and to oversee that the Company 
is adequately resourced and effectively controlled. The Board 
comprises the independent non-executive Chairman, Senior 
Independent Director, a further independent non-executive 
director, Chief Executive, Finance Director and a further 
executive director.
The Board has approved the matters specifically reserved 
for consideration by the Board. The Board determines the 
responsibilities and authority of its sub-committees, individual 
directors and the level of authorities delegated to the 
management of the business. 
The Audit Committee, Nomination Committee and 
Remuneration Committee have terms of reference approved 
by the Board that can be found on the Company’s website, 
www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk. Matters considered at Board 
meetings during the period have typically included:
 ● Review and setting of strategy for the Group’s operations.
 ● Review of the management accounts, key performance 
indicators and full period forecasts produced quarterly.
 ● Approval of the annual and interim results and Interim 
Management Statements.
 ● Review and approval of annual budgets.
 ● Regular reports by the Chief Executive, proposals and 
updates on developing business operations, significant 
investments, major initiatives, other organisational 
changes and health and safety.
 ● Reports of the Chairman of sub-committees and minutes 
following sub-committee meetings.
 ● Review and approval of decisions, transactions and sensitive 
policies that are significant to the group such as dividends; 
the organisational, legal and capital structure of the group; 
acquisitions of significant literary titles, businesses and 
companies; and major contracts. 
 ● Evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board and its sub-
committees and approval of sub-committee terms of 
reference.

Corporate Governance
There is a clear division of responsibilities at the head of the 
Company, with the Chairman responsible for the effective 
operation of the Board, encouraging the active participation 
of all directors, and the Chief Executive responsible for the 
strategic running of the Company’s businesses. The Board 
has approved formal statements describing the role and 
remit of both the Chairman and Chief Executive, which further 
emphasise this division of responsibilities. The executive 
directors regularly hold formal meetings with senior managers 
as a management team to assist the Chief Executive in 
fulfilling his operational objectives. This management team 
makes recommendations to the Board and seeks approval 
from the Board where required. The Non-Executive Directors 
constructively challenge and help develop proposals on 
strategy at meetings specifically set up for the purpose, which 
are attended by all Board members.
All directors and Board sub-committees have access to the advice 
and services of the Company Secretary, who is responsible for 
ensuring that Board procedures are followed and advising the 
Board, through the Chairman, on governance matters. They also 
have access to independent professional advice, if required, at the 
Company’s expense.
The chairman has held meetings with the non-executive directors 
without the executives present to discuss relevant matters.
Director independence
The Board considers each of the three Non-Executive Directors, 
including the non-executive Chairman, to be independent in 
character and judgement and does not consider that there 
are any relationships or circumstances which affect, or could 
appear to affect, their independent judgement. Ian Cormack 
is a non-executive director of the Authority Board of Qatar 
Financial Centre for whom the Bloomsbury Information 
publishing division of the Company provides publishing 
related support services. He does not have any executive 
responsibilities for the management of either the Qatar 
Financial Centre or Bloomsbury Information and does not 
benefit financially from the relationship. The Board is therefore 
satisfied that this relationship does not affect Mr Cormack’s 
independent judgement.
The Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee comprises solely independent 
non-executive directors and is chaired by Sarah Jane Thomson. 
The chairman of the Board, Jeremy Wilson, is one of the 
three independent non-executive director members of the 
Remuneration Committee and was considered to be independent 
on appointment as chairman. The Committee met five times during 
the period to 28 February 2011. During the period Charles Black and 
Mike Mayer retired from the Board and the Committee on 28 May 
2010 and 31 December 2010 respectively. Sarah Jane Thomson and 
Ian Cormack joined the Board and the Committee on 28 May 2010 
and 1 January 2011 respectively.
The Committee formulates and recommends to the Board the 
policy for the remuneration of the Chairman of the Board, executive 
directors including the Chief Executive, Company Secretary 
and senior executives designated by the Board. It approves the 
design of, and determines the targets for, reward schemes for 
the executive directors. The remuneration of the non-executive 
directors is determined jointly by the Chairman and the executive 
directors and the remuneration of the Chairman is determined 
by the executive directors. The Committee is supported by 
remuneration consultants Hewitt New Bridge Street who work 
exclusively for the Committee and have no other commercial 
connection with the company. A statement to this effect is included 
on the Company’s website, www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk. 
The Committee ensures that the contractual terms and 
payments upon the termination of directors’ services are 
fair and do not reward failure, and that the duty to mitigate 
loss is fully recognised. It approves the design of employee 
share incentive plans, the grant of share incentive awards 
and options to employees and determines whether the 
performance criteria have been met for the vesting of awards 
and options. The Committee monitors the remuneration 
trends for employees generally across the Group and oversees 
major changes in employee benefits structures.
The Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises two independent non-
executive directors including the Committee Chairman, Ian 
Cormack, who has recent and relevant financial experience. 
The Committee met on four occasions during the period to 
28 February 2011. During the period Charles Black and Mike 
Mayer retired from the Board and the Committee on 28 May 
2010 and 31 December 2010 respectively. Sarah Jane  Thomson 
and Ian Cormack joined the Board and the Committee on  
28 May 2010 and 1 January 2011 respectively.
The terms of reference of the Committee can be found on 
the Company’s website, www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk, and set 
out the role and authority of the Committee. Duties and 
matters reserved for the Committee include oversight of the 
relationship and process with the external auditor; review 
of significant financial information, including assumptions, 
judgements of management and a critical accounting 
policies, to be published externally; reviewing the Company’s 
effectiveness of the systems of internal control and risk 
management; and recommending to the board changes to 
the Committee’s terms of reference.

Corporate Governance
During the period, the Committee has reviewed the interim 
and annual results and Interim Management Statements to 
ensure that they present a fair assessment of the Group’s 
position and prospects before approval by the Board. The 
Committee approves all significant changes in accounting 
policies. It has reviewed the Company’s statement on internal 
control systems prior to endorsement by the Board and has 
reviewed the policies and processes for identifying, assessing 
and managing business risks.
The Committee evaluates the effectiveness of the external 
auditor and oversees their appointment, reappointment 
and fees, ensuring these are adequate for the work they 
are required to undertake. The Committee monitors the 
independence and objectivity of the external auditor, ensuring 
that key audit partners are rotated at appropriate intervals. The 
Committee reviews the level of non-audit fees relative to audit 
fees and has approved a formal policy on the provision of non-
audit services to safeguard the independence and objectivity of 
the external auditors. The policy prohibits the external auditor 
from being engaged on work where their independence could 
be threatened and requires the pre-approval by the Committee 
for a non-audit service where the fees of the external auditor 
would exceed £5,000 or if non-audit fees for the year would 
exceed audit fees. Further safeguards are employed such as 
audit and non-audit work being performed by different teams 
from the external auditor.
The Company has employed an outsourced internal audit 
function during the period. The Committee reviews the plans, 
findings and recommendations of the internal auditor, and 
management’s responses to internal audit recommendations. It 
ensures that the internal audit function is adequately resourced 
and has appropriate standing within the Company. The 
Committee evaluates the effectiveness of the internal auditor 
and makes recommendations to the Board on the removal or 
appointment of the outsourced internal audit function.
The Committee typically invites the external auditor, internal 
auditor, Chief Executive and Finance Director to attend 
meetings. After the period end, the Committee met the 
external auditor alone without management present, in 
respect of the period ended 28 February 2011. 
The Committee formally reviews the whistle-blowing 
arrangements of the Company by which staff may, in 
confidence, raise concerns about possible improprieties 
in matters of financial reporting or other matters at 
least annually. The Committee’s objective is to ensure 
that arrangements are in place for the proportionate 
and independent investigation of such matters and for 
appropriate follow-up action.
Nomination Committee 
The Nomination Committee comprises three independent 
directors, including the Chairman of the Board, and the Chief 
Executive who chairs the Committee.
The Committee meets as required and operates under terms 
of reference agreed by the whole Board, and which are 
available on the Group’s website. Its role is to regularly review 
the composition of the Board, consider succession planning 
and nominate to the Board, for approval, candidates to fill 
Board vacancies. 
The Board formally approves the appointment of all new 
Directors on the recommendation of the Nomination Committee. 
Board appointment process
The Board adopts a formal and rigorous approach to the 
appointment of directors. The following outlines the typical 
board appointment process:
 ● the need to appoint a new director is identified by an 
existing board member’s intention to retire or by the 
regular monitoring by the Committee of the board’s 
structure, balance, succession planning and need for 
progressive refreshing which takes account of the findings 
of the Board’s evaluation of the skills and capabilities of 
Board members;
 ● the Committee determines the recruitment process;
 ● the Committee considers the strengths and weaknesses 
of the Board, the management team and the business to 
define the experience and capabilities required for the 
new appointment; 
 ● external recruitment consultants are appointed and 
briefed with the requirements for candidates; filtering 
selects a long list of the highest calibre candidates; 
standard interviews are conducted on the long list by 
two directors sitting together supported by the external 
recruitment consultant; and a short list of candidates is 
recommended to the Committee. The recommended 
candidates are supported by further detailed background 
research to confirm their suitability which includes 
detailed references taken up by the Company;
 ● the Committee considers whether a suitable high candidate 
can be selected and, if so, recommends a single candidate 
to the Board.
The Chairman ensures that new directors receive a full, formal 
and tailored induction on joining the board. Wendy Pallot, a 
newly appointed executive director, will be provided with the 
opportunity to meet major shareholders as part of the investor 
relations programme of the Company.

Corporate Governance
Re-Election of Directors
All Directors are subject to appointment by the shareholders 
at the first Annual General Meeting after their appointment, 
and reappointment thereafter at intervals of no more than 
three years. Non-executive Directors are appointed for an initial 
period of three years, subject to reappointment and a notice 
period by the Company or the director (notice periods are set 
out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 39 to 45). A 
policy is followed of progressive refreshing of the Board and the 
independent non-executive Directors can be expected to retire 
from the Board by the completion of the third three year period.
Performance Evaluation
The performance of the Board, and of each individual 
Director, is evaluated through completion of self assessment 
questionnaires and one-to-one interviews with the Chairman. 
Upon completing interviews, the Chairman considers the 
findings and decides on appropriate steps to take which can 
include further research on the issues raised. Where needed 
the Chairman holds confidential follow up meetings with 
individual directors to address concerns they have raised or to 
address concerns raised about them by other Directors.
The performance evaluation of the Chairman is by the other non-
executive directors and is led by the Senior Independent Director. 
The evaluation is undertaken by completion of a self assessment 
questionnaire and one-to-one interview with the Senior 
Independent Director who takes into account the confidential 
views of the other directors.
The Chairman and Senior Independent Director update the 
Board on their findings, conclusions and recommendations 
for approval and implementation by the Board. 
The performance of the Audit Committee, Remuneration 
Committee and Nomination Committee is evaluated using 
questionnaires to support Board discussion. Improvements 
to subcommittee processes arising from the evaluations are 
agreed by the Board and implemented.
Each subcommittee considers its own terms of reference at 
least annually and, if considered necessary, recommends 
changes for the Board to approve.
The conclusions of the Board evaluations are considered by 
the Nomination Committee when reviewing the structure and 
composition of the Board and succession planning.

Training and development of the Directors
Evaluation of the Board reviews whether the Directors have 
refreshed their skills and knowledge sufficiently and provides 
an opportunity for directors to identify where training and 
development can assist them in the performance of their 
duties. Development may include, for example, meetings 
with senior managers to gain an improved understanding 
of processes and issues specific to the business. Directors are 
provided with relevant technical reports and updates by the 
Company Secretary as part of the Board’s information process. 
The Board is progressively refreshed so that three 
directors have recently retired and been replaced by new 
appointments bringing new skills and experience to the Board.
Shareholder Communications
The Annual Report, Interim Reports, Interim Management 
Statements, AGM and post results announcement 
presentations are the principal means through which the 
Company communicates its strategy and performance to its 
shareholders. All shareholders are welcome to attend the AGM 
and private investors are encouraged to take advantage of 
the opportunity given to ask questions. The Chairmen of the 
Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees attend the 
meeting and are available to answer questions, as appropriate.
The Company maintains an active dialogue with its 
institutional shareholders and City analysts through a 
planned programme of investor relations. The programme 
includes formal presentations of results and post results 
meetings with the major shareholders and other investors 
who request meetings. The presentations are made available 
on the website www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk. The meetings and 
presentations provide an opportunity for shareholders to 
ask questions and to meet the executive directors including 
the Chief Executive and non-executive directors including 
the Senior Independent Director. The outcome of regular 
meetings with the main shareholders, presentations and post 
results meetings is reported to the Board. This includes both 
feedback from individual directors and feedback collated 
from discussions by the Company’s corporate broker with the 
main shareholders. The Company’s corporate broker provides 
regular shareholder analysis to the Board.
At least annually, the Chairman writes to the major 
shareholders inviting them to meet to discuss governance and 
strategy and to review with them the Group’s performance.
Internal Control and Risk Management
The Code requires the directors to assess at least annually the 
effectiveness of the Company’s systems of internal control 
which include financial, operational and compliance controls, 
and risk management. This review has been carried out by the 
Audit Committee on behalf of the Board. 
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of 
internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness, for setting 
policy on internal control, and for reviewing the effectiveness 
of internal control. The role of management is to implement 
Board policies on risk and control. The system of internal 
control is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk 
of failure to achieve business objectives, and can only provide 
reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material 
financial misstatement or loss.
The Board operates both formally, through Board and 
Committee meetings, and informally, through regular contact 
amongst Directors. High level decisions on such matters as 
strategy, financial performance and reporting, dividends, risk 
management, major capital expenditure, acquisitions and 
disposals are reserved for the Board or Board Committees. For 
its regular formal meetings, the Board receives appropriate 
information in advance from management. Other decisions 
outside of these areas are delegated to the Company’s 
management, which reports to the Executive Directors.
The Board has put in place an ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the 
Group in accordance with the guidance of the Turnbull 
Committee on internal control. This process has been in place 
for the period under review, and up to the date of approval 
of this annual report. The process is regularly reviewed by the 
Audit Committee on behalf of the Board to ensure that the 
procedures implemented continue to be effective and where 
appropriate recommendations are made to management 
to improve the procedures. The Group’s system of internal 
financial control aims to safeguard the Group’s assets, 
ensure that proper accounting records are maintained, that 
the financial information used within the business and for 
publication is reliable, that business risks are identified and 
managed and that compliance with appropriate legislation 
and regulation is maintained.

of the Group is the responsibility of the Finance Directors 
overseen by the Audit Committee and the Board. This 
includes responsibility for ensuring appropriate internal 
controls are in place over financial reporting processes and 
related IT systems. The Audit Committee monitors the risks 
and associated controls over financial reporting processes, 
including the consolidation process.
Relevant features of the Group’s system of internal controls 
and risk management in relation to the financial reporting 
process and preparation of the group accounts include:
Organisational culture: The Group has a highly skilled, 
professional and committed workforce. The Board is 
committed to developing a culture of openness, integrity, 
competence and responsibility. The Board concentrates 
mainly on strategic and significant organisational issues, 
approving objectives and monitoring, at a high level, the 
financial and operational performance against objectives. 
Risk and control review: The Group maintains risk logs and 
a risk matrix supported by the outsourced internal auditor 
KPMG. The Executive Committee (formerly the Finance 
Committee) and Board has reviewed the significant risks and 
ensures appropriate action is being taken to address the risks. 
The Audit Committee has reviewed the Group’s risk matrix 
when considering the financial statements.
Financial internal control and risk review: The Finance 
Director formally reviews the internal financial controls taking 
account of the risks within the financial information systems 
and reports the findings of this review to the Audit Committee. 
Analytical review of operating results and detailed control 
questionnaires completed for the publishing divisions and 
overseas offices supplement management’s knowledge of the 
business for the evaluation of the risks and assessment of the 
internal financial controls. The Audit Committee also receives 
independent reports on the internal financial controls and 
risks provided by the internal auditor. The Audit Committee 
receives other reports from management relevant to the 
internal financial controls such as reports on the progress of 
key group projects including the implementation of a new 
accounting and management information system.
Authority levels: The Board sets the level of authority required, 
before Board approval is needed, to commit the Group or 
to undertake transactions. It also approves budgets and 
other performance targets. Business publishing divisions and 
business functions operate within these authority levels and 
budgets and determine the authority to be delegated to 
individual managers. 
Financial management reporting: The Board approves annual 
budgets. Sales are reported daily, weekly and monthly. Financial 
results of the business operations are reported monthly and 
compared to budgets. Detailed forecasts for the Group are 
updated regularly and reviewed by the Board. The Finance 
Director approves author advances in the balance sheet.
Acquisition procedures: Established procedures, such as the 
review and approval by an executive director of acquisition 
proposals of rights to new books, are operated within set 
authority limits and used for transactions in the ordinary 
course of business such as for acquisition of books for future 
publication. Acquisitions exceeding delegated authority limits 
require approval by the Board. Acquisition of companies and 
businesses are approved by the Board.
Accountability: The Group has clearly defined lines of 
responsibility headed by the Chief Executive and Executive 
Committee to control the publishing divisions and business 
functions. Each overseas office has a local manager who is 
responsible for operational effectiveness and the local internal 
controls. Detailed operational and financial performance data 
are monitored by supervisory management to ensure the 
performance of operations is in line with targets. The reasons 
for variances and under performance are established by 
supervisory line management. 
Internal audit: An outsourced internal audit function 
provided by KMPG, undertakes a programme agreed with 
the Audit Committee to review the internal controls. Its 
conclusions are communicated to senior management and 
the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee considers reports 
from external and internal audit to ensure that adequate 
measures are being taken by management to address risk and 
control issues. The outsourced internal audit function reports 
to the Chairman of the Audit Committee.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Corporate Governance Directors’ Remuneration Report
Introduction
This report has been prepared on behalf of the Board by 
the Remuneration Committee in accordance with Schedule 
8 to the Accounting Regulations under the Companies 
Act 2006. The report also meets the relevant requirements 
of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and 
describes how the Board has applied the principles relating to 
Directors’ remuneration in The Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance revised June 2008 (the “Code”). As required by 
the Act, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed 
at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the 
financial statements will be approved.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Company’s 
members on certain parts of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report and to state whether in their opinion those parts of 
the report have been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Accounting Regulations. The report has therefore been 
divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited 
information.
PART A — UNAUDITED INFORMATION 
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises three independent 
non-executive directors, namely Sarah Jane Thomson 
(Chairman of the Committee), Ian Cormack (Senior 
Independent Director) and Jeremy Wilson (Chairman of 
the Board). The Committee has been chaired by Sarah Jane 
Thomson from 25 May 2010 prior to which the Committee was 
chaired by Charles Black.
None of the Committee has any personal financial interest 
(other than as shareholders), conflicts of interests arising from 
cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running 
the business. The Committee makes recommendations to the 
Board. No Director plays a part in any discussion about his or 
her own remuneration.
When considered appropriate, advice has been taken from 
external consultants New Bridge Street. The Committee’s 
terms of reference are available on the Company’s website 
www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk and from the Company Secretary 
on request.
Remuneration Policy
The remuneration policy aims to encourage the highest levels 
of performance, to attract, motivate and retain high calibre 
directors and to align the interests of the executive directors 
with those of the shareholders. Remuneration is structured so 
that a significant element is related to performance, both short 
term and long term.
The components of the Executive Directors’ remuneration are:
1) Basic salary
The salaries for the Executive Directors are as follows:
Executive Director
14 months to 
28 February
 2011
£’000
12 months to 
31 December
 2010
£’000
12 months to 
31 December
 2009
£’000
Nigel Newton 404 341 378
Richard Charkin 329 279 308
Colin Adams 223 193 214
Basic salaries are reviewed annually and are set at levels 
that take account of the performance, experience and 
responsibilities of each individual concerned having regard to 
the prevailing market conditions and the overall pay rise used 
for employees generally when determining the Group budget. 
On appointment, the basic salaries for executive directors 
take account of appropriate market competitive ranges from 
companies of a similar size and complexity.
In respect of the year to 31 December 2010, the directors 
voluntarily elected to waive an annual increase and took 
a cut in basic salary of 10%. This followed consideration of 
the pressures faced by Bloomsbury’s employees from the 
challenging economic environment.
The level of opportunity to earn performance related annual 
bonus and to earn long term incentive awards is a set as a 
proportion, determined by the Committee, of basic salary. The 
Committee has regard to the basic salary of the director when 
determining the level of pension payments for those directors 
who receive pension contributions.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
2) Pension contributions
On his appointment, the basic salary of Richard Charkin 
included an allowance in lieu of pension and no further 
pension contributions have been made. Nigel Newton and 
Colin Adams each receive contributions to their contributory 
private pensions approved annually by the Committee 
taking account of their basic salary, director remuneration in 
businesses of similar size and complexity, their performance 
and applicable tax regulation.
The Committee intends to review the structure of director 
remuneration, including the policy with respect to pensions, 
with external specialists to ensure that directors are motivated 
to achieve the highest levels of performance aligned with the 
interests of the shareholders.
3) Other benefits
The Company offers executive directors a motor vehicle 
or a cash alternative and benefits including life assurance, 
permanent health cover, private medical cover and other 
minor benefits.
4) Performance related annual bonus
The executive directors are eligible for an annual cash bonus up 
to a maximum of 100% of basic salary as per the previous year.
Annual bonuses for the period are determined by reference 
to both financial performance and personal and strategic 
objectives. The financial objectives, which accounted for 
80% of the bonus awards for the period, require suitably 
stretching levels of Group profit before tax during the year. 
The financial objectives set by the Committee were achieved 
in full. The personal and strategic targets, which account for 
the remaining bonus award, are set to incentivise the delivery 
of key strategic and development objectives over the year in 
relation to each executive Directors’ area of responsibility. 
In respect of the 14 month period to 28 February 2011, the 
Committee approved annual bonuses for executive directors 
that are restricted to 12 months as follows:
Bonus
£’000
% basic 
salary
Percent
Nigel Newton 341 100%
Richard Charkin 265 95%
Colin Adams 193 100%
 
Basic salary for the 12 months to 31 December 2010 is used in 
the table above to calculate the % basic salary.
5) Long term incentive plans
Performance Share Plan (“PSP”)
The PSP permits performance shares to be granted annually 
to executive directors and senior individuals up to a maximum 
level of 150% of base salary per annum. In practice, the 
Committee applies a maximum award level of 75% of basic 
salary for the Chief Executive, 66% for the other executive 
directors and lower levels for individuals below the level of the 
Board. The Committee intends to make an initial PSP award of 
100% of basic salary for Wendy Pallot.
The PSP was approved by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting held on 27 September 2005 and enables the Company 
to set suitably challenging targets to reward outstanding 
performance over a three year performance period.
Generally, awards of PSP Performance Shares are granted 
subject to two non-concurrent performance conditions, 
namely 50% of awards are subject to normalised Earnings Per 
Share (“EPS”) targets and 50% of awards are subject to Total 
Shareholder Return (“TSR”) targets over a three year period. 
PSP awards lapse in the event that the conditions are not met 
at the end of the three year performance period.
EPS performance conditions and level of vesting
The Committee determines performance conditions for each 
award at the time of making each award and determines 
the basis for calculating normalised EPS. The normalised 
EPS performance conditions applied over a three year 
performance period for PSP awards granted prior to 2009 
have been:
Criteria for normalised EPS Level of vesting 
Less than RPI +5% per year Nil
RPI +5% per year 35%
RPI +8 % per year and above 100%
Vesting between RPI +5% and RPI +8% is straight line.
In respect of annual PSP awards granted on 25 September 
2009 and 6 May 2010 the Committee approved absolute 
normalised EPS performance targets for the three year 
performance period. This took account of consensus broker 
forecasts and the need to set challenging performance targets 
to motivate the highest levels of performance of the executive 
directors in light of deteriorating economic conditions 
prevailing at the time of making the awards.

pence and 9.25 pence is straight line.
TSR performance conditions and level of vesting
The TSR performance conditions applied to PSP awards over 
a three year performance period are generally as follows. The 
comparator group is the FTSE Mid 250 excluding investment 
trusts or as otherwise determined by the Committee.

Details of the directors’ outstanding PSP awards and awards 
made during the 14 month period ended 28 February 2011 are 
shown below in Part B of this report.
Savings Related Share Option Scheme (“Sharesave”)
All UK employees, including the executive directors, are eligible 
to participate in the Company’s all employee HM Revenue and 
Customs approved Sharesave scheme. The Sharesave allows 
participants to make 36 equal monthly instalments under a 
building society savings contract. On maturity of the savings 
contract, participants may use the savings plus interest to 
purchase shares under share options granted at a discount of 
15% to the market price at the start of the savings contract.
Details of the directors’ outstanding Sharesave options are 
shown in Part B of this report. 
Change of control provisions for share schemes
On a change of control, PSP awards vest to the extent that 
the performance conditions, as adjusted for the reduced 
vesting period due to the change of control, have been 
achieved subject to settlement of taxes arising on vesting. The 
Committee would determine a reasonable basis for measuring 
the extent to which the performance conditions have been 
achieved. Sharesave options become exercisable on a change 
of control however the treatment for tax would be subject to 
HM Revenue & Customs regulations that apply at the time.
Shareholding guidelines
The Company does not have a policy requiring the executive 
directors to hold a minimum value of the Company’s shares.
Total value of incentives for Executive Directors
The charts below summarise the key drivers of performance 
and their influence on the overall incentive package for 
the executive directors. In order to illustrate the impact of 
different levels of performance on the composition of total 
remuneration in terms of the proportion of fixed and variable 
remuneration, two notional levels of company share price, 
company and personal performance have been defined. The 
assumptions made for the charts are as follows:
Performance level

LTIP (i.e. PSP) Full vesting

The chart is based on the face values of incentive awards at 
threshold and stretch performance levels (as defined above), 
however actual values of awards that vest under the schemes 
will depend on future share prices at the time the awards vest.

The charts above exclude pensions and the value of Sharesave 
scheme options in which executive directors may voluntarily 
participate. Pension contributions are approved annually by 
the Committee, and vary by executive director. One executive 
director does not receive a pension contribution. The Committee 
intends to review the policy on pensions. The Chief Executive is 
assumed to receive annual LTIP PSP awards at the level of 75% of 
basic salary and other executive directors are assumed to receive 
annual awards at a level of 66% of basic salary.
Remuneration earned by the Executive 
Directors from outside appointments
Significant external appointments of the directors are given in 
the bibliographic details on page 23. The Committee considers 
that the external appointments of the executive directors have 
no detrimental impact on the performance of their duties. 
The Committee has approved that each executive director 
may retain his or her remuneration earned from external 
appointments up to £15,000 per year.
Contracts of Service
The Company’s policy is for executive directors to have contracts 
of employment with notice periods of up to 12 months. The 
Company will not enter into service contracts of more than two 
years duration without obtaining prior shareholder approval. 
Contracts with notice periods in excess of 12 months will only be 
considered at the time of recruitment and would normally be 
structured so that the notice period reduces to a period up to 12 
months over a specified time of service.
Details of the service contracts of the directors at the date of 
signing this report are set out below:
Executive 
Directors

Date

Nigel Newton 24 June 2003 – 12 months
Richard Charkin 10 October 2007 – 12 months
Wendy Pallot 10 March 2011 – 12 months*
*  The service agreement of Wendy Pallot includes that notice 
is three months during the first three months of service 
following which the notice period increases to 12 months.
The service agreements of Richard Charkin and Wendy Pallot 
include terms such that there would be no claim for loss of 
office as a director of the Company resulting from termination 
of their service agreement. The agreement for Wendy Pallot 
includes that the Company may make a payment of basic 
salary in lieu of notice. There are no further specific provisions 
for compensation on early termination of service contracts for 
the executive directors and no automatic right to payments. 
In the event of early termination, the Committee would seek 
to take such steps as necessary to mitigate the loss to the 
Company and to ensure that the executive director observed 
his or her duty to mitigate loss. The Committee considers the 
termination terms of the executive directors to be appropriate 
to avoid rewarding failure on termination.

Non-Executive Directors
The fees of non-executive directors are determined by the Chairman and the executive directors. The fees of the Chairman are determined 
by the Remuneration Committee. The fees and continuance of service of each non-executive director are reviewed at least annually. Non-
executive directors receive a basic fee plus an extra fee for additional responsibilities such as chairing sub-committees. The basic fee and extra 
fee is reviewed annually taking account of benchmark data provided by external remuneration consultants New Bridge Street.
The Non-Executive Directors and Chairman do not participate in the Company’s annual bonus or share incentive schemes 
including Sharesave.

the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for 
the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As more fully explained in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 30, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and 
express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK 
and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements is provided on the APB’s website at www.frc.org.uk/apb/scope/
private.cfm.
Opinion on the financial statements
In our opinion 
 ● the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and the parent company’s affairs as at 28 
February 2011 and of the group’s profit for the period then ended;
 ● the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; 
 ● the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
 ● the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards 
the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 ● the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006; and
 ● the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the financial statements.

a) Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and 
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations endorsed by the European Union (“EU”) 
and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements have been 
prepared under the historical cost convention.
The reporting period has been changed to a February year end to allow for improved access to shareholders and analysts during 
the interim and final reporting season. As a result of this change the amounts presented in the financial statements are for a 
fourteen month period to 28 February 2011 and are not directly comparable to the previous twelve month financial year.
The Company’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position 
are set out in the Business Review on pages 6 to 22. The financial position of the Company, its cash flows and liquidity position 
are described in the Financial Review on pages 14 to 16. In addition, note 22 to the financial statements includes the Company’s 
objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial 
instruments; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
Having made enquiries of senior management and reviewed cashflow forecasts, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that 
the Company and Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The factors 
taken into account include the level of cash reserves, limited impact of economic downturn on book sales and continuing sources 
of revenue. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies set out below, which have been 
consistently applied to all periods. These accounting policies comply with applicable IFRSs and IFRIC interpretations issued, 
effective and endorsed by the EU at the time of preparing these statements.
The Group has adopted IFRS 3 (revised 2008) ‘Business combinations’ which has resulted in a change of accounting policy as 
detailed further in note (n) below. This impacts the treatment of the acquisition made in the period and future acquisitions but is 
not applied retrospectively.
The following Standards and Interpretations, which were also effective for this financial period, have no material impact on the 
financial statements of the Group:
 ● IAS 27 (revised 2008), ‘Consolidated and separate financial statements’; the revised standard provides guidance relating to 
the accounting for non-controlling interests in loss making subsidiaries, the acquisition of non-controlling interests and the 
accounting for subsidiaries when control by the entity is lost.
 ● IAS 28 (amended), ‘Investments in associates’, and IAS 31 (amended), ‘Interests in joint ventures’; the amendment provides 
additional guidance in situations where significant influence or joint control is lost.
 ● IAS 39 (amended), ‘Eligible Hedged Items’; the amendment provides further clarification in the application guidance.
 ● IFRS 2 (amended), ‘Group cash-settled Share-based Payment Transactions’; the amendment clarifies that an entity that 
receives goods or services in a share-based payment arrangement must account for those goods or services regardless of 
which entity in the group settles the transaction.
 ● IFRS 1 (revised 2009), ‘First-time adoption of IFRS’; additional exemptions for first time adopters. 
 ● IFRIC 17, ‘Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners’.
 ● IFRIC 18, ‘Transfers of Assets to Customers’.
 ● Annual Improvements 2009, including IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’ – Amendment; Unit of accounting for goodwill 
impairment testing. The amendment specifies that the required unit for goodwill impairment is not larger than the operating 
segment level as defined in paragraph 5 of IFRS 8 before the permitted aggregation.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations, which have not yet been 
applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective:

 ● IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013). The standard applies a 
consistent approach to classifying financial assets and replaces the numerous categories of financial assets in IAS 39, each 
of which had its own classification criteria. It also results in one impairment method, replacing the numerous impairment 
methods in IAS 39 that arise from the different classification categories. *
 ● IAS 32 ‘Classification of Rights Issues’ (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 February 2010). The amendment 
addresses the accounting for rights issues offered for a fixed amount of foreign currency.
 ● IFRIC 19 ‘Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments’ (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 
2010). The IFRIC addresses the accounting for issues of equity instruments in order to settle, in full or in part, a financial liability.
 ● IFRIC 14 (amended) ‘The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction’ (effective 
1 January 2011) – Amendment; Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement. The amendment permits the benefit of 
early payment of contributions paid to cover minimum funding requirements to be treated as an asset.
 ● IAS 24 ‘Related Party Disclosures’ (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011). The revised standard 
simplifies the disclosure requirements for government-related entities, requires commitments outstanding at the balance 
sheet date to be disclosed and clarifies the definition of a related party.
 ● IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ Disclosures – Transfers of Financial Assets (effective for annual periods beginning 
on or after 1 July 2011) – Amendment. The amendments will require improved disclosures of transfers of financial assets, 
including explaining the possible effects of any risks that may remain with the entity that transferred the assets. The 
amendments also require additional disclosures if a disproportionate amount of transfers are undertaken around the end of 
a reporting period.*
 ● Annual improvements 2010.
 ● IFRS 1 ‘First-time Adoption of IFRS – Amendment; Severe Hyperinflation and Removal of Fixed Dates for First-Time Adopters’.
 ● IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes – Amendment; Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets.’ The amendments are in relation to 
investment properties.
 ● IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013). The new 
standard will replace IAS 27 ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’ and SIC 12 ‘Consolidation – Special Purpose 
Entities’. IFRS 10 retains the principle of control but redefines ‘control’ and provides further guidance on how to apply the 
control principle. *
 ● IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’ (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013). The new standard will 
replace IAS 31 ‘Interests in Joint Ventures’ and SIC 13 ‘Jointly Controlled Entities – Non-monetary contributions by Venturers’ 
and establishes consistent principles for financial reporting for all types of jointly controlled arrangements. IFRS 11 retains 
a similar definition of joint control to IAS 31, but clarifies that a joint arrangement will be either a ‘joint operation’ or a ‘joint 
venture’. *
 ● IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities’ (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013). The 
new standard applies to entities that have interests in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and other unconsolidated 
structured entities and aims to make disclosures in respect of such entities consistent. * 
 ● IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ (effective for annual periods commencing on or after 1 January 2013). The new standard 
provides guidance on measurement of fair value for financial reporting purposes where IFRSs require or permit fair value 
measurements or disclosures about fair value measurements. *
 ● IAS 27 (amended 2011) ‘Separate Financial Statements’ (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013). 
The amendment removes the accounting principles applicable to groups which are now set out in IFRS 10. The amended 
standard contains accounting and disclosure requirements for investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates when 
an entity presents separate financial statements. *
 ● IAS 28 (amended 2011) ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’ (effective for annual periods beginning on or after  
1 January 2013). The amendment applies the equity method of accounting to investments in associates and joint ventures 
and thus eliminates the choice to proportionately consolidate joint ventures that was previously available. *
*  Not yet endorsed by the EU.
There were no Standards and Interpretations which were in issue but not effective at the date of authorisation of these financial 
statements, including the above, that the Directors anticipate will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group 
or the Company.

b) Goodwill and intangible assets
Goodwill, being the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of assets acquired, is recognised as an intangible asset. 
Goodwill is not amortised, but instead is subject to annual impairment reviews. Any impairment losses are recognised immediately in the 
income statement and are not subsequently reversed. Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. 
Negative goodwill is credited to the income statement in the period in which it arises.
Intangible assets are capitalised and amortised over their expected useful lives by equal annual instalments at the following rates:
Publishing relationships – 5%–14% per annum
Imprints – 3%–5% per annum
Subscriber and customer relationships – 6%–17% per annum
Order backlog – 33% per annum
Systems development – 20% per annum
The amortisation is included in administrative expenses.
The separately acquired trademark for the name Bloomsbury Publishing Plc in the US is shown at historical cost and is subject to 
annual impairment reviews. The trademark is deemed to have an indefinite life due to the underlying stability of the industry in 
which it operates. 
c) Revenue
Revenue represents the amount derived from the provision of goods, services and rights falling within the Group’s ordinary activities, 
after deduction of trade discounts, value added tax and anticipated returns. Revenue from book publishing is recognised on delivery 
to retailers. Revenue from the sale of publishing and distribution rights, including film, paperback, electronic, overseas publishing rights 
and sponsorship, is recognised on the delivery of the related content. Revenue from database contracts is recognised in accordance 
with the stages of completion of contractual services provided. The degree of completion is calculated as a proportion of the content 
generated against the contractually agreed milestone, for example number of words generated. Where the degree of completion 
of milestones cannot be reliably measured, revenue is only recognised in full on completion. Revenue from management services 
contracts is recognised at the contractually agreed rate. Revenue from e-book sales is recognised when reported by aggregators.
d) Inventories
Inventories include paper, sheets and bound stock. The cost of work in progress and finished stock represents the amounts 
invoiced to the Group for paper, origination, printing and binding. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. Cost is determined using the weighted average cost method.
e) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Property, plant and equipment are depreciated in order to write down their cost by equal annual instalments over their expected 
useful lives at the following rates: 
Short leasehold improvements – over the remaining life of the lease
Furniture and fittings – 10% per annum
Computer equipment – 20% per annum
Other office equipment – 20% per annum
Motor vehicles – 25% per annum
Depreciation is pro-rated in the years of acquisition and disposal of an asset.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and 
the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.

f) Royalty advances to authors
Advances to authors are included within prepayments and accrued income and are written off to the extent that they are not 
covered by anticipated future sales or firm contracts for subsidiary rights receivable.
g) Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax expense and deferred tax expense.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income 
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and it further excludes 
items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated by using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities 
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using 
the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax 
assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial 
recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a 
transaction which affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the 
Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled 
based upon tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or 
credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to other comprehensive income, in 
which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income. 
h) Foreign currencies
The presentational currency is sterling. The parent Company’s functional currency is sterling. The functional currencies of its 
overseas subsidiaries are Euros, US dollars and Australian dollars. 
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of 
the transactions. Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at closing rates of exchange at the balance 
sheet date. Income statements and cash flows of overseas subsidiary companies are translated into sterling at average exchange 
rates for the period.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign 
entity and translated at the closing rate. All other exchange differences are charged or credited to the income statement.
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of opening net assets and income statements of overseas subsidiary 
companies are charged or credited to other comprehensive income.

i) Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group has become a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. The Group’s financial assets and liabilities are as below:
Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method less any provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established 
when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms 
of the receivables. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial 
reorganisation and changes to debtor payment patterns are considered indicators that the trade receivable may be impaired. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and at bank and other short-term deposits held by the Group, repayable  
on demand.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. 
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost in the balance sheet. They are tested for impairment when there is objective 
evidence of impairment. Any impairment losses are recognised in the income statement in the period they occur.
j) Operating leases
Operating leases are leases where substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the related asset are not 
transferred to the Group. Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement as they fall due. Stamp duty is capitalised 
in leasehold improvements and amortised over the life of the lease.
k) Pension costs
Pension costs relating to defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the income statement in the period for which 
contributions are payable. 
Until 1997 a subsidiary company operated a defined benefit pension scheme. The liability in respect of the defined benefit pension 
scheme is the present value of the defined benefit obligations, calculated using the projected unit credit method at each balance 
sheet date by the scheme actuary, less the fair value of the scheme’s assets.
The current service cost, interest on scheme liabilities and all actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the income statement.

l) Share-based payment
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payment instruments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payment 
transactions are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of equity-settled share-
based payments is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s 
estimate of shares that will eventually vest. 
Options granted under the Group’s share option schemes and Sharesave scheme are equity settled, as are awards granted under 
the Group’s share appreciation rights scheme. The fair values of such options have been calculated using the Black–Scholes 
model or a modified version of the same, based on publicly available market data. 
Awards granted under the Group’s performance share plan are equity settled. Due to the Total Shareholder Return performance 
condition that applies to half of any award granted under the plan, the fair value of awards has been calculated using the Monte-
Carlo style stochastic model.
m) Employee share ownership plans
The Company operates an employee benefit trust and has de facto control of shares held by the trust and bears their benefits and 
risks. The Group records certain assets and liabilities of the trust as its own. Finance costs and administrative expenses are charged 
as they accrue.
n) Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries at the period end. The results of 
the subsidiaries are accounted for in the income statement from the date of acquisition. 
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies to obtain economic 
benefit to the Group. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of 
disposal, as appropriate.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The consideration 
transferred is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued, contingent consideration and liabilities 
incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. 
Costs directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. This is a change of accounting policy following the adoption of 
the revisions to IFRS 3. Previously costs directly attributable to the acquisition were included as part of the cost of the acquisition.
Changes in contingent consideration arising from additional information, obtained within one year of the acquisition date, 
about facts or circumstances that existed at the acquisition date are recognised as an adjustment to goodwill. Other changes in 
contingent consideration are recognised through profit or loss, unless the contingent consideration is classified as equity. In such 
circumstances, changes are recognised within equity. This is a change of accounting policy following the adoption of the revisions 
to IFRS3. Previously all changes to contingent consideration were recognised as an adjustment to goodwill.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are initially measured at fair 
value at the acquisition date irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line 
with those used by other members of the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.

o) Segmental reporting
Segments are identified based on internal reporting to the chief operating decision maker, which has been identified as the 
Company Board. A business segment is a group of assets and operations that provide a product or service and that is subject to 
risks and returns that are different from other business segments. A geographic segment is a group of assets and operations that 
provide a product or service within a particular economic environment and that is subject to risks and returns that are different 
from segments operating in different economic environments. There is no difference between the basis of measurement of 
segment amounts included in the management accounts and the basis of measurement of those amounts included in the financial 
statements. The Company Board reviews the Group consolidated commentary. This reflects the geographic performance of the 
operations in the UK, North America, Continental Europe and Australia down to profit before taxation and also the performance of 
the Trade and Specialist divisions, down to the profit before investment income, finance costs and tax line.
p) Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether 
there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount 
of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash 
flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which 
the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments and the risks 
specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset (or cash generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an 
expense immediately. 
q) Dividends
Dividend payments are recognised as liabilities once they are appropriately authorised and no longer at the discretion of the 
Company.

r) Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including 
reasonable expectations of future events. The resultant estimates will, by definition, not necessarily equal the related actual 
results and may require adjustment in subsequent accounting periods. The estimates and judgements that may cause a material 
adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the next financial year are:
Book returns
As books are returnable by customers, the Group makes a provision against books sold in the accounting period which is then 
carried forward and offset against trade receivables in the balance sheet in anticipation of book returns received subsequent to 
the period end. The provision is calculated by reference to historical returns rates and expected future returns.
Author advances
A provision is made by the Group against published title advances which may not be covered by anticipated future sales, 
paperback editions or contracts for subsidiary rights receivable. At the end of each financial year a review is carried out on all 
published titles advances. If it is unlikely that royalties from future sales, paperback sales or subsidiary rights will fully earn down 
the advance, a provision is made to the income statement for the difference between the carrying value and the anticipated 
recoverable amount from future earnings.
Inventory
At the end of each financial year a review is carried out on all published titles where inventory is held. A provision is made by the 
Group against unsold inventory on a title by title basis, with regard to historical net sales and expected future net sales, to value 
the inventories at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Impairment reviews
IFRS requires management to undertake an annual test for impairment of indefinite life assets and, for finite life assets, to test for 
impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The 
Group currently undertakes an annual impairment test covering goodwill and other indefinite life assets and also reviews finite 
life assets to consider whether a full impairment review is required. 
Intangible assets recoverability is an area involving management judgement, requiring assessment as to whether the carrying 
value of assets can be supported by the net present value of future cash flows derived from such assets using cash flow projections 
which have been discounted at an appropriate rate. In calculating the net present value of the future cash flows, certain 
assumptions are required to be made. Note 9 details the assumptions used.

1. Segmental analysis
As the main thrust of the Group’s growth is to develop its international publishing strategy, the internal reporting to the chief 
operating decision maker is by geographical segments. Management has determined the operating segments based on these 
reports. All segments derive their revenue from book publishing, sale of publishing and distribution rights, sponsorship and 
database contracts. The analysis by geographical segment is shown below.

Highlighted items charged to profit before taxation comprise significant non-cash charges and/or non-recurring items which are 
highlighted in the income statement because, in the opinion of the Directors, separate disclosure is helpful in understanding the 
underlying performance of the business.
The goodwill impairment charge relates to the investment in Berlin Verlag. This was the result of an impairment review assessing 
the carrying value of the investment, which took account of economic factors in Germany, in particular the weakness of the retail 
market there, and forecasts not supporting the carrying value. With the new management team and structure, there will be a 
rationalisation of the publishing programme and continuing reduction of Berlin’s cost base as part of the plan to increase the 
profitability of the business.
Legal costs of £25,000 were incurred in relation to the acquisition of Duckworth Academic. 
The Group has incurred costs of £196,000 relating to the planned relocation of its Head Office to Bedford Square in August 2011, 
including professional fees and additional rental expense while the new premises are refurbished.
Aborted acquisition costs of £313,000 related to professional fees in connection with an acquisition of a business which did not go 
ahead following the due diligence process.
Restructuring costs of £247,000 have been incurred as a result of the strategic global reorganisation of the Bloomsbury Group.

Pension costs
The pension costs summarised above of £824,000 (2009: £561,000) relate to the Group’s defined contribution and defined benefit 
pension arrangements. 
Defined contribution plans
The Group operates defined contribution retirement benefit plans for all qualifying employees.
The total cost charged to income of £824,000 (2009: £561,000) represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates 
specified in the rules of the schemes. At 28 February 2011 there were prepaid contributions of £12,000 (31 December 2009: £3,000).
Defined benefit plan
A subsidiary company operates a defined benefit scheme for some staff. Accrual of benefits ceased in 1997, with the scheme now 
operated as a closed fund. There is no obligation in respect of medical costs. A full actuarial valuation was carried out as at  
1 January 2010 and updated to 28 February 2011 by a qualified independent actuary.
At the date of the last completed independent actuarial valuation, which was 1 January 2010, the market value of the assets of the 
scheme was £388,000. The actuary advised that at that date the actuarial valuation of the assets of the scheme was sufficient to 
cover 76% of the benefits that had accrued to members. The scheme is actuarially valued every three years. The next valuation of 
the scheme will be as at 1 January 2013.
Contributions are paid by the employer at the rate of £1,600 per month, plus expenses as and when required to cover any 
expenses of the scheme. Contributions paid to the scheme during the period were £22,000 (year ended 31 December 2009: 
£42,000. This included £23,000 of scheme cost for 2008 and 2009). The Directors’ best estimate of the contribution to be paid for in 
the year ended February 2012 is £40,000. 
The Group’s policy is to fund the deficit in the scheme by additional contributions to meet the scheme’s commitment to 
members.
The major assumptions used by the actuary for the update were as follows:

(c) Factors affecting tax charge for future years
At the balance sheet date, the expected standard rate of UK corporation tax was to be reduced to 27%, effective from 1 April 2011, 
by virtue of previously substantively enacted legislation. The financial statements reflect this rate being used in providing for any 
deferred tax assets and liabilities at 28 February 2011. The standard rate is however to be reduced to 26% with effect from 1 April 2011, 
following a subsequent announcement made by the government in March 2011 and there are also planned further reductions of 
1% p.a. that will result in a standard rate of 23% at 1 April 2014. The reduction to 26% has been substantively enacted however the 
further reductions have not been substantively enacted at the date of publication of these financial statements.
Details of the Group’s deferred tax assets are shown in note 11.

6. Dividends
For the prior year
A final dividend for 2009 of 3.65 pence per share (£2,698,000) was paid to the equity shareholders on 1 July 2010, being the 
amount proposed by the Directors, and subsequently approved by the shareholders at the 2010 Annual General Meeting (2009: 
final dividend for 2008 paid in 2009 of 3.47 pence per share, £2,554,000).
For the current period
On 16 November 2010 an interim dividend of 0.81 pence per share (£597,423) was paid to the equity shareholders (2009: 0.78 
pence per share, £574,000).
The Directors declared a second interim dividend of 3.91 pence per share, which was paid on 1 June 2011 to shareholders on the 
register at close of business on 3 May 2011. The second interim dividend will be £2,825,000.
The Directors propose that a final dividend of 0.28 pence per share was paid to the equity shareholders on 27 September 2011. 
Based on the number of shares currently in issue, the final dividend will be £207,000. This dividend is subject to approval by the 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and has not been included as a liability in these financial statements.
7.  Earnings per share
The basic earnings per share has been calculated by reference to earnings of £2,229,000 (2009: £4,981,000) and a weighted 
average number of Ordinary Shares in issue after deducting 88,760 (2009: 88,760) shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust of 
73,735,046 (2009: 73,594,863). The diluted earnings per share has been calculated by reference to earnings of £2,229,000 (2009: 
£4,981,000) and a weighted average number of Ordinary Shares of 73,735,046 (2009: 73,920,795) which takes account of share 
options and awards.

Goodwill is not amortised, but instead is subject to annual impairment reviews. Any impairment losses are recognised immediately 
in the income statement. The carrying value is determined on the basis of value in use.
On 1 November 2010 A&C Black acquired the business and net assets of Duckworth Academic for a cash consideration of 
£1,100,000. It was renamed Bristol Classical Press and is being managed under the Bloomsbury Academic imprint. Bloomsbury has 
identified academic and professional publishing as a growth area for the Group. Bringing Bristol Classical Press into Bloomsbury 
Academic is an important stepping stone in the development of our publishing in this area. The acquisition has been accounted 
for using the acquisition method of accounting. The goodwill of £28,000 and intangibles of £930,000 arising on the acquisition 
have been capitalised in the Group balance sheet.
 
Under the Sale and Purchase Agreement the seller has given indemnifications in respect of any obligations and legal cost arising out 
of non-payment of due and committed advances, royalties and outstanding distribution and agency contracts at the time of sale.

Identifiable intangible assets of £930,000 consist of publishing rights of £849,000 and imprints of £81,000. The publishing rights 
have a useful life of fourteen years and imprints thirty years. The goodwill is attributable to the expected profitability of the 
acquired business and the synergies expected to arise after the acquisition. The goodwill arising on the acquisition of £28,000 is 
expected to be fully deductible for tax purposes.
The following pro forma summary presents the Group as if Duckworth Academic was acquired on 1 January 2010.
The pro forma amounts do not include any possible synergies from the acquisition. The pro forma information is provided for 
comparative purposes only and does not necessarily reflect the actual results that would have occurred, nor is it necessarily 
indicative of future results of operations of the combined companies.

The carrying amount of the Group’s goodwill relates to the following geographical segments:

28 February
2011
£’000
Year 
ended
31 December
2009
£’000
United Kingdom 22,413 22,385
North America 3,251 3,290
Continental Europe – 1,578
25,664 27,253
The carrying amount of trademarks of £111,000 (2009: £111,000) which have an indefinite useful life is included in the North 
American cash-generating unit. 
In testing goodwill for impairment, the recoverable amount of each geographical segment’s assets is calculated on the basis of 
future cash flows, whilst also taking into account past performance for well established operations, such as in the United Kingdom. 
The operating performance of each segment is based on the Board’s approved budgets for the year ending 28 February 2012 for 
all segments and extrapolated forecasts for subsequent years up to 2018 for Continental Europe and up to 2028 for North America 
and the United Kingdom. 
Forecasts greater than five years can be justified on the basis that the remaining carrying value of goodwill largely relates to 
acquired business units which have been established for over one hundred years. This is further supported by the valuations 
which were required to be undertaken as a result of the acquisitions made, and the useful lives of some of the separately 
identifiable intangibles acquired on recent acquisitions, such as imprints and certain publishing relationships, which were 
assessed in the valuations as twenty years or greater. 
The following key assumptions in the value in use calculations were applied to each geographical segment:
 ● The discount rates used were 9.5%–11.0% (2009 8.5%–9.5%) for the United Kingdom, 10.5% (2009: 10.5%) for North 
America and 11% (2009: 11%) for Continental Europe. These are justified, as although current interest rates remain low, the 
recessionary environment has increased commercial risk.
 ● Gross margins have been based on historic performance and have been applied on a consistent basis to future projections, 
other than for Continental Europe where projected cost savings at gross margin level have been taken into account.
 ● The budgeted revenue and cost increases for the year to February 2012 were based on the Group’s approved budgets.
 ● Forecast revenue and cost increases for subsequent years were based on growth rates applied to approved budgets of one 
year and other factors which management consider should be taken into account, such as growth in the backlist revenues, 
development of new revenue streams within each geographical segment and cost savings following ongoing operational 
reviews, as follows:
United 
Kingdom 
North 
America
Continental
 Europe
Revenue growth after February 2012 3.5%–15.8% 5.5% 4.0% 
Overhead growth after February 2012 1.5%–11.9% 4.0% 3.0% 
The Directors feel the growth rates, although higher than industry averages, are justifiable on the basis of past performance and 
history of growth in the Group. The rates include Berg and Bloomsbury Professional who have higher growth rates than the rest of 
the Group following the launch of online platforms. 
The Group’s impairment review is sensitive to a change in the key assumptions used, most notably the discount rates and growth 
rates. Based on the Group’s sensitivity analysis a reasonably possible change in the growth rate of the Walker, Wisden and 
Duckworth Cash Generating Units (CGU's) could cause impairment. In addition a reasonably possible change in the discount rate 
of the Wisden and Duckworth CGU’s could also result in impairment.

Walker is included in the North American segment. Wisden and Duckworth are included in the UK segment.
The fair value of Walker is 6.12% or £0.4m above its carrying value, but a decrease of 1% on the variable elements of the business 
would cause the value in use to fall below the carrying value. 
The fair value of Wisden is 5.92% or £0.18m above its carrying value, but a decrease of 1% on the variable elements of the 
business would cause the value in use to fall below the carrying value. Likewise a 1% increase in the discount rate used would also 
cause the value in use to fall below the carrying value.
The fair value of Duckworth is 2.87% or £0.03m above its carrying value, but a decrease of 1% on the variable elements of the 
business would cause the value in use to fall below the carrying value. Likewise a 1% increase in the discount rate used would also 
cause the value in use to fall below the carrying value.

An impairment review assessing the carrying value of the investments, which took account of economic factors in Germany, in 
particular the weakness of the retail market there, and forecasts not supporting the carrying value was carried out in February 
2011 and the investment in Berlin Verlag was written down by £7,452,000 (2009: £723,000 write down of investment in Bloomsbury 
Publishing Inc). In testing impairment of investments, the recoverable amount is calculated on the basis of future cash flows. 
Operating performance is based on the Board’s approved budgets for the period ending 28 February 2012 and extrapolated 
forecasts for subsequent years up to 2023 using a growth rate of 2% – 4% and a discount rate of 12%.

A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the amount of tax losses of Bloomsbury Publishing Inc that the Group’s 
projections indicate will be recovered within three years of the balance sheet date. Previously recognised deferred tax assets for 
BV Berlin Verlag GmbH have been written off due to the impairment of the parent’s investment in that subsidiary.

These deferred tax assets are recoverable against available taxable profits of the same type or from the same trades in future 
years. They have not been recognised in the accounts as recovery is not sufficiently certain.
The gross tax losses on which no deferred asset has been recognised were £4,745,484 (2009: £3,555,000). This relates to tax losses 
for certain subsidiaries in the US, Germany and UK. The losses in the US can be carried forward for twenty years, whilst the losses in 
Germany and the UK can be carried forward indefinitely.

The non-current amounts owed by group undertakings represent loan balances due from subsidiary companies. These loans are 
technically repayable on demand, however there is no intention to demand repayment of the loans within the next twelve months. 
Trade receivables comprise amounts receivable from the sale of books. Payments are received on the basis of contracted 
payment terms with the distributors and for co-editions according to contractual agreements. At 28 February 2011 the average 
number of days’ credit taken for sales of books by the Group was 96 days (31 December 2009: 107 days), and the average number 
of days’ credit taken by the Company was 92 days (31 December 2009: 119 days). The majority of trade receivables are secured 
by credit insurance, third party distributors and letters of credit. At the period end an allowance has been made for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods of £745,000 (2009: £1,044,000) by the Group and of £219,000 (2009: £388,000) by the 
Company. This allowance has been made by reference to specific debts, past default experience, trading history and the current 
economic environment. The decrease in the period-end provision on trade receivables since 31 December 2009 was £299,000 
(2009: increase £237,000) for the Group and £169,000 (2009: £88,000) for the Company. The impairment loss was £171,000 (2009: 
£107,000) for the Group and £99,000 (2009: credit £28,000) for the Company. The £470,000 difference between the provision 
movement and the income statement charge for the Group in the period ended 28 February 2011 was due in the main to usage 
of the provision during the period. The £268,000 difference for the Company was due to usage of the provision during the period. 
As books are returnable by customers, the Group makes a provision against books sold in the accounting period which is then 
carried forward in trade receivables in the balance sheet in anticipation of book returns received subsequent to the period end. 
A provision for the Group of £6.51m (2009: £6.51m), at margin, for future returns relating to the current period and prior year 
sales has been included in trade receivables in the balance sheet at 28 February 2011. This included a provision for the Company 
of £2.21m (2009: £2.14m). A 1% change in the closing returns provision rates would have an impact of £0.31m for the Group 
(2009: £0.26m). In addition to books returned by customers during 2009, there was a write-back in the returns provision relating 
to changes in assumptions made in respect of the provision brought forward from the prior year which, as a result of the level 
of returns actually received during the period, is no longer required. The value of the write-back to the income statement is £nil 
(year to 31 December 2009: £0.58m).

The change in the basis of the calculation takes account of the reassessment of likely returns rates based on the level of actual 
returns in the period.
The Group makes a provision against published titles advances which may not be covered by anticipated future sales, paperback 
editions or contracts for subsidiary rights receivable. At the end of each financial year a review is carried out on all published titles 
advances. If it is unlikely that royalties from future sales, paperback sales or subsidiary rights will fully earn down the advance, a 
provision is charged to the income statement for the difference between the carrying value and the anticipated recoverable amount 
from future earnings (“advance provision”). The advance provision charged to the income statement for the Group was £3.67m for 
the fourteen months to 28 February 2011 (year to 31 December 2009: £3.44m). The provision for the Company has been increased by 
£0.88m (year to 31 December 2009: £1.03m). The net advance is included within prepayments and accrued income.

the average middle-market price of the Ordinary Share for the five dealing days immediately preceding the award date or 
the middle-market price on the dealing day before the award date. The vesting period is generally three years and the level 
of vesting is subject to the achievement of Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) and Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) performance 
conditions (see Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 39 to 45) approved by the Remuneration Committee. Except in certain 
circumstances, awards lapse if the employee leaves the Group.

Awards made under the PSP Plan vest on the third anniversary of grant and a three year expected life has been assumed. The 
expected volatility was based on Bloomsbury’s share price volatility over the period prior to grant equal in length to the expected 
three year life. Half of any award is subject to an EPS performance condition (which is not factored into the valuation) and the 
other half is subject to a Total Shareholder Return condition whereby performance is compared to the FTSE Mid 250 companies 
(excluding Investment Trusts) over a three year period from the date of grant, with 35% of shares subject to this performance 
condition vesting for a median ranking rising to 100% for an upper quartile ranking. The discount for this TSR condition is 
calculated at the date of grant using the “Monte-Carlo” model.
2009 Conditional Share Awards

2006 Share Appreciation Rights Scheme (“The SAR Scheme”)
Under the rules of the SAR Scheme awards granted provide participants the right to buy a number of Company shares at their 
nominal value. The awards have an exercise price which is set at the time of granting the awards and the number of shares that can 
be acquired under the award is that which has a value equal to the excess of the market price of the Company’s shares at date of 
exercise over the exercise price for the award. SAR awards are exercisable for four years after the vesting date subject to satisfying an 
Earnings per Share condition which is tested at the date of exercise.

2007 Unapproved Employee Share Option Scheme (“the 2007 ESOS”) 
During 2007 the Company introduced an unapproved employee share option scheme to be funded from shares purchased by 
the Company in the market. Under the rules of the 2007 ESOS, a participant will be able to exercise the options at an option price 
agreed at the grant date. The awards have generally been exercisable up to 3 years from the date of grant and subject to the 
achievement of performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee. No Awards were made prior to 18 December 2007.

The Bloomsbury Employee Benefit Trust 2005 (“the EBT”)
The EBT is an independent discretionary trust established to acquire issued shares of the Company to satisfy any of the share 
based incentive schemes and plans of the Company. All employees of the Group are potential beneficiaries of the EBT. At

included in the financial statements of the Group. The market value of the 88,760 shares at 28 February 2011 was £106,000 (2009: 
£112,000). Whilst the trustee has power to subscribe for Ordinary Shares and to acquire Ordinary shares in the market or from 
treasury, it is not permitted to hold more than five percent of the issued share capital without prior approval of the shareholders.
As at the date of signing this Annual Report, the Trust held 1,600,610 ordinary shares of 1.25 pence being approximately 2.2%

19. Commitments and contingent liabilities
The Group is committed to paying royalty advances to authors under publishing contracts during subsequent financial years. At 
28 February 2011 this commitment amounted to £15,115,000 (2009, £14,902,000).
The Group is implementing a new centralised publishing and distribution workflow system for which it has a commitment of 
£250,000 (2009: £nil).
The Group is also committed to paying £1,285,000 to cover the refurbishment cost of the new offices at Bedford Square (2009: £nil).
There is a contingent consideration for the 2008 acquisition of Oxford International Publishers Limited t/a Berg Publishers. It is 
based on the average revenues for the Berg Fashion Library element of the business payable in 2014 and 2015 up to a maximum 
of £1,000,000. None of the contingent consideration has been recognised as a reliable measurement cannot be ascertained due 
to the timescales the contingent consideration is based on.
20. Post balance sheet events
The Directors declared a second interim dividend of 3.91 pence per share (£2,825,000), which was paid on 1 June 2011 to 
shareholders on the register at close of business on 3 May 2011.
The Directors propose that a final dividend of 0.28 pence per share (2009: 3.65 pence per share) will be paid to the equity shareholders on 27 
September 2011 to Ordinary Shareholders on the register at close of business on 26 August 2011. Based on the number of shares currently 
in issue, excluding shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust, the final dividend will be £202,000 (2009: £2,689,000). This dividend is subject to 
approval by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and has not been included as a liability in these financial statements.
21. Parent company result
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present the

items and after impairment of the investment in Berlin Verlag of £7,452,000 (2009: £723,000 impairment of the investment in 
Bloomsbury Publishing Inc) and partial write off of the inter-company balance with Belin Verlag of £1,800,000 (2009: £nil) as a 
result of the impairment review (note 10). The Company’s profit for the period before the impairment of the investment and 
inter-company write off and after highlighted items was £3,064,000 (2009: £3,395,000). The Company’s total comprehensive

2. Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Group’s 
income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control 
market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk. 
The Group’s activities expose it mainly to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest 
rates. The Group incurs costs in the same currencies as it earns revenue creating some degree of natural hedging. 
The Group does not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes. 
The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise 
potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. Risk management is carried out by Group Treasury under policies 
approved by the Board of Directors. Group Treasury monitors the distribution of its cash assets so as to control exposure to the 
relative performance of any particular territory, currency or institution.
The Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as policies covering specific areas, such as funding, 
foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and investment of excess liquidity.
(i) Interest rate risk
The Group has significant interest bearing assets in the form of cash and cash equivalents, as such cash flows are dependent on 
changes in market interest rates. 
The Group maintains a low risk stance to investing surplus cash balances and does not allow speculative trading or investment 
and invests surplus funds only in investments that meet certain criteria which include the following:
 ● Invest utilising permitted instruments as authorised by the Board
 ● Are held at a permitted institution
 ● Have a defined maximum maturity date which is no longer than twelve months unless a UK Government bond
 ● Are denominated in sterling, euro, US dollars or AUS dollars
 ● Pay interest at a fixed, floating or discount rate
The Group has financial assets comprising cash and short-term bank deposits of £36,876,000 at 28 February 2011 (2009: 
£35,036,000). The Company has financial assets comprising cash and short-term bank deposits of £29,010,000 at 28 February 2011 
(2009: £31,084,000). Short-term bank deposits are at fixed rates, and the maturity terms range between one day and one month 
(2009: four days and three months). Cash at bank is at variable rates. The average rate of interest on cash deposits for the Group 
and the Company during the period ended 28 February 2011 was 1.08% (2009: 2.6%).

Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The Group derived the following sensitivities to assess the impact of changes in interest rates, based on the effect of the market 
volatility in the current climate and the previous 12 months:
2011
£’000
2009
£’000
Impact on equity
1% increase in base rate of interest (2009: 3%) 369 1,051
0.5% decrease in base rate of interest (2009: 3%) (184) (1,051)
Impact on profit or loss
1% increase in base rate of interest (2009: 3%) 369 1,051
0.5% decrease in base rate of interest (2009: 3%) (184) (1,051)
(ii) Currency risk
The Company believes in its current circumstances that the Group’s risk from foreign currency exposure is limited and no 
active currency risk management by hedging is considered necessary, as a significant proportion of revenues are matched by 
expenditure in the same local currency creating some degree of natural hedging.
Of the Group’s total financial assets of £59,421,000 (2009: £58,067,000), comprising certain receivables as above and cash and cash 
equivalents, £6,775,000 is denominated in US dollars (2009: £5,705,000), £3,010,000 is denominated in euros (2009: £3,736,000) 
and £1,052,000 is denominated in Australian dollars (2009: £nil). Of the Group’s total financial liabilities of £26,652,000 (2009: 
£20,951,000), £2,479,000 is denominated in US dollars (2009: £1,851,000), £2,715,000 is denominated in euros (2009: £2,110,000) and 
£1,978,000 is denominated in Australian dollars (2009: £nil). 
Of the Company’s total financial assets of £54,959,000 (2009: £55,243,000), comprising certain receivables as above and cash and 
cash equivalents, £506,000 is denominated in US dollars (2009: £1,010,000), £314,000 is denominated in euros (2009: £432,000) 
and £3,000 is denominated in Australian dollars (2009: £nil). Of the Company’s total financial liabilities of £20,220,000 (2009: 
£15,775,000), £2,000 is denominated in US dollars (2009: £94,000) and £nil is denominated in euros (2009: £108,000). 
The foreign exchange gain on receivables was £231,000 (2009: gain £174,000) for the Group and the Company.
No financial assets or liabilities are denominated in currencies other than sterling, US dollars, euros and Australian dollars.

3. Credit risk 
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables of £21,378,000 (2009: £21,601,000) and rights income 
receivable of £1,167,000 (2009: £1,430,000), the majority of which is secured by credit insurance, third party distributors and letters 
of credit. The Company’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables of £8,175,000 (2009, £9,034,000) and rights 
income receivable of £882,000 (2009: £1,037,000), the majority of which is secured by credit insurance, third party distributor and 
letters of credit. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the 
Group’s management based on the trading experience and the current economic environment. The movement in the allowance 
during the period is shown in note 13.
The majority of trade receivables is due on the basis of set contracted payment terms with the distributors and co-edition 
contractual agreements and therefore falls within due dates.
Although the Group holds the majority of its deposits with two financial institutions, the credit risk is limited because these are 
banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group determines its concentration of credit risk based on the individual characteristics of its customers and publicly 
available knowledge of specific circumstances affecting those customers.
The Group has a significant concentration of credit risk due to its use of third party distributors. This risk has however been 
mitigated as significant amounts outstanding through the UK distributors are secured by credit insurance and letters of credit. In 
addition, credit risk for significant amounts outstanding through the distributors in Europe and USA of £7.7m at the period end 
rests with the distributors (2009: £5.7m). Credit limits are set by the distributors for customers based on a combination of payment 
history and third party credit references. Credit limits are reviewed on a regular basis in conjunction with debt ageing and 
collection history. The distributors belong to established international groups whose business includes a number of publishing 
interests and clients.
20234-02 BLOOMSBURY BACK.indd   101 29/06/2011   09:18:04 20234.04   29/06/11   Proof 9
Bloomsbury Publishing Plc 102
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk, including trade receivables, rights income receivable and cash and cash equivalents, 
is £59,421,000 (2009: £58,067,000). The Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk, including trade receivables, amounts owed by 
group undertakings, rights income receivable and cash and cash equivalents, is £56,759,000 (2009: £55,243,000).
4. Liquidity risk
The Directors do not consider that the Group currently has an exposure to liquidity risk, as the Group has no borrowing and has 
sufficient cash deposits to meet its debts as they fall due for the foreseeable future.
Cash flow budgets and forecasts are prepared by the operating entities of the Group, aggregated for the Group and regularly 
reviewed by the Board, and the actual cash position of the Group and each entity is compared monthly against budget. This 
allows management to ensure that each operating entity and the Group have sufficient cash to meet operational needs.
Surplus cash held by the operating entities over and above the balance required for working capital management is invested in 
interest bearing accounts. 
The Group’s financial liabilities are trade payables, accruals and other payables, as shown above in this note in the table under 
Categories of financial instruments. Apart from other payables due after one year, as shown in that table, the other financial 
liabilities shown in the table are due within one year.
Fair value of financial instruments
There is no material difference between the fair value and book value of financial assets and liabilities. 
23. Related party transactions

Company Information & Notice of AGM
Notes: 
1.  THIS DOCUMENT IS IMPORTANT AND REQUIRES YOUR IMMEDIATE ATTENTION. If you are in any doubt as to the 
action you should take, you are recommended to seek your own financial advice immediately from your stockbroker, bank 
manager, solicitor, accountant, fund manager or other appropriate independent financial adviser authorised under the 
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.
2.  If you sell or have sold or otherwise transferred all of your ordinary shares, you should send this document together with the 
accompanying Form of Proxy as soon as possible to the purchaser or transferee or to the stockbroker, bank or other agent 
through whom the sale or transfer was effected for delivery to the purchaser or the transferee.
3.  Explanatory statements relating to the Ordinary and Special Business of the Annual General Meeting are contained in the 
Directors’ Report on pages 31 and 32 of the Annual Report and Accounts for the fourteen months ended 28 February 2011.
4.  Only the holders of ordinary shares are entitled to attend the meeting and vote. A member entitled to attend and vote may 
appoint one or more proxies to attend, speak and vote on his behalf. A proxy need not be a member of the Company. A 
form of proxy is enclosed for your use. Further copies of the form of proxy may be obtained from the registered office of the 
Company.
5.  If a member wishes his proxy to speak on his behalf at the Meeting, he or she will need to appoint his own choice of proxy 
(who is not the Chairman) and give instructions directly to the proxy. The completion and return of a form of proxy will 
enable a shareholder to vote at the General Meeting without having to be present at the General Meeting, but will not 
preclude him or her from attending the General Meeting and voting in person if he or she should subsequently decide  
to do so. 
6.  A member may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to different 
shares. A member may not appoint more than one proxy to exercise rights attached to any one share. To appoint more 
than one proxy, please sign and date the form of proxy and attach a schedule listing the names and addresses (in block 
letters) of all your proxies, the number of shares in respect of which each proxy is appointed (which, in aggregate, should 
not exceed the number of shares held by you) and indicating how you wish each proxy to vote or abstain from voting. If you 
wish to appoint the Chairman as one of your multiple proxies, insert “Chairman of the Meeting” in the box which is used to 
identify the name of the proxy on the relevant proxy card.
7.  To be valid, the enclosed form of proxy must be lodged with the Company’s Registrars, Capita Registrars, not later than 48 
hours before the time appointed for the holding of the Annual General Meeting. 
8.  Shareholders included on the register of members (in relation to ordinary shares held in CREST, pursuant to Regulation 41 
of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001) at 6pm on 9 August 2011 will be entitled to attend and vote at the Annual 
General Meeting in respect of the number of ordinary shares registered in their name at that time. Changes to the register 
of members after that time will be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting. 
9.  Any person to whom this notice is sent who is a person nominated under section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 to enjoy 
information rights (a “Nominated Person”) may, under an agreement between him/her and the shareholder by whom he/
she was nominated, have a right to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy for the Annual General 
Meeting. If a Nominated Person has no such proxy appointment right or does not wish to exercise it, he/she, under any such 
agreement, has a right to give instructions to the shareholder as to the exercise of voting rights.
10. The statement of the rights of shareholders in relation to the appointment of proxies does not apply to Nominated Persons. 
The rights described in this regard can only be exercised by shareholders of the Company.

Notes to Notice of Annual General Meeting
11.  Shareholders should note that it is possible that, pursuant to requests made by shareholders of the Company under section 527 
of the Companies Act 2006, the Company may be required to publish on a website a statement setting out any matter relating 
to: (i) the audit of the Company’s accounts (including the auditor’s report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid 
before the Annual General Meeting; or (ii) any circumstance connected with an auditor of the Company ceasing to hold office 
since the previous meeting at which annual accounts and reports were laid in accordance with section 437 of the Companies 
Act 2006. The Company may not require the shareholders requesting any such website publication to pay its expenses in 
complying with sections 527 or 528 of the Companies Act 2006. Where the Company is required to place a statement on a 
website under section 527 of the Companies Act 2006, it must forward the statement to the Company’s auditor not later than 
the time when it makes the statement available on the website. The business which may be dealt with at the Annual General 
Meeting includes any statement that the Company has been required under section 527 of the Companies Act 2006 to publish 
on a website.
12.  In order to facilitate voting by corporate representatives at the meeting, arrangements will be put in place at the meeting 
so that (i) if a corporate shareholder has appointed the chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative to vote on a 
poll in accordance with the directions of all of the other corporate representatives for that shareholder at the meeting, then 
on a poll those corporate representatives will give voting directions to the chairman and the chairman will vote (or withhold 
a vote) as corporate representative in accordance with those directions; and (ii) if more than one corporate representative 
for the same corporate shareholder attends the meeting but the corporate shareholder has not appointed the chairman of 
the meeting as its corporate representative, a designated corporate representative will be nominated, from those corporate 
representatives who attend, who will vote on a poll and the other corporate representatives will give voting directions to that 
designated corporate representative. Corporate shareholders are referred to the guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Secretaries and Administrators on proxies and corporate representatives (www.icsa.org.uk) for further details of this procedure. 
The guidance includes a sample form of appointment letter if the chairman is being appointed as described in (i) above.
13.  In the case of joint registered holders, the signature of one holder will be accepted and the vote of the senior who tenders a 
vote, whether in person or proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders. For this purpose, 
seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names stand on the register of members in respect of the relevant 
joint holding.
14.  Copies of the following documents will be available for inspection at the Company’s registered office, 36 Soho Square, W1D 3QY, 
during usual business hours on any weekday, Saturdays and public holidays excepted, from the date of this notice until the date of 
the Annual General Meeting and at the place of the Annual General Meeting for 15 minutes prior to and during the meeting:
 ● Copies of the service agreements under which Directors of the Company are employed by the Company or its 
subsidiaries
 ● Copies of letters of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors
 ● A copy of the Articles of Association of the Company.
 ● the terms of reference of the Audit Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the Nominations Committee of  
the Board.

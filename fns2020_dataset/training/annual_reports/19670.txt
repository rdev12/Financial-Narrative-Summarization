STRATEGIC REPORT
4 Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2015 Five reasons to invest in Spire Healthcare
Attractive and fast-growing market
The UK private healthcare market is expected to  
grow as the persistent supply and demand gap in  
publicly funded healthcare continues to widen, resulting  
in longer waiting lists and increasing the restriction of the 
availability of procedures by the NHS. We have a stable 
platform for the future and are seeing real evidence of 
market growth.
Well positioned to meet market needs
Our broad network of hospitals, aligned with major 
population centres and our areas of speciality and  
acuity, position us to address key market opportunities.  
Our financial resilience and development projects under 
way put us in a strong position to gain market share.
Strategy for diversified growth across 
payor groups
We have a clear and focused plan to grow the business 
across all of our three payor groups. In addition, Spire 
Healthcare benefits from an inherent ‘payor hedge’ 
amongst its payor groups. With these three separate 
groups we are well placed to weather any market volatility. 
On track to deliver significant  
capacity growth
We continue to invest in new operating theatres, hospitals 
and cancer centres to meet the growing demand and  
to fill geographical and speciality gaps in the market. We 
explore investment opportunities in our existing network 
so as to add additional capacity to meet increased demand 
over time.
Strong cash flows and balance sheet
We are focused on ensuring that our sales are converted 
into strong cash flows to finance capital expenditure to 
maintain and improve the current asset base, to grow 
capacity as far as possible out of free cash flow and to 
provide a dividend return to shareholders. All in all, our 
business is highly cash generative, as demonstrated in  
this report.

Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2015 5 GARRY WATTS
EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN
In our first full year as a listed 
company we continued to 
build on eight years of success. 
We added capacity across our 
national network, and we 
broke ground on two new-
build hospitals, due to open 
in 2017 .
Above all, we provided 
treatment of the highest 
quality to over 760,000 
patients, whilst improving  
or maintaining our already 
excellent staff, consultant and 
patient satisfaction scores. 
In a year when issues surrounding the 
provision of healthcare in the UK seemed  
to be in the news every day, I am pleased  
to report that our highly skilled staff were 
able to deliver outstanding treatment and 
care to more patients than ever before –  
and to the highest standards of safety and 
clinical outcomes.
Our financial performance in 2015 was  
good. In what was, at times, a challenging 
year, we achieved our eighth successive  
year of growth. Total revenue increased  
3.4% to £884.8 million; the result was a 
pro-forma profit after tax of £73.0 million* 
(2014: £71.6 million). 
We continue to invest significantly in  
our people, services, treatments, hospitals 
and equipment. In the year, we invested 
£109.5 million across the business, further 
reinforcing our position as the pre-eminent 
provider of private healthcare in the UK.
DIVIDEND
Subject to shareholder approval, the 
Company will pay a final dividend in respect 
of the 2015 year of 2.4 pence per ordinary 
share. Together with the interim dividend  
of 1.3 pence this amounts to a total annual 
dividend of 3.7 pence per ordinary share.  
This is in line with our stated dividend policy 
which aims to pay out around 20% of profit 
after taxation each year.
BOARD CHANGES
During the year, we saw the exit of Cinven, 
our long-standing private equity investor, 
and the resignation from the Board of its 
representative, Dr Supraj Rajagopalan.  
We wish Cinven and Supraj well in their 
future ventures.
We were delighted that Simon Rowlands 
consented to remain on the Board, given  
his experience both with the Company  
since 2007 and in the healthcare sector 
more widely.
In June, we welcomed Mediclinic 
International to our share register when  
they took a 29.9% strategic stake in Spire 
Healthcare. Mediclinic International is  
an international private healthcare group 
operating in South Africa, Switzerland  
and the Middle East. Danie Meintjes,  
their chief executive officer, joined our  
Board and we are already benefiting from  
his knowledge and international experience  
as we explore new ways in which we can 
develop our business. 
In March 2016, we announced that Rob 
Roger would be leaving the Company on  
30 June 2016 to take up a new CEO role  
at Vero Group, a large privately financed 
property business.
Rob has been with Spire for over nine  
years. As chief financial officer he played  
an integral part in the formation of Spire 
Healthcare in 2007, before becoming Chief 
Executive Officer in 2011. He has overseen 
the significant growth of the Group, both 
organically and through acquisition, and  
led the Company through its successful  
stock market debut in 2014. Rob and I have 
worked together for over five years and  
I will be sorry to see him depart. On behalf  
of us all at Spire, I wish him well in his  
new role.
I have resumed the role of Executive 
Chairman, and Andrew White, Chief 
Operating Officer, will join me and Simon 
Gordon on the Board as an Executive 
Director with effect from 1 July 2016. 
Andrew joined Spire Healthcare in November 
2015, and brings significant professional 
experience to the role. Further 
announcements regarding the Chief 
Executive Officer role will be made  
as appropriate.
GOVERNANCE
Your Board and its committees have 
developed strongly during the year, with  
*  Pro-forma profit is calculated as earnings after tax adjusted 
for exceptional items. For 2014, pro-forma profit is 
calculated as earnings after tax adjusted for the capital 
restructuring, exceptional items, to conform the property 
rental base, PLC operating costs and the net profit arising on 
the sale of property and other assets (detailed on page 32).
Executive Chairman’s  
statement
Building on success
STRATEGIC REPORT
6 Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2015 the Directors learning from each other and 
working together effectively. We conducted 
an internal evaluation of the Board and 
individual Directors, and will complete  
a further evaluation in 2016.
The highest levels of clinical governance  
and performance are central to our  
business – a review of our performance  
in this area is always the first substantive 
item on Board agendas. 
The Board’s Clinical Governance and Safety 
Committee is independently chaired by 
Professor Dame Janet Husband. Her report 
on this committee’s activities can be found 
on pages 72 and 73. 
In 2015, we welcomed the Care Quality 
Commission (CQC) to seven of our hospitals 
as it started to implement its new inspection 
regime. Details of the CQC inspections can 
be found on pages 34 to 37 . We are fully 
supportive of strong regulation and will 
continue to work with the CQC, sharing  
best practice and developing our culture  
of continuous improvement.
The Board is united in its aim that all our 
hospitals should be CQC rated as ‘Good’ 
or ‘Outstanding’.
OUR GREATEST ASSET
We have all read of the challenges the UK 
faces in recruiting, training, developing  
and retaining skilled nurses and doctors.
Delivering outstanding healthcare to 
thousands of patients every day of the  
year is an intensely personal business.  
Our committed nurses, allied healthcare 
professionals, doctors and everyone else  
in our hospitals are our greatest asset and  
I cannot overstate the gratitude of the  
Board, our shareholders, and above all,  
our patients, for their unstinting efforts 
throughout the year.
You can read more about the emphasis  
we place on the recruitment, training, 
development and management of  
the skilled individuals who make Spire 
Healthcare such a special organisation  
in ‘Our people’, on pages 42 to 45. 
LOOKING AHEAD
The strong underlying growth drivers 
present in the UK healthcare market are 
incontrovertible. They present a range of 
outstanding opportunities for healthcare 
providers of the highest quality such as 
Spire Healthcare. I believe that we have  
the management team, staff, culture  
and resources in place to become the  
UK’s leading private healthcare provider  
and a key presence in the wider UK 
healthcare economy.
Garry Watts 
Executive Chairman

Our second, purpose-built Specialist  
Care Centre, which opened in November, 
houses two linear accelerators, a 6D 
robotic couch, a wide-bore CT scanner 
equipped with 4D imaging capabilities 
and a chemotherapy suite, and offers the 
very best in cancer treatment and care. 
The centre will treat a broad range of 
cancers including breast, gynaecological, 
prostate, head, neck, skin and lung 
cancers, from diagnosis to treatment, 
using state-of-the-art treatment and 
verification techniques.

PRIVATE HOSPITAL PROVIDER OF THE YEAR WIN FOR SECOND YEAR RUNNING
Read more about developments on 
pages 18 and 19
Spire Healthcare was named ‘Private 
hospital group of the year’ for the  
second year running at the HealthInvestor 
Awards in June. The 2015 competition 
was fierce with award submissions  
up by 20% on 2014, but despite this,  
Spire Healthcare still pipped six other 
organisations to the top spot.
Opened in June, the hospital’s third 
theatre will benefit more than 2,000 
self-paying, medically insured and NHS 
patients from the local area in its first  
12 months. This increased operating 
capacity means patients will be treated 
sooner and with more flexibility than  
ever before.
The £2.7 million laminar flow theatre  
will be complemented by the hospital’s 
nationally accredited sterile services unit, 
which places Spire Elland Hospital as  
the only hospital in the local area where 
the staff are able to sterilise operating 
instruments on-site.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2015 7 WHAT IS YOUR OVERALL VIEW OF 
PERFORMANCE IN 2015?
RR: Let me start with what we are really 
about – patient care. During 2015, we 
delivered outstanding, personalised care  
to 270,000 in-patient and daycase patients. 
That’s a 3.7% increase on 2014, and the  
most patients ever treated.
We had no incidents of MRSA or MSSA, and 
c.difficile infection rates, at 0.60 per 10,000 
bed days, continued to be substantially lower 
than equivalent NHS rates. We maintained 
our high patient and consultant satisfaction 
levels and friend and family survey results.
We translated this excellent clinical work 
into a good set of financial results. Overall 
revenue for the year grew 3.4% to £884.8 
million (2014: £856.0 million). Adjusted 
EBITDA grew 2.2% to £160.1 million (2014: 
£156.7 million). We also continued to invest 
in the business – £109.5 million this year –  
as part of our steady development strategy. 
So, overall, a good year. 
There’s more detail on our clinical 
performance, including Care Quality 
Commission (CQC) inspections, in the  
Clinical and Operating reviews on pages  
34 and 35 and more on our financial 
performance in Simon Gordon’s Financial 
review on pages 26 to 33.
IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN A RELATIVELY 
VOLATILE YEAR, WITH BOTH STRENGTH 
AND WEAKNESS IN YOUR NHS WORK?
RR: About 30% of our business comes 
through the NHS – and, overall, it continues 
to grow. Three-quarters of that comes 
through the NHS e-Referral Service (formerly 
Choose and Book) and about a quarter from 
local CCG and Trust contract work. 
The NHS e-Referral Service volumes  
grew at 8.0–9.0% in the year, which is  
a steady growth.
2015 was another year of 
major development for 
Spire Healthcare. Rob Roger, 
our Chief Executive Officer, 
answers some key questions, 
reviewing a sometimes 
challenging year and looking 
to the future.
ROB ROGER
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
For local contract work, it was a year of two 
halves. In the first half, we benefited from 
a lot of pre-election work, but that slowed 
after the election, and fell markedly in the 
last quarter after Monitor’s intervention in 
August 2015 to reduce penalties imposed  
for exceeding waiting list times.
We believe the NHS’s drive for cost  
control and further efficiencies will  
constrain local contract work going forward. 
That, in turn, is likely to result in lengthening 
waiting lists and further rationing of 
non-essential treatments.
HALF OF SPIRE HEALTHCARE’S BUSINESS 
COMES THROUGH PMI – IS THAT MARKET 
TIGHTENING AND WHAT CAN YOU DO 
TO BOLSTER GROWTH IN THE SECTOR?
RR: The number of insured lives has 
effectively been flat for a while. We saw  
a growth in insured lives in 2014, but we 
haven’t seen much traction since then. 
There’s net growth in corporate insured  
lives in the market, offset by a reduction  
in individual insured lives, as people face  
an increase in insurance premium tax and 
therefore turn to Self-pay as an alternative. 
We are looking to bolster private healthcare 
at two levels. One is to go directly to market. 
We launched InSpire in 2014, and one year  
on I’m delighted that we’ve got nearly 10,000 
new insured lives – and nearly 90% of those 
are people who didn’t have insurance before.
Secondly, working in partnership with 
insurance providers and clinicians to grow 
volume by reducing the cost of pathways. 
Continuing to deliver exceptional clinical  
care by looking for ways to further reduce 
the administration costs of all parties and 
improve customer service. These objectives 
often require investment in medical 
technologies or IT infrastructure by  
Spire Healthcare.
Chief Executive  
Officer’s Q&A
In good health
STRATEGIC REPORT
8 Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2015 At a macro level, the leading insurers and 
providers are now working together for  
the first time in many years to make our 
combined product more relevant to 
customers with the objective of attracting 
more customers to the insured market. 
HOW EFFECTIVE IS YOUR ‘PAYOR HEDGE’? 
RR: The payor hedge is how we refer to the 
fact that our business comes from three 
main payor sources – PMI, Self-pay and 
the NHS. 
In 2015, we saw that payor hedge in action –  
the growth in patients self-paying came 
as a direct result of individuals recognising 
the pressures on the NHS resulting in 
rationing and growing waiting times.
The price of PMI for individuals is clearly 
an issue. In the UK, as people get older, 
premiums get more expensive, because they 
are risk adjusted. If you’re 65 and retired, your 
insurance premium is going to be very high. 
So more and more people are turning to 
Self-pay. 
And, of course, we are helping them by 
offering fixed prices on our most common 
procedures and always with immediate 
access and outstanding clinical outcomes.
HOW CONFIDENT ARE YOU THAT 
GROWING WAITING LISTS WILL MEAN 
MORE BUSINESS IN SELF-PAY AND 
E-REFERRAL SERVICE? 
RR: The growing funding gap remains. 
Whether it’s £22 billion by 2020/21, or  
£65 billion by 2030/31, I don’t know, but 
ultimately, on current funding levels, the  
NHS can’t be there for everybody. As the  
gap between supply and demand grows, by 
nature people will turn to a private product.
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE FUTURE 
OF THE INDEPENDENT SECTOR’S ROLE 
TO THE UK HEALTH SYSTEM?
RR: Even though private healthcare is a tiny 
proportion – at its maximum it’s 6% of all 
health spend in the UK – and the elective 
spend, which is what we do, is less than  
4%, the opportunities are still vast.
We know we have a growing and ageing 
population, with increasing acute and 
chronic conditions. The ability to fund  
this growth in demand is a major cause  
of concern for Government.
What the private sector can offer is capital 
for investment, and capacity, particularly 
in elective areas such as orthopaedics, 
cardiology and opthalmics. 
We’re also in a position to invest in areas 
of higher acuity, such as cancer, where UK 
radiotherapy provision is already under-
resourced and where much of the NHS’s 
equipment is reaching the end of its 
operational life. 
YOU HAD A ROUND OF CQC INSPECTIONS 
LAST YEAR. WHAT HAVE BEEN THE 
GENERAL STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES 
FOUND IN THE HOSPITALS INSPECTED 
TO DATE?
RR: Let me firstly say that we welcome  
the new CQC inspection regime. We believe  
its concentration on the five ‘domains’ is 
robust and solid. We have even revised our 
own internal clinical reviews to mirror their 
domain protocols. We don’t want ever to be 
surprised by a CQC finding. To us, knowing 
our hospitals is all part of being ‘well led’.
Obviously, in the first year of the new  
regime both we and the CQC were learning 
from every inspection, but overall the 
outcomes have been very positive. There is 
more information on CQC inspections on 
pages 34 to 37 .

Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2015 9 Chief Executive 
Officer’s Q&A continued 
In good health
I want all our hospitals to be either ‘Good’ or 
‘Outstanding’. I don’t know how long it will 
take to get there, but we are on the path  
and it’s an absolute business priority.
MEDICLINIC INTERNATIONAL TOOK A 
29.9% STAKE IN SPIRE HEALTHCARE IN 
2015. WHAT SYNERGIES HAVE YOU 
IDENTIFIED SINCE ITS INVESTMENT?
RR: Mediclinic brings a wealth of 
international experience to our business. 
We’ve looked at specific areas such as supply 
chain, comparing our costs with those in 
Switzerland, Dubai or South Africa. We’re 
also looking at nursing and recruitment, 
co-ordinating our approach worldwide. 
HAS MEDICLINIC INTERNATIONAL’S 
INVESTMENT CHANGED YOUR STRATEGY?  
RR: Our strategy hasn’t changed: we will 
continue to grow by concentrating on the  
UK consumer, offering value for money and 
outstanding care. That means being the  
best clinically. We are developing our own 
channels for sales and referrals. We will 
reinvest to drive down cost through 
efficiencies and standardisation, while 
developing our capabilities by investing 
in our people. And we will increase our 
capacity by using what we have more 
efficiently, and by building new as required.
That strategy was in place prior to 
Mediclinic’s involvement and they  
support this. 
HOW WILL SPIRE HEALTHCARE MAINTAIN 
ABOVE-AVERAGE INDUSTRY MARGINS?
RR: The short answer is grow more volume 
and continue to improve efficiency! 
We are already a very efficient business  
but we can always do more. We are seeing 
the benefits coming through from our 
investment in a new SAP system. We put  
in a new CRM system which will improve 
sales conversion. 
Efficiency is delivered through cultural 
engagement. In 2015, we put in place an 
enhanced leadership team, ready to take  
us to the next stage in our development.
We brought in a new Chief Operations 
Officer, Andrew White, to manage the 
business day-to-day, working with our  
four Operations Directors. 
Peter Corfield, our new Group Commercial 
Director, brings significant experience  
of the insurance industry. He will continue  
to drive revenue growth through our three 
payor groups. 
Jonathan Paisley was recently appointed 
Chief Information Officer, to strengthen  
our use of digital technology. Whether it’s 
around control and referrals, engaging with 
GPs or engaging with patients, IT can make 
Spire Healthcare more efficient.
And Caroline Roberts joined us as Group 
Human Resources Director to help us  
meet the challenges the whole healthcare 
sector faces in staff recruitment and  
talent development.
There is more detail on all these areas in the 
Operating review and Our people sections  
on pages 38 to 45. 
WHERE WILL YOU BE OPENING NEW 
CAPACITY IN 2016?
RR: We have three new theatres under 
construction at Spire Methley Park, Hull and 
East Riding, and Parkway hospitals due for 
completion in the second half of 2016. Six 
new theatres are in development at Spire  
St Anthony’s Hospital (to replace four 
existing theatres) due to open later in the 
year, and two new hospitals are in build,  
in Manchester and Nottingham. They are 
scheduled to open in early 2017. We should 
have at least 131 theatres operating by the 
end of 2018.
We currently have further specialist care  
sites under review as we develop our cancer 
care offer.
WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS FOR ENTRY  
INTO THE LONDON MARKET?
RR: The London market has strong  
potential in its own right and insurers want 
contestability in the market. Obviously  
Spire St Anthony’s Hospital has bolstered  
our number of hospitals around Greater 
London, but we want a presence within 
central London. It would be a significant 
investment decision, so choosing the right 
sites is important, not only in terms of 
physical location but also proximity to the 
major teaching hospitals. 
Our duty of care at 
Spire Healthcare
We operate an extensive and well-
equipped network of acute independent 
hospitals which give patients access  
to high-quality equipment, nurses, 
consultants and medical support staff, 
from referral right through to discharge 
and beyond. 
Our culture of continuous learning 
means patients can be assured that we 
will always strive to do the very best at 
every step of their journey. 
STRATEGIC REPORT
10 Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2015 WHAT IS THE OUTLOOK FOR 2016?
RR: We believe that we will continue  
to see growth across all payor groups, 
gaining market share with our insurers and 
expanding our Self-pay business as more 
NHS procedures are restricted and waiting 
lists increase. Working to attract more NHS 
patients through growth of the e-Referral 
Service gives patients the choice to come  
to one of our hospitals for the same price  
as they would if they were going to an  
NHS hospital.
Looking forward, we expect that in 2016:
• full year revenue will grow by between 
3.0% and 5.0%;
• the Group’s adjusted for comparable 
EBITDA margin for the year as a whole will 
remain consistent with that for 2015; and
• capital expenditure will be between  
£170 million and £190 million. 
WHY HAVE YOU DECIDED TO LEAVE SPIRE 
HEALTHCARE AND WHAT WILL BE YOUR 
HIGHLIGHT?
RR: I will be leaving the Company in June  
to take on a new challenge in a different 
industry. I have spent over nine years at Spire 
Healthcare, helping to build what I believe is 
the best private healthcare provider in the 
UK. Spire Healthcare has a great senior 
management team in place, ready to take  
the business forward and I know that their 
priority to offer patients the highest 
standards of care will continue. 
Working to establish Spire Healthcare has 
been a real privilege and I am proud to have 
worked alongside the countless individuals 
who work tirelessly to make healthcare 
better in the UK, and to be a part of the team 
who created the Group. I wish everyone at 
Spire Healthcare the best for the future.

CONSULTANT AND GP ENGAGEMENT 
   Dr Ian Gold speaking at Spire Bushey Hospital’s 
musculoskeletal GP education event 
STRATEGIC REPORT All Spire Healthcare hospitals run GP 
engagement and education programmes, 
aiming to build closer links between 
primary and secondary care, and 
improving the care pathway for patients.
Local NHS GP , Dr Ian Gold, has worked 
with Spire Bushey Hospital for 12 years, 
organising academic workshop sessions 
for GPs. Supported by our staff, Dr Gold 
plans and chairs up to seven full day 
master classes and eight evening seminars 
a year, bringing GPs and Consultants 
together to network and discuss the latest 
developments in specialist medicine. 
The workshops also help GPs determine 
whether they need to refer certain cases, 
or whether they can be managed within 
their practices. 
In 2015, topics covered included 
musculoskeletal problems, 
ophthalmology, ENT, neurology, 
paediatrics, obstetrics and gynaecology, 
urology, oncology, endocrinology, 
cardiology, gastroenterology, pain 
management and respiratory medicine.
HELPING GPs TO IMPROVE OUR PATIENT CARE
Spire Healthcare’s well-established range of 
free GP workshops is part of our nationwide 
education and engagement programme.
MR ROBERT LEE     
Consultant – NHS Royal National 
Orthopaedic Hospital, Stanmore  
“I have presented a few Spire workshops 
looking at a range of back pain case 
studies. It’s a good and interactive way  
of delivering relevant information to up 
to 100 GPs at a time – showing them 
actual cases of patients that should be, 
and have been, referred for treatment. 
They learn what to look for, when to 
refer and equally importantly, when  
not to refer. 
It’s good for GPs to see my face and  
know to whom they’re referring.  
We build good relations, so they can feel 
comfortable referring their patients.
At the end of the day, and what really 
counts is, I believe it’s good for  
our patients.”

DR VICTORIA MCCULLOCH   
NHS GP – The Grove Medical Centre, 
Borehamwood 
“I attended a recent Spire musculoskeletal 
workshop. I’m returning from maternity 
leave so it was the perfect opportunity 
for me to meet colleagues from the local 
area and update my knowledge at the 
same time.
I get to raise my knowledge in the subject 
area and get an update on conditions.  
It’s also good to meet the consultants  
to whom we refer, as my patients like  
to know that I am familiar with them.
We have just started using the NHS 
e-Referral Service at the practice. My 
patients are seen quicker and don’t have 
to wait so long for intervention. I think  
it makes sense to use private capacity 
rather than make patients wait a long 
time, or worse, have treatment refused.”

STRATEGIC REPORT
14 Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2015 Paying for private 
healthcare
The private sector increasingly provides 
capacity for the NHS. Approaching a third 
of Spire Healthcare’s patients are funded 
by the NHS, with over 75% of these coming 
through the NHS e-Referral Service. 
Apart from the NHS, private treatment  
is funded either through Private Medical 
Insurance (PMI), Self-pay (domestic or 
international.) 
POPULATION IN  
THE UK THAT  
HAS PMI

PERCENTAGE OF PMI 
POLICIES PROVIDED  
BY EMPLOYERS
78%
Source: LaingBuisson Healthcare Market Review, 27th Edition.
PMI funds nearly half of all independent 
acute medical and surgical procedures,  
yet currently only some 10.6% of the 
population (6.8 million people) have PMI – 
a relatively low level of market coverage  
by international standards. 
Most PMI policies (78%) are provided  
by employers and PMI coverage has 
historically been closely linked to the 
relative health of the economy. As Bupa 
noted in its 2015 interim results, economic 
recovery is beginning to generate growth 
again in large corporate and SME PMI.
Over recent years there has been a marked 
increase in patients, particularly those  
over 50, choosing to self-insure or Self-pay 
for private treatment – a trend driven  
by relative affordability, the introduction 
of fixed pricing, and increasing NHS 
waiting times.
Source: Bupa 2015 half-year interim results.
Increasing demand  
for healthcare 
As the post-war baby boomers reach 
retirement, the UK’s population is  
getting older. In 2014, nearly 18% of the 
population were aged 65 and over – by 
2050 this proportion will rise to 25%.

And they are living longer. Between  
2010 and 2035, the number of people  
aged over 85 will more than double –  
from 1.4 million to 3.5 million. 
Source: ONS.
The implications, both in terms of costs 
and healthcare provision, are profound – 
annual average NHS expenditure for  
an 85-year-old is over five times that of  
a 50-year-old and eight times that of a 
25-year-old. 
Source: Department of Health.
It is, therefore, likely that demand for 
private healthcare will grow as restricted 
government funding and increasing 
healthcare demand leads to lengthening 
NHS waiting lists and the ‘rationing’  
of some procedures, deemed non-urgent 
or of low clinical value, a trend we are 
clearly seeing.

The government has also promised to

order to meet that increasing demand. 
However, the NHS’s Five Year Forward 
View (published October 2014) indicated 
that a minimum of £30 billion could be 
required by 2020/21. While the NHS at 
that time indicated it could seek to make 
cost savings and efficiencies of £22 
billion over that period, various papers 
since then (including the Carter Report) 
have suggested that this is an ambitious 
target which is unlikely to be achieved.

OUR PROGRESS
• We continue to work with PMIs to provide the most cost-
effective contracts. In April 2015, our latest contract with Bupa, 
our largest PMI partner, commenced. It runs for a minimum  
of four years, with prices agreed through to March 2021
• Following the launch of InSpire in 2014 – a bespoke Spire 
Healthcare-based health insurance plan that combines 
high-quality healthcare with exceptional value for money –  
we have nearly 10,000 new insured lives, and 90% of those  
are people who didn’t have insurance before
• Targeting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), in 2015 
we developed ‘MySpire Corporate’, a hybrid Self-pay product, 
offering SMEs effective healthcare cover for their employees
• We continue to develop simple, transparent and affordable 
packages offering patients procedures not always funded  
by the NHS
• We have increased our range of fixed prices to include our top 
25 procedures, all backed up with clear ‘plain English’ terms  
and conditions. This approach gives self-paying patients 
transparency in terms of our pricing
• All our hospitals continue to work with local NHS commissioners 
and providers to offer much needed capacity, taking elective 
patients out of overstretched hospitals and helping the NHS 
drive value and achieve better outcomes
• Approximately 75% of our NHS work comes through the NHS 
e-Referral Service. During 2015, this work grew steadily at  
8.0 to 9.0% as we saw a shift from local contracts to the  
NHS e-Referral Service. We continue to work with local  
providers and commissioning bodies to ensure that patient 
choice is maintained 
DRIVE VOLUME GROWTH BY CONTINUING TO BUILD OUR 
RELATIONSHIPS WITH PATIENTS AND GPS

e-Referral Service
CONTINUE TO BUILD OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH CONSULTANTS 
TO IMPROVE OUR OFFERING TO PATIENTS
• Help new consultants to build their practices and provide 
established consultants with the high-quality facilities and 
well-trained staff they need to deliver outstanding care for  
their patients
• Continue to engage with consultants to explore new services, 
developments and innovations to improve the quality and  
scope of our offer to our patients
UTILISE OUR EXISTING CAPACITY BETTER
• Raise average theatre utilisation and increase theatre and 
diagnostic capability, optimising throughput
• Optimise patient experience through better use of technology 
ensuring that care is delivered in the most appropriate setting 
• Refurbish and upgrade our patient bedrooms and in-patient and 
out-patient facilities 
OUR PROGRESS
• We continue to market direct to consumers, building brand 
awareness and increasing referrals, a process we started in 2014
• We maintained an impressive level of consultant satisfaction: 
79% of consultants rate the quality of service Spire Healthcare 
provides as ‘Excellent’ or ‘Very good’
• In 2015, our GP engagement programme delivered over 1,100 
workshops, bringing together local GPs and consultants to 
improve referrals and service provision
• We see consultants as partners, developing their practices in our 
hospitals. Our new hospital in Nottingham, opening in 2017, is 
being developed with the engagement of 70 local surgeons in 
response to changing market conditions in the area 
• The number of consultants working in our hospitals has risen 
from 3,750 in 2014 to 3,790 in 2015
• Our average theatre utilisation was 63% in 2015. With our top 
six hospitals averaging close to 80%, there is scope for higher 
utilisation across many of our hospitals
• We added one new theatre in 2015 at Spire Elland Hospital, 
which was operational from June 2015 
• Spire Leeds Hospital added an ambulatory care unit, which was 
operational from Q4 2015
• Spire Roding Hospital opened a Bone and Joint Centre, which 
began operating in Q4 2015

Our strategic pillars
TO DEVELOP NEW SITES AND SERVICES, PARTICULARLY 
FOR THE TREATMENT OF CANCER
TO DRIVE EFFICIENCY AND  
IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY 
ACQUIRE OR BUILD NEW SITES
• Expand geographically to cover under-serviced areas
DEVELOP AND EXPAND OUR CANCER CARE OFFER
• Identify and develop standalone Specialist Care Centres as part  
of expanding our cancer care offerings
DEVELOP CAPABILITIES IN AREAS OF HIGHER ACUITY
• Continue to develop higher acuity services such as neurosurgery 
and cardiology 
OUR PROGRESS
• We are expanding capacity in and around London. A six-theatre 
complex will be completed at Spire St Anthony’s Hospital  
in 2016, replacing the four existing theatres 
• Our new-build hospitals in Nottingham and Manchester  
are well advanced – both are due to open in 2017 
• We continue to develop our in-house pathology service with  
a new laboratory due to open at Spire Hull and East Riding 
Hospital in 2016 
• Our second state-of-the-art Specialist Care Centre opened in 
Baddow, in November 2015, and we have identified land for  
a third centre 
• Spire Hesslewood Clinic, part of Spire Hull and East Riding 
Hospital, opened a standalone clinic in February 2015 and  
has seen positive business growth in its first year
• Construction of a brand new theatre expansion and 
chemotherapy development is under way at Spire Parkway 
Hospital comprising an endoscopy unit with Storz OR1 theatre 
•  Offering further capacity for NHS referrals under the patient 
choice initiative, reducing our dependence on directly 
commissioned work (NHS Local)
•  Developed a new suite of theatre utilisation tools that allow far 
greater visibility of utilisation, allowing management teams to 
schedule work more efficiently
FOCUS ON PERFORMANCE
• Do the basics really well
• Simplify management structures and information 
• Bring management together to spread best practice and act  
as one team
• Targeted interventions to support improvement across  
the portfolio 
BUILD ON OUR SCALE AND EXPERTISE
• Continue to implement procedure-specific kits and packs  
across the network
• Leverage the scale of both Spire Healthcare and Mediclinic 
International as we continue to rationalise our supply chain
• Deploy tools to optimise diagnostic and theatre activities  
to improve productivity and capacity
OPTIMISE AND DEVELOP OUR OPERATING MODEL
• Drive operational synergies across the network 
• Improve and standardise capabilities network-wide
• Use technology to streamline administrative processes 
• Continue to improve the patient journey
OUR PROGRESS
• Our in-house procurement and supply chain model is based 
around a national distribution centre (NDC) in Droitwich. The 
NDC has been markedly successful in lowering procurement 
and distribution costs across the Group through the 
consolidation of supplies and suppliers 
• Our senior management was considerably strengthened in 2015 
with the establishment of new operational roles, tasked with 
improving day-to-day management and optimising the balance 
between centrally controlled services and the operational 
flexibility of local management
• Our HR development is focused on recruitment and retention – 
growing our own – to increase our flexible ‘bank’ nursing 
resource, reduce our use of relatively expensive ‘agency’ nurses, 
and make Spire Healthcare an employer of choice
• We are generating operational synergies by using regional ‘hub 
and spoke’ models to provide support, for example in HR and in 
engineering services
• We continue to focus on well-established KPIs to manage costs, 
including staff costs and clinical consumables, and we use peer 
group benchmarking between hospitals to share best practice 
for cost control
• We are investing in management reporting systems to improve 
cost control

The quality of our patient care depends 
on our nurses. We’re not immune to the 
well-publicised problems faced by the  
NHS – too few nurses have graduated 
from our universities in recent years, 
those with young families want a better 
work/life balance and flexible hours, 
and many career nurses are now in their 
fifties and approaching retirement.
All of which means we have to make 
working at Spire Healthcare as attractive 
as possible, and do everything we can to 
retain our nurses with training and 
education, helping them develop their 
skills and leadership qualities.
While we use agency nurses in some 
highly skilled and difficult-to-fill roles –  
particularly in theatres – bank work 
offers nurses part time flexibility and 
gives our consultants and patients the 
reassurance of knowing that the nurses 
are familiar with the hospital and our 
ways of working.
CARE CONTINUITY
PAT OLDFIELD   
Bank nurse 
Pat Oldfield retired in 2015 year after 
26 years nursing at our Spire Leeds 
Hospital, but she continues to work 
part time on the hospital’s bank, so 
patients and staff continue to benefit 
from her experience as a specialist  
infection control nurse and clinical 
effectiveness lead.
As Pat says, “Although I’ve retired,  
it gives me something I love doing, 
without dropping out of work 
altogether.” 
STAFF NURSES, BANK NURSES AND AGENCY NURSES
“ It’s been great having Pat 
as a mentor – her support and 
experience has enabled me 
to develop my skills at Spire.” 
SAM WILSON, Student nurse 
“ Having experienced people 
around supports the new staff. 
Working on the bank helps the 
hospital – and it helps me.” 
PAT OLDFIELD, Bank nurse 
ANNE PERRIMAN   
Bank nurse 
Anne Perriman originally trained as a nurse 
in the early 1980s but left the profession 
to raise her family. In 2012, she started  
a return to practice course at Kingston 
University. She did her work placement  
at Spire St Anthony’s Hospital and, on 
completing her course, she joined Spire 
Healthcare full time.
“St Anthony’s has a close relationship with 
Kingston – they are really supportive, you 
have a mentor and they really help you, 
particularly on the theoretical side which 
has changed completely since I trained.
Spire’s offer was basically whatever hours 
and shifts would suit me. That flexibility  
is really important – we have another 
return to practice nurse who started in 
January – she does three days a week.”
Anne has since developed a key role  
in discharge co-ordination at Spire St 
Anthony’s Hospital, acting as a central 
point of contact for social services  
and carers, and giving our patients the 
quickest, safest and best discharge 
packages possible.
RETURNING TO PRACTICE
Our nursing staff deliver a high level of 
responsive, compassionate and dignified 
care across all our hospitals.

Of the underlying revenue growth of 2.5%:
• an increase of 3.3% in the volume of in-patient and daycase admissions accounted for a 2.2% increase in revenue in the year with volume 
growth across all payor groups;
• the Group reported a nominal decline in the rate for in-patient and daycase (average revenue per case) equivalent to a 0.1% decline in total 
revenue. This was the result of year-on-year NHS tariff reductions and a shift in PMI case mix towards lower yielding daycase admissions in 
the year; and
• out-patient activities increased with the volume of admissions but growth has been tempered by PMI out-patient pricing in the year. 
Out-patient revenue growth accounted for an increase in underlying total revenue of 0.4%.

Of the underlying fall in PMI revenue of 1.1%:
• an increase of 0.2% in the volume of in-patient and daycase admissions accounted for a 0.2% increase in PMI revenue in the year;
• overall the proportion of daycase admissions increased from 73.9% of PMI admissions in 2014 to 75.8% of PMI admissions in 2015. This mix 
shift in admissions had an adverse impact on average revenue per case and on out-patient revenue associated with the patient episodes;
• the Group reported a comparable decline of 0.3% in the rate of in-patient and daycase (average revenue per case). As explained above this  
is largely a product of mix. Relative to 2014, the average rate per case for 2015, on an equivalent mix of PMI admissions, increased by 2.4%;
• inflation plus rate rises for in-patient and daycase admissions tempered overall by reductions in the rates achieved for out-patient activities. 
Overall PMI price increases for 2015 were positive but sub-inflationary; and
• out-patient revenue declined in the year, equivalent to a 1.1% decline in overall underlying PMI revenue. This was a combination of  
lower out-patient activity levels arising from the daycase surgery mix and the bias of 2015 price increases towards in-patient and daycase 
surgical activities.

NHS revenue for the year ended 31 December 2015 increased by £16.1 million, or 6.5%, to £262.0 million (2014: £245.9 million). Underlying 
growth, excluding revenue relating to Spire St Saviour’s and Spire St Anthony’s hospitals, was 6.7%.
Of the underlying growth in NHS revenue of 6.7%:
• the underlying increase in NHS e-Referral Service revenue was 12.5% in the year;
• the underlying decline in non-NHS e-Referral Service revenue was 10.0% in the year. The Group has been impacted by a significant and 
abrupt curtailment of outsourcing work from NHS Trusts in the second half of 2015 as a direct response to directives designed to address 
NHS funding deficits;
• overall the Group reported a net increase of 5.7% in the volume of in-patient and daycase admissions. This accounted for a 4.7% increase  
in NHS revenue in the year;
• the Group reported a decline in the rate for in-patient and daycase (average revenue per case) equivalent to a 0.5% decline in NHS revenue. 
Although case mix complexity increased in the year, this was mitigated by an overall effective reduction in NHS tariffs of approximately  
2.0% for the year; and
• out-patient activities increased with the volume of NHS admissions accounting for an overall increase in NHS revenue of 2.6% over 2015.

revenue; and
• out-patient activities increased with the volume of admissions, accounting for an overall increase in Self-pay revenue of 1.5% over 2014.
Other revenue
Other revenue, which includes fees paid to the Group by consultants (e.g. for the use of Group facilities and services) and third-party revenue 
(e.g. pathology services to third parties), increased by £0.2 million, or 0.6%, in the year, to £31.8 million (2014: £31.6 million).
COST OF SALES AND GROSS PROFIT 
Cost of sales increased in the year by £23.4 million, or 5.4%, to £460.0 million (2014: £436.6 million). 
Underlying cost of sales (excluding Spire St Saviour’s and Spire St Anthony’s hospitals and the fertility business) increased in the year by  
£17.1 million, or 4.1%, to £436.8 million (2014: £419.7 million).
Underlying gross margin for the year of 2015 was 48.5%, compared to 49.2% in 2014. 
On an underlying basis, and as a percentage of relevant revenue:
• clinical staffing costs increased from 17.3% of revenue for the year ended 31 December 2014 to 18.4% of revenue for the year ended  
31 December 2015. The increase in costs reflects the current overall shortage in the supply of qualified nursing staff across the UK  
and a consequent increase in agency staffing spend;
• fees paid to clinicians for services provided to the NHS increased from 5.8% of revenue for the year ended 31 December 2014 to 6.0%  
of revenue for the year ended 31 December 2015. This increase reflects the weighting of overall revenue growth in the year. Fees as a 
percentage of NHS revenue have reduced in the year from 19.9% of NHS revenue for the year ended 31 December 2014 to 19.8% for  
the year ended 31 December 2015;
• other direct costs, which includes drugs, consumables and prosthesis spend, has reduced in the year from 22.0% of revenue for the year 
ended 31 December 2014 to 21.7% of revenue for the year ended 31 December 2015. This has been achieved notwithstanding a relative 
increase in NHS activities and a reduction in equivalent NHS tariff reimbursement rates; and
• other fees payable to consultants for out-patient and diagnostic activities reduced as a percentage of revenue, from 5.7% for the year  
ended 31 December 2014 to 5.6% of revenue for the year ended 31 December 2015.
OTHER OPERATING COSTS 
Other operating costs for the year ended 31 December 2015 decreased by £30.0 million, or 8.3%, to £329.3 million (2014: £359.3 million).
Underlying other operating costs (excluding Spire St Saviour’s and Spire St Anthony’s hospitals and the fertility business) decreased  
in the year by £28.4 million, or 8.2%, to £318.9 million (2014: £347.3 million).
Included within these costs are exceptional costs of £54.0 million for 2014 and £15.7 million for 2015 relating to the business reorganisation, 
hospital closure, and regulatory and governance costs. Before exceptional items, underlying operating costs increased by £9.9 million, or 3.4% 
from £293.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2014 to £303.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2015 on revenue growth of 2.5% 
in the year.
Depreciation
Excluding £1.5 million relating to Spire St Saviour’s and Spire St Anthony’s hospitals, the underlying charge for depreciation for the year ended 
31 December 2015 has increased by £3.4 million, or 7.7%, relative to 2014, to £47.4 million.

STRATEGIC REPORT
30 Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2015 Rent
Rent of land and buildings before exceptional items for the year, excluding £0.1 million relating to Spire St Anthony’s Hospital, increased by  
£1.6 million, or 2.6%, to £62.2 million. The increase is largely the consequence of the annualised impact of Spire Washington Hospital rent and 
commencement of rental of Spire Hesslewood Clinic, Hull, part of Spire Hull and East Riding Hospital.
Share-based payments in other operating costs
During the year, grants were made to Executive Directors and members of the senior management team under the Company’s Deferred Bonus 
Plan and Long Term Incentive Plan. For the year ended 31 December 2015, the charge to the income statement was £0.7 million, or £0.8 million 
inclusive of NI. Further details are contained in note 28 on page 129 of the financial statements. 
For the year ended 31 December 2014, the charge to the income statement was £2.8 million (£3.7 million inclusive of NI), of which £2.5 million 
(£3.4 million inclusive of NI) related to the Directors’ Share Bonus Award and was charged to exceptional items, as it related to performance 
during the period prior to the IPO.

EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA
EBITDA for the year ended 31 December 2015 increased by £0.9 million, or 0.6% from £159.2 million to £160.1 million. After account is taken  
of the basis of differences between reported EBITDA results in 2015 versus 2014, adjusted EBITDA increased by 2.2%, from £156.7 million to 
£160.1 million.
OPERATING PROFITS BEFORE AND AFTER EXCEPTIONAL COSTS
Operating profit after exceptional costs increased by 58.9% in the year to £95.5 million. Before exceptional costs, operating profits decreased 
by 2.5%, to £111.2 million (2014: £114.1 million). After taking into consideration the basis of differences between 2015 versus 2014, adjusted 
operating profit before exceptional costs decreased by 0.4%, from £111.6 million to £111.2 million.
PROFIT ON DISPOSAL OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
The loss on disposal of £0.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2015 relates principally to obsolete equipment. The profit in the prior year 
of £18.5 million relates principally to the sale, subject to lease, of the Spire Washington Hospital.
FINANCE COSTS 
Finance costs in the prior year include those incurred in respect of borrowings drawn under the capital structure of the Group prior to 
Admission. On Admission, indebtedness reduced significantly and, therefore, finance costs also reduced. 
Finance costs for the year ended 31 December 2015 totalled £21.4 million, a reduction of £64.5 million, or 75.1%, over the prior year. This 
reduction mainly comprised £54.8 million of interest on shareholder debt and £13.7 million on bank loans, net of the mark-to-market 
movement on interest rate swap instruments settled on Admission.
TAXATION
The taxation charge for the year ended 31 December 2015 consisted of a £7.9 million charge for corporation tax and a charge of £5.7 million  
for deferred tax. Before exceptional items, the effective tax rate for the year ended 31 December 2015 was 18.3%.
The taxation credit for the year ended 31 December 2014 consisted of a £0.7 million charge for corporation tax and a credit of £13.7 million  
for deferred tax. The UK corporation tax charge on 2014 profits was £nil, reflecting the significant allowable costs arising from the Admission, 
including the settlement of out-of-the-money interest rate swaps. The UK corporation tax charge in the income statement was an adjustment 
to prior years. The credit for deferred taxation for the year ended 31 December 2014 was £13.7 million, comprising deferred tax assets 
previously unrecognised, in relation to losses carried forward following the reorganisation into a single tax group. Before exceptional items,  
the effective tax rate for the year ended 31 December 2014 was 21.6%.
PROFIT AFTER TAXATION
The profit after taxation for the year ended 31 December 2015 was £60.0 million, compared with a profit after taxation for the year ended  
31 December 2014 of £6.0 million. The capital restructuring of the Group on Admission substantially reduced finance costs, contributing  
£64.5 million to the increase in profit after tax in the year.

PRO-FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION
The pro-forma financial information set out below, as presented in the Group’s Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 
2014, was prepared to illustrate the effect of the IPO on pro-forma profit after tax. This statement was prepared for illustrative purposes only 
and did not represent the Group’s actual earnings. The information was prepared on a basis consistent with the accounting policies of the 
Group and as described in the notes set out below.
Pro-forma profit after tax and earnings per share
The prior year’s income statement for the year ended 31 December 2014 included finance costs that related to debt which was settled on 
Admission on 23 July 2014, reducing the borrowings outstanding on that date and finance costs that will arise in future periods. Therefore, 
profit after tax is presented below on a pro-forma basis, under which finance costs are restated as if the Group had been refinanced on 
1 January 2014. In addition, adjustments are made to include the overhead costs associated with operating as a listed company and to remove 
the impact of a number of other significant non-recurring items.

The cash inflow from operating activities before exceptional items and income tax paid for the year was £166.7 million, which constitutes  
a cash conversion rate from Adjusted EBITDA for the year of 104.1% (2014: £164.2 million or 104.8%). 
INVESTING AND FINANCING CASH FLOWS
Net cash used in investing activities for the year was £109.6 million. Capital expenditure for the purchase of property, plant and equipment  
in the year totalled £109.5 million, which included the development of the Manchester and Nottingham hospitals, the Spire Specialist Cancer 
Care Centre in Baddow and theatre developments at Spire St Anthony’s and Spire Elland hospitals.
Net cash used in investing activities for the prior year ended 31 December 2014 was £70.0 million, which included the acquisition of  
St Anthony’s Hospital in May 2014 for £38.5 million and other capital expenditure of £66.6 million, offset by the proceeds from the disposal  
of the long leasehold interest in Spire Washington Hospital and the disposal of a fertility business, totalling £34.8 million, and interest received  
of £0.3 million. Capital expenditure comprised the completion of the radiotherapy centre in Bristol, new theatres in Harpenden and South 
Bank, the completion of a cardiac catheterisation laboratory and theatre in Cardiff, MRI at Clare Park and a major reconfiguration and 
development of facilities in Tunbridge Wells, including investment in out-patient areas and static MRI and CT machines at this hospital.
Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended 31 December 2015 was £41.3 million, including interest paid of £21.4 million, the 
purchase of shares by the Company’s Employee Benefit Trust of £5.6 million and a dividend paid to shareholders of £12.4 million.

of £306.9 million, the net repayment of bank debt after cash raised from new borrowings of £345.6 million and interest paid of £41.3 million. 
On Admission, 150,100,341 new ordinary shares were issued by the Company, which generated cash proceeds of £306.9 million. The proceeds, 
combined with a restructuring of existing shareholder interests in the Group and the refinancing of the bank facilities served to reduce overall 
Group indebtedness and materially reduce the net funding costs of the Group.
BORROWINGS

Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2015 33 Clinical review
Clinical quality and performance are  
at the heart of everything we do
Our Group Medical Director,  
Dr Jean-Jacques de Gorter, 
is responsible for defining our 
clinical governance and quality 
strategy, and his team audit, 
monitor and report on our 
quality performance. In 
addition, the Clinical Services 
team supports our hospitals  
to comply with relevant 
healthcare regulations across 
England, Scotland and Wales.
2015 has been a year of considerable 
adaptation and transformation for Spire 
Healthcare. At the beginning of the year we 
prepared for changes introduced by the Care 
Quality Commission (CQC) regarding how 
they inspect hospitals in England by adapting 
our systems for monitoring and reporting 
performance. We also strengthened our 
programme of on-site clinical reviews led by 
the Chief Nursing Officer and these are now 
undertaken regularly and rigorously in line 
with the CQC’s own methodology.
In 2015, seven hospitals underwent formal 
inspection by the CQC according to the  
new inspection methodology. Results for  
six hospitals have been published: four  
were rated ‘Good’ by the CQC inspection 
team (though we await the outcome of our 
challenge to improve one hospital’s rating to 
‘Outstanding’) and two were rated ‘Requires 
improvement’. We have taken immediate 
steps to address the issues identified on the 
day of inspection and look forward to these 
hospitals being reinspected.
Our hospitals in Wales are regulated by 
Healthcare Inspectorate Wales (HIW)  
and those in Scotland by Healthcare 
Improvement Scotland (HIS). There were  
no inspections in 2015 by HIW. Both Scottish 
hospitals were inspected by HIS in 2015,  
with Spire Murrayfield Edinburgh Hospital 
rated ‘Very good’ for all five standards 
inspected, and Spire Shawfair Park Hospital 
rated ‘Very good’ for four standards and 
‘Good’ for one standard.
In 2016, we will introduce a new clinical 
assurance framework designed in line  
with the five domains inspected by the  
CQC. This will bring together the many 
sources of hard and soft intelligence we 
already monitor in order to help guide our 
frontline management teams as well as 
provide assurance to the executive and  
Board committees ahead of future 
regulatory inspections.  We are pleased  
to report that the Group as whole achieved 
all five clinical KPIs in 2015. 
In addition, and for the third year running, 
there was not a single case of MRSA 
bacteraemia reported by our hospitals,  
nor indeed any cases of MSSA bacteraemia. 
Despite a slight increase in the number  
of C.difficile cases, our rates nevertheless 
compare very favourably with national 
averages published by the Health  
Protection Agency.
Surgical site infection following hip and knee 
surgery (0.20%) in 2015 was the lowest 
reported on record, as was post-operative 
veno-thromboembolism (0.39%).
In terms of treatment effectiveness, we  
are very pleased to report the lowest-ever 
rate of unplanned returns to theatre  
(0.13%), unplanned readmissions (0.18%)  
and unplanned patient transfers (0.04%). 
Inpatient mortality and mortality within  
31 days of surgery both fell slightly in 2015 
compared with 2014. This is a testament to 
the care and attention to detail shown by our 
clinical teams. Good teamwork, robust and 
up-to-date care pathways, and a willingness 
to challenge have together created a basis  
for reliable and high-quality care.
Over the past five years, our hospitals have 
worked hard to improve our processes for 
patient discharge and the planning necessary 
to ensure this is undertaken in a calm and 
efficient manner. Patient satisfaction with 
discharge processes increased for the fifth 
year in a row, making this the greatest 
improving satisfaction measure over this 
period. In addition, compared with last year, 
patients responding ‘Excellent’ to quality of 
care improved by 3% (we do not believe that 
achieving ‘Very Good’ is sufficient for our 
patients) and responses to our other key 
questions all improved year-on-year.
Despite these results, in 2015 I commissioned 
an independent review into the way that we

manage any complaints we might  
receive. In 2016, we will be enacting the 
recommendations that relate to process, 
leadership, development and assurance  
in a bid to better address any concerns that 
are raised by patients when their care did  
not meet their expectations. I expect these 
improvements to further enhance our 
customer service.
Finally, we began two important projects  
in 2015 to transform the way we not only 
care for our cancer patients, but also comply 
with national guidelines and regulations.  
We launched the electronic Ardeo Cancer 
Registry that will record the recommended 
treatment plans for every patient treated for 
cancer with surgery, chemotherapy or 
radiotherapy at a Spire Healthcare hospital. 
This platform also enables multidisciplinary 
teams, either at the hospital or remotely,  
to discuss the treatment plan for a patient 
whilst also viewing their diagnostic images 
and pathology findings. Beginning with 
patients being treated for breast cancer or 
with chemotherapy, in time this will extend 
to every tumour site.
In parallel, we began our implementation  
of iQemo, an electronic prescription system 
for chemotherapy. This will make the process 
of treating patients with chemotherapy both 
simpler for consultants and staff, and safer 
for our patients.
In conclusion, in 2015 our hospitals delivered 
care to patients that was safer and more 
effective than in previous years. At the same 
time, patients have responded by telling us 
that their experience of receiving care was 
better than ever. I salute our clinical teams 
for having delivered on our clinical quality 
goals last year. Working alongside our 
dedicated consultants and specialists, I firmly 
believe that we are united in our ambition to 
improve the quality of our care even further 
in 2016.

STRATEGIC REPORT
   Rebecca Marchant at Spire Liverpool Hospital  Four of our hospitals that have had  
their inspection results published were  
all rated ‘Good’  – with Spire Liverpool  
and Spire Washington hospitals having 
individual domains rated ‘Outstanding’ 
– the only two independent hospitals  
in the country to achieve this so far. 
Like the majority of hospitals in the country, 
two of our hospitals were found to require 
improvement. Prompt and robust action 
has been taken to correct the minor 
concerns which the CQC identified. 
We are looking forward to all our 
remaining hospitals being CQC rated  
as soon as possible – working with our 
regulator and sharing best practice to 
improve our already excellent care quality. 
EMBRACING CARE QUALITY
REBECCA MARCHANT   
Clinical inspection team, CQC 
A small central clinical inspection team,  
led by Chief Nursing Officer, Susan 
Holliday, supports our hospitals before 
and during CQC inspections. Rebecca 
Marchant conducts many clinical 
reviews – which are now effectively 
mini-CQC inspections – preparing  
staff for the sorts of questions and 
information required in the new 
inspection regime.
“We hold forums for matrons and 
clinicians – and we have a range of 
pre-inspection checklists, action plans  
and newsletters – all aimed at sharing 
inspection experiences and tips across 
all our hospitals. Next year we are 
looking to introduce an inspection 
‘toolkit’, for all staff including self-
assessments to help them prepare.”

teams of up to 22 inspectors over a number 
of days of intense examination of all 
aspects of our care provision. 
THE FIVE KEY QUESTIONS THE CQC ASKS 
To give a hospital an overall rating, the 
CQC concentrates on five questions when 
inspecting. Are services: 
• safe?
• effective?
• caring?

Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2015 37 Operating review
Delivering for our patients
Andrew White, Chief Operating 
Officer , joined Spire Healthcare 
in November 20 15. Working 
with our four operations 
directors and our hospital 
directors around the country, 
Andrew and the management 
team run the business day-to-
day, building capacity and 
capability as we implement 
our strategy.
2015 PERFORMANCE 
We judge our performance using a range 
of metrics and key performance indicators 
(KPIs) mapped to a balanced scorecard  
that covers service quality, people and 
engagement, reputation, and shareholder 
value. We track our engagement and 
reputation through regular annual surveys. 
Patient satisfaction is high. In order to align 
our rating of patient satisfaction with the 
NHS and other providers, we introduced a 
Net Promoter Score (NPS) measure for our 
friends and family question, under which  
we were rated 82 out of a possible 100 in 
2015. High patient satisfaction levels were 
also evidenced by patients’ responses 
regarding overall service quality, with 98% of 
our patients rating overall quality of service 
either ‘Excellent’ or ‘Very good’. 
Consultant satisfaction continues to be high, 
with 79% rating our quality of service either 
‘Excellent’ or ‘Very good’. The proportion of 
consultants who believe that our hospitals go 
out of their way to make a difference to their 
working relationship is 96%, the same as last 
year and those who would be ‘Certain’ or 
‘Very likely’ to recommend a Spire Healthcare 
hospital to their friends and family was 
constant at 82%.
77% of our staff responded to our 2015 Staff 
Engagement Survey, an increase of 3% on the 
previous year. This is a good response rate 
and overall engagement improved 2% on 
2014 to 88%. Further details of the positive 
results from our Staff Engagement Survey 
can be found in Our people, the section that 
follows this review, on pages 42 to 45. 
All in all, we are very pleased with a good 
performance for the year. 
REGULATORY COMPLIANCE
We welcome the increase in scrutiny that the 
CQC’s new inspections bring. Experience of 
the process so far indicates that our hospitals 
are in the main, ‘Good’ and ‘Outstanding’  
in some areas, but there are elements for 
improvement. We address all such areas as  
a matter of urgency. 
We have revised the format of our own 
clinical reviews to mirror the CQC’s approach 
across the five domains it reviews – safe, 
effective, caring, responsive and well led.  
Our assurance team already has robust and 
valuable management information, but by 
aligning our risk-based approach and using 
peer review we have developed a good 
feedback loop so we can all learn from our 
experiences and continually improve. 
Our hospitals in Wales are regulated by 
Healthcare Inspectorate Wales (HIW) and 
those in Scotland by Healthcare Improvement 
Scotland (HIS). There were no inspections  
in 2015 by HIW. Both Scottish hospitals  
were inspected by HIS in 2015. Ratings are 
provided against five quality standards; Spire 
Murrayfield Hospital scored ‘Very good’ on all 
five standards, and Spire Shawfair Park Hospital 
scored four ‘Very good’ and one ‘Good’. 
Looking ahead, we will continue to develop 
Spire Healthcare’s management system as 
well as build on our culture as a learning 
organisation.
We are also subject to compliance with the 
Competition and Markets Authority’s Private 
Healthcare Market Investigation Order 2014, 
which came into effect in 2015. Our legal team 
undertook a detailed review of any potentially 
non-compliant arrangements at each of our 
hospitals to ensure each one was compliant  
by the designated deadline of April 2015.

STRATEGIC REPORT
38 Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2015 • Spire Methley Park Hospital – £7.5 million 
development scheme which will see a 
refurbishment of administration areas, 
bedrooms and theatres. Due for 
completion in late 2016 
• Spire Southampton Hospital – £2.5 million 
project to enlarge existing ward due for 
completion in 2016. In addition, we have 
approval to invest in a da Vinci surgical 
robot in 2016 
• Spire Clare Park Hospital – £1.9 million MRI 
scanner, opened in November plus £2.5 
million endoscopy unit, due for completion 
in 2016 
We will also begin the process of 
commissioning our two new hospitals, 
in Manchester and Nottingham, which 
are due to open in 2017 .
Turning to other areas of our business, 
in November, Perform at St George’s Park 
extended its partnership by two years with 
the League Managers Association to provide 
its Perform for Life health and wellbeing 
screening assessments. As well as working 
with hundreds of members of the public,  
the centre also saw a steady stream of top 
athletes and sportsmen and women, 
including boxer, James DeGale, and potential 
Team GB Olympian, Emma Jackson. In 
addition, the centre hosted Ireland and 
Argentina during the Rugby Union World  
Cup and also England Rugby League during  
their three-match test series against New 
Zealand in November. 
Despite challenging trading conditions, 
Lifescan, our screening service, delivered 
7% revenue and 58% EBITDAR growth during 
the year. The integration of this business 
into the Spire Healthcare network is almost 
complete and has successfully delivered not 
only its own revenue stream and improved 
profitability, but also new downstream 
OPERATIONAL EXPANSION
During the year, we opened our second 
Specialist Care Centre in Baddow, offering 
external beam radiotherapy and state-of-the-
art cancer planning and treatment techniques 
to patients in Essex. More details of this 
centre, and our specialist development team 
that opened it, on time and under budget, 
can be found on pages 41 and 57 .
A significant development at Spire  
St Anthony’s Hospital during 2015 was  
the construction of a £27 million purpose-
built complex, increasing capacity to six 
theatres, replacing four. This is due for 
completion in mid 2016. 
Other projects that ran in 2015: 
• Spire Hesslewood Clinic, part of Spire  
Hull and East Riding Hospital, a standalone 
clinic opened in February 2015 and  
has seen positive business growth  
in its first year
• Spire Elland Hospital – new £2.6 million 
theatre which began operating in  
summer 2015 
• Spire Leeds Hospital – £0.4 million 
ambulatory care unit which began 
operating in Q4 2015 
• Spire Roding Hospital – £1.2 million  
Bone and Joint Centre began operating  
in Q4 2015 
• Spire Parkway Hospital – £9.0 million  
theatre expansion and chemotherapy 
development with endoscopy unit and  
a new Storz OR1 theatre
• Spire Cheshire Hospital – £1.3 million 
endoscopy unit, due for completion  
in early 2016 
• Spire Hull and East Riding Hospital –  
£3.3 million development comprising  
a purpose-built clinic and new MRI/CT 
provision, which is due for completion  
in 2016 
income at hospital level. We have received  
full authorisation for our services from both 
the CQC and under the Ionising Radiation 
(Medical Exposure) Regulations 2000 (IRMER). 
This now enables us to concentrate on 
further developing the business as the basis 
of an overall Spire Healthcare screening 
service offering.
In 2015, our pathology laboratories 
undertook 2.2 million tests and showed a 
12% improvement in operational efficiency 
(cost per test). We have also been leading  
the way in the transition from CPC to ISO 
accreditation and we now have three 
laboratories fully accredited (Cardiff, 
Southampton, Portsmouth) with three  
more due for assessment in 2016. 
We also expanded our pathology service, 
opening a new laboratory at Spire Cambridge 
Hospital. The focus for 2016 will be on further 
exploiting capabilities within the Spire 
Healthcare network and developing 
opportunities in the wider pathology market, 
as well as developing laboratories for Spire 
Hull and East Riding Hospital and our two 
new hospitals in Manchester and Nottingham.
OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY
We continue to drive margin through a close 
focus on improving operational efficiency. 
This requires a balanced approach. 
We operate a devolved business model, 
where local leadership and local teams are 
empowered to do the right thing for local 
patients and consultants. However, all our 
hospitals work within Spire Healthcare’s 
operating framework/management system. 
Maintaining the right balance, in terms of 
central protocols, requirements and quality 
standards, aligned with driving local growth 
and performance, remains a key aspect of 
operational management.

Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2015 39 Operating review continued
We will continue to seek ways in which  
we can improve operational efficiency,  
while always safely delivering outstanding 
healthcare to our patients. 
In terms of work flow and patient care, 
we will be moving beyond theatre utilisation, 
to work on theatre optimisation. That  
means planning for the right teams to be in 
the right theatres at the right time, with the 
appropriate skill mix, the correct consumable 
packs and kits for the procedures – all to 
make the journey faster and smoother for the 
patient and make our service the most usable 
for our consultants.
Andrew White
Chief Operating Officer 
16 March 2016
We have instituted a monthly forum for 
all our Hospital Directors to meet and share 
experiences and best practice. A task force 
has been formed to concentrate on assisting 
our lowest quartile performers, drive 
improvement and deliver consistent 
performance right across the portfolio.
Theatre utilisation is a key performance 
indicator of operational efficiency. Average 
utilisation marginally decreased to 63%  
(2014: 64%) across our hospitals in 2015. 
Several hospitals were integrating new 
theatres in 2015, including the new Spire 
Elland Hospital theatre, which initially and 
temporarily affected utilisation. 
Operational efficiency spans the full patient 
journey – from admissions forecasting, 
enquiry conversion, admission processing  
and theatre utilisation, through to timeliness, 
quality of discharge and post-operative 
rehabilitation. Doing this well has a direct 
impact on safety, quality and ultimately, 
patient satisfaction. 
We continue to develop our IT systems, 
an integrated patient, financial and  
supply chain system, providing improved 
management information, cost savings 
and streamlined administration processes. 
During 2015, we integrated the newly 
acquired Spire St Anthony’s Hospital into our 
IT system, developed a new suite of theatre 
utilisation tools enabling more efficient 
scheduling, and began the roll-out of 
real-time bar code stock tracking.
We have also implemented a new Customer 
Relationship Management (CRM) system 
which is fully integrated with our SAP system. 
The new CRM system will improve enquiry 
management and conversion, and call 
handling, and enable direct patient bookings 
for insurers and GPs. 
It was a strong year for the National 
Distribution Centre (NDC) in Droitwich. 
Successful audits were carried out on two  
of the nationally recognised standards with 
which we comply. The NDC also undertook 
compliance audits as part of being a critical 
supplier to the Group. T o support the NDC 
Quality Management System, Q-Pulse, a 
software system has been implemented, 
which will provide all NDC employees with  
a central focal point for all compliance data, 
materials and activities. In addition, Q-Pulse 
will make management aware of areas in  
need of attention if their compliance statuses 
are to remain.
The bi-yearly external Health and Safety 
Audit was conducted and the total risk 
management score was 85 out of 90 (94% 
compliance). Areas of merit included risk 
assessments, incident investigation and 
document control. 
2016
As we continue to expand and grow, one  
of the biggest challenges facing Spire 
Healthcare – and the entire UK healthcare 
system – is finding, recruiting and retaining 
the best staff – particularly nurses.
We are working to develop our recruitment 
and retention strategies. Further details 
of our human resources approach can be 
found in the section, Our people, that follows 
this review on page 42, and this will be an 
area of particular focus during 2016.
The development and opening of our new 
hospitals in Manchester and Nottingham, 
during 2016/17 , will require not only the 
recruitment of additional staff but also 
the support of our procurement and stock 
management teams throughout next year.
In my first few months, I have been visiting our  
38 hospitals and what has struck me most is Spire 
Healthcare’s strong, caring culture, totally focused on 
the patient. And talking to staff all around the UK –  
they’re a great team of highly motivated people who  
want to do the right thing for our patients and truly  
make a difference.
ANDREW WHITE, CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER
STRATEGIC REPORT
40 Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2015 Treatment is always personal – but 
cancer treatments, often requiring 
multiple visits, create particularly strong 
bonds between our patients, their 
hospitals and their clinical teams. In 
developing our Specialist Care Centres 
we have used patient input at all stages 
in creating the calm and positive internal 
environments that are so important for 
reassurance, tranquillity and confidence. 
All aspects of colour, art and aesthetics 
come together to help our patients on 
the road to recovery. 
PATIENTS INVOLVED ALL THE WAY
ROB ANDERSON
Operations Director 
“Cancer survival rates in this 
country are at the highest they 
have ever been. Investment  
in new technology and state-of-
the-art treatment centres like  
this will help push that figure  
even higher.”
MAKING THE DIFFERENCE
Our latest Specialist Care Centre opened  
in Baddow in November 2015 – bringing 
state-of-the-art cancer treatment to Essex 
and the wider region.
The consultant-led centre houses two 
LINACs (linear accelerators) which direct 
high energy beams to conform to a 
tumour’s shape and destroy cancer cells. 
This enables clinicians to provide highly 
targeted radiotherapy, which means  
much greater precision for patients as 
healthy tissue surrounding tumours can be 
preserved. Special additions include a 6D 
robotic couch and a wide-bore CT scanner 
equipped with 4D imaging capabilities. 
The centre treats a broad range of  
cancers including breast, gynaecological, 
prostate, head, neck, skin and lung cancers 
using state-of-the-art treatment and 
verification techniques. 
As with our first Specialist Care Centre  
in Bristol, the centre enables Spire 
Healthcare to offer integrated end-to-end 
care for patients from diagnosis right 
through to recovery.
Offering specialist cancer care, in tailor-made 
surroundings, is part of our strategy to offer 
higher acuity services to our patients.
DELIVERING THE SPECIALIST CARE PATIENTS NEED, IN THE FACILITIES THEY WANT
The UK has fewer LINACs per head  
of population than France, Germany, 
Netherlands, Italy and Belgium*. 
Our continued development of Specialist 
Care Centres means a significant increase 
to the private provision of LINACs, which 
currently stands at only 20 machines 
nationwide outside Greater London.

Our people
Perhaps more than most businesses, ours  
is one where every member of staff needs  
to feel fulfilled, valued and satisfied with 
their work. 
Providing quality care to our 760,000 
patients is totally personal. It is delivered, 
every day of the year, by our skilled and 
dedicated staff. 
At 31 December 2015, we employed  
12,426 people, (3,529 bank workers and 
8,897 permanent employees) – equivalent  
to over 7,800 full-time jobs – split between 
nursing, theatre staff, allied health 
professionals, and administration and  
clinical support staff.
Our employees are predominantly female; 
7,294 compared to 1,603 male. For senior 
management we employ 149 female 
managers out of a total of 247.
ENGAGEMENT AND MOTIVATION
We work hard to foster Spire Healthcare’s 
unique culture – one where every member of 
staff feels fully valued and listened to, where 
they can do their best for their patients, and 
where they can feel fully appreciated. 
Every year we survey our staff’s views on 
how we are doing and ask them how we 
could improve. This year 77% of staff 
responded (3% more than last year), and 
of them 78% said they would recommend 
Spire Healthcare to family and friends as  
a place to work (up from 76% last year and 
72% the year before).
Other highlights from the 2015 survey 
respondents included:
• 93% believe what they do at work makes 
a positive difference (92% in 2014);
• 92% would recommend Spire Healthcare 
to friends and family if they needed care 
or treatment (90% in 2014);
• 91% get personal satisfaction from their 
work (90% in 2014);
• 90% feel that they really fit in with the 
rest of their team (89% in 2014); and
• 89% are proud to work for Spire Healthcare 
(88% in 2014).
The survey also pointed to a number of areas 
where we could improve. Chief among 
these were:
• working together – developing inter-
departmental relationships;
• resource allocation of staff and equipment 
to improve service quality; and
• more open and visible senior  
management – demonstrating our  
values in action.
THE CHALLENGES WE FACE
Finding, recruiting, developing and retaining 
the best clinical and support staff is one 
of our biggest challenges, particularly so  
in a market where there are too few nurses. 
Full-time equivalent nursing vacancy rates 
within the NHS are at least 7%, 37% of nurses 
in the UK are 50 years of age or over. 
Commissioned nursing student places were 
reduced from 22,000 in 2008/09 to 17,000  
in 2012/13 and only 19,000 in 2014/15*, so 
there are not enough new nurses graduating 
from our universities. And the shortfall is not 
being met successfully by overseas nurses – 
tightening immigration law, through the 
Points-Based System introduced in 2008, 
means that 7,000 fewer nurses a year  
are now coming to the UK compared to  
10 years ago.
We are meeting this challenge and 
responding to staff feedback in a number 
of ways.

IMPROVING STAFF RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION AT LEICESTER 
Providing quality care to our 760,000 
patients is totally personal. It is delivered, 
every day of the year, by our skilled and 
dedicated staff.
CAROLINE ROBERTS, GROUP HUMAN RESOURCES DIRECTOR 
Spire Leicester Hospital is among our  
best, in terms of effective recruitment, 
low spending on agency nurses, and  
high staff retention rates. It’s far more 
cost-effective to find good staff and to 
keep them, than it is to be in a constant 
cycle of turnover. But of even greater 
importance – skilled and stable clinical 
teams deliver the very best care for  
our patients.
Overseen by Matron, Alison Dickinson, 
and HR Administrator, Lyn Hall, 
recruitment and retention is key to  
the success of Spire Leicester Hospital. 
As Alison says, “We have a low rate of 
agency nursing staff at Leicester of 1.03% 
and also a relatively low clinical staff 
turnover of 9.4%. Our recruitment 
campaign successfully attracts really 
great people from both the independent 
sector and the NHS. That gives us a broad 
spectrum of people and skills. We’ve 
made it easy for potential NHS recruits  
by adopting the NHS’s language around 
pensions, which really helps people with 
the transition. And we operate a buddy 
system and really good induction plan to 
help new starters through their first few 
weeks in the hospital.” 
Lyn comments, “We are able to act faster 
than the NHS which means we can recruit 
quickly and flexibly. For instance, if we  
see a really outstanding person, even if 
there are no immediate vacancies in their 
specialist area, we might offer another 
post and give training to fit the role.  
We’re able to offer a lot of training 
opportunities, which is a massive draw  
to staff. We also offer taster days in 
departments so applicants can see for 
themselves whether they’d suit life at 
Spire Leicester Hospital.”

• managing our talent better, so that 
we identify, deploy, develop and engage 
our people better; and
• better aligning our staff benefits and 
incentives to personal, business and 
investor needs.
Clinical staff resourcing is of critical 
importance. We already have a recruitment

STRATEGIC REPORT
44 Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2015 HEALTHCARE CYCLE CHALLENGE
In June, we held the second annual 
Spire Healthcare Cycle Challenge.
Last year, the Challenge covered 620km 
between Spire Healthcare hospitals 
and raised money for Walking with the 
Wounded and Macmillan Cancer 
Support. This year, 200 Spire Healthcare 
cyclists, joined again by Chief Executive 
Officer, Rob Roger, covered 720km over 
six days, from Manchester to London, 
stopping at Blackpool, Leeds, Bristol, 
Southampton, Portsmouth, Cheam, 
Norwich and Cambridge along the way. 
Over £5,000 was raised for this  
year’s chosen charity, Harrison’s Fund. 
The charity is named after an eight-
year-old boy from Surrey who was 
diagnosed with Duchenne Muscular 
Dystrophy, a fatal genetic condition 
that affects the muscles, causing 
muscular weakness. The charity’s goal  
is to raise as much money as it can  
for the world’s best researchers working  
on a cure for Duchenne.
2015 CHARITABLE HIGHLIGHTS 
COMMUNITY CHARITY WORK 
Over the last year, each Spire Healthcare 
hospital continued to fundraise for 
important local and national causes.  
In fact, over £158,000 was raised by  
the Group through various sponsored 
walks, sporting events, bake-offs and 
consultant golf days, to name but  
a few. Next year, it is our aim to go 
further and raise more, and build upon 
the good work our people already do.

SUSAN HOLLIDAY 
Chief Nursing Officer, Spire Healthcare
“I have worked with the CQC since the 
new methodology was introduced 
about three years ago and, in 2015,  
I became a specialist adviser and 
inspector myself. It was important for 
me to see the other side of the CQC, 
what they are looking for and how  
we can be at our best for inspections. 
My area of expertise is governance 
and it’s my position to support  
the CQC inspection to enable the  
best rating outcome. I undertake 
hospital-wide inspections and 
interview hospital directors,  
matrons, governance managers, 
infection control leads and senior 
management teams. I look for  
a sound knowledge base of the 
hospital, their understanding of  
what is happening, visibility, and 
vision of the business, and staff 
engagement. This role really helps  
me get into the correct mind-set  
for when I do my internal clinical 
reviews in Spire Healthcare hospitals. 
There are few people working in  
the independent sector that have,  
like me, joined the CQC as specialist 
advisers. Private hospitals do operate 
differently from their NHS counterparts 
and advisers who know the independent 
sector bring a wealth of experience  
and expertise to the role. 
The CQC’s new methodology of 
inspecting hospitals has presented 
differing views but ultimately  
they are looking for good leadership, 
management and governance  
of the organisation.”

LOOKING AFTER OUR ENVIRONMENT 
At Spire Healthcare, we realise that we have  
a ‘duty of care’ to the environment as well  
as our patients and we continue to promote 
a low carbon culture across our hospitals.  
We continually review how we operate our 
buildings and infrastructure to improve 
carbon efficiency across our portfolio. 
One of our key areas of focus is our usage  
of electricity and natural gas.
ENERGY
Energy targets vs performance
In 2010, we published our five-year energy 
reduction targets, aiming to reduce CO 2e 
from electricity and natural gas by 10% per 
pound of revenue by 2015 on the baseline 
year of 2010. We are delighted to announce 
that this was exceeded – we achieved a 
reduction of 32% per £ of revenue by  
1 January 2015.
We use the intensity metric of carbon 
emissions per £ revenue, which increases  
in proportion to the growth in our business. 
The addition of Spire St Anthony’s Hospital  
to our portfolio, for example, added 6% to 
our energy consumption overnight. 
Legislation
Since becoming a publicly listed company  
in 2014, the Group has registered for the 
government’s CRC energy efficiency scheme 
and we will report our carbon emissions  
to the Environment Agency accordingly.
Our mandatory ESOS audits have now  
been completed and concluded that due  
to work already undertaken in improving 
energy efficiencies across our estate,  
the recommendations would be unlikely  
to produce large energy savings. The 
recommendations will however be 
incorporated into our carbon reduction 
planning for the future. 
We have also been invited to participate  
in the Carbon Disclosure Project’s (CDP) 
programme which evaluates both 
performance and disclosure. We made our 
first submission to the CDP this year and we 
are delighted to say that our score of 90D 
made us the second placed new respondent 
in the FTSE350 for 2015.
Capital investment in low carbon 
infrastructure
We continue to invest in our engineering 
infrastructure to improve energy efficiencies. 
Key projects this year included investment  
in areas such as lighting, mechanical 
ventilation, building controls, heating and 
domestic hot water services.
High efficiency lighting – we have now 
installed external LED lighting at 32 of our 
hospitals which are benefiting from a much 
improved light quality as well as the energy 
reduction this technology brings. On the 
back of the measured energy and aesthetic 
benefits of our internal upgrade to LED 
lighting at Spire Leicester Hospital last year, 
similar investment has been made at Spire 
Southampton Hospital in 2015 where over 
890 fluorescent fittings have been replaced 
with LED luminaires. We intend to invest 
further in this area during 2016 to ensure  
we continue to reduce our electricity 
consumption and realise our 2020 energy 
reduction targets.
High efficiency heating and hot water 
services – modular condensing heating  
and hot water boilers were installed at  
Spire Dunedin and Spire Leeds hospitals in 
2015, which will deliver a reduction in gas 
consumption at those sites in future years. 
Due to the absence of piped natural gas at 
our Spire Tunbridge Wells Hospital, the hot 
water demand was previously served solely 
by grid-supplied mains electricity. Two ageing

STRATEGIC REPORT
46 Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2015 and inefficient 2000L hot calorifiers were 
heated by an array of electric elements 
totalling 38kW each to provide hot water 
distribution at 60 degrees centigrade for 
hospital clinical, domestic and catering 
needs. Working with our mechanical and 
electrical consultants, we reviewed more 
efficient replacement options and opted to 
install underground liquid petroleum gas 
storage cylinders to fuel new high efficiency 
LPG condensing modular boilers. These will 
provide low pressure hot water and serve 
plate heat exchangers for domestic hot 
water use. Using LPG as a primary fuel source 
provides access to efficient plant, improved 
control and reduced carbon emissions. Its 
capacity can be increased as required to 
reduce the site’s reliance on electricity for 
heating the main building.
High efficiency ventilation system – our 
theatre ventilation plant ensures rapid air 
exchange within our theatre suites to protect 
our patients from infection. These systems 
are energy hungry. In 2015, we replaced 
ageing systems at Spire Yale Hospital with 
high efficiency control and heat recovery 
systems that help deliver this critical air  
in the most efficient way.
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS (GHG)
This section provides the emissions data  
and supporting information required by  
The Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report 
and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013.
Footprint boundary
An operational control approach has been 
used to define the GHG emissions boundary, 
as defined in Defra’s latest Environmental 
Reporting guidelines: “Your organisation has 
operational control over an operation if it, or 
one of its subsidiaries, has the full authority 
to introduce and implement its operating 
policies at the operation”. 
For purposes of baselining and ongoing 
comparison, it is required to express the GHG 
emissions using a carbon intensity metric. 
The intensity metric chosen is per £ revenue. 
Spire Healthcare’s revenue in 2015 was 
£884.8 million, giving an intensity of 
51.1tCO 2e per £m revenue, 3% lower than 
2014 (52.6tCO 2e). 
WASTE
The NDC provides the Group with a 
collection service, removing cardboard  
and paper for recycling. As part of the  
NDC ISO 14001 objectives the scheme has  
been extended to the re-use of cardboard 
packaging at handling units as part of  
NDC deliveries into hospitals; this has 
resulted in a 46-tonne/11% reduction  
of cardboard during 2015.  
Central Purchasing continues to work with 
our strategic waste management partners  
to help direct our general waste away from 
landfill and into Energy from Waste (EfW) 
facilities. Over 86% of our general waste 
(1,981 tonnes) is now being recycled utilising 
material recycling facilities and 100% of the 
residue waste is now being sent to EfW. 
All the clinical waste generated by clinical 
facilities is now either incinerated or 
pre-treated and the residual sent to EfW.
For Spire Healthcare this captures emissions 
associated with the operation of all our 
hospitals and other buildings such as clinics, 
offices and the distribution centre, plus 
company-owned and leased transport. As 
Spire Healthcare has no overseas operations, 
all emissions refer to UK operations only. 
Emissions sources
All material scope one and two emissions  
are included. These include emissions 
associated with: 
• fuel combustion: stationary (natural gas, 
and red diesel for backup generators) and 
mobile (vehicle fuel); 
• purchased electricity; and 
• fugitive emissions (refrigerants,  
medical gases). 
There are no known process emissions  
and no purchased heat or steam. 
Methodology and emissions factors
This report was calculated using the 
methodology set out in Environmental 
Reporting Guidelines (ref. PB 13944), 
published by Defra in June 2013. 
Emissions factors are taken from the Defra/ 
DECC emissions factor update published  
in 2015, produced on behalf of Defra/DECC 
by Ricardo AEA and Carbon Smart. 
GHG emissions data
The GHG emissions for Spire Healthcare  
for the year were 45,282tCO 2e, (2014: 
45,053tCO 2e). The ‘facility operation’ 
emissions are attributable to the use of 
medical gases, carbon dioxide and nitrous 
oxide, (5,004tCO 2 e) and leakage of refrigerant 
gases (2,149tCO 2e).
This is 2% higher than the emissions reported 
for 2014.

Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2015 47 Risk management  
and internal control
The Audit and Risk Committee, with the 
assistance of the Clinical Governance and 
Safety Committee (CGSC), provides the  
Board with advice on the Group’s overall risk 
appetite and strategy, and a view on the 
current risk exposures, the future risk strategy, 
and the effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management and internal control processes. 
The risk management framework is designed 
to identify, evaluate and mitigate the risks 
that the Group faces at all levels. The 
underlying process aims to provide robust 
management information to enable conscious 
risk-based decision making. 
In 2015, the Risk Appetite and Risk Strategy 
were reviewed and agreed by the Board to 
ensure a consistent level of understanding 
of risk tolerance and acceptable level of risk  
to the Group as well as a clear strategy on risk 
management processes going forward. 
The Board recognises that it has limited 
control over many of the external risks it  
faces, such as macroeconomic events and the 
complex regulatory environment. However, it 
is important to consider the potential impact 
of such ongoing risks to the business and 
where possible develop contingency plans to 
minimise the impact of these external risks. 
CLINICAL GOVERNANCE AND SAFETY 
COMMITTEE
During 2015, the CGSC chaired by Dame Janet 
Husband focused on key clinical risks and 
trends including the review of notifiable 
incidents and external regulatory inspections 
across the Group. The corporate Clinical 
Services team has developed a detailed 
hospital review methodology and internal 
inspection programme that provides 
assurance to the CGSC and senior level 
management that hospitals are complying 
with national clinical standards and Spire 
Healthcare’s policies and procedures. Where 
any gaps are identified, these are reported 
and acted upon promptly. 
The Clinical Services team has developed  
a detailed set of assurance reports in order  
to provide management oversight at a Group 
and hospital level.
RISK MANAGEMENT  
The Board recognises that the Group needs  
to comply with both the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and increasing regulatory 
expectations for listed companies risk 
management and internal control processes. 
The risk management framework was 
reviewed by the Board and its committees 
during 2015, and it will continue to evolve and 
develop as the level of risk maturity increases 
within the Group.
CORPORATE RISKS
All significant risks facing the Group are 
captured within a Corporate Risk Register  
and are assessed in terms of consequence  
and likelihood. Each such risk is owned by 
a member of the senior leadership team who 
works to monitor and mitigate that risk. The 
Corporate Risk Register is reviewed on a 
regular basis, and in response to changes in 
the risk environment (for example in response 
to an incident). The principal risks facing the 
Group are drawn from the Corporate Risk 
Register and are linked to the Strategic Pillars 
of the Group. These are also reviewed on a 
regular basis and changes from last year are 
indicated in the Principal risks section on 
pages 50 to 55.
INTERNAL CONTROLS
The principal internal controls and assurance 
activity over the risks that are directly 
manageable by the Group are:
Standard policies and procedures 
The Group has documented policies and 
standard procedures in place covering all 
significant activities and areas of risk, which 
are subject to regular review and update.
Assurance over clinical delivery and clinical 
regulatory compliance risks
As a provider of clinical services to patients, 
the Group faces a specific set of non-financial 
risks associated with such provision. In 
relation to these risks:
• the corporate Clinical Services team, which 
is independent of the hospital operations 
and is led by the Group Medical Director, 
oversees a national programme of clinical 
audits, in addition to conducting on-site 
clinical reviews of every hospital and 
non-hospital unit, according to the 
approach taken at regulatory inspections. 
These form part of the overall framework 
for clinical governance and quality, to 
ensure that clinical risk and clinical 
regulatory compliance is managed 
effectively across all registered sites. The 
results of these activities are regularly 
reviewed by the corporate Clinical Services 
team, Operations Directors, Matrons, the 
Executive Committee and the CGSC; 
• comprehensive, non-financial 
management information on clinical 
performance, including safety, clinical 
effectiveness and customer experience,  
is produced and reviewed quarterly  
against pre-agreed standards by the 
corporate Clinical Services team, 
Operations Directors, Matrons, the 
Executive Committee and the CGSC. 
Specific KPI measures drawn from this 
management information are given  
on page 35; 
Overall responsibility for the Group’s risk  
management and internal control systems  
lies with the Board of Directors. The Board  
has delegated oversight to two committees.
STRATEGIC REPORT
48 Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2015 • the Group is subject to substantial levels  
of external inspection and review, both by 
the range of national healthcare regulators 
and through invited assurance inspections 
such as the rolling programme of health 
and safety inspections carried out by 
third-party specialists. The outcomes  
of these activities are reviewed by the 
Executive Committee and the CGSC; and
• the structures and processes for internal 
confirmation of clinical regulatory 
compliance and the level of evidence  
and assurance required to monitor this  
on an ongoing basis have been further 
strengthened and formalised in 2015. 
FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL CONTROLS
Financial control is established through:
• the annual process of preparing business 
plans and budgets, followed up by close 
monitoring of operational performance by 
the executive management and the Board;
• monthly monitoring of actual results, 
compared to budgets, forecasts and the 
previous year ;
• all material capital expenditure is subject to 
an investment evaluation and authorisation 
procedure; 
• common accounting policies and 
procedures; and 
• the Group’s treasury position and forecast 
liquidity are kept under review to ensure 
that borrowings are aligned with the 
Group’s growth and are in compliance  
with banking covenants.
Other non-financial operational risks are 
managed by means of the application of best 
practice, as defined by Group policies and 
standard procedures, in areas such as project 
management, human resources management 
and IT security and delivery, supported by 
detailed performance monitoring of outputs 
and issues.
INTERNAL AUDIT/INTERNAL CONTROL 
ASSURANCE
The need for an Internal Audit function was 
reviewed by the Audit and Risk Committee 
during the year. It is anticipated that the 
structure of the function will be formalised 
and the remit of the Internal Audit activities 
will be further redefined during 2016. 
The Group has not historically considered 
it necessary to establish an Internal Audit 
function, in part because of the way hospitals 
and administration activities are structured, 
which means that the initiation of 
transactions is entirely separated from the 
delivery of the associated services and their 
financial recording, and the low level of 
delegated authority at hospital level limits 
risk exposure. Reliance is placed on the 
management review process, transaction-
level controls built into business processes 
and other forms of assurance activity and 
audits being performed across the Group, 
including clinical audits, health and safety 
audits and regulatory inspections. 
The Audit and Risk Committee has decided 
that the assurance provided by these 
processes will be supplemented in certain 
specific areas through the procurement of 
specific independent reviews undertaken 
within an Internal Audit framework, the  
scope of which is set by the Audit and Risk 
Committee based on a periodic review of the 
risk register and internal controls.
CONTINUOUS LEARNING 
Accepting that internal control systems and 
robust risk management cannot guarantee  
to reduce error or loss to zero, the Group takes 
all instances of complaints, control failures, 
regulatory non-compliance or other risk 
events (or near misses) very seriously, and  
has a detailed process in place to take action 
in respect of each specific issue identified, 
to understand the cause and to learn from  
the event wherever possible, so that the 
chance of reoccurrence is minimised. An open 
culture is actively promoted and monitored 
within the Group that positively encourages 
the reporting of all risk events and other  
issues arising. The number and nature of 
events arising and the operation of event 
management processes are closely monitored 
by hospital management, the Executive 
Committee, the Audit and Risk Committee 
and the CGSC.
The Group operates an independent 
whistleblowing service to facilitate reporting 
of any issues or concerns that staff may 
have that they are unwilling to raise via any 
other channel. 
VIABILITY STATEMENT
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 2014 revision of the Corporate Governance Code, the Directors assessed the viability of the Group 
and have adopted a period of three years for the assessment. A three-year period was selected as it corresponds with the Board’s strategic 
planning horizon. Whilst existing bank facilities extend until July 2019, this viability assessment has also considered the ability of the Group 
to refinance bank facilities at the end of the three-year period based on current market-lending multiples.
The assessment conducted considered the Group’s revenue, EBITDA, operating profit, cash flows and loan covenants over the three-year 
period. These metrics were subject to severe downside stress testing and sensitivity analyses over the assessment period, taking account  
of the Group’s current position, the Group’s experience of managing adverse conditions in the past and the impact of a number of severe 
yet plausible scenarios, based on the principal risks set out in the Strategic Report. 
These scenarios may be summarised as follows:
• Spire Healthcare is unable to access sufficient numbers of appropriately qualified clinical staff, restricting growth, driving up clinical  
staff costs and constraining the capacity of new hospital developments;
• a key hospital is subject to temporary suspension of trade, with a permanent adverse impact on revenues, for example, due to failure  
to meet CQC regulatory standards; 
• the Group is subject to temporary suspension of trade, with a temporary adverse impact on revenue, for example, as a result of a 
successful cyberattack on key business systems; and
• the downside modelling of a number of risks which result in a decline in earnings, including lower NHS tariffs or referral rates or a general 
economic downturn.
Based on the results of this analysis, the Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the next three years.

THE RISK
1 Availability of 
key medical staff
Growing demand for healthcare, changes to the working requirements and a limited supply of appropriately 
qualified key medical staff, leads to a shortage of medical staff. Profitable growth, in line with the Group’s 
strategy, requires an expansion of clinical services in hospitals, particularly including more complex surgical 
procedures and ongoing treatment of higher-risk patients, which could be impacted by a shortage of key 
medical staff. In order to expand our directory of services at hospital level, in line with our strategy, it is vital 
to have access to appropriately qualified, self-employed consultants.
The market may see salary rates rise as competition for staff increases and, as a result, the Group’s costs may 
increase and its profits may reduce.
The Board focuses on staff retention, evidenced by very high levels of staff satisfaction and, hence, 
low staff turnover, and its excellent reputation to attract new staff.
Overseas recruitment of English-speaking nurses is being used to mitigate the UK shortage of 
trained nursing staff and to reduce the cost of using agency staff.
The Group believes consultants are attracted by its advanced facilities, technology and equipment, 
excellent brand and reputation, the availability of a broad range of treatments, skilled nursing staff 
and medical support staff, and the efficiency of administrative support. The Group undertakes 
continuous investment in its equipment, facilities and services to retain high-quality consultants 
and also provides theatre capacity to new consultants. This is confirmed by high consultant 
satisfaction levels.
An employee survey is conducted annually to establish employee satisfaction and, where 
appropriate, changes in working practices are made in response to the survey findings to  
aid retention.
2 Clinical care The Group’s future growth depends upon its ability to maintain its reputation for high-quality services  
by meeting its quality goals. Poor clinical outcomes, negative media comment or patient, GP and/or 
consultant dissatisfaction could reduce the quality ratings, which could lead to a loss of patient referrals  
and lost earnings.
Spire Healthcare continually monitors its clinical standards, policies and procedures through the 
Board’s Clinical Governance and Safety Committee. 
During 2015, effective management information and associated reporting have been developed 
and are now provided to the Executive Committee on a regular basis for greater transparency. 
A number of key performance indicators are used in the assessment of clinical standards and these 
may be found in the Clinical review.
The Group reviews and maintains insurance to mitigate the possibility of a major loss. Adequacy  
of cover is reviewed annually with the Group’s brokers.
3 Macroeconomic 
conditions
Approximately 67% of the Group’s revenue is dependent on private patients having private medical 
insurance (PMI), paid by their employer or paid by the individual, or being able to afford its services (Self-pay).
In an economic downturn, the number of insured individuals falls with the level of employment and 
individuals have reduced real income to fund insurance or Self-pay for procedures.
This would have an adverse effect on the Group’s business, the results of its operations and prospects.
The Board manages this risk by regularly reviewing market conditions and economic indicators  
to assess whether actions are required.
As successfully employed in the recent economic downturn, if the private market contracts, the 
Group can try to reduce costs and future investment to improve profit and cash flow, and may  
be able to offer the released capacity to the NHS at its lower tariff, reducing the impact on profit.

THE RISK
4 Government 
policy
Change in the medium-term public funding of NHS services provision, and/or the prioritisation of this  
funding to particular service lines over time (elective healthcare, A&E, community care, etc.), could adversely 
reduce the flow of NHS patients to Spire Healthcare.
Changes in the service level requirements for providers of NHS services, and service level commitments  
to members of the public served by the NHS, could adversely impact the attractiveness of privately  
funded treatment.
Changes in fiscal policy could increase the burden of welfare resulting in a reduction of NHS-funded options. 
A fundamental change in the tariff structure (pricing arrangements) associated with the provision of services 
to the NHS could result in reduced access to patients, reduced tariffs, or reduced prices leading to reduced 
revenues and/or margins. 
The Group believes that the private sector has become a fundamental partner of the NHS across 
the UK. The continued use of private facilities is, in Spire Healthcare’s view, the best way to meet 
the challenges facing the NHS, particularly as there is limited capacity within the NHS to take back 
work currently undertaken by the private sector.
The Group’s service levels are confirmed by regular surveys of patients, GPs and consultants, which 
provide ongoing feedback to ensure NHS requirements (whether as providers or as commitments 
to its patients) are met. In addition, the Board regularly reviews the competitiveness of its patient 
offering (both NHS and private patients).
The Board continually monitors government policy, NHS requirements and associated tariff structures 
to consider the need for cost and/or investment reduction, whether in the short, medium or long term.
5 Compliance with 
laws, regulations 
and other 
applicable 
requirements
The Group operates in a highly regulated environment, including complying with the requirements of,  
for example, the CQC, Monitor and the CMA.
Failure to comply with laws, regulations or regulatory standards may expose the Group to patient claims, 
fines, penalties, damage to reputation, suspension from the treatment of NHS patients, loss of hospital 
license and loss of private patients, such that the Group may not be able to operate one or more of its 
hospitals, causing a significant reduction in profit.
The CQC has initiated its new inspection regime which assesses and rates hospitals and makes these results 
publicly available. If a hospital fared badly in one of these inspections, or a process embedded throughout the 
Group was considered unacceptable it could result in one or many hospitals being assessed as ‘Inadequate’ 
which could have significant regulatory and reputational impacts. 
In addition, the Group could fail to anticipate legal or regulatory changes leading to a significant financial  
or reputational impact.
The Group is in the process of strengthening its Group-wide risk management framework 
(and associated policies and procedures) to ensure that risks are mitigated as far as possible,  
the executive management team has appropriate visibility to ensure robust decision making, and 
the Group has the ability to monitor and react to the changing regulatory framework of a listed 
company in the healthcare sector.
The Group has a significant centralised clinical team which assists hospitals in establishing and 
maintaining a high level of clinical performance. 
Emerging legal or regulatory changes are monitored by the Board, the Executive Committee and 
the Safety Quality and Risk Committee, in addition to consultations with external advisers and 
industry briefings.
6 Competitor 
challenge
Spire Healthcare operates in a highly competitive market. New or existing competitors may enter the market 
of one or more of our existing hospitals, or offer new services.
The potential impact would be the loss of market share due to a new competitor and reduced profitability 
and cash flow.
The Group maintains a watching brief on new and existing competitor activity and retains the 
ability to react quickly to changes in patient and market demand.
The Group considers that a partial mitigation of the impact of competitor activity is ensured by 
providing patients with high-quality care and by maintaining good working relationships with GPs 
and consultants.
7 Insurance Healthcare companies, including Spire Healthcare, are sometimes subject to actions alleging negligence,

THE RISK
4 Government 
policy
Change in the medium-term public funding of NHS services provision, and/or the prioritisation of this  
funding to particular service lines over time (elective healthcare, A&E, community care, etc.), could adversely 
reduce the flow of NHS patients to Spire Healthcare.
Changes in the service level requirements for providers of NHS services, and service level commitments  
to members of the public served by the NHS, could adversely impact the attractiveness of privately  
funded treatment.
Changes in fiscal policy could increase the burden of welfare resulting in a reduction of NHS-funded options. 
A fundamental change in the tariff structure (pricing arrangements) associated with the provision of services 
to the NHS could result in reduced access to patients, reduced tariffs, or reduced prices leading to reduced 
revenues and/or margins. 
The Group believes that the private sector has become a fundamental partner of the NHS across 
the UK. The continued use of private facilities is, in Spire Healthcare’s view, the best way to meet 
the challenges facing the NHS, particularly as there is limited capacity within the NHS to take back 
work currently undertaken by the private sector.
The Group’s service levels are confirmed by regular surveys of patients, GPs and consultants, which 
provide ongoing feedback to ensure NHS requirements (whether as providers or as commitments 
to its patients) are met. In addition, the Board regularly reviews the competitiveness of its patient 
offering (both NHS and private patients).
The Board continually monitors government policy, NHS requirements and associated tariff structures 
to consider the need for cost and/or investment reduction, whether in the short, medium or long term.
5 Compliance with 
laws, regulations 
and other 
applicable 
requirements
The Group operates in a highly regulated environment, including complying with the requirements of,  
for example, the CQC, Monitor and the CMA.
Failure to comply with laws, regulations or regulatory standards may expose the Group to patient claims, 
fines, penalties, damage to reputation, suspension from the treatment of NHS patients, loss of hospital 
license and loss of private patients, such that the Group may not be able to operate one or more of its 
hospitals, causing a significant reduction in profit.
The CQC has initiated its new inspection regime which assesses and rates hospitals and makes these results 
publicly available. If a hospital fared badly in one of these inspections, or a process embedded throughout the 
Group was considered unacceptable it could result in one or many hospitals being assessed as ‘Inadequate’ 
which could have significant regulatory and reputational impacts. 
In addition, the Group could fail to anticipate legal or regulatory changes leading to a significant financial  
or reputational impact.
The Group is in the process of strengthening its Group-wide risk management framework 
(and associated policies and procedures) to ensure that risks are mitigated as far as possible,  
the executive management team has appropriate visibility to ensure robust decision making, and 
the Group has the ability to monitor and react to the changing regulatory framework of a listed 
company in the healthcare sector.
The Group has a significant centralised clinical team which assists hospitals in establishing and 
maintaining a high level of clinical performance. 
Emerging legal or regulatory changes are monitored by the Board, the Executive Committee and 
the Safety Quality and Risk Committee, in addition to consultations with external advisers and 
industry briefings.
6 Competitor 
challenge
Spire Healthcare operates in a highly competitive market. New or existing competitors may enter the market 
of one or more of our existing hospitals, or offer new services.
The potential impact would be the loss of market share due to a new competitor and reduced profitability 
and cash flow.
The Group maintains a watching brief on new and existing competitor activity and retains the 
ability to react quickly to changes in patient and market demand.
The Group considers that a partial mitigation of the impact of competitor activity is ensured by 
providing patients with high-quality care and by maintaining good working relationships with GPs 
and consultants.
7 Insurance Healthcare companies, including Spire Healthcare, are sometimes subject to actions alleging negligence,

The Group could be subject to litigation for actions by third parties or may be found liable for damages which

THE RISK
8 Cybersecurity The Group’s information technology platform supports, among other things, management control of patient 
administration, billing and financial information and reporting processes. In common with other corporate 
organisations, the Group faces the challenges of a continually evolving external cyberthreat landscape, and 
could become vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruption from unauthorised tampering.
The Group’s business could be disrupted if its information systems fail or if its databases are breached, 
destroyed or damaged. This could cause financial and reputational impacts.
The Group has a three-year IT plan outlining the strategy developed in order to support the 
business. There are forums which relevant business and IT stakeholders attend to discuss the IT plan 
and projects, including monthly meetings to discuss changes to SAP enhancements and NHS 
developments and senior leadership team meetings held quarterly. The Group’s Information 
Technology Continuity Plans continue to be reviewed, updated and tested to ensure relevance.
9 Concentration 
of PMI market
The PMI market is concentrated, with the top four companies – Bupa, AXA, Aviva and VitalityHealth 
(formerly PruHealth) – having a market share of over 85%.
Loss of an existing contractual relationship with any of the key insurers could significantly reduce revenue 
and profit.
Further consolidation of the PMI market may lead to additional restrictions which could decrease profitability 
or increase the consequential loss of a partner.
The Group works hard to maintain good relationships and a joint product/patient health offering 
with the PMI companies, which, in the opinion of the Directors, assists the healthcare sector as  
a whole in delivering high-quality patient care. 
The Board believes continuing to invest in its well-placed portfolio of hospitals should provide  
a natural fit to the local requirements of all the PMI providers.
The Group has entered into contracts to continue the good relationships for the long-term and  
to reduce the Group’s risk.
10 Investment plans 
and execution
The capital investment programme (which includes IT system developments, and the construction of two 
new hospitals) for the Group consists of the largest number of parallel developments undertaken to date.
With any major project, there are risks such as major cost overrun or substantial delay in delivery which could 
impact upon the expected returns, the Group’s planned profit growth and future cash flow.
The Group conducts a detailed financial and operational appraisal process to evaluate the expected 
returns on capital during the evaluation phase of the project. 
Robust project management is employed throughout the project, from the evaluation, to the bid 
process, agreement of contract terms and conditions, cost forecasting, as well as regular 
monitoring and management of progress. 
Regular reporting of all significant projects to the executive sponsor and the Board is provided.
11 Liquidity and 
covenant risk
The Group may have insufficient liquid resources to meet its financial liabilities as they fall due, or breach 
financial covenants linked to its borrowings.
Failure to meet its obligations or covenants would have a substantial adverse effect on the Group’s 
reputation and may lead to borrowings becoming repayable earlier than contracted for.
The Group actively monitors and manages its liquid asset position, its financial liabilities falling due 
and the cover against its loan covenants.
Forward projections show that the Group can meet its liquidity requirements from existing liquid 
assets and maintain its loan covenant obligations, even in adverse scenarios. In addition, there is  
a committed, undrawn revolving credit facility of £100 million available to meet liquidity needs,  
if required.
In an adverse scenario, capital expenditure could be cut back to reduce the demand on liquidity.

  Julie Peters on site at Spire St Anthony’s Hospital 
STRATEGIC REPORT Creating new hospitals and expanding our 
existing ones without disrupting patient 
care requires specialist planning and 
development skills.
Our skilled and experienced development 
team uses proven project management 
methodologies to deliver these highly 
complex developments to strict 
timetables and budgets.
Success is built on constant  
communication, the absolute expectation 
that all contractors will deliver, and 
meticulous attention to all aspects  
of the project – from community 
engagement to planning, from 
construction to staff recruitment. 
As Julie Peters from our central 
development team says, “These highly 
complex developments combine planning, 
design, clinical, commercial, IT and 
construction work streams. Our job is to 
make sure the hospital isn’t just there, but 
that the clinical staff are recruited and 
trained, it passes its CQC inspection and 
everything is fully operational on day one.
“And that we deliver on time and even 
under budget!”

BUILDING FOR THE FUTURE
Spire Healthcare has invested 
substantially every year we’ve been in 
existence in new and expanded hospitals.
In 2015, we opened our second new-build 
Specialist Care Centre in Baddow, and  
a new theatre, opened at Spire Elland 
Hospital, will benefit more than 2,000 
patients from the local area in its first year.
At Spire St Anthony’s Hospital, six new 
theatres, a new physiotherapy suite with  
a gym and hydrotherapy, an enlarged 
recovery unit, additional consulting rooms 
and an expanded car park, are all due to be 
completed by mid 2016. 
And two entirely new-build hospitals –  
in Nottingham and Manchester – will add 
six theatres and 86 in-patient beds to our 
capacity in 2017.

STRATEGIC REPORT

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2015 61 Executive Chairman’s  
governance letter
We recognise and support  
the principles of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. 
During 2015 we complied with 
the relevant provisions of this 
code except in relation to 
director independence which is 
described further in the report.
Dear Shareholder,
Last year, in our first Annual Report, we took 
the opportunity to describe the governance 
challenges that the Company faced as a 
newly listed public limited company and  
the steps we had taken to address these 
including creating a new Board of Directors, 
establishing committees and implementing 
a robust system of controls since Admission. 
During 2015, we further developed these 
measures, at all levels, as we strongly believe 
that sound corporate governance standards 
underpin sustainable growth and generates 
shareholder value.
I am very pleased to report that your  
Board, with its diverse commercial skills  
and experience, continues to develop good 
working relationships and Board synergies, 
which will aid our future stewardship of  
the Company and its overall governance.
I would especially like to draw shareholders’ 
attention to the following key governance 
matters on which we have focused. 
MEDICLINIC INTERNATIONAL
In June, our long-term major investor, Cinven 
Funds, sold its 29.9% ordinary shareholding  
in the Company to Mediclinic International.  
I would like to record my thanks to Cinven  
for the support it has given Spire Healthcare 
and the wise counsel that both Dr Supraj 
Rajagopalan and Simon Rowlands have 
brought to Board discussions as Principal 
Shareholder Directors. Supraj left the Board  
at this time but I was pleased that Simon 
agreed to remain as a Non-Executive Director. 
His knowledge of the Company and the wider 
private medical care industry will continue  
to be a valuable resource as we progress  
the business.
Following the acquisition of shares by 
Mediclinic International, we welcomed  
its chief executive, Danie Meintjes, as a 
shareholder-appointed Director to the  
Board in August.
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
During the second half of 2015, the Board 
completed its first formal performance 
evaluation. The evaluation process was led 
by myself, with support from the Group 
Company Secretary, and consisted of a 
questionnaire that covered areas including 
strategy, Board and management succession, 
Board culture, balance and diversity, 
meetings and processes, investor relations, 
decision-making, risk management and 
Board committees. The review of my own 
performance was separately led by the 
Senior Independent Director in conjunction 
with the other Non-Executive Directors.
The principal conclusions were presented 
and discussed at our meeting in November.  
It was determined that the Company’s Board 
was operating effectively in an open and 
transparent manner, providing support and 
challenge to senior management. The 
evaluation process did identify a small 
number of areas for further review as follows:
• to ensure appropriate resourcing, 
development and reporting of all risk 
management activities;
• the continued development of our 
Non-Executive Directors to cover both 
their knowledge of the business and 
exposure to senior management; and
• the continued development of our 
succession planning to include a review  
of the future skill sets and diversity needs 
of the Board.
Progress against these areas will be reported 
in our Annual Report 2016. The Board will 
again undertake an evaluation of its 
performance, and that of its committees, 
during 2016.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
In the last week, we have announced that 
Rob Roger will step down as Chief Executive 
Officer and leave the Company on 30 June 
2016, and that I will resume my previous role 
as Executive Chairman. I anticipate that my 
executive role will last for a period of up  
to 12 months from Rob leaving and 
succession planning to appoint a new Chief 
Executive Officer is well underway.
Finally, my Board colleagues and I look 
forward to meeting as many shareholders  
as possible at our annual general meeting 
which will be held at 11.00am on Thursday, 
19 May 2016 at the offices of J.P . Morgan,  
60 Victoria Embankment, London EC4Y OJP .

62 Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2015 Corporate governance
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Group complies with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code issued in September 2014 
(the ‘UK Code’), except as noted.
COMPLIANCE WITH THE UK CODE IN 2015
The Group has complied with the  
principles (and code provisions) of the  
UK Code, throughout the year except  
as described below.
Independence is determined by ensuring 
that, apart from receiving their fees for 
acting as Directors or owning shares, 
Non-Executive Directors do not have any 
other material relationship or additional 
remuneration from, or transactions with, the 
Group, its promoters, its management or its 
subsidiaries, which in the judgement of the 
Board may affect, or could appear to affect, 
their independence of judgement.
The UK Code recommends that at least  
half the board of directors of a UK-listed 
company, excluding the chairman,  
should comprise non-executive directors 
determined by the board to be independent 
in character and judgement and free from 
relationships or circumstances that may 
affect, or could appear to affect, the 
directors’ judgement.
The Group complies with this 
recommendation of the UK Code, 
notwithstanding that the following 
Non-Executive Directors are not 
independent in the Company’s opinion:
• Simon Rowlands continues to hold a  
senior position with the Company’s  
former principal shareholder, Cinven; and
• Danie Meintjes has been nominated  
to act as a Non-Executive Director by 
Mediclinic International, the principal 
shareholder, whose subsidiary, Remgro 
Jersey Limited, entered into a relationship 
agreement with the Company in June 2015 
(the ‘Relationship Agreement’). Under the 
terms of the Relationship Agreement, 
when Mediclinic International controls  
15% or more of the votes, it will be entitled 
to appoint one Non-Executive Director  
to the Board. It controls 29.9% of votes as 
at 16 March 2016. The Directors believe 
that the terms of the Relationship 
Agreement will enable the Group to  
carry on its business independently of 
Mediclinic International.
The UK Code also recommends that the 
Chairman of the Board of Directors should 
meet the independence criteria set out  
in the UK Code on appointment.
Garry Watts was not independent on 
appointment, having served as Executive 
Chairman of Spire Healthcare prior  
to Admission. 
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
Save as set out in the table below, there  
are no actual or potential conflicts of interest 
between any duties owed by the Directors  
or senior management to the Company  
and their private interests or other duties.  
The Board will continue to monitor and 
review potential conflicts of interest on  
a regular basis.

BOARD AND COMMITTEE STRUCTURE
Ultimate responsibility for the management 
of the Group rests with the Board of 
Directors.
The Board focuses primarily upon strategic 
and policy issues and is responsible for:
• leadership of the Group; 
• implementing and monitoring effective 
controls to assess and manage risk;
• supporting the senior leadership team to 
formulate and execute the Group’s 
strategy;
• monitoring the performance of the Group; 
and
• setting the Group’s values and standards.
There is a specific schedule of matters 
reserved for the Board.
THE NON-EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN AND 
THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
The division of responsibilities between  
the Non-Executive Chairman and the  
Chief Executive Officer is set out in writing 
and was reviewed and approved by the 
Board during the Admission process. This 
was in effect throughout all of 2015.
THE NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Non-Executive Directors bring a  
wide range of skills and experience to the 
Board. The independent Non-Executive 
Directors represent a strong, independent 
element on the Board and are well placed  
to constructively challenge and support 
management. They help to shape the  
Group’s strategy, scrutinise the performance 
of management in meeting the Group’s 
objectives and monitor the reporting  
of performance. 
Their role is also to satisfy themselves  
with regard to the integrity of the Group’s 
financial information and to ensure  
that the Group’s internal controls and  
risk management systems are robust  
and defensible. 
The independent Non-Executive  
Directors oversee the adequacy of the risk 
management and internal control systems 
(from their membership of the Audit and Risk 
Committee and Clinical Governance and 
Safety Committee (‘CGSC’)), as well as the 
remuneration for the Executive Directors 
(from their membership of the 
Remuneration Committee). 
As members of the Nomination Committee, 
the Non-Executive Directors also play a 
pivotal role in Board succession planning and 
the appointment of new Executive Directors.
YOUR BOARD IN 2015
During the year, the Board met on nine 
scheduled occasions.
The agenda at scheduled meetings in 2015 
covered standing agenda items, including:  
a review of the Group’s performance by the 
Chief Executive Officer, the current month’s 
and year to date financial statistics by the 
Chief Financial Officer and a review of clinical 
performance. In addition, the Board received 
a verbal report from committee chairs, 
where their committee met immediately in 
advance of the scheduled Board meeting, 
and the Board regularly received reports on 
legal and statutory matters.
Also in 2015, the Board focused on major 
elements of the Group’s operations by:
• reviewing, and approving, the Group’s 
three-year Strategic Plan;
• considering a preliminary draft 2016 
Annual Operating Plan; and
• receiving, reviewing and approving major 
capital expenditure proposals.
The Board has a formal schedule of matters 
reserved to it and delegates certain matters 
to committees, as outlined elsewhere. 
Specific matters reserved for the Board 
considered during the year to 31 December 
2015 included reviewing the Group’s 
performance (monthly and year to date), 
approving capital expenditure, setting  
and approving the Group’s strategy and 
annual budget, and a review of the draft 
dividend policy. 
THE BOARD’S PLAN FOR 2016
It is planned that the Board will convene on 
eight formal scheduled occasions during 
2016, as well as holding any necessary ad hoc 
Board and committee meetings to consider 
non-routine business. 
The Deputy Chairman and the other 
Non-Executive Directors are scheduled to 
meet on their own without the Executive 
Directors present. In addition, the Non-
Executive Directors will also meet without 
the Chairman present to discuss matters  
such as the Chairman’s performance.
The Board will maintain its focus on the 
Group’s pursuit of its 2016 targets and also 
review succession planning during the year. 
Its activities will include:
• appointment of a new Chief Executive 
Officer;
• review and approve the 2015 Annual 
Report;
• review the proposed final dividend for 
2015;
• approve the 2016 Annual Operating Plan; 
• consider specific major themes;
• review the risk management framework; 
and
• follow a rolling agenda, ensuring proper 
time for strategic debate.
Furthermore, the Board will continue to 
consider clinical safety matters and maintain 
overall responsibility for the Group’s system 
of internal control and risk management 
processes via the relevant Board committees.
SHARE SCHEMES COMMITTEE
In addition, the Board delegates  
certain responsibilities in relation to the 
administration of the Company’s share 
schemes on an ad hoc basis to the Share 
Schemes Committee. This committee 
operates in accordance with the delegation 
of authority agreed by the Board.
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
During the year, the Chief Executive  
Officer reviewed the structure of the senior 
leadership governance structure. The 
previous Executive Management Team  
was replaced with an Executive Committee 
which is supported by two newly formed 
bodies: an Operating Board; and a Safety, 
Quality and Risk Committee.

To the extent that Directors are unable to 
attend scheduled meetings, or additional 
meetings called on short notice, they will 
receive the papers in advance and relay  
their comments to the Chairman for 
communication at the meeting. The 
Chairman will follow up after the meeting  
in relation to both the discussions held and 
decisions taken.
EFFECTIVENESS
Board composition
The Board seeks to ensure that both it and  
its committees have the appropriate range  
of skills, experience, independence and 
knowledge of the Group to enable them  
to discharge their respective duties and 
responsibilities effectively; for example, the 
2016 Board calendar includes both Board 
development training sessions on statutory 
duties and hospital visits.
The number of Non-Executive Directors  
and their range of skills and experience were 
carefully reviewed and agreed as part of  
the Admission process. The continuing 
requirements and the number of Directors, 
together with the Group’s succession plans, 
will form part of the Nomination Committee 
activities and the Board’s evaluation process 
in 2016. The Board considers its size and 
composition to be appropriate for the 
current requirements of the business. 
Committee composition is set out in the 
relevant committee reports. No one other 
than committee chairs and members of  
the committees is entitled to participate  
in meetings of the Audit and Risk, 
Nomination, Remuneration, and Clinical 
Governance and Safety Committees, unless 
by invitation of the committee chair. John 
Gildersleeve is the Deputy Chairman and 
Senior Independent Director.
Biographical details of the Directors are set 
out on pages 58 to 59.
Independence
The Board considers that half of the Board  
is independent of management and free 
from any business or other relationship  
that could affect the exercise of their 
independent judgement.
As the Chairman acts in an executive 
capacity he is not considered to be 
independent. He also did not satisfy the 
independence criteria on his appointment  
to the Board. Both Simon Rowlands and 
Danie Meintjes are also not considered  
to be independent.
Appointments to the Board
Recommendations for appointments  
to the Board are made by the Nomination 
Committee. The Nomination Committee 
follows a formal, rigorous and transparent 
procedure for the appointment of new 
Directors to the Board. Further information  
is set out in the Nomination Committee 
Report on pages 74 to 75.
Time commitment of the Non-Executive 
Directors
The Non-Executive Directors each have a 
letter of appointment, which sets out the 
terms and conditions of their directorship.  
An indication of the anticipated time 
commitment is provided in any recruitment 
role specification, and each Director’s letter 
of appointment provides details of the 
meetings that they are expected to attend.
Non-Executive Directors are required to set 
aside sufficient time to prepare for meetings, 
and to regularly refresh and update their 
skills and knowledge. In signing their  
letters of appointment, all Directors have 
consequently agreed to commit sufficient 
time for the proper performance of their 
responsibilities, acknowledging that this will 
vary from year to year, depending on the 
Group’s activities. 
Directors are expected to attend all Board 
and committee meetings, and any additional 
meetings, as required. Each Director’s other 
significant commitments were disclosed to 
the Board at the time of their appointment 
and they are required to notify the Board  
of any subsequent changes. The Group  
has reviewed the availability of the Non-
Executive Directors and considers that each 
of them is able to, and in practice does, 
devote the necessary amount of time to  
the Group’s business. 
Induction and training
Generally, reference materials are provided, 
including information about the Board,  
its committees, directors’ duties, procedures 
for dealing in the Group’s shares and other 
regulatory and governance matters, and 
Directors are advised of their legal and  
other duties, and obligations as directors  
of a listed company. 
On appointment, Danie Meintjes completed 
a detailed induction programme that 
included meeting with other Board members 
and senior executives, a familarisation of the 
business and a hospital visit.
The Group Company Secretary ensures that 
any additional request for information is 
promptly supplied. The Chairman, through 
the Group Company Secretary, ensures that 
there is an ongoing process to review any 
internal or external training and 
development needs.
In November, all Directors received a 
refresher training session, delivered by  
the Company’s legal advisers on their 
statutory duties.
As already noted, in the event of a general 
training need, in-house training will be 
provided to the entire Board. Necessary and 
relevant regulatory updates are provided  
as a standing item at each Board meeting  
in the Group Company Secretary’s report  
and Board briefing by external advisers, 
where appropriate.
Information and support
The Board ensures that it receives, in a timely 
manner, information of an appropriate 
quality to enable it to adequately discharge 
its responsibilities. This is aided by the use of 
an online portal. Papers are provided to the 
Directors in advance of the relevant Board or 
committee meeting to enable them to make 
further enquiries about any matters prior to 
the meeting, should they so wish. This also 
allows Directors who are unable to attend to 
submit views in advance of the meeting.
Outside the Board papers process, the  
Chief Executive Officer provides written 
updates to Non-Executive Directors on 
important business issues, including financial 
GOVERNANCE
66 Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2015 and commercial information. In addition, 
relevant updates on shareholder matters 
(including analysts’ reports) are also provided 
to the Board.
All Directors have access to the advice and 
services of the Group Company Secretary. 
There is also an agreed procedure in place  
for Directors, in the furtherance of their 
duties, to take independent legal advice,  
if necessary, at the Group’s expense.
Election of Directors
All the Directors offered themselves for 
election at the first annual general meeting 
in May 2015 and, in future, will be re-elected 
in accordance with the requirements of the 
UK Code. The biographical details of each  
of the Directors are set out on pages 58 to  
59 and in the 2016 Notice of Meeting. The 
Board believes that each of the Directors 
standing for election is effective and 
demonstrates commitment to their 
respective roles. Accordingly, the Board 
recommends that shareholders approve  
the resolutions to be proposed at the 2016 
annual general meeting relating to the 
election of the Directors.
Directors’ indemnities
The Directors of the Company have  
the benefit of a third-party indemnity 
provision, as defined by section 236 of the 
Companies Act 2006, in the Group’s Articles 
of Association. In addition, Directors and 
officers of the Group are covered by 
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance. 
Directors’ conflicts of interest
The Companies Act 2006 provides that 
directors must avoid a situation where they 
have, or can have, a direct or indirect interest 
that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with 
the Company’s interests. Directors of public 
companies may authorise conflicts and 
potential conflicts, where appropriate, if  
a company’s articles of association permit.
The Board has established formal procedures 
to authorise situations where a Director has 
an interest that conflicts, or may possibly 
conflict, with the interests of the Company 
(Situational Conflicts). Directors declare 
Situational Conflicts, so that they can  
be considered for authorisation by the 
non-conflicted directors. 
In considering a Situational Conflict, these 
Directors act in the way they consider would 
be most likely to promote the success of the 
Group, and may impose limits, or conditions, 
when giving authorisation or, subsequently, 
if they think this is appropriate. 
The Group Company Secretary records  
the consideration of any conflict and any 
authorisations granted. The Board believes 
that the system it has in place for reporting 
Situational Conflicts continues to operate 
effectively.
ACCOUNTABILITY
The Audit and Risk Committee 
The Audit and Risk Committee’s report is  
set out on pages 68 to 71 and identifies its 
members, whose details are set out on  
pages 58 and 59.
The report describes the Audit and Risk 
Committee’s work in discharging its 
responsibilities during the year ended  
31 December 2015, and its terms of 
reference can be found on the Group’s 
website at www.spirehealthcare.com.
Risk management and internal control 
The Board has overall responsibility for 
establishing and maintaining a sound system 
of risk management and internal control, and 
for reviewing its effectiveness. This system is 
designed to manage, rather than eliminate, 
the risks facing the Group and safeguard its 
assets. No system of internal control can 
provide absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. The Group’s system is 
designed to provide the directors with 
reasonable assurance that issues are 
identified on a timely basis and are dealt 
with appropriately. 
The Audit and Risk Committee and the 
Clinical Governance and Safety Committee, 
whose reports are set out on pages 68 to 71 
and pages 72 to 73, respectively, assist the 
Board in reviewing the effectiveness of the 
Group’s risk management system and 
internal controls, including financial, clinical, 
operational and compliance controls.
Executive compensation and risk
Only independent Non-Executive Directors 
are allowed to serve on both the Audit and 
Risk, and Remuneration Committees. The 
Non-Executive Directors are therefore able  
to bring their experience and knowledge of 
the activities of each committee to bear 
when considering the critical judgements  
of the other.
This means that the Directors are in a 
position to consider carefully the impact  
of incentive arrangements on the Group’s 
risk profile and to ensure the Group’s 
remuneration policy and programme  
are structured, so as to accord with the 
long-term objectives and risk appetite  
of the Group.
Financial and non-financial risk
The Clinical Governance and Safety 
Committee, in conjunction with the Audit 
and Risk Committee, between them aim  
to ensure that the control and monitoring  
of both financial and non-financial risks  
is satisfactory.
In addition, the committees, jointly, seek  
to ensure, as far as practicable, there are  
no elements omitted or unnecessarily 
duplicated and that all critical judgements 
receive the correct level of challenge.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Board is committed to communicating 
with shareholders and stakeholders in  
a clear and open manner, and seeks to  
ensure effective engagement through  
the Group’s regular communications,  
the annual general meeting and other 
investor relations activities. 
The Group undertakes an ongoing 
programme of meetings with investors, 
which is managed by the Chief Executive 
Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The 
majority of meetings with investors are  
led by them. 
During the year, there were in excess  
of 250 individual meetings, conference 
presentations, group lunches and telephone 
briefings with investors, attended in  
all cases by the Investor Relations Director 
accompanied in the majority of cases by  
one or both of the Executive Directors.
The Executive Chairman, Senior Independent 
Director and committee chairs remain 
available for discussion with shareholders  
on matters under their areas of responsibility, 
either through contacting the Group 
Company Secretary or directly at the annual  
general meeting.
The Company reports its financial results  
to shareholders twice a year, with the 
publication of its annual and half yearly 
financial reports. 
It also currently issues further trading 
updates each year with the publication  
of an Interim Management Statement. In 
conjunction with these announcements, 
presentations or teleconference calls are held 
with institutional investors and analysts, and 
copies of any presentation materials issued 
are made available through the Company’s 
website at www.spirehealthcare.com. 
All Directors are expected to attend the 
Company’s annual general meeting, 
providing shareholders with the opportunity 
to question them about issues relating to  
the Group, either during the meeting, or 
informally afterwards.

Audit and Risk
Committee Report
Dear Shareholder,
On behalf of the Audit and Risk Committee 
(the ‘Committee’), I am pleased to present its 
report for the year ended 31 December 2015.
The Committee normally meets at least 
three times a year. It met four times in 2015, 
with attendance disclosed on page 71. 
The Committee normally invites the external 
auditor and the Chief Financial Officer to 
attend each meeting and other members 
of the management team attend as and 
when invited. Representatives of the Group’s 
external auditor have a private session with 
the Committee or Chair of the Committee 
when required.
EXTERNAL FINANCIAL REPORTING
The Committee is responsible for 
monitoring, reviewing and challenging the 
integrity of the financial statements, and 
ensuring compliance with legal, regulatory 
and statutory requirements, giving due 
consideration to the provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. 
The external auditor provided reports for the 
half year and year end reporting, including  
all significant issues, with an assessment  
of the appropriateness of management’s 
judgements. The Committee considered that 
management’s judgements were cautious, 
but not overly prudent.
At the request of the Board, the Committee 
considered whether the Annual Report  
and Accounts for the year ended 2015 was 
fair, balanced and understandable, and 
whether it provided the necessary 
information for the shareholders to assess 
the Group’s performance, business model 
and strategy. The Committee took into 
account its own knowledge of the Group,  
its strategy and performance in the year, 
internal verification of the factual content, 
comprehensive review undertaken at 
different levels in the Group to ensure 
consistency and overall balance, and detailed 
review by senior management and the 
external auditor. The Committee was 
satisfied that, taken as a whole, the Annual 
Report and Accounts for the year ended 2015 
is fair, balanced and understandable, and has 
affirmed that view to the Board.
ACTIVITIES 
The main activities relating to the financial year were as follows:
• agreeing the Committee’s rolling agenda for 2015;
• approving the terms of engagement of the external auditor, including its remuneration 
and reviewing its independence;
• approving the plan for the external audit for 2015;
• discussing and reviewing the Group’s accounting policies and critical estimates and 
judgements;
• assessing going concern and the viability of the Group;
• receiving and approving the half year results and the Annual Report and Accounts for the 
year ended 2015;
• reviewing the risk management framework for the Group, including risk appetite and risk 
evaluation methodology and reviewing the Group risk register; and
• reviewing the systems of internal control, including assessing the requirement for an 
internal audit function.
Our priority is in laying  
the foundations for 
maintaining the highest 
standards of governance  
and risk management  
across the business.

SIGNIFICANT ISSUES AND MATERIAL JUDGEMENTS
The Committee assesses whether suitable accounting policies have been adopted and whether management has made appropriate estimates 
and judgements. The table below summarises the matters where the most material judgements have been made in relation to reporting in 
2015. Ernst & Young LLP (‘EY’) also identified these matters in its audit report, commenting that they had the greatest effect on the overall 
audit strategy, the allocation of resources and in directing the efforts of the engagement team: 
Matters Judgement and estimation required How the Committee gained comfort on the matter
Improper 
revenue 
recognition – 
management 
manipulation
Pressure to achieve results and secure bonus payments 
could lead management to manipulate the financial 
reporting of revenue. This could include the:
• manipulation of prices charged, in particular in relation 
to NHS and PMI revenue;
• intentional mis-coding of procedures by hospitals 
impacting revenue recorded;
• misreporting of other income in the year; and
• overstatement of deferred revenue at the year end.
Management carry out a detailed review of monthly 
hospital performance compared to forecast, in particular 
focusing on the cut-off of revenue reported at the 
balance sheet date.
An external audit was carried out to test the adequacy of 
clinical coders, which did not raise any issues of concern.
The Committee noted that substantive testing had been 
carried out by EY, for example, to test the completeness 
of cash received after the year end in respect of invoices 
raised for the various customer revenue streams. EY’s 
testing did not reveal any areas of concern.
Improper 
revenue 
recognition – 
complexity of 
PMI and NHS 
contracts
The complexity of the pricing structures and the high 
volume of procedures undertaken present a risk in 
relation to the accuracy and completeness of revenue 
recognition, in particular the use of incorrect codes  
or prices. 
An external audit was carried out to test the adequacy of 
clinical coders, which did not raise any issues of concern.
The Committee noted the testing of key manual controls 
carried out by EY, which included substantive testing of  
a sample of transactions back to proof of procedure and 
price lists. No significant issues were noted by them 
during the course of their audit. 
Inappropriate 
capitalisation  
of development 
costs 
Expenditure on internal capital projects is high. 
Construction is under way on two new hospitals. 
Additionally, the Group is developing Spire St Anthony’s 
Hospital at an expected total cost of £27.0 million, and 
undertaking other major projects at existing hospitals.  
A £14.0 million Specialist Cancer Care Centre was 
completed at Baddow in the year.
There is a risk of inappropriate capitalisation to these 
projects to enhance reported earnings.
The Committee considered the controls over capital 
expenditure incorporated within the Group’s project 
management procedures, as implemented by the 
business development team.
The Committee noted the work carried out by EY in 
verifying the amounts being capitalised as part of EY’s 
audit programme. No issues of concern were noted.
Spire Manchester 
Hospital asset 
impairment
Spire Healthcare’s new hospital in West Didsbury, 
Manchester, will be opening in early 2017. 
An impairment charge of £5.7 millon is made to fully 
write down the carrying value of leasehold improvements 
and medical equipment by 31 December 2016. This 
charge reflects the diminished earning potential of the 
existing Spire Manchester Hospital. 
The existing facility is held under a long lease. Following  
the assessment of the operational options available, the 
Directors concluded that no further provision is required 
under this commitment.
The Committee reviewed management’s analysis of 
economic forecasts of the existing hospital and tested 
the key assumptions and risks inherent therein. It paid 
particular attention to the scenario analyses and the 
impact of key variables on the revenues, direct costs and 
expenditure relating to running the facility.
Provisions for 
patient claims
Such claims are typically complex. Judgement is required 
in the estimation of the size and incidence of claims, 
which is usually based on professional advice and 
historical information on similar claims.
The Group recognised total net provisions of £8.2 million  
at 31 December 2015. 
The Committee reviewed management’s detailed report 
on the status of live claims and information concerning 
the settlement of related claims. It also considered the 
advice provided by the Group’s external legal and 
insurance advisers. GOVERNANCE
70 Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2015
The Committee ensures that the external 
auditor adheres to The Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standard 3, which requires 
the rotation of the audit partner for listed 
companies every five years. EY has audited 
the financial statements of Spire Healthcare 
since 2008. A new audit engagement 
partner, Debbie O’Hanlon, was appointed 
during the year. As a FTSE 250 company,  
we will comply with the new provisions 
requiring an audit tender at least every  
10 years and our approach to this will be 
considered further in 2016.
As noted, we reviewed the independence 
and effectiveness of the external auditor.  
We did this by:
• reviewing its proposed plan for the  
2015 audit;
• discussing the results of its audit, including 
its views about material accounting issues 
and key judgements and estimates, and its 
audit report;
• reviewing the quality of the people and 
service provided by EY; and
• evaluating all of the relationships between 
the external auditor and the Group, to 
determine whether these impair, or appear 
to impair, the auditor’s independence.
NON-AUDIT SERVICES AND 
INDEPENDENCE
There are certain services termed ‘excluded 
services’ that are not permitted to be 
provided by the external auditor, including 
where the auditor may be required to audit 
its own work, would participate in activities 
that would normally be undertaken by 
management or is remunerated through  
a ‘success fee’ structure.
Total non-audit services provided by EY to 
the Group for the year ended 31 December 
2015 totalled £71,000, the majority of which 
related to IT services (2014: £0.5 million for 
services on Admission).
The Committee considers the requirements 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code and 
the appropriateness of tendering the 
external audit contract as part of normal 
business practice. Based on an ongoing 
assessment, for example, of the quality  
of the external auditor’s report to the 
Committee and the audit partner’s 
interaction with the Committee, the 
Committee remains satisfied with the 
efficiency and effectiveness of the audit.  
The Committee, therefore, has not 
considered it necessary to require the audit 
to be put to tender.
The Committee has recommended, and  
the Board has agreed, that, subject to 
shareholder approval, EY will be reappointed 
as the Company’s auditor at the annual 
general meeting in May 2016.
RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL 
CONTROLS 
An overview of the risk management and 
internal controls processes are contained on 
pages 48 to 49. The Committee, with the 
assistance of the Clinical Governance and 
Safety Committee (‘CGSC’) (which focuses on 
key non-financial risks, including patient and 
clinical risks), carried out the following:
• reviewed the work carried out by the CGSC 
in relation to the risks within its remit;
• reviewed the Group’s system of  
internal control;
• undertook a review of cybersecurity;
• monitored the risks and associated 
controls over the financial reporting 
processes, including the process by which 
the Group’s financial statements are 
prepared for publication; and
• reviewed reports from the external auditor 
on any issues identified during the course 
of its work, including a report on control 
weaknesses.
The overall risk management framework, 
including the Board’s appetite for risk  
and the underlying process for capturing  
and reporting risk and control data,  
will continue to be reviewed by the  
Board and its committees during 2016  
to ensure that changes to reflect the new 
regulatory environment and best practice  
are incorporated.
VIABILITY
The Committee spent time, at two meetings, 
reviewing the process undertaken by 
management to support and allow the 
Directors to make the Group’s viability 
statement. The Committee considered and 
provided input into the determination of 
which of the Group’s principal risks and 
combinations thereof might have an impact 
on the Group’s liquidity and solvency.  
The Committee reviewed the results of 
management’s scenario modelling and the 
stress testing of these models. The viability 
statement can be found on page 49.
OUR PRIORITIES FOR 2016
These include the following:
• roll-out of the updated risk 
management procedures;
• review of the consolidated risk register;
• review findings of the internal audit 
work commissioned;
• confirm our internal audit priorities for 
2017; and
• agree the 2016 external audit plan.
INTERNAL AUDIT
During the year, the Committee agreed 
the scope of internal audit’s activities and 
level of resourcing required. A high-level 
Internal Audit Plan is to be approved by 
the Committee on an annual basis. 
Audit activity will be focused on areas 
identified as high risk, in particular where 
existing regulatory controls and 
inspections are not considered to be 
sufficiently comprehensive in terms of 
providing independent assurance on the 
effectiveness of internal controls. The 
specific areas of focus for 2016 include:
•  cybersecurity and IT risk management;
• revenue recognition and fraud risk; and
• clinical performance data integrity.
EXTERNAL AUDITOR
The Committee oversees the Group’s 
relationship with the external auditor and 
formally reviews the relationship, policies 
and procedures to ensure independence.

WHISTLEBLOWING
The Committee also continued its 
monitoring and oversight of the procedures 
for the receipt, retention and treatment  
of qualifying disclosures by staff.
The Group offers its staff an independent 
and confidential service, where staff may 
register any concerns about any wrongdoing 
or safety at work. The General Counsel  
and Group Company Secretary is, as 
Whistleblowing Officer, responsible for the 
investigation of any concerns arising and 
reporting directly to the Committee.
ACCOUNTABILITY
Following a detailed review by the 
Committee of the Corporate Risk Register 
and the principal risks drawn from it, 
consideration of reports on the operation  
of the risk management and internal  
control systems from senior management, 
the results of all external audit, review  
and inspection activity and all reported  
risk events, the Directors confirmed that  
no material failings or weaknesses  
were identified.
ANNUAL EVALUATION OF THE 
COMMITTEE’S PERFORMANCE
The first evaluation of the Committee’s 
performance was carried out in 2015 which 
confirmed that it had fulfilled its obligations 
as set out within its terms of reference.

Audit and Risk Committee at a glance Dear Shareholder,
On behalf of the Clinical Governance and 
Safety Committee (the ‘Committee’ or 
‘CGSC’), I am pleased to present our report 
for the year ended 31 December 2015  
and to look ahead to the coming year. The 
Committee has covered much ground this 
year overseeing the delivery of clinical 
services through promoting best practice 
and clinical governance and I am proud  
to report that excellent progress has been 
made in developing the Quality Governance 
Framework which, from 2016, will provide 
assurance to the Board on the quality of 
services provided across all our hospitals 
on a single dashboard and will also permit 
benchmarking of clinical services between 
individual hospitals.
I would also like to take this opportunity  
to acknowledge the support and openness 
we have received from all staff across the 
business to our enquiries and recognise  
the commitment of my fellow Committee 
members to fully understand and embrace 
these extremely important matters.
2015 ACTIVITIES
During 2015, the CGSC met on eight 
occasions, three of which were at one of the 
Company’s hospitals with the remainder 
being held at the Company’s London head 
office. Our off-site meetings were deemed  
to be highly successful, both from the 
Committee’s and the hospital staff’s 
perspective. Meetings were held at Spire 
Hospital and Perform Centre, Southampton 
in March, Spire Hartswood Hospital, 
Brentwood in May and Spire Murrayfield 
Hospital, Edinburgh in December. Each 
hospital visit began with a tour of the 
hospital’s facilities by the hospital director 
and matron, and allowed an opportunity to 
meet both clinical and administrative staff. 
This would be followed by presentations to 
the Committee describing the current local

healthcare environment, and the current 
position of the hospital highlighting 
particular successes and areas for further 
improvement. The hospital director would 
also highlight their future aspirations for the 
development of clinical services and spend 
time discussing these issues with members 
of the Committee. Consultants in different 
specialties and senior members of  
staff would also be invited to meet the 
Committee for informal discussions which 
provided an opportunity for members to 
engage on an individual basis.
The Committee continued to receive 
quarterly clinical governance reports and the 
clinical governance and safety reports. These 
reports are presented by the Group’s Medical 
Director and include data on clinical key 
performance indicators, and compliance 
with the balanced scorecard. The Committee 
also scrutinised trends in performance over 
time and reviewed both staff and patient 
satisfaction surveys. 
In addition, the Committee received reports 
on Health and Safety and Information 
Governance. It also regularly reviewed the 
Company’s Whistleblowing Register.
The Committee continued its programme of 
themed reviews which last year focused on:
• Quality Governance Framework;
• Spire Healthcare’s complaints policy and 
process;
• Clinical Reviews; and
• Resident Medical Officer Services.
These reviews consisted of an appraisal of 
Spire Healthcare’s approach to each area 
under review and the Committee also made 
recommendations for future development 
and scrutiny of the various activities.
In addition, the Committee reviews CQC (and 
other regulators) inspection reports on Spire 
Healthcare hospitals.

72 Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2015 THE IMPORTANCE OF GOOD CLINICAL 
GOVERNANCE TO SPIRE HEALTHCARE
Clinical governance, and the importance of 
embedding sound and robust practices that 
deliver patient safety, are of paramount 
importance to our business.
HOSPITAL VISITS
In last year’s report I indicated that I had 
begun a programme of informal visits to all 
of our hospitals in order to better understand 
the business, culture and ethos within Spire 
Healthcare’s diverse portfolio. During the 
year, I visited a further 15 different sites so 
that I have now visited 29 hospitals within 
the Company’s portfolio in total over the 
past 18 months. This has allowed me to be 
an independent observer of a hospital’s 
operations. I am therefore in a position to 
give the best possible personal appraisal  
of the standards of care being given to  
our patients. These hospital visits have 
continued to allow me to question the 
hospital management teams on various 
issues and to gather ideas and suggestions 
that may have an impact on the future 
strategy of both the Committee and the 
Group. I have learnt about the aspirations  
for future development within each hospital 
as well as an enormous amount about  
the complexity and variety of Spire’s 
healthcare business and of the influences 
that drive change and development in the 
local environment.
Through my visits I have also been able to 
facilitate the greater sharing of knowledge 
and best practice across the Group including 
a review of specialist internet forum pages. 
Importantly, I have made a particular request 
to talk to individual patients on a one-to-one 
basis at each of my hospital visits and have 
learnt about their experience of being a 
patient at a Spire Healthcare hospital and 
how they viewed the quality of care they 
have received. I am pleased to report that  
the feedback from the patients I have met 
has been overwhelmingly positive.
COMMITTEE MEETINGS IN 2016
Towards the end of the year, the Committee 
took the opportunity to review the format 
and frequency of its meetings. In view of  
the success of our formal hospital visits for 
our Committee meetings in 2015, it was 
unanimously agreed that more time should 
be spent further developing the relationship 
with hospitals and clinical staff. To this end, 
it has been agreed that we will hold six 
meetings in 2016, with five being held in 
hospitals, and each visit will be extended 
over two days instead of one. This will allow 
the Committee members more opportunity 
to engage with consultants, management 
and more junior clinical staff. It will also serve 
to increase the Committee’s understanding 
of the numerous pressures and challenges 
that junior colleagues face on a day-to-day 
basis and to understand their career 
development needs and opportunities. 
These longer visits will also allow me to hold 
personal meetings with groups of staff (up 
to 10 members) from different disciplines 
and of varying seniority to find out from 
them about their roles, their understanding 
of clinical governance and their aspirations 
and challenges of working within the Group. 
As occurred last year, CGSC meetings will be 
scheduled to take place ahead of each Board 
meeting, so that there is a timely flow of 
information on clinical governance matters 
to the other Directors. This will aid a ‘Board 
to Ward’ approach to clinical governance and 
also permits the hospital management team 
to present its own strategic developments 
and challenges and to focus on specific 
aspects of clinical governance relevant to  
its own experience. 
We will continue our planned themed review 
programme in 2016 and the areas of focus 
will include patient involvement and clinical 
training and recruitment.
COMMITTEE EVALUATION PROCESS
In November, the Committee undertook  
its first formal review as part of the wider 
Board evaluation process. The results, which 
were discussed in November, showed that 
they believed the CGSC was working very 
well and that it was important to build on 
the existing programme of hospital visits. 
This was subsequently addressed as already 
described. Committee members also 
identified the development of appropriate 
risk management structures as being of 
particular importance for the Company 
going forward.
The Committee believes that it has  
received sufficient, relevant and reliable 
information from management and the 
clinical executive team to enable us to 
discharge our responsibilities.

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2015 73 Dear Shareholder,
During the year, the Nomination Committee 
(the ‘Committee’) met for the first time since 
the Company’s Admission in July 2014 and  
I was extremely pleased with the level of 
debate and the collective decisions that  
we reached as a group.
DIRECTOR CHANGES
You will have already read in the Annual 
Report 2015 about the changes to the 
Company’s Board of Directors that were 
made during both 2015 and since the year 
end. I cannot emphasise enough the 
importance of the role that the Committee 
has played in all of these decisions.
Following the decision by Cinven to sell  
its shareholding to Mediclinic International 
in June 2015, the Committee agreed that 
Simon Rowlands should remain as a 
Non-Executive Director. We concluded  
that Simon’s deep experience both of Spire 
Healthcare itself, and of the private hospital 
industry in the UK and overseas, would 
continue to be a valuable asset to the Board 
as the Company continues to develop. In 
August 2015, the Committee reviewed the 
decision by Mediclinic International to 
propose Danie Meintjes as a Non-Executive 
Director under the terms of the relationship 
agreement with them, and subsequently 
recommended to the Board that he be 
appointed a Non-Executive Director.
More recently, the Committee has endorsed 
the Board’s decision to: 
•  appoint Garry Watts as Executive 
Chairman from 13 March 2016. This is to 
coincide with the decision by Rob Roger to 
step down as Chief Executive Officer; and
•  appoint Andrew White, our Chief 
Operating Officer, as an Executive Director 
on 1 July 2016.
Nomination Committee Report
As a Committee, we 
acknowledge the importance 
of diversity, including gender, 
both on the Board and 
throughout the organisation. 
A key focus for the Committee this year  
will be the recruitment of a new Chief 
Executive Officer and I hope to be in a 
position to update you on this matter in  
next year’s report. 
2015 ACTIVITIES
As a Committee our priorities during the year 
have been to:
• review and recommend the Director 
changes to the Board;
• evaluate the balance of skills, knowledge 
and experience on the Board and its 
diversity, including gender;
• undertake our first performance review;
• review the independence of each 
Non-Executive Director, and the balance of 
skills, knowledge, experience and diversity 
on the Board prior to recommending 
Directors’ re-election at the annual general 
meeting; and
• review and update the Committee’s terms 
of reference.
COMMITTEE EVALUATION
The Committee completed its first annual 
performance evaluation as part of the overall 
Board evaluation process and the findings 
relating to the Nomination Committee were 
discussed and reviewed by the Committee. 
The Committee was considered to be 
operating effectively in fulfilling its duties 
throughout 2015.
DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION

towards this as and when positions arise. 
However, our overriding intent in any new 
appointment must always be to select on 
merit, in fulfilment of our role of ensuring 
the continued success of the Company.
RE-ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
The Committee met in March 2016 and 
reviewed the continuation in office, and 
potential reappointment, of all members  
of the Board. Following this review, the 
Committee recommended to the Board  
that all Directors should be reappointed,  
and hence all Directors will seek re-election 
at the annual general meeting.
TERMS OF REFERENCE
Under its terms of reference, the Committee 
and its members are empowered to  
obtain outside legal or other independent 
professional advice (at the cost of the Group) 
in relation to its deliberations (which were 
not exercised during the year) and to secure 
the attendance at its meetings of any 
employee or other parties, should it be 
considered necessary.

The maximum number of meetings that the member could have attended during 2015  
is shown in brackets. Members’ biographies are shown on pages 58 and 59. 
The Group Company Secretary, or their appointed nominee, is secretary to the Committee.
ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES
The Committee’s foremost priorities are to ensure that the Group has the best  
possible leadership and a clear plan for both Executive and Non-Executive Director 
succession. Its prime focus is, therefore, to concentrate upon the strength of the Board,  
for which appointments will be made on merit against objective criteria, selecting  
the best candidate for the post. The Nomination Committee advises the Board on  
these appointments, and also on retirements and resignations from the Board, and  
its other Committees.
The Committee will regularly examine succession planning based on the Board’s balance 
of skills and overall diversity. Led by the Committee, succession planning of the Board will 
form an integral part of the Board’s annual strategy meeting.
PROCESS FOR BOARD APPOINTMENTS
When considering Board recruitment, the Committee will draw up a specification for a 
director, taking into consideration the balance of skills, knowledge and experience of its 
existing Board members, the diversity of the Board, the independence of continuing Board 
members, together with the ongoing requirements and strategic development of the 
Group. The search process can then focus on appointing a candidate with a balance of 
skills that will enhance the Board.
The Committee will utilise the services of an executive search firm to identify appropriate 
candidates, ensuring that the search firm appointed does not have any other connection 
with the Group. In addition, the Committee will only use those firms that have adopted 
the Voluntary Code of Conduct addressing gender diversity and best practice in search 
assignments. A longlist of potential appointees will then be reviewed, followed by the 
shortlisting of candidates for interview, based upon the objective criteria identified at 
inception. Care is taken to ensure that all proposed appointees will have sufficient time  
to devote to the role and do not have any conflicts of interest. The Committee will then 
recommend a preferred candidate and the Directors not on the Committee will meet the 
candidate. Following these meetings, and assuming acceptance, the Committee will make 
a formal recommendation to the Board on the appointment. Wherever possible, the 
Nomination Committee will arrange for all Directors to meet the preferred candidate.

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2015 75 We believe that the Company’s 
current remuneration  
structure is working well and  
is effectively incentivising our 
Executive Directors and senior 
management to achieve both  
our short- and longer-term 
business targets. 
Directors’ Remuneration Report
Dear Shareholder,
Last year the Remuneration Committee  
(the ‘Committee’) delivered its first Directors’ 
Remuneration Report (‘DRR’) following  
Spire Healthcare’s listing in July 2014. I was 
extremely pleased with the response from 
shareholders to both the Annual Report on 
Remuneration and the Remuneration Policy 
which were presented at our annual general 
meeting in May 2015; both received 
extremely positive votes in favour of 98.94% 
and 99.56% respectively.
CONSISTENCY IN APPROACH
The Committee has agreed to maintain the 
approved remuneration structure for 2016 
and is not proposing any amendments to  
the Company’s Remuneration Policy for the 
coming year. We believe that the current 
structure is working well and is effectively 
incentivising our Executive Directors and 
senior management to achieve both our 
short and longer-term business targets in a 
way which supports sustainable shareholder 
value creation while also enshrining the  
core behaviours and values that have been 
integral to Spire Healthcare’s success to  
date. During the year, there have been a 
number of appointments to the wider senior 
management team, and the simple and 
transparent remuneration structure we 
operate has been a crucial factor when 
attracting some extremely strong candidates 
to the Company.
The Committee remains committed to 
focusing on pay for performance and 
rewarding the leadership team in a way 
which aligns them with the interests of  
our shareholders, while staying true  
to the Company’s values.
REMUNERATION DECISIONS IN RESPECT 
OF 2015
Although the Company’s performance 
remained good during the year, the business 
was impacted by an increasingly challenging 
business environment predominantly  
driven by external factors. Performance as  
a whole fell short of the stretching EBITDA 
targets that were set by the Committee at 
the start of the year and therefore no bonus 
payment will be made in respect of the 2015 
financial year.
The first share awards granted under the 
Company’s ongoing Long Term Incentive Plan 
(‘LTIP’) will be performance tested after the 
2016 year end and, therefore, no awards have 
vested under this plan.
DIRECTOR CHANGES
As announced in March 2016, Rob Roger  
will step down as Chief Executive Officer on 
30 June 2016 and Garry Watts has resumed 
the role of Executive Chairman. 
It is expected that Garry will serve in this 
capacity for a period up to 12 months from  
the date of Rob’s departure. Further details 
regarding both Rob’s departure terms  
and Garry’s arrangements while in post  
as Executive Chairman are set out in this 
year’s Annual Report on Remuneration.
REMUNERATION STRUCTURE FOR 2016
The salary for the Chief Executive Officer, 
Rob Roger, will remain unchanged up  
until his departure. The Committee has 
determined that, with effect from 1 April 
2016, Simon Gordon’s salary will be increased 
by 5% to £367,500. This is the first raise in his 
salary since Admission and reflects Simon’s 
importance in delivering the Company’s 
growth objectives over the next few years.
TONY BOURNE 
COMMITTEE CHAIR
GOVERNANCE
76 Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2015 The bonus structure will continue to be 
based on EBITDA and a balanced scorecard  
of strategic and individual objectives. 
One-third of any bonus earned will normally 
be deferred into shares for three years. The 
Committee has also agreed that LTIP awards 
to be granted in 2016 will continue to be 
subject to appropriately stretching EPS and 
relative TSR targets.
The Committee recognises the importance 
of fostering a culture of wider share 
ownership across the organisation. 
Therefore, at the annual general meeting, 
the Company will seek approval from 
shareholders for the rules of an all-employee 
HMRC -approved Sharesave Plan (SAYE).
COMMITTEE EVALUATION
As part of the Board’s wider evaluation 
completed in 2015, the Committee spent 
time at its meeting in November reviewing 
its own performance and discussing areas 
of good practice that had been raised. 
A number of the Committee had identified 
the appointment of a permanent Group 
Human Resources Director as a priority in 
order to ensure there is a clear People Plan in 
place as the Company grows. This was 
addressed with the permanent appointment 
of Caroline Roberts to the position in 
November 2015, which should further 
strengthen the support for the Committee’s 
work in future.
SHAREHOLDER COMMUNICATION AND 
THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
The Committee welcomes any feedback 
from our shareholders and trusts that you 
will support the policies and practices 
outlined in this report. As Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee, I am committed 
to ensuring an open dialogue with our 
shareholders. If you have any questions 
about the DRR or remuneration generally, 
please contact me via companysecretary@

The Committee recommends the 2015  
DRR to you for approval and we look forward 
to your continued support at our annual 
general meeting in May 2016.

NOTES TO THE POLICY TABLE 
PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND TARGETS
Annual bonus
The annual bonus performance measures  
are designed to provide an appropriate 
balance between incentivising Executive 
Directors to meet financial targets for  
the year and to deliver specific strategic, 
operational and personal goals. This balance 
allows the Committee to review the  
Group’s performance in the round against 
the key elements of our strategy, and 
appropriately incentivise and reward the 
Executive Directors. 
Bonus targets are set by the Committee each 
year to ensure that Executive Directors are 
focused on the key financial and strategic 
objectives for the financial year. In doing so, 
the Committee usually takes into account a 
number of internal and external reference 
points, including the Group’s business plan.
Long Term Incentive Plan
The Committee believes it is important that 
the performance conditions applying to LTIP 
awards support the long-term ambitions of 
the Group and the creation of shareholder 
value. The Committee currently considers 
that a combination of relative TSR and 
financial metrics (currently EPS) are the 
most appropriate measures to assess the 
underlying performance of the business, 
while creating alignment with shareholders 
and rewarding long-term value creation.
The Committee will keep the measures and 
weightings under review to ensure that the 
most appropriate measures to incentivise 
the long-term success of the Group are used.
RECOVERY PROVISIONS (MALUS AND 
CLAWBACK)
Prior to vesting, the Committee may cancel 
or reduce the number of shares subject to,  
or impose additional conditions on, LTIP , DBP 
awards and Directors’ Share Bonus Awards  
in circumstances where the Committee 
considers it to be appropriate (‘malus’).  
Such circumstances may include: a serious 
misstatement of the Group’s audited 
financial results, a serious miscalculation of 
any relevant performance measure, a serious 
failure of risk management or regulatory 
compliance by a relevant entity, serious 
reputational damage to the Group, or the 
participant’s material misconduct.
In addition, for cash bonus awards in respect 
of 2015 and future years, and for LTIP awards 
granted after 1 January 2015, the Committee 
may also claw back vested awards in certain 
extreme circumstances (including those 
listed above) for up to two years following 
the determination of the relevant 
performance outcome.
Prior to applying malus or clawback, the 
Committee will take into account all relevant 
factors (including, where a serious failure of 
risk management or regulatory compliance 
or serious reputational damage has occurred, 
the degree of involvement of the employee 
in that failure or damage in question and the 
employee’s level of responsibility) in deciding 
whether, and to what extent, it is reasonable 
to operate malus and/or clawback. The 
Committee is satisfied that the above 
provisions provide robust safeguards against 
inappropriate payment of incentive awards.
LEGACY ARRANGEMENTS
Directors’ Share Bonus Plan Awards  
were granted to Rob Roger, Simon Gordon 
and Garry Watts (in recognition of his 
performance as Executive Chairman prior  
to Admission) to reflect their contribution  
to the Company prior to Admission. These 
awards were made over shares in the form  
of nil-cost options. The awards are split into 
two equal tranches, which normally become 
exercisable on the first and second 
anniversary of Admission, respectively.
Although these awards were made in 
recognition of services provided to the 
Company prior to Admission, the awards 
will only be exercisable in full if the 90-day 
average share price prior to the first and 
second anniversary of Admission is at least 
359 pence. If, at the relevant anniversary, the 
average share price is at or below 224 pence, 
the number of shares in the relevant tranche 
to which the options relate will be reduced 
by approximately 35%. Where the average 
share price at the relevant anniversary is 
between 224 pence and 359 pence, the 
proportion exercisable will be reduced on  
a pro rata basis.
RECRUITMENT POLICY
In determining remuneration for new 
Executive Directors, the Committee will 
consider all relevant factors, including the 
calibre of the individual and the external 
market, while aiming not to pay more than  
is necessary to secure the required talent. 
The Committee would seek to act in what  
it considers to be the best interests of the 
Group and its shareholders. Normally, the 
Committee will seek to align the new 
Executive Director’s remuneration package 
to the remuneration policy, as set out above. 
Salary and benefits (including any retirement 
benefits) will be determined in accordance 
with the policy table above. In certain 
instances, the Committee may decide to 
appoint an executive director to the Board 
on a lower-than-typical salary, with the 
intention of gradually increasing the salary 
to move closer to market level as they build 
experience in the role. Normally, benefits 
will be limited to those outlined in the policy 
table above, including a relocation allowance 
in certain circumstances.
The maximum level of variable pay 
(excluding any buyouts) that may be 
awarded to a new executive director will  
be limited to 350% of base salary, which  
is consistent with the policy table above. 
Incentives will normally be granted under the 
existing plans; however, where appropriate, 
the Committee may tailor the award (e.g. 
time frame, form, performance criteria) 
based on the commercial circumstances. 
The Committee may ‘buy out’ remuneration 
terms a new hire has had to forfeit on 
joining the Group. Buyout awards are 
intended to be of comparable commercial 
value, and capped accordingly. The 
Committee will take into account all 
relevant factors when determining the 
quantum and form/structure of any buyout, 
including any performance conditions 
attached to any forfeited awards, the 
likelihood of those conditions being met, 
and the proportion of the vesting/
performance period remaining. 
The service contracts for new appointments 
will be consistent with the policy described 
below. Where an Executive Director is 
appointed from within the organisation,  
the policy of the Group is that any legacy 
arrangements would be honoured in line 
with the original terms and conditions. 
Similarly, if an executive is appointed 
following an acquisition of, or merger  
with, another company, legacy terms  
and conditions would be honoured. 
GOVERNANCE
80 Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2015 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SERVICE CONTRACTS AND PAYMENTS FOR LOSS OF OFFICE
The key employment terms and other conditions of the current Executive Directors, as stipulated in their service contracts, are set out below:
Provision Policy
Notice period • 12 months’ notice by either the Group or the Executive Director. This is also the policy for new recruits.
Benefits • The Group may agree that certain benefits will be specified within the Executive Directors’ service contracts.
• The current Executive Directors are contractually entitled to private medical insurance (for the Executive 
Director and his family), permanent health assurance, income protection, life assurance, an annual health 
assessment (for the Executive Director and their spouse) and a car allowance.
Termination payment • It is the Group’s policy that service contracts contain provisions that allow the Group to terminate employment 
by making a payment in lieu of notice (‘PILON’) equivalent to (i) 12 months’ base salary, and (ii) the cost of 
specific benefits (including retirement benefits).
• Upon termination by the Group, the Group can determine whether a PILON is made as a single lump sum or 
paid in instalments, subject to mitigation. Where the sum is paid in instalments, the Executive Director has a 
duty to use reasonable endeavours to secure alternative employment as soon as reasonably practicable. In the 
event the Executive Director commences alternative employment with an annual salary of greater than 
£30,000, there will be a pro rata reduction in the PILON payments.
Immediate termination • The service contract of an Executive Director may also be terminated immediately and with no liability to  
make payment in certain circumstances, such as the Executive Director bringing the Group into disrepute or 
committing a fundamental breach of their employment obligations.
External appointments • Executive Directors may accept one position as a non-executive director of another publically listed company 
that is not a competitor of the Group, subject to prior approval of the Board. External appointments to any other 
company (and treatment of any fees) are also subject to the prior approval of the Board.
In the event that the employment of an Executive Director is terminated, any compensation payable will be determined in accordance with  
the terms of the service contract between the Group and the employee, as well as the rules of any incentive plans in which they participate.
Where an Executive Director’s employment with the Group ceases prior to the payment of the annual bonus in respect of a financial year, the 
Committee in its absolute discretion will determine whether any bonus should be paid and the extent to which deferral into shares should be 
applied. Any awards would normally be prorated. For bonuses in respect of 2015 onwards, clawback provisions will also apply. For the 
avoidance of doubt, in the event the Executive Director is dismissed for misconduct, no bonus will be payable.

• LTIP awards will vest to the extent determined by the 
Committee, which, unless the Committee determines 
otherwise, will be calculated on the basis of the achievement 
of any performance conditions at the relevant vesting date 
and, unless the Committee determines otherwise, the period 
of time that has elapsed between grant and cessation of 
employment/directorship.
• The vesting date for such awards will normally be the 
original vesting date, although the Committee has the

of employment.
• DBP awards will normally vest in full on the original vesting 
date, although the Committee has the flexibility to 
determine that awards can vest earlier.
• DBP and LTIP awards will continue to be subject to the malus 
provisions outlined on page 80 until the vesting of the 
awards. LTIP awards granted from 2015 onwards are subject 
to a clawback provision, as described above.
• Any other reason • Awards lapse in full.

GOVERNANCE
82 Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2015 CHAIRMAN AND NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Group seeks to appoint Non-Executive Directors who have relevant professional knowledge (and/or specific technical skills) to support the 
current expertise of the Board and to match the healthcare sector within which the Group operates.
In the event of the appointment of a new Chairman and/or Non-Executive Director, remuneration arrangements will normally be in  
line with those detailed in the relevant table below. Fees to Non-Executive Directors will not include share options or other performance-
related elements.
Remuneration of independent Non-Executive Directors, with the exception of the Chairman, is determined by the Chairman and the Executive 
Directors. The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Committee. Directors are not involved in any decisions in relation to their 
own remuneration. 
The table below sets out the remuneration policy with respect to Non-Executive Directors. Non-Executive Directors do not participate in the 
Group’s bonus arrangements, share incentive schemes or retirement benefit plans. 
Approach to setting remuneration for  
Non-Executive Directors Opportunity
• Fees are set at appropriate levels to ensure Non-
Executive Directors are paid to reflect the individual 
responsibility taken, as well as the skills and experience 
of the individual. Fees are reviewed periodically. 
• When setting fee levels, consideration is given to  
a number of factors, including responsibilities and 
market positioning. 
• Where appropriate, benefits to the role may be 
provided. Travel and other reasonable expenses 
(including fees incurred in obtaining professional 
advice in the furtherance of their duties and any 
associated taxes) incurred in the course of performing 
their duties may be paid by the Group or reimbursed to 
Non-Executive Directors.
• The total fees paid to Non-Executive Directors will remain within the limit stated 
in the Articles of Association of the Company.
• Individual fees reflect responsibility and time commitment, as well as the skills 
and experience of the individual. Additional fees may be paid for further 
responsibilities, such as chairmanship of committees.
• Any benefits provided will be reasonable in the market context and take  
account of the individual circumstances and benefits provided to comparable 
roles. Expenses reasonably incurred in the performance of the role may be 
reimbursed or paid for directly by the Group, as appropriate, including any tax 
due on the benefits. Non-Executive Directors will also be covered by the Group’s 
indemnity insurance.
• The fees as at 31 December 2015 were: 
 − Non-Executive Chairman: £257,000;
 − Deputy Chairman and Senior Independent Director: £140,000;
 − Non-Executive Director basic: £50,000; and
 − Committee chairmanship: £10,000.
Under the terms of his appointment, Garry Watts is entitled to private medical expenses insurance (for both himself and his spouse and any 
dependent children), life assurance, annual health assessment (for both himself and his spouse) and office facilities to perform his duties as 
Chairman. Medical expenses insurance and life assurance will be provided under the Group’s arrangements or, if he obtains equivalent benefits 
directly, the Group will meet his costs (up to a specified cap).
CHAIRMAN AND NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ LETTERS OF APPOINTMENT
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment that set out their duties and responsibilities. They do not have service 
contracts with either the Group or any of its subsidiaries. 
The key terms of the appointments are set out in the table below. This is the policy for current and any new Non-Executive Directors.
Provision Policy
Period • In line with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Chairman and all 
independent Non-Executive Directors are subject to annual re-election by 
shareholders at each annual general meeting.
• After the initial three-year term, the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors 
are typically expected to serve a further three-year term.
Termination • The appointment of the Chairman is terminable by either the Group or the 
Director by giving 12 months’ notice.
• The appointment of the Deputy Chairman is terminable by either the Group or 
the Director by giving three months’ notice.
• The appointment of any independent Non-Executive Directors is terminable by 
either the Group or the Director by giving two months’ notice.
• The Non-Executive Director nominated by Mediclinic International pursuant to 
the terms of the relationship agreement is terminable without notice.

FURTHER DETAILED PROVISIONS
The DBP and LTIP , as well as the outstanding legacy Directors’ Share Bonus Awards, will be operated in accordance with the relevant plan 
rules (which were summarised for shareholders in the Prospectus). The Committee may adjust or amend awards only in accordance with 
the provisions of the relevant plan rules. This includes making adjustments to awards to reflect one-off corporate events, such as a change 
in the Group’s capital structure. In accordance with the plan rules, awards may be settled in cash rather than shares, where the Committee 
considers this appropriate.
The performance conditions applicable to incentive awards may be amended on an appropriate basis determined by the Committee, 
if an event occurs or circumstances arise that cause the Committee to consider the performance condition is no longer a fair measure of 
performance (and, in the case of the Directors’ Share Bonus Awards, the Committee determines fairly and reasonably that the circumstances 
prevailing at grant have changed). For LTIP and Directors’ Share Bonus Awards, the amended performance condition will be at least as 
challenging as the original condition.
Under the DBP , LTIP and Directors’ Share Bonus Awards, participants may receive an additional amount, in cash or shares, to take account 
of the value of dividends the participant would have received on the shares that vest.
In the event of a change of control of the Company, LTIP awards may vest to the extent that the Committee determines, taking into account 
the extent to which any performance conditions have been satisfied, and such other factors as the Committee considers relevant in the 
circumstances, provided that, unless the Committee determines otherwise, awards will be adjusted to reflect the period of time that has 
elapsed between grant and cessation of employment/directorship; DBP awards will normally vest in full; and Legacy Share Bonus Awards may 
vest based on the per-share price payable to shareholders on the relevant transaction, or, in the case of a winding-up, the share price at the 
time. Alternatively, awards may be exchanged for equivalent awards in the acquiring company.
The Committee may make any remuneration payments (including vesting of incentives) and payments for loss of office, notwithstanding that 
they are not in line with the policy set out above, where the terms of that payment were agreed before this policy came into effect; or at a 
time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in 
consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company.
The DBP and LTIP incorporate dilution limits. These limits are 10% in any rolling 10-year period for all plans and 5% in any rolling 10-year period 
for executive share plans. Shares issued out of treasury will count towards these limits for so long as this is required under institutional 
shareholder guidelines. Shares issued, or to be issued, pursuant to any awards granted on or before the date of Admission will not count 
towards these limits. In addition, awards that lapse shall be disregarded for the purposes of these limits.
The Committee may make minor amendments to the Policy set out above for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes 
or to take account of a change in legislation without obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment.
ILLUSTRATION OF THE REMUNERATION POLICY
The remuneration arrangements have been designed to ensure that a significant proportion of pay is dependent on the delivery of stretching 
short-term and long-term performance targets aligned with the Group’s objectives, and on delivering shareholder value. The Committee 
considers the level of remuneration that may be received under different performance outcomes to ensure that this is appropriate in the 
context of the performance delivered and the value added for shareholders. 
The charts that follow provide illustrative values of the annual remuneration packages for Executive Directors in 2016 under three assumed

84 Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2015 Assumed performance Assumptions
Fixed pay All performance scenarios • Consists of total fixed pay, including base salary, benefits and 
retirement benefits. 
• Base salary – salary effective as at 1 January 2016.
• Benefits – based on 2015 values.
• Retirement benefits – 18% of 2016 salary.
Variable pay Minimum performance • No payout under the annual bonus.
• No vesting under the LTIP .
Mid-point • 50% of the maximum payout under the annual bonus. This represents 75% 
of base salary for both Executive Directors. One-third of the bonus payable 
is deferred into shares under the DBP .
• 50% vesting under the LTIP . This represents 100% of base salary for both 
Executive Directors.
Maximum performance • 100% of the maximum payout under the annual bonus. This represents 150% 
of base salary for both Executive Directors. One-third of the bonus payable 
is deferred into shares under the DBP .
• 100% vesting under the LTIP . This represents 200% of base salary for both 
Executive Directors.
DBP and LTIP awards have been shown at face value, with no share price growth, dividend accrual or discount rate assumptions. The illustrative 
scenarios exclude payouts under the Legacy Share Bonus Award, which were granted to the Executive Directors in recognition of services prior 
to Admission.
REMUNERATION ARRANGEMENTS THROUGHOUT THE COMPANY
The Policy for our Executive Directors is designed in line with the remuneration philosophy and principles that underpin remuneration across 
the Group. When making decisions in respect of the Executive Directors’ remuneration arrangements, the Committee takes into consideration 
the pay and conditions for employees throughout the Group. As stated in the policy table, salary increases are, in practice, normally aligned 
to the general employee population. The Committee does not directly consult with our employees as part of the process of determining 
executive pay.
DIFFERENCES IN REMUNERATION POLICY FOR ALL EMPLOYEES
The remuneration of the wider employee population is based on the same reward philosophy, whilst the components of remuneration 
vary with seniority. All employees, including Executive Directors, receive a salary and role-appropriate benefits. Role-specific annual bonus 
arrangements are operated across the Group. For more senior roles, a portion of the bonus is deferred on a similar basis to Executive Directors. 
Only senior individuals who can have significant influence on the performance of the Group as a whole are invited to participate in the 
long-term incentive plans. This provides those individuals with an incentive to help achieve the Group’s medium- and long-term objectives 
and create shareholder value, whilst ensuring their remuneration varies to the extent these goals are achieved.
CONSIDERATION OF SHAREHOLDER VIEWS
The structure of remuneration for Board members was first presented to shareholders in the Prospectus prior to Admission.
The Committee is mindful of shareholders’ views when evaluating and setting ongoing remuneration strategy, and intends to appropriately 
consult with shareholders prior to any significant proposed changes to the remuneration policy.

2  In accordance with the requirements of the disclosure regulations, the value of the Share Bonus Award vesting in 2015 is calculated based on the share price at the date of vesting of £3.709 after  
part of the performance criteria for the first tranche of this award was met, inclusive of accrued dividend equivalents. It should be noted that as at the year end these vested nil cost options  
remain unexercised.
ADDITIONAL NOTES TO THE TABLE
Salary
On Admission, the salary for Rob Roger, Chief Executive Officer, was £525,000 and for Simon Gordon, Chief Financial Officer, was £350,000. 
These salaries remained unchanged during 2015.
Benefits
The benefits consist of private medical insurance (for the Executive Directors and their families), permanent health assurance, life assurance 
and a car allowance. Under his contractual terms, Simon Gordon also has an annual health assessment (for himself and his spouse). Under his 
contractual terms, Rob Roger also has income protection cover.
Retirement benefits
The amount set out in the table represents the Group contribution to the Executive Directors’ retirement planning at a rate of 18% of base 
salary. Simon Gordon is a member of the Spire Healthcare Pension Plan and Rob Roger has a personal pension scheme. Amounts above the 
HMRC annual allowance are paid as taxable cash supplements.
Annual bonus
For the 2015 financial year, the maximum bonus opportunity for Rob Roger and Simon Gordon was 150% of base salary. The annual bonus 
targets were set at the beginning of the financial year, with 70% of the award being assessed against EBITDA and 30% assessed against a 
balanced scorecard based on strategic targets including productivity, customer, quality and staff measures. The threshold EBITDA target for 
2015 was set at £171.0 million and no bonus would be payable if this threshold was not achieved.
Although the Company’s performance remained good during the year, the increasingly challenging environment and external factors 
impacting the business, meant that it did not achieve the minimum EBITDA threshold of £171.0 million. Although both Executive Directors 
largely met their individual objectives under the balanced scorecard, the Committee determined that no bonus will be paid in respect of 2015. 
GOVERNANCE
86 Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2015 DEFERRED BONUS PLAN
Under the DBP , one-third of the Executive Directors’ annual bonus is deferred for three years. The following awards over shares were granted 
under the DBP during the year. These amounts relate to their 2014 bonus which was disclosed in the 2014 Annual Report and Accounts:
Type of award Date of award Shares awarded Shares exercisable
Rob Roger Conditional Share Award (in the 
form of nil-cost options)
1 June 2015 18,057 1 June 2018 to 1 June 2025
Simon Gordon 1 June 2015 10,922 1 June 2018 to 1 June 2025
The share price used to determine the number of deferred shares subject to award was £3.606, the mid-market closing share price on 29 May 2015.
Awards are deferred for a period of three years and are conditional on continued employment. There are no further performance conditions 
attaching to these shares although they remain subject to a malus provision.
LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
No awards under the LTIP vested in the 2015 financial year and, subsequently, no award is shown in the single figure table above.
Awards under the LTIP were granted on 1 April 2015. These awards were granted in the form of nil-cost options over Spire Healthcare Group plc 
shares, with the number of shares that may vest conditional on performance over the three-year period to 31 December 2017. The maximum 
award granted to Executive Directors was equivalent to 200% of base salary.
The Committee determined that awards under this plan should be linked to the value created for shareholders over the period, and as a 
consequence that the awards should continue to be equally weighted against relative TSR and EPS performance targets. Further details  
of the performance conditions applying to the 2015 awards are set out below.
EPS – 50% of award
Vesting of this element is based on the adjusted EPS outcome for the 
2017 financial year.
Relative TSR – 50% of award
Vesting of this element is based on TSR performance measured against 
the constituents of the FTSE 250 (excluding investment trusts).
2017 EPS
Percentage of the 
element vesting TSR performance
Percentage of the 
element vesting
Less than 23.8 pence 0% Below median 0%
23.8 pence 25% Median 25%
27.5 pence or more 100% Upper quartile 100%
Straight-line vesting operates between these points. Straight-line vesting operates between these points. Based on relative TSR performance from  
1 January 2015 to 31 December 2017.

1 April 2015 193,905 £3.610 £700,000 31 December 2017
The share price used to determine the number of shares under each award is based on the average of the mid-market quotation at close of business over the last five dealing days prior to the date of grant. 
The face values at grant are equivalent to 200% of base salary. Both 2014 and 2015 awards are subject to EPS and relative TSR performance conditions. 
LEGACY ARRANGEMENTS – VARIABLE INCENTIVES RELATING TO THE PERIOD PRIOR TO ADMISSION
As disclosed in the Prospectus, the Company granted, conditional on Admission, Accrued Incentive Payments and Share Bonus Plan Awards. 
These are legacy arrangements that were adopted and operated prior to Admission. These figures have been included in the single-figure table 
above in the interests of transparency; however, it should be noted that they relate to performance delivered prior to Admission.
LEGACY ARRANGEMENT – DIRECTORS’ SHARE BONUS PLAN AWARDS
Awards were granted to Rob Roger, Simon Gordon and Garry Watts (in recognition of his performance in his pre-Admission role of Executive 
Chairman) to reflect their contribution to the Company prior to Admission. Details of these awards are set out below. In order to create further 
alignment with shareholders, these awards were made over shares in the form of nil-cost options and split into two equal tranches, which 
become exercisable on the first and second anniversary of Admission, respectively. 
Although these awards were made in recognition of services provided to the Company prior to Admission and, as such, are not subject to 
continued employment, the Share Bonus Awards will only remain exercisable in full if the 90-day average share price prior to the first and 
second anniversary of Admission is at least 359 pence. If, at the relevant anniversary, the average share price is at or below 224 pence, the 
number of shares in the relevant tranche, to which the awards relate, will be reduced by approximately 35%. Where the average share price 
at the relevant anniversary is between 224 pence and 359 pence, the proportion exercisable will be reduced on a pro rata basis.

No further awards will be made under this arrangement.
The 90-day average share price on the first anniversary of Admission was £3.438 and, as a result, the first tranche of the award (up to 50% of

NOTES TO THE TABLE
Benefits
Only Garry Watts has a contractual entitlement to benefits, which consist of private medical insurance for himself and his family; life cover 
for himself only; annual health assessment for himself and his spouse; and office facilities to enable him to perform his duties as Chairman. 
Reasonable expenses incurred by any Non-Executive Director will be reimbursed by the Company.
Chairman
As disclosed in the Prospectus, Garry Watts was entitled to a time prorated bonus for the period prior to Admission, in respect of his previous 
role as Executive Chairman. 
Details of the Legacy awards relating to performance prior to Admission are set out on pages 87 and 88.
On Admission, Garry Watts was appointed as Non-Executive Chairman and, in line with corporate governance guidelines, in that role he did 
not participate in any future incentive plans.
DEPARTURE TERMS FOR ROB ROGER
As announced in March 2016, Rob Roger will step down from the Board on 30 June 2016 after more than nine years with the business. 
On departure, Rob Roger will not receive any cash termination payment or payment in lieu of notice. His outstanding LTIP awards will lapse  
on departure. He will not receive a bonus in respect of 2016. The Committee has determined that he will retain his outstanding award under 
the Deferred Bonus Plan which is due to vest in 2018, as this relates to performance in 2014. Awards under the Legacy Deferred Share Bonus 
Plan will be treated in accordance with the plan rules, and the unvested element will vest to the extent that the relevant share price hurdles

IMPLEMENTATION FOR 2016
The following table summarises how remuneration arrangements will be operated for 2016. Shareholders will note that, for the second year, 
the maximum opportunity under the incentive plans will also remain unchanged.
Salary and 
benefits
• Following the year end, the Committee reviewed the base salary for Executive Directors as part of the annual salary  
review process.
• The Chief Executive Officer’s salary will remain unchanged for the coming year. The Committee has determined that with 
effect from 1 April 2016, the Chief Financial Officer’s salary will be increased by 5%. This is the first increase since 
Admission and reflects both Simon Gordon’s growing contribution towards the execution of the strategy as well as his 
importance in delivering the Company’s growth objectives over the next few years.

• No changes to benefits for 2016 – benefits include private medical insurance, permanent health assurance, income 
protection, life assurance, an annual health assessment and car allowance. Company contributions to the Executive 
Directors’ retirement benefits remain at 18% of salary.
* Effective from 1 April 2016. 
Annual bonus The maximum opportunity for Executive Directors will remain at 150% of salary. In view of his departure, Rob Roger will  
not receive a bonus in respect of 2016.
• The performance targets in respect of the 2016 bonus will be based on EBITDA, and a balanced scorecard based on 
strategic targets linked to productivity, customer, quality and staff measures. The detail of targets for the coming year is 
commercially sensitive; however, the Committee will look to provide expanded disclosure regarding bonus outcomes in 
next year’s report.
• One-third of any bonus earned will be deferred into shares for three years.
LTIP • Conditional award over shares will be made in 2016 of 200% of base salary in the form of nil-cost options. Rob Roger will 
not be granted an award in 2016.
• Performance will be measured over the period from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2018.
• Awards conditional on relative TSR and adjusted EPS targets. The EPS target range has been set in the context of external 
market conditions anticipated over the period. The EPS hurdle has been set so that vesting above 50% would require 
significant outperformance of market expectations. The EPS target range requires growth from current performance 
levels and the Committee is satisfied that the range is appropriately stretching and challenging.

to declare a final dividend, to receive the 
Annual Report and Financial Statements,

elect or re-elect all of the Directors and to 
reappoint Ernst & Young LLP as auditor. 
Shareholders will also be asked to authorise

is merited by the business of the meeting 
and is thought to be in the interests of 
shareholders as a whole). Further items  
of business to be proposed at the annual 
general meeting are described throughout 
this Directors’ Report.
DIVIDENDS
The Directors recommend the payment  
of a final dividend in respect of the year

recommendation at the annual general 
meeting, the final dividend will be paid on

The Company paid an interim dividend in 
respect of the year ended 31 December 2015 
of 1.3 pence per share on 15 December 2015.
BOARD OF DIRECTORS
Following the announcement in June 2015  
of the sale of Cinven Fund’s shareholding in 
the Company to Mediclinic International,  
Dr Supraj Rajagopalan stepped down  
from the Board on 29 June 2015. Danie 
Meintjes was appointed as a Non-Executive 
Director on 20 August 2015 under the  
terms of the relationship agreement  
entered into between the Company and 
Remgro Jersey Limited, a subsidiary of 
Mediclinic International. 
In March 2016, we announced that Rob 
Roger will be stepping down as Chief 
Executive Officer and leaving the Company 
on 30 June 2016. We will also appoint 
Andrew White, our Chief Operating Officer, 
to the Board on 1 July 2016.
The UK Corporate Governance Code provides 
for all Directors of FTSE companies to stand 
for election or re-election by shareholders 
every year. Accordingly, all members of the 
Board, with the exception of Danie Meintjes, 
who will stand for election for the first time, 
will retire and seek re-election at this year’s 
annual general meeting. Full biographical 
details of all of the Directors can be found  
on pages 58 and 59.
Further information on the contractual 
arrangements of the Executive Directors  
is given on page 81. The Non-Executive 
Directors do not have service agreements.
POWERS OF THE DIRECTORS
The business of the Company is managed  
by the Directors who may exercise all the 
powers of the Company, subject to any 
relevant legislation, any directions given by 
the Company by passing a special resolution 
and to the Company’s Articles of Association. 
The Articles, for example, contain specific 
provisions concerning the Company’s power 
to borrow money and issue shares.
APPOINTMENT AND REMOVAL  
OF DIRECTORS
Rules relating to the appointment and 
removal of the Directors are contained 
within the Company’s Articles of Association.
DIRECTOR’S INDEMNITIES 
See page 67 in the Corporate governance 
section.
AMENDMENT OF ARTICLES OF 
ASSOCIATION
The Company may only make amendments 
to the Articles of Association of the  
Company by way of special resolution  
of the shareholders, in accordance with  
the Companies Act 2006.
EMPLOYEES 
The Group is an equal opportunities 
employer and is committed to creating an 
environment which will attract, retain and 
motivate its people, by creating a working 
environment in which individuals are able  
to make best use of their skills, free from 
discrimination or harassment, and in which 
all decisions are based on merit. Spire 
Healthcare employs people who consider 
themselves to have a disability (a physical or 
mental impairment which has a substantial 
and long-term adverse effect on their ability 
to carry out normal day-to-day activities). 
Employees who consider themselves to have 
a disability are under no obligation to inform 
their employer of this, however, we are fully 
aware of, and comply with, our obligations  
in accordance with the relevant provisions  
of the Equality Act 2010.
GOVERNANCE
94 Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2015 The Group gives full and fair consideration  
to applications for employment from 
disabled persons. Should an employee 
become disabled during their employment 
with Spire Healthcare, every effort is made  
to enable them to continue their service  
with the Group.
Further information on our employees  
can be found under Our people on pages  
42 to 45.
POLITICAL DONATIONS AND 
EXPENDITURE
The Group made no political donations 
during the year. Although the Company  
does not make, and does not intend to  
make, donations to political parties, within 
the normal meaning of that expression,  
the definition of political donations under 
the Companies Act 2006 is very broad and 
includes expenses legitimately incurred as 
part of the process of talking to members of 
Parliament and opinion formers to ensure 
that the issues and concerns of the Group are 
considered and addressed. These activities 
are not intended to support any political 
party and the Group’s policy is not to make 
any donations for political purposes in the 
normally accepted sense.
A resolution will therefore be proposed  
at the annual general meeting seeking 
shareholder approval for the directors to be 
given authority to make donations and incur 
expenditure which might otherwise be 
caught by the terms of the Companies Act 
2006. The authority sought will be limited  
to a maximum amount of £100,000.
SHARE CAPITAL
As at the date of this report, Spire Healthcare 
Group plc had an issued share capital of 
401,081,391 ordinary shares of 1 pence  
each, being the total number of shares with 
voting rights. 
Equiniti Trust (Jersey) Limited, as trustee of 
the Company’s Employee Benefit Trust, holds 
1,692,242 ordinary shares of 1 pence each 
(2014: nil). Further details can be found in 
note 27 on page 128. 
The rights attaching to the shares are set out 
in the Articles of Association. There are no 
restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares 
in the capital of the Company other than 
those which may be imposed by law from 
time to time. There are no special control 
rights in relation to the Company’s shares 
and the Company is not aware of any 
agreements between holders of securities 
that may result in restrictions on the transfer 
of securities or on voting rights. In accordance 
with the Disclosure and Transparency  
Rules, certain employees are required to  
seek approval prior to dealing in the 
Company’s shares.
The Company’s entire issued ordinary share 
capital is listed on the premium segment  
of the Official List of the Financial Conduct 
Authority and to unconditional trading on 
the London Stock Exchange plc’s main 
market for listed securities.
Further information relating to the 
Company’s issued share capital can be found 
in note 27 to the Company’s financial 
statements on page 128.
The Company has made no purchases of its 
own shares during the year and no shares 
were acquired by forfeiture or surrender or 
made subject to a lien or charge.
ALLOT SHARES AND PRE-EMPTION RIGHTS
Shareholders will be asked to renew both the 
general authority of the Directors to issue 
shares and to authorise the Directors to  
issue shares without applying the statutory 
pre-emption rights. In this regard, the 
Company will continue to adhere to the 
provisions in the Pre-emption Group’s 
Statement of Principles. 
Further details on these matters can  
be found in the 2016 Notice of annual 
general meeting. 
VOTING RIGHTS
In a general meeting of the Company, on a 
show of hands, every member who is present 
in person or by proxy and entitled to vote 
shall have one vote. On a poll, every member 
who is present in person or by proxy shall 
have one vote for every share of which they 
are the holder.
RESTRICTIONS ON VOTING
Unless the Directors otherwise determine,  
a shareholder shall not be entitled to vote 
either personally or by proxy:
• if any call or other sum presently payable 
to the Company in respect of that share 
remains unpaid; or
• having been duly served with a notice to 
provide the Company with information 
under Section 793 of the Companies Act 
2006, and has failed to do so within 14 
days, for so long as the default continues.
DIRECTORS’ INTERESTS IN SHARES
The beneficial interests of the Directors’ and 
their families in the shares of the Company 
are detailed on page 91. 
During the year, no Director had any material 
interest in any contract of significance to the 
Group’s business.

As at 16 March 2016, the Company has been 
notified by the following investors of their 
interests in 3% or more of the Company’s

SIGNIFICANT AGREEMENTS 
The following agreements are considered  
to be significant in terms of their potential 
impact on the business of the Group as  
a whole and could alter or terminate on  
a change of control of the Group:
• the Group’s bank facility agreement 
contains provisions entitling the 
counterparties to exercise termination  
or other rights in the event of a change  
of control;
• there are a number of contracts which 
allow the counterparties to alter or 
terminate those arrangements in the event 
of a change of control of the Company. 
These arrangements are commercially 
sensitive and confidential and their 
disclosure could be seriously prejudicial  
to the Group; and
• the Company’s share incentive plans 
contain provisions relating to a change of 
control and full details of these plans are 
provided in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report on pages 76 to 93. Outstanding 
options and awards would normally vest 
and become exercisable on a change of 
control, subject to the satisfaction of 
performance conditions, if applicable,  
at that time.
The relationship agreement entered into by 
Cinven and Spire Healthcare Group plc in July 
2014 terminated on the sale of their 
shareholding in June 2015.
Following the purchase of shares by 
Mediclinic International from Cinven, a 
relationship agreement was entered into 
with Remgro Jersey Limited, a subsidiary  
of Mediclinic International, in June 2015  
and this is deemed a material agreement 
between the Company and its principal 
shareholder. The agreement does not include 
a change of control provision but does 
terminate upon the earlier of the Company’s 
ordinary shares ceasing to be listed and 
traded on the London Stock Exchange’s main 
market for listed securities and the principal 
shareholder’s ceasing to be entitled, in 
aggregate, to exercise or to control the 
exercise of 15% or more of the votes to  
be cast on all or substantially all matters  
of a general meeting of the Company.
COMPENSATION FOR LOSS OF OFFICE
There are no agreements between the  
Group and its Directors or employees 
providing for compensation for loss of office 
or employment that occurs as a result of  
a change of control.
DISCLOSURES REQUIRED UNDER LISTING 
RULE 9.8.4R 
The above table is included to meet the 
requirements of Listing Rule section 9.8.4R. 
The information required to be disclosed  
by that section, where applicable to the 
Company, can be located in the Annual 
Report 2015 at the references set out above.
EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD
There have been no material events  
affecting the Group or Company since  
31 December 2015.
GOING CONCERN
The Group is financed by a bank loan facility 
that matures in 2019. The Directors have 
considered the Group’s forecasts and 
projections, and the risks associated with 
their delivery, and are satisfied that the 
Group will be able to operate within the 
covenants imposed by the bank loan facility 
for the foreseeable future. In relation to 
available cash resources, the Directors  
have had regard to both cash at bank and a 
£100.0 million committed undrawn revolving 
credit facility. Accordingly, they have adopted 
the going concern basis in preparing these 
financial statements.
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION  
TO AUDITOR
Having made enquiries of fellow Directors 
and of the Company’s auditor, each of the 
Directors confirms that:
• to the best of their knowledge and belief, 
there is no relevant audit information of 
which the Company’s auditor is unaware; 
and
• they have taken all the steps a director 
might reasonably be expected to have 
taken to be aware of relevant audit 
information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditor is aware of that 
information. 
REAPPOINTMENT OF AUDITOR
Resolutions for the reappointment of Ernst & 
Young LLP as the auditor of the Company and 
to authorise the Directors to determine its 
remuneration will be proposed at the annual 
general meeting. Ernst & Young LLP has 
expressed its willingness to be reappointed.

financial year. Under company law, the 
Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state  
of affairs of the Company on a consolidated 
and individual basis, and of the profit or loss 
of the Company on a consolidated basis for 
that period. 
In preparing these financial statements,  
the Directors are required to:
•  select suitable accounting policies in 
accordance with IAS 8: Accounting Policies, 
Changes in Accounting Estimates and 
Errors and then apply them consistently;
•  make judgements and estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
• present information, including accounting 
policies, in a manner that provides 
relevant, reliable, comparable 
and understandable information;
• provide additional disclosures when 
compliance with the specific requirements 
in IFRS as adopted by the EU is insufficient 
to enable users to understand the impact 
of particular transactions, other events and 
conditions on the Group’s and Company’s 
financial position and financial 
performance;
•  state that the Group’s and Company’s 
financial statements have complied with 
IFRS as adopted by the EU, subject to  
any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and
•  prepare the financial statements on  
a going concern basis, unless it is not 
appropriate to presume that the Company 
will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions, and disclose,  
with reasonable accuracy at any time, the 
Company’s financial position and enable 
them to ensure compliance with the 
Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the Company’s 
assets and for taking reasonable steps  
for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities. 
Each of the Directors, whose names and 
functions are listed on pages 58 and 59, 
confirms that:
•  to the best of their knowledge, the 
Consolidated financial statements and  
the Parent Company financial statements, 
which have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRS as adopted by the EU, give  
a true and fair view of the assets,  
liabilities, financial position and profit  
of the Company on a consolidated and 
individual basis;
•  to the best of their knowledge, the 
Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report 
include a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the 
position of the Company on a consolidated 
and individual basis, together with a 
description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that it faces; and
•  they consider that the Annual Report and 
Accounts for the year ended 31 December 
2015, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced  
and understandable, and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders  
to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy.

OVERVIEW OF OUR AUDIT APPROACH
Risks of material 
misstatement
• Improper revenue recognition – management manipulation
• Improper revenue recognition – complexity of PMI and NHS contracts
• Inappropriate capitalisation of development costs of new hospitals
• Manchester hospital asset impairment
Audit scope We performed an audit of the complete financial information of four Group companies and audit procedures 
on specific balances for a further 16 Group companies.
The Group companies for which we performed full or specific audit procedures accounted for 100% of revenue, 
100% of profit before tax and 99% of total assets.
Materiality Overall Group materiality of £3.7 million which represents 5% of profit before tax.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
98 Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2015 OUR ASSESSMENT OF RISK OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT 
We identified the risks of material misstatement described below as those that had the greatest effect on our overall audit strategy, the 
allocation of resources in the audit and the direction of the efforts of the audit team. In addressing these risks, we have performed the 
procedures below which were designed in the context of the financial statements as a whole and, consequently, we do not express any 
opinion on these individual areas.
(New in 2015) Improper revenue recognition – management manipulation 
Refer to the Audit and Risk Committee Report on pages 68 to 71 and accounting policies on page 111. 
Risk Our response to the risk
What we concluded to the  
Audit and Risk Committee
2015 revenue: £885 million (2014:  
£856 million)
We considered that pressure to achieve 
results and secure bonus payments 
increases the risk of financial reporting 
manipulation by management. We  
consider there to be a risk that revenue  
is inappropriately reported to achieve a 
desired financial result. We believe that the 
opportunity to manipulate revenue creates 
a heightened risk in the following 
four areas:
• inappropriate revenue recognition by way 
of management manipulation of the 
pricing master file resulting in inaccurate 
patient invoicing, primarily in respect of 
PMI revenue;
• inaccurate coding at the hospital level 
across a number of hospitals, either 
through coders being misdirected by 
management to apply incorrect HRG 
(procedure) codes for NHS revenue or 
intentional miscoding of PMI procedures 
where incentivisation and direction to 
miscode could result in a material revenue 
misstatement;
• material overstatement of other income, 
specifically revenue earned through the 
specific NHS campaigns where the 
reporting of results achieved could be 
manipulated; and
• material risk that deferred patient 
revenue, across all payor groups, could be 
manipulated through early recognition/
deferral at the year end date. 
• Evaluated and tested controls over the maintenance 
and accuracy of the pricing master file and its 
interface with SAP . 
• Our testing involved the audit of controls over a 
sample of patient procedures for which revenue  
is recognised, agreeing to proof of procedure, and 
corroborating the pricing back to agreed price lists 
(insured, NHS and Self-pay) and contracts.
• The timeliness of cash payments from all of the main 
customer streams has been corroborated to provide 
additional assurance around the accuracy of revenue 
recognition. We obtained a breakdown of cash 
settlements to verify the recoverability of period  
end debtors.
• Tested controls around the monthly NHS procedures 
and payments (SAC) reconciliation, as well as 
analytically reviewing the activity report within this 
reconciliation for unexpected or unusual changes  
in types of treatment provided and recognised  
as revenue.
• Reviewed an independent audit report on the 
adequacy of expert clinical coders and enquired on 
the Group’s responses to the report’s key findings.
• For other income, our audit involved, in addition to 
the testing of cash payments from the NHS, 
agreement to source documents supporting the 
measurement and accuracy of the revenue 
recognised. 
• The risk of material misstatement in patient revenue 
towards the year end has been addressed through an 
increased level of substantive testing in respect of 
revenue cut off around the year end date.
We performed full and specific scope audit procedures 
which meant that 100% (rounded) of the Group’s 
revenue was included in our population for testing.
We did not identify any issues 
regarding improper revenue 
recognition or ineffectiveness  
of the controls over the revenue 
process. 
Based on our audit procedures 
performed, we concluded  
that revenue for the year is 
appropriately recognised  
and free from material 
misstatement.

Improper revenue recognition – complexity of PMI and NHS contracts
Refer to the Audit and Risk Committee Report on pages 68 to 71. 
Risk Our response to the risk
What we concluded to the  
Audit and Risk Committee
2015 PMI revenue: £435 million  
(2014: £432 million)
2015 NHS revenue: £262 million  
(2014: £246 million)
The complexity of PMI and NHS contracts 
could result in mis-billing, either through 
inaccurate coding, or using an inappropriate 
price list. The result would be that an 
invoice would not be settled, and the 
invoice would have to be cancelled, 
corrected, and rebilled. These errors may 
not be corrected by the end of the year, 
resulting in the risk of a material 
misstatement to revenue.
• Certain of the audit procedures designed to address 
the fraud risk as referred to above, have also 
addressed this significant risk of misstatement.
• Our testing has involved the audit of controls over  
a sample of revenue procedures and transactions.
• In addition, we have substantively agreed a sample 
of revenue transactions back to proof of procedure 
and agreed price lists.
• Timeliness of cash payments provides additional 
assurance of revenue recognition and has been 
evidenced as received where appropriate.
We did not identify any  
issues regarding any material 
mis-billing arising from the 
complexity of NHS and  
PMI contracts.
Based on our audit procedures 
performed, we concluded  
that revenue for the year is 
appropriately recognised and 
free from material 
misstatement.
(New in 2015) Inappropriate capitalisation of development costs of new hospitals 
Refer to the Audit and Risk Committee Report on pages 68 to 71 and note 17 of the Consolidated financial statements on page 122. 
Risk Our response to the risk
What we concluded to the  
Audit and Risk Committee
During 2015, total capital expenditure 
across the Group was £110 million (2014: 
£67 million).
Construction is under way on new  
hospitals in Manchester and Nottingham. 
Additionally, the Group is redeveloping 
parts of Spire St Anthony’s Hospital, 
amongst other development projects at 
existing hospitals, and has built a Specialist 
Care Centre in Baddow during the year.
Given management’s bonus structure  
and analysts’ expectations on the Group’s 
performance, we consider the risk of 
inappropriate capitalisation to these 
significant development projects as a 
material fraud risk in accordance with  
the auditing standards definition. 
We have focussed on this area in 2015  
as the level of capital expenditure is 
significantly more material to the financial 
statements than in prior years.
• We tested the effectiveness of controls associated 
with the capitalisation of development expenditure
• We performed testing of the nature, relevance to the 
project, existence and accuracy of additions to 
property, plant and equipment during the year using 
suitable thresholds. 
Our audit procedures found  
no instances of expenditure 
which in our opinion had been 
inappropriately capitalised.

Refer to the Audit and Risk Committee Report on pages 68 to 71; accounting policies on page 112; and note 17 of the Consolidated financial 
statements on page 122. 
Risk Our response to the risk
What we concluded to the  
Audit and Risk Committee
Spire’s new hospital in West Didsbury  
is planned to open in early 2017. As a 
consequence, the Directors have considered 
the impact on the Group’s existing hospital 
in Manchester, from the date of the new 
facility being opened. The existing facility is 
held under an operating lease arrangement 
which expires in 2042. 
The directors have forecast the 
consequential reduction in the earnings of 
the existing Manchester hospital. This has 
resulted in an impairment charge of £5.7 
million being recognised against the site’s 
leasehold improvements and equipment. 
However, based on their forecasts, the 
Directors have concluded that no onerous 
lease provision is required in respect of  
the lease. 
• Through enquiries of management, we assessed  
the various operational and commercial options 
available to the Directors for the existing Manchester 
site from 2017.
• We tested management’s forecast earnings analysis. 
We considered the,key assumptions and sensitivities 
in respect of the reduced earnings potential. 
Management’s forecast 
supports both the impairment 
charge recognised in the year 
but also that the lease is not 
onerous. We agree that balance 
sheet position at 31 December 
2015 appropriately reflects  
the impact of the new West 
Didsbury site on the earnings  
of the existing Manchester site.
In the prior year, our auditor’s report included risks of material misstatements in relation to goodwill carrying amounts, appropriate recognition 
of deferred tax assets and the treatment of costs directly attributable to the Group’s Admission. In the current year, have determined that 
these risks do not have the greatest effect on the financial statements in the year ended 31 December 2015. 
The carrying amount of goodwill has not been an area of major audit focus this year because the results of the last few years’ impairment 
review showed the value-in-use of the goodwill was significantly in excess of its carrying value. Given the continued year-on-year growth in  
the business, and management’s assessment of the forecast future profitability of the Group for the foreseeable future, we considered the  
risk of impairment to be reduced this year.
The risk of inappropriate recognition of deferred tax balances is no longer considered to be significant due to our assessment that there is  
little sensitivity to the judgements underpinning the basis of the deferred tax liability expected to arise in respect of the property portfolio, 
there is little judgement in respect of availability of losses across the Group nor judgement in respect of the right of offset of assets and 
liabilities in accordance with IAS 12.
The risk area we identified last year relating to the treatment of costs directly attributable to the Group’s IPO is not applicable this year due  
to the one-off nature of these transactions.

THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT 
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for each 
entity within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the Consolidated financial statements. We take into account 
size, risk profile, the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of group-wide controls when assessing the level of work to be performed  
at each entity.
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage of 
significant accounts in the financial statements, we identified the subsidiaries which represent the principal business units within the Group. 
The Group continues to operate solely in the UK. 
We performed an audit of the complete financial information of four entities (‘full scope components’) which were selected based on their size 
or risk characteristics. For a further 16 entities (‘specific scope components’), we performed audit procedures on specific accounts within that 
entity that we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the financial statements either because of 
the size of these accounts or their risk profile. 
The entities for which we performed audit procedures accounted for 100% (2014: 99%) of the Group’s revenue, 100% (2014: 100%) of the 
Group’s profit before tax, and 99% (2014: 99%) of the Group’s total assets. For the current year, the full scope components contributed 97% 
(2014: 96%) of the Group’s revenue and 62% (2014: 46%) of the Group’s total assets. The specific scope components contributed 3% (2014: 3%) 
of the Group’s revenue and 37% (2014: 53%) of the Group’s total assets. The audit scope of these components may not have included testing  
of all significant accounts of the component but has contributed to the coverage of significant accounts tested for the Group. Due to the 
distribution of the constituent parts of profit before tax across the Group’s entities, it is not possible to present the split between full and 
specific scope components in a meaningful way as intra-group profits earned in certain specific scope components results in the aggregate 
profit before tax at the component level being marginally in excess of 100%. 
For the remaining entities we performed other procedures, including analytical review and testing of the clerical accuracy of the consolidation 
to respond to any potential risks of material misstatement to the Group financial statements.
The charts below illustrate the coverage obtained from the work performed.
The audit of the entities within the Group is undertaken by one audit team which is led by the senior statutory auditor.
There have not been any significant changes to the scope of our audit from the prior year.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
102 Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2015 OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY 
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating  
the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in forming our audit opinion. 
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of the users of the financial 
statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our  
audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £3.7 million (2014: £3.9 million), which  
is 5% of profit before tax (2014: 5% of profit before tax and after adding back exceptional 
associated with the Group’s IPO). We believe that profit before tax provides us with the 
most applicable measurement basis for the users of the financial statements. 
Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount 
to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and 
undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall 
control environment, our judgement was that performance materiality was 75% (2014:  
75%) of our planning materiality, namely £2.8 million (2014: £2.9 million). We have set 
performance materiality at this percentage due to our assessment of the overall control 
environment and the history of no or very few audit adjustments.
Audit work on subsidiaries for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant 
financial statement accounts is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance 
materiality. The performance materiality set for each entity is based on the relative scale 
and risk of the entity to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of 
misstatement arising in that entity. In the current year,  
the range of performance materiality allocated to subsidiary entities was £0.6 million to £2.8 million (2014: £0.6 million to £2.9 million). 
Performance threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of £0.2 million  
(2014: £0.2 million), which is set at 5% of materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds. 
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other 
relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
SCOPE OF THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of:  
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation  
of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or 
materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent  
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITOR
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities set out on page 97, the directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us  
to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2015 111 
1. GENERAL INFORMATION 
Spire Healthcare Group plc (the ‘Company’) and its subsidiaries (collectively, ‘the Group’) owns and o perates private hospitals and clinics  
in the UK and provides a range of private healthcar e services. 
The financial statements for the year ended 31 Dece mber 2015 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors of the Company  
on 16 March 2016. 
The Company is a public limited company, which is l isted on the London Stock Exchange and incorporated and domiciled in the UK  
(registered number: 9084066). The address of its re gistered office is 3 Dorset Rise, London, EC4Y 8EN. 
2. BASIS OF PREPARATION  
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards a s adopted by the European Union 
(‘IFRS’) and on an historical cost basis, except fo r derivative financial instruments that are measure d at fair value.  
Group reorganisation during 2014 
As a result of the Group reorganisation implemented on 23 July 2014 through an exchange of equity inte rests, the Company became  
the legal parent of Spire Healthcare Group UK Limited and Spire UK Holdco 2A Limited, together with each of their subsidiaries. These 
companies were under common management and control throughout the periods presented and, therefore, th e comparative periods  
have been prepared as if the reorganisation had tak en place as at the beginning of the earliest period presented herein. 
As the Group reorganisation did not lead to a chang e in control of the companies included in the Group , it was accounted for using the  
pooling-of-interest method by aggregating the assets, liabilities, results, share capital and reserves, after eliminating intercompany  
balances and unrealised profits. The Consolidated f inancial statements, therefore, reflect the assets, liabilities and results of operations  
of the components of the Group that constituted the property ownership and trading businesses. 
Going concern 
The Group is financed by a bank loan facility that matures in 2019. The Directors have considered the Group’s forecasts and projections,  
and the risks associated with their delivery, and a re satisfied that, the Group will be able to operat e within the covenants imposed by the  
bank loan facility for the foreseeable future. In r elation to available cash resources, the Directors have had regard to both cash at bank  
and a £100.0 million committed undrawn revolving cr edit facility. Accordingly, they have adopted the g oing concern basis in preparing  
these financial statements. 
3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Significant accounting policies applied 
The principal accounting policies adopted are descr ibed below and were consistently applied for all pe riods presented, except as noted below. 
Revenue recognition 
The Group derives its revenue primarily from providing private healthcare services to both the public sector and private patients in the UK. 
Revenue from charges to patients is recognised when the treatment is provided. 
Interest income 
Interest is recognised on an effective interest rat e basis. 
Cost of sales 
Cost of sales principally comprises salaries of cli nical staff, consultant and clinical fees, medical services and inventories, including drugs, 
consumables and prostheses.

3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES c ont inu e d 
Other operating costs 
Other operating costs mainly comprise non-clinical staff costs, rent associated with properties leased under operating leases, depreciation, 
maintenance and running costs of properties and equ ipment. It also includes administrative expenses, i ncluding the provision of central 
support services, IT and other administrative costs .  
Operating profit 
Operating profit is the profit arising from the normal, recurring operations of the business and after charging exceptional items, as defined below. 
Operating profit is adjusted to exclude exceptional items to calculate the Key Performance Indicator ‘ Operating profit before exceptional  
items’, which is utilised in measuring performance before the impact of non-recurring, exceptional ite ms in the income statement. 
Exceptional items 
Exceptional items are those items which, by virtue of their size or incidence, either individually or in aggregate, need to be disclosed separately 
to allow a full understanding of the underlying per formance of the Group. 
Consolidation 
The results of all subsidiary undertakings are incl uded in the Consolidated financial statements. Asse ts, liabilities, income and expenses of  
a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the yea r are included in the Consolidated financial statem ents from the date the Group gains 
control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.  
Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or h as rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability  
to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an inves tee if, and only if, the Group has: 
• power over the investee (i.e., existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee);  
• exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and 
• the ability to use its power over the investee to a ffect its returns.  
Business combinations and goodwill 
Business combinations are accounted for using the a cquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is me asured as the aggregate of the 
consideration transferred measured at acquisition d ate fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree. For each 
business combination, the Group elects whether to m easure the non-controlling interests in the acquire e at fair value or at the proportionate 
share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Ac quisition-related costs are expensed as incurred an d included in other operating costs.  
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appro priate classification and designation  
in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the ac quisition date.  
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acqui sition over the fair value of the assets, liabiliti es and contingent liabilities of acquired 
businesses at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses. 
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairm ent, or more frequently if there is  
an indication that the value of the goodwill may be impaired. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost les s accumulated depreciation. 
No depreciation is charged on freehold land or prop erties under construction. Other assets are depreci ated so as to write off the carrying 
amounts of the assets, less their estimated residua l values, over their expected useful lives, as foll ows: 
Freehold buildings and improvements – 5 to 50 years 
Leasehold buildings and improvements  – lower of unexpired lease term or expected life, wit h a maximum of 35 years 
Plant and machinery – 5 to 10 years 
Fixtures, fittings and equipment  – 3 to 10 years 
The expected useful lives and residual values of pr operty, plant and equipment are reviewed annually a nd revised as appropriate. The review 
of the asset lives and residual values of propertie s takes into consideration the plans of the busines s and levels of expenditure incurred on  
an ongoing basis to maintain the properties in a fi t and proper state for their ongoing use as hospita ls and the forecast timing of disposal.

3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES c ont inu e d 
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost means purchase price, less trade discounts, calculated on an average  
basis. Net realisable value means estimated selling price, less trade discounts, and less all costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution . 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances an d call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral  
part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the p urpose only of the statement  
of cash flows. 
Interest-bearing borrowings 
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initiall y at fair value less attributable transaction costs . Subsequent to initial recognition,  
interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost on an effective interest basis. 
Borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to t he acquisition and construction of qualifying asset s, which are assets that necessarily take  
a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of tho se assets, until such time as the assets  
are substantially ready for their intended use or s ale. 
All other borrowing costs are recognised as an expe nse in the period in which they are incurred. 
Pensions 
The Group operates the Spire Healthcare Pension, a defined contribution scheme. The assets of the sche me are held separately from those  
of the Group in independently administered funds. 
Obligations for contributions to defined contributi on pension schemes are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred. 
Other employee benefits 
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measure d on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.  
A provision is recognised for the amount expected t o be paid under short-term cash bonuses if the Grou p has a present legal or constructive 
obligation to pay this amount as a result of past s ervice provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably. 
Share-based payments 
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share -based payment schemes under which the Group receiv es services from employees as 
consideration for equity instruments (options) of t he Group. The fair value of the employee services r eceived in exchange for the grant of the 
options is recognised as an expense. Where the shar e awards have non-market related performance criter ia, the Group has used the Black 
Scholes valuation model to establish the relevant f air values. Where the share awards have total share holder return (‘TSR’) market-related 
performance criteria, the Group has used the Monte Carlo simulation valuation model to establish the r elevant fair values (see note 28).  
The resulting fair values are recognised in the inc ome statement over the vesting period of the option s. 
At the end of each year, the Group revises its esti mates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-market conditions 
and recognises the impact of the revision to origin al estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity. 
The social security contributions payable in connec tion with the grant of the share options is conside red to be an integral part of the grant  
itself, and the charge will be treated as a cash-se ttled transaction. 
Provisions 
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obli gation as a result of a past event, and  
it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined  
by discounting the expected, risk-adjusted, future cash flows at a pre-tax risk-free rate. Provisions are measured gross of any expected insurance 
recovery. Any such insurance recoveries are recogni sed separately in receivables when the receipt of t hem is judged sufficiently probable. 
Leases 
Leasing arrangements which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset are treated as if the asset 
had been purchased outright. The assets are include d in tangible assets and depreciated over their est imated economic lives or over the term  
of the lease, whichever is the shorter. 
The capital element of the leasing commitments is i ncluded in liabilities as obligations under finance leases. The lease rentals are treated  
as consisting of capital and interest elements. The capital element is applied to reduce the outstandi ng obligation and the interest element  
is charged to the income statement in proportion to the capital element outstanding. 
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES c ont inu e d 
Taxation including deferred taxation 
Total income tax on the result for the year compris es current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognis ed in the income statement except to  
the extent that it relates to items recognised dire ctly in equity and other comprehensive income, in w hich case it is recognised directly in equity 
and other comprehensive income. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxa ble result for the year, using tax rates enacted, o r substantively enacted, at the balance  
sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable in r espect of previous years. 
Deferred tax is provided on all temporary differenc es between the carrying amounts of assets and liabi lities for financial reporting purposes  
and the amounts used for taxation purposes, except for:  
• goodwill not deductible for tax purposes; 
• the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination a nd which, at the time of the transaction, 
affects neither the accounting profit nor the taxab le profit or loss; and 
• investments in subsidiary companies where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is co ntrolled by the Group and it is 
probable that the temporary difference will not rev erse in the foreseeable future. 
The amount of deferred tax recognised is based on t he expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities, using tax rates enacted, or substantiv ely enacted, at the balance sheet date. A deferred tax asset is only recognised to the extent  
that it is probable that future taxable profits wil l be available against which the asset can be used. 
Derivative financial instruments 
The Group may enter into derivative financial instr ument arrangements to manage its exposure to intere st rate risk.  
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into a nd subsequently remeasured to their  
fair value at each balance sheet date. 
The Group applies cash flow hedge accounting to suc h derivatives if the criteria for doing so are met. 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as c ash flow hedges are deferred in other 
comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately i n the income statement. 
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in the inco me statement in the periods when the hedged item is recognised, in the same line of the 
income statement as the recognised hedged item. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group rev okes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrume nt expires or is sold, terminated,  
or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge acco unting. Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time remains in other comprehensive 
income and is recognised when the forecast transact ion is ultimately recognised in the income statemen t. When a forecast transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately i n the income statement. 
Share capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Increment al costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are deducted from share premium. 
Where the employee benefit trust purchases the Comp any’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the c onsideration paid, including any  
directly attributable incremental costs, is deducte d from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders in both the Company and the 
Consolidated balance sheet until the shares are can celled or reissued. 
Dividend distribution 
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s financ ial statements in the period in which the 
dividend is approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividend is recognised when paid. 
New and amended standards and interpretations  
The following amendments to existing standards and interpretations were effective for the Group from 1 January 2015, but either they were 
not applicable to or did not have a material impact on the Group: 
• IAS 19 Employee Benefits – Defined Benefit Plans: E mployee Contributions (Amendments) 
• Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2010–2012 Cycle 
• Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2011–2013 Cycle 
The Group or the Company has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective on  
1 January 2015.

The Directors do not expect the adoption of these s tandards and interpretations to have a material imp act on the Consolidated or Parent 
Company financial statements in the period of initi al application, except for IFRS 16 Leases . The impact of this standard will be evaluated. 
4. SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES 
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, the Directors are required to make judgements a nd estimates about the carrying  
amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based 
on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may diff er from these estimates. The following 
accounting policies have been identified as involving particularly complex judgements or subjective es timates: 
Judgements 
• Deferred tax  
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent th at it is probable that taxable income will be avail able in future against which they can  
be utilised. Future taxable profits are estimated b ased on business plans which include estimates and assumptions regarding economic 
growth, interest, inflation rates and taxation rate s. 
 The Group owns a portfolio of freehold and leaseho ld property interests. The Group has recognised a d eferred tax liability in its financial 
statements in respect of capital gains tax and othe r taxes based on the assumption that a proportion o f the freehold properties will be 
disposed of in future years, with the remaining pro perties being realised through use. This calculatio n requires judgement about the timing 
and number of the related property disposals, which is potentially impacted by changes to plans made b y the business over time and,  
in particular, changes in business plans in respect of the holding or disposing of properties. 
• Leases 
In the determination of the classification of a num ber of leases over hospital properties as operating leases, assumptions have been made 
about the discount rate applied to the annual rent payable over the remainder of the lease term compared against their respective fair  
values and of the useful economic life of the hospi tals. Further information about commitments under t hese leases is given in note 29. 
• Exceptional items  
Judgements are required as to whether items that ar e material in size, unusual or infrequent in nature should be disclosed as exceptional. 
Deciding which items meet this definition requires the Group to exercise its judgement. Details of the se items categorised as exceptional  
are outlined in note 8.

4. SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES c ont i nue d 
Estimates 
• Estimation of useful lives and residual values  
Property, plant and equipment are depreciated over their useful lives, taking into account residual va lues, where appropriate. The  
actual lives of the assets and residual values are assessed annually and may vary depending on a numbe r of factors. In reassessing asset  
lives, factors such as technological innovation, product life cycles and maintenance programmes are ta ken into account. Residual value 
assessments consider issues such as the remaining l ives of the assets and projected disposal values. T he estimated useful lives of  
property, plant and equipment are set out in note 3 . 
• Goodwill  
Goodwill is considered for impairment at least annually or more frequently if there is an indication t hat goodwill may be impaired. This  
is achieved by comparing the value-in-use of the go odwill with its carrying value in the accounts. The value-in-use calculations require  
the Group to estimate future cash flows expected to arise in the future, taking into account market co nditions. The present value of  
these cash flows is determined using an appropriate discount rate. 
 The assumptions considered to be most critical in reviewing goodwill for impairment are contained in note 16.  
• Share-based payments  
At the end of each reporting period, the Group revi ses its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on  
the non-market vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement,  
with a corresponding adjustment to equity.  
 The assumptions considered to be most critical in estimating share-based payments are contained in no te 28.  
• Provisions for patient claims 
In the measurement of such provisions where the rec ognition criteria are met, the typical complexity o f claims – for example in respect  
of their outcome and the extent of damages (if any) assessed on the Group – requires management to use estimation. Such estimates  
are typically based on professional advice on expec ted outcomes and historic information on similar cl aims. 
 In some cases, judgement is also required, for exa mple, as to whether the criteria for recognising pr ovisions are met and whether  
a reliable estimate of the outcomes can be made.   
 Further details of claims and the amounts provided are given in note 23.

Impairment of intangible assets – 1.0 
Staff costs (see note 7) 253.0 283.1 
6. SEGMENTAL REPORTING 
In determining the Group’s operating segment, manag ement has primarily considered the financial inform ation in the internal reports that

as a result of the listing, but not directly relate d to the issues of new shares. These costs include such items as IPO bonuses, marketing 
expenditure, professional and other services. These costs were largely tax deductible. A deferred tax asset was recognised in relation to  
the share-based payments. 
Non-IPO related 
In the year ended 31 December 2015, business reorga nisation costs mainly comprised staff restructuring costs. Hospital impairment relates  
to an impairment charge of £5.7 million on leasehold improvements and equipment associated with the ex isting Spire Manchester Hospital,  
as a result of the development of a new hospital fa cility in West Didsbury, South Manchester. Hospital closure costs relate to the closure of the

Exceptional items give rise to a tax credit of £2.7 million. 
In the year ended 31 December 2014, reorganisation and set-up costs were mainly associated with the co sts of acquisition of St Anthony’s 
Hospital, which as a material acquisition in 2014, has been treated as exceptional. Regulatory costs i nclude costs relating to the Competition 
and Markets Authority (‘CMA’) enquiry and £3.3 mill ion provision for the estimated liabilities payable to third parties, arising from uninsured,  
or partly uninsured, claims for damages in respect of the supply of medical products and other legal c laims made in respect of services 
previously supplied to patients. These costs were l argely tax deductible, except for the costs of acqu isition of St Anthony’s Hospital.

At 31 December 2014 519.1 
The goodwill arising on acquisitions is reviewed an nually for impairment or when there is an event tha t may indicate impairment. The prior 
year’s impairment of £1.0 million relates to the Gr oup’s goodwill in relation to an investment in a me dical practice following a CMA Final Order. 
The Directors do not believe that any impairment is required in the current financial year.  
Impairment testing  
The Directors treat the business as a single cash-g enerating unit for the purposes of testing goodwill for impairment. The recoverable amount 
of goodwill is calculated by reference to its estim ated value-in-use. 
In order to estimate the value-in-use, management h as used trading projections covering the three-year period to December 2018, which were 
extended to cover the five-year period to December 2020. 
Management identified a number of key assumptions r elevant to the value-in-use calculations, being rev enue growth, which is impacted  
by an interaction of a number of elements of the op erating model, including pricing trends, volume gro wth and the mix and complexity of 
discharges, assumptions regarding cost inflation and discount rates. These variables are interdependen t and the forecast cash flows reflect 
management’s expectations based on current market t rends. Revenue growth is projected to be in line wi th past experience and expectations 
of future performance, averaging 5.9% for the five- year period (2014: 5.9%). Cost assumptions are cons istent with the Group’s historic track 
record, after taking account of headline inflation at 2.7% (2014: 3.3%). 
A long-term growth rate of 2.25% (2014: 2.25%) has been applied to cash flows beyond 2020, which is ba sed on historic growth rates achieved  
by the sector, which have typically exceeded retail price index (‘RPI’). Pre-tax discount rates were b ased on the capital asset pricing model, utilising  
a sector-specific Beta in arriving at the equity pr emium and cost of debt based on current bank lendin g rates. A specific pre-tax discount rate was 
calculated to reflect the profile of cash flows inh erent to the cash-generating unit and this was 9.0% (2014: 10.2%). 
A sensitivity analysis has been performed in order to review the impact of changes in key assumptions. For example, an increase of 3.0% in  
the pre-tax discount rate to 12.0%, with all other assumptions held constant, did not identify any imp airments. Similarly, zero growth in the 
period beyond 2020, with all other assumptions held constant or combined with a 1.0% increase in the p re-tax discount rate, did not identify 
any impairment. 
As at the balance sheet date, it is not considered to be reasonably possible that circumstances will c hange, such that the key assumptions made  
in assessing the recoverable amount relating to eac h of the acquisitions will be revised to the point where the goodwill is considered impaired.

Prior year balance sheet restatement 
The carrying amount of long leasehold property at 3 1 December 2014 has been restated from £145.1 milli on to £139.8 million, with an 
equivalent £5.0 million (£5.3 million less £0.3 mil lion deferred tax impact) adjustment to equity. Thi s is the result of a correction to the initial 
measurement of certain of the associated lease liab ilities, from their inception in January 2010, to a ccount for all minimum annual increases  
in the rental payable under those leases and a cons equential reassessment of the appropriate discount rate (see also note 22). There is no 
material resultant change to the income statements for any of the periods presented.

Provisions relate to onerous tenancy contracts, end of life dilapidations under leases, commitments to patients in respect of the removal or 
replacement of the PIP brand of breast implants, an d estimated liabilities arising from claims for dam ages in respect of services previously 
supplied to patients.  
The provisions are shown gross of any expected reim bursement from insurers of the related risks. The r eimbursement is recognised as a 
separate receivable when receipt of it is judged su fficiently probable. The amount in receivables in t hat respect was £6.2 million (2014: £nil).  
In prior years, the provision represented the net a mount expected to be paid under excess arrangements with the insurers, but no adjustment 
has made to the presentation of the prior year numb ers as any change is considered immaterial. 
Provisions as at 31 December 2015 are expected to b e utilised within three years. 
The Group has received claims and notifications fro m patients of a consultant, who previously had prac tising privileges at Spire Healthcare.  
The patients are claiming against the consultant an d other involved parties including the Group. Court hearings are scheduled for a limited 
number of claims in June 2017 through which precede nt will be established regarding how future claims will be treated. The Group is 
defending such claims and the legal process is expe cted to take place over a period of several years. There is significant uncertainty regarding 
the number of claims, the outcome of the claims, an y amounts to be awarded to each claimant and the ap portionment of damages between 
the parties. It is, therefore, not possible to reli ably estimate any liability of the Group. The Group maintains comprehensive medical malpractice 
insurance, and in the event that the Group is found liable, the Directors consider that insurers will meet any such liabilities, subject to certain 
terms and excess limitations.

Recognised in equity – – 0.1 0.1 
At 31 December 2015 77.8 – (24.2) 53.6 
Deferred tax on property, plant and equipment has a risen on differences between the carrying value of the relevant assets and the tax base.  
Of the amounts included in losses and other, £23.0 million (2014: £30.5 million) relate to losses. Other deferred tax items relate to temporary 
differences on non-specific provisions and expense accruals. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are m easured at the tax rates that are expected 
to apply in the period when the asset is realised o r the liability settled, based on tax rates that ha ve been enacted, or substantively enacted, at 
the balance sheet date. The Finance Bill 2015, whic h includes a stepped reduction in the UK corporate tax rate from 20.0% to 18.0% on 1 April 
2020, has been enacted and so deferred tax assets a nd liabilities have been calculated at this rate un less the timing difference is expected to 
reverse sooner than 1 April 2020 in which case the applicable rate of 20.0% or 19.0% has been used. 
The Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets as a t 31 December 2015 as follows: 
(£ million) 2015 2014 
Trading losses 1.9 1.9 
Capital losses 0.3 0.3 
Tax basis for future capital disposals 10.7 9.2 
 12.9 11.4 
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in res pect of these amounts due to uncertainties as to th e timing of future profits that the trading 
losses could be set against and whether capital gai ns will arise against which the capital losses coul d be utilised.

27. SHARE CAPITAL AND RESERVES c ont i nue d 
Capital reserves 
This reserve represents the loans of £376.1 million due to the former ultimate parent undertaking and management that were forgiven  
by those counterparties as part of the reorganisati on of the Group prior to the IPO in 2014. 
Treasury share reserves 
Equiniti Trust (Jersey) Limited is acting in its capacity as trustee of the Company’s Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’). The purpose of the EBT is to 
further the interests of the Company by benefiting employees and former employees of the Group and cer tain of their dependants. The EBT  
is treated as an extension of the Group and the Com pany. 
Where the EBT purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares) the consideration paid, i ncluding any directly attributable 
incremental costs, is deducted from equity attribut able to the Company’s equity holders until the shar es are cancelled or reissued. As  
at 31 December 2015 1,692,242 shares (2014: nil) we re held by the EBT in relation to the Directors’ sh are bonus award and long term  
incentive plan. 
The treasury share reserve represents the considera tion paid when the EBT purchases the Company’s equi ty share capital, until the shares  
are reissued. 
28. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS 
The Group operates a number of share-based payment schemes for Executive Directors and other employees , all of which are equity settled.  
The Group has no legal or constructive obligation t o repurchase or settle any of the options in cash. The total cost recognised in the income 
statement was £0.7 million in the year ended 31 Dec ember 2015 (2014: £2.8 million). Employer’s NI is b eing accrued, where applicable, at the 
rate of 13.8%, which management expects to be the p revailing rate at the time the options are exercise d, based on the share price at the 
reporting date. The total NI charge for the year wa s £0.1 million (2014: £0.9 million).

Directors’ share bonus award 
At the time of the IPO on 23 July 2014, the Company granted nil cost share options to Executive Direct ors to reflect their contribution prior  
to Admission. The maximum number of shares underlyi ng the awards total 1,671,200. Each award was divided into two equal tranches, the 
first of which vested on 23 July 2015 and the secon d tranche will vest on 23 July 2016. The number of options that will vest will depend on 
conditions relating to share price on the relevant date. The first tranche, which vested on 23 July 20 15, resulted in 801,824 options being  
issued. For further details, see the Directors’ Rem uneration Report, on pages 76 to 93. 
Long term incentive plan 
The Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) is open to Executive Directors and designated senior managers, a nd awards are made at the discretion  
of the Remuneration Committee. Awards are subject t o market and non-market performance criteria. 
Deferred bonus plan 
The Deferred Bonus Plan is a discretionary executiv e share bonus plan under which the Remuneration Com mittee determines that a proportion 
of a participant’s annual bonus will be deferred. T he market value of the shares granted to any employ ee will be equal to one-third of the total 
annual bonus that would otherwise have been payable to the individual. The awards will be granted on t he day after the announcement of  
the Group’s annual results. The awards will normall y vest over a three-year period.

29. COMMITMENTS 
(a) Operating leases 
The Group had future minimum lease payments under n on-cancellable operating leases, based on rents pre vailing at the year end, as set  
out below: 
 2015  2014 
(£ million) 
Land and  
buildings Other

Later than five years  1,334.2 –  1,353.0 – 
 1,647.2 2.6  1,658.9 2.1 
The Group has a number of long-term institutional lease arrangements. These include leases over 12 pro perties with a term up to December 
2042, subject to renewal or extension over each of the 12 properties. The leases include key terms suc h as annual rental covenants and 
minimum levels of capital expenditure invested by t he Group. Rent is indexed annually in line with RPI , subject to a floor of 0.0% and a cap  
of 5.0%. The capital expenditure covenants measured on an average basis over each five-year period dur ing the term of the leases, require  
the Group to incur, in total, £5.0 million of maint enance capital expenditure and £3.0 million of addi tional capital expenditure each year,  
such being subject to indexation in line with RPI.  
(b) Consignment stock 
At 31 December 2015, the Group held consignment sto ck on sale or return of £20.9 million (2014: £19.3 million). The Group is only required  
to pay for the equipment it chooses to use and ther efore this stock is not recognised as an asset. 
(c) Capital expenditure commitments 
Capital commitments comprise amounts payable under capital contracts which are duly authorised and in progress at the balance sheet  
date. They include the full cost of goods and servi ces to be provided under the contracts through to c ompletion. The Group has rights within  
its contracts to terminate at short notice and, the refore, cancellation payments are minimal. 
Capital commitments at the end of the year were as follows: 
(£ million) 2015 2014 
Contracted but not provided for 39.4 6.4 
30. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES 
The Group had the following guarantees at 31 Decemb er 2015: 
• Spire Healthcare Limited, a subsidiary undertaking of the Company, had entered into an Authorised Guar antee Agreement (‘AGA’) with 
regard to the premises of the former customer conta ct centre at Victoria Harbour City, Manchester. Under the AGA, Spire Healthcare Limited 
acted as a guarantor to the new tenants until the e nd of the lease term, in January 2016. The maximum contingent liability at the balance 
sheet date was £0.3 million (2014: £0.8 million). T he guarantee has since lapsed and Spire Healthcare Limited is no longer liable to any 
contingent liability. 
• The bankers to Spire Healthcare Limited have issued a letter of credit in the maximum amount of £1.5 m illion (2014: £1.5 million) in relation 
to contractual pension obligations and statutory in surance cover in respect of the Group’s potential l iability to claims made by employees 
under the Employers’ Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Act 1969. 
• Under certain lease agreements entered into on 26 J anuary 2010, the Group has given undertakings relat ing to obligations in the lease 
documentation and the assets of the Group are subje ct to a fixed and floating charge.

31. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 
The Group’s objective is to maintain an appropriate balance of debt and equity financing to enable the Group to continue as a going concern,  
to continue the future development of the business and to optimise returns to shareholders and benefit s to other stakeholders. 
The Board closely manages trading capital, defined as net assets plus net debt. The Group’s net assets at 31 December 2015 were £997.6 million 
(2014: £955.0 million) and net debt, calculated as total debt (comprising obligations under finance le ases and borrowings), less cash and cash 
equivalents, amounted to £419.5 million (2014: £424 .3 million). 
The principal focus of capital management revolves around working capital management and compliance with externally imposed financial 
covenants. Throughout the period, the Group complie d with all covenants required by our lending group. 
Major investment decisions are based on reviewing t he expected future cash flows and all major capital expenditure requires approval by  
the Board.  
At the balance sheet date, the Group’s committed un drawn facilities, and cash and cash equivalents, we re as follows: 
(£ million) 2015 2014 
Committed undrawn revolving credit facility 100.0 100.0 
Cash and cash equivalents 78.9 74.5 
32. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: 
• credit risk; 
• liquidity risk; and 
• market risk. 
This note presents information about the Group’s ex posure to each of the above risks, the Group’s obje ctives, policies and processes  
for measuring and managing risk. Further quantitati ve disclosures are included throughout these financ ial statements. 
The Directors have overall responsibility for the e stablishment and oversight of the Group’s risk mana gement framework. 
The Group’s risk management policies are establishe d to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Gr oup, to set appropriate risk limits  
and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. 
Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Gr oup if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations, and arises principally from the Group’ s receivables from customers and investment securit ies. 
• Trade and other receivables 
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced m ainly by the individual characteristics of each cus tomer. The Group’s exposure to credit  
risk from trade receivables is considered to be low because of the nature of its customers and policie s in place to prevent credit risk occurring. 
Most revenues arise from insured patients’ business and the NHS. Insured revenues give rise to trade r eceivables which are mainly due  
from large insurance institutions, which have high credit worthiness. The remainder of revenues arise from individual Self-pay patients  
and consultants. 
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment t hat represents its estimate of incurred losses in r espect of trade and other receivables.  
This allowance is composed of specific losses that relate to individual exposures and also a collectiv e loss component established in respect  
of losses that have been incurred but not yet ident ified, determined based on historical data of payme nt statistics.

32. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT c ont i nue d 
Note 20 shows the ageing and customer profiles of t rade receivables outstanding at the year end. 
• Investments 
The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by onl y investing in short-term money market deposits wit h large financial institutions, which  
must be rated at least Investment Grade by key rati ng agencies. 
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they f all due. The Group’s approach to managing 
liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and 
stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation . 
Liquidity is managed across the Group and consideration is taken of the segregation of accounts for re gulatory purposes. Short-term 
operational working capital requirements are met by cash in hand and overdraft facilities. 
Typically the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expense s for a period of at least 90 days, 
including the servicing of financial obligations. I n addition to cash on demand, the Group has availab le the following lines of credit: 
• £100.0 million of revolving credit facility, which was fully undrawn as at 31 December 2015 (2014: £10 0.0 million). 
The following are the contractual maturities, as at the balance sheet date, of financial liabilities, including interest payments and excluding

increases in the rental payable under those finance leases.

32. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT c ont i nue d 
Bases of valuation 
The management assessed that cash and short-term de posits, trade receivables, trade payables and other current liabilities approximate their 
carrying amounts largely due to the short-term matu rities of these instruments. 
The carrying value of the other financial instrumen ts, being finance leases and debt, is approximately equal to their fair value based on a review 
of current terms against market and expected short- term settlements, except for floating rate debt, wh ich is after the deduction of £4.0 million 
(2014: £5.1 million) of issue costs.  
As at 31 December 2015, the Group did not hold any financial instruments measured at fair value (2014: nil). 
Market risk 
Market risk is the risk that changes in market pric es, such as interest rates, will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial 
instruments. The objective of market risk managemen t is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while 
optimising the return on risk. 
Interest rate risk 
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk arising from fluctuations in market rates. This affects fut ure cash flows from money market 
investments and the cost of floating rate borrowing s. 
From time-to-time, the Group considers the cost benefit of entering into derivative financial instrume nts to hedge its exposure to interest  
rate volatility based on existing variable rates, c urrent and predicted interest yield curves and the cost of associated medium-term derivative 
financial instruments. 
Interest rates on variable rate loans are determine d by LIBOR fixings on a quarterly basis. Interest i s settled on all loans in line with agreements 
and is settled at least annually.

Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2015 139 Notes to the Parent Company financial statements 
 
140 Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2015 
This section contains the notes to the Company fina ncial statements. The issued share capital is  
consistent with the Spire Healthcare Group plc Grou p financial statements. Refer to note 27 of the  
Group financial statements. 
C1. BASIS OF PREPARATION 
The financial statements have been prepared in acco rdance with International Financial Reporting Stand ards as adopted by the  
European Union (‘IFRS’) and on an historical basis. 
The financial statements have been prepared on a go ing concern basis as the Directors believe there ar e no material uncertainties that  
lead to significant doubt that the Company can cont inue as a going concern in the foreseeable future. 
The Company applies consistent accounting policies, as applied by the Group. To the extent that an acc ounting policy is relevant to both  
Group and Company financial statements, refer to th e Group financial statements for disclosure of the accounting policy. Material policies  
that apply to the Company only are included as appr opriate. 
The Company has used the exemption granted under s4 08 of the Companies Act 2006 that allows for the no n-disclosure of the income 
statement of the Parent Company. 
The Company did not have items to be reported as ot her comprehensive income; therefore, no statement o f comprehensive income was prepared. 
The profit attributable to the Company for the year ended 31 December 2015 was £41.6 million (period e nded 31 December 2014: £36.1 million). 
The comparative prior period amounts presented in t hese financial statements were from 12 June 2014 (date of incorporation) to  
31 December 2014. 
C2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES IN THIS SECTION 
Investment in subsidiaries 
The Company’s investments in subsidiaries are carri ed at cost less provisions resulting from impairmen t. In testing for impairment,  
the carrying value of the investment is compared to its recoverable amount, being its value-in-use. The value-in-use is calculated using  
the same assumptions as noted for the testing of go odwill impairment in note 16 to the Group financial statements. 
Share-based payments 
The financial effect of awards by the Company of op tions over its equity shares to employees of subsid iary undertakings is recognised by  
the Company in its individual financial statements as an increase in its investment in subsidiaries wi th a credit to equity equivalent to the  
IFRS 2 cost in subsidiary undertakings. The subsidi ary, in turn, will recognise the IFRS 2 cost in its income statement with a credit to equity 
to reflect the deemed capital contribution from the Company. 
C3. KEY ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IN THIS SECTION 
Impairment testing of investments in subsidiaries 
The Company’s investments in subsidiaries have been tested for impairment by comparison against the underlying value of the subsidiaries’ 
assets based on value-in-use calculated using the s ame assumptions as noted for the testing of goodwil l impairment in note 16 of the  
Group financial statements. 
C4. STAFF COSTS AND DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION 
The Company had no employees during the year/period , except for the Directors. The information on comp ensation for the Directors, being 
considered as the key management personnel of the C ompany, is disclosed in note C12.

Interest rate risk and sensitivity analysis 
As at 31 December 2015 the Company had short-term b orrowings of £1.9 million (2014: £5.5 million) owed to subsidiary undertakings, which 
are repayable on demand and bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.00% (2014: LIBOR plus 2.25%). Interest on th ese borrowings in the year amounted  
to £0.2 million (2014: £nil) and the Directors do n ot perceive that servicing this debt poses any sign ificant risk to the Company given its size in 
relation to the Company’s net assets.  
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures required a market risk sensitivity analysis illust rating the fair values of the Company’s financial 
instruments and the impact on the Company’s income statement and shareholders’ equity of reasonably po ssible changes in selected  
market risks. The Company has no financial assets o r liabilities that expose it to market risk, other than the amounts owed by/to subsidiary 
undertakings of £44.5 million (2014: £7.8 million) and £1.9 million (2014: £5.5 million) respectively. The Directors do not believe that a change  
of 25 basis points in the LIBOR interest rates will have a material impact on the Company’s income sta tement or shareholders’ equity.  
C11. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES 
Lease arrangements with a consortium of investors 
The Company has given a guarantee to a consortium o f investors, comprising Malaysia’s Employees Provid ent Fund (EPF), affiliated funds  
of Och-Ziff Capital Management Group and Moor Park Capital, in relation to the sale of 12 of the Spire Group’s property-owning companies  
on 17 January 2013. With effect from 17 January 201 3, the total third-party annual commitments of the Group under these operating leases 
increased by £51.3 million per annum. 
As a result of the sale, the Group has long-term institutional lease arrangements (up to December 2042, subject to renewal or extension),  
with the landlord for each of the 12 properties. Th e leases include key terms such as annual rental co venants and minimum levels of capital 
expenditure invested by the Group. The capital expe nditure covenants measured on an average basis over each five-year period during the  
term of the leases, require the Group to incur, in total, £5.0 million of maintenance capital expendit ure and £3.0 million of additional capital 
expenditure on the portfolio of 12 hospitals each y ear, such being subject to indexation in line with RPI. If the minimum rent cover ratio is not 
met, the Group is required to enter into an asset p erformance recovery plan in order to comply with th e covenants, but no default would be 
deemed to have occurred. The Company is a party to this guarantee. As at 31 December 2015 the Group co mplied with the required covenants. 
Lease agreements entered into by Classic Hospitals Limited 
Under lease agreements entered into on 26 January 2 010 by Classic Hospitals Limited, a subsidiary undertaking of the Company, the Company 
has undertaken to guarantee the payment of rentals over the lease term to August 2040, and to ensure t hat the other covenants in the lease 
are observed. The initial rentals payable under the leases in 2010 were £6.3 million per annum, which will be subject to an increase in future 
years. As part of these arrangements, the assets of the Company are subject to a fixed and floating ch arge in the event of a default. As at  
31 December 2015 there was no breach in the require d covenants.

scams in what often turn out to be worthless, 
non-existent or high-risk shares in US or 
UK investments. These operations are 
commonly known as ‘boiler rooms’.
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of 
any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at 
a discount or offers of free company reports.

These materials contain certain forward-looking statements relating to the 
business of Spire Healthcare Group plc (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries 
(collectively, the “Group”), including with respect to the progress, timing and 
completion of the Group’s development, the Group’s ability to treat, attract, 
and retain patients and customers, its ability to engage consultants and  
GPs and to operate its business and increase referrals, the integration 
of prior acquisitions, the Group’s estimates for future performance and its 
estimates regarding anticipated operating results, future revenue, capital 
requirements, shareholder structure and financing. In addition, even if 
the Group’s actual results or development are consistent with the  
forward-looking statements contained in this presentation, those results or 
developments may not be indicative of the Group’s results or developments

“anticipates,” “believes,” “intends,” “estimates,” or similar words. These 
forward-looking statements are based largely on the Group’s current 
expectations as of the date of this presentation and are subject to a number 
of known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors that may 
cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different 
from any future results, performance or achievement expressed or implied

could be affected by, among other things, uncertainties involved in the 
integration of acquisitions or new developments, changes in legislation or 
the regulatory regime governing healthcare in the UK, poor performance

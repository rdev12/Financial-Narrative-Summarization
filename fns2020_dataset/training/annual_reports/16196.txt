Salesrevenue
£582million
Lower commodity prices and sales
volumes resulted in a 16% decrease
in sales revenue in 2009.
Operating profit
£95million
Operating profit decreased by 68% due to lower
sales revenue, significantly lower profit on asset
disposals compared with 2008, offset by a
decrease in exploration costs written-off.
Profit after tax
£19 million
Profit after tax decreased by 92% mainly due
to lower operating profit and an IAS 39 charge
of £37 million (2008: credit of £43 million),
offset by a lower effective tax rate.

Operating cash flow
£374million
Lower commodity prices and sales volumes
led to a reduction of 28% in operating cash flow.
Operating cash flow and equity placing proceeds
facilitated capital investment of £758 million
in 2009.
Basic earnings per share
1.9 pence
Basic earnings per share decreased by 94% in
2009 primarily due to the reduction in profit after
tax and also an increase in issued share capital
during the year.
Dividend per share
6.0pence
With considerable opportunity to deliver
shareholder value by continuing to invest in
the business, the Board feels it is appropriate
to maintain the dividend at the 2008 level.
The 2009 results are in line with expectations and reflect a period of financial
transition as we re-position the business. We significantly strengthened our
balance sheet and have put in place a capital structure integral to delivering our
medium-term strategy. This enables us to invest in high-impact exploration
and develop significant production from two world-class basins.

How we create value
Directors’ Report: Group overview
Tullow creates value in two main ways. We grow our resource
base through successful exploration and strategic acquisitions,
which complement our business in our areas of focus. We then
commercialise those resources by efficiently developing fields
or by farming down and re-investing for strategic advantage.

Value
creation
We have developed a strong track record
of successfully acquiring assets and companies
which complement and extend our portfolio, skill
set and business opportunities. Since 2000 we have
acquired and quickly integrated UK North Sea gas
assets, Energy Africa and Hardman Resources;
each creating a step change which has contributed
to the transformation of Tullow.
Successful exploration is often the most
cost-effective way to add transformational
resources. Tullow finds oil and gas through
geological expertise and enhanced geophysical
prospecting technologies. We balance high-risk
exploration drilling in frontier areas which have
lots of follow-up potential, with low-risk appraisal
and satellite drilling activity.

that is capable of funding a major annual exploration programme.

Commercialising
our resource base
Total reserves and resources
894mmboe
Our aim is to continuously grow our resource base to generate
value-adding development or dilution opportunities. We achieved
437% organic replacement in 2009 and 1,232% in 2008.
Strategic portfolio management dilutes selected
exploration and production assets and generates
additional cash flow for re-investment into high
value growth opportunities. It also provides a
platform for us to introduce new partners with
complementary skills, gives host governments
the ability to participate and establishes a
market value for return on future investments.
Turning resources into reserves and then into
production revenue is one of our core strengths.
We have a successful track record in managing
mature production operations and the fast-track
development of major projects in Ghana and
Uganda is shifting our operating capability to
a different level.

Tullow achieved an exceptional business and operational
performance in 2009, with an unprecedented level and pace
of activity throughout the Group. We also delivered well
against our Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and
effectively managed our principal risks.
Chairman’s statement 14
A first-class performance in 2009 and an excellent start to
2010 puts Tullow in a great position. We continue to build on
our strong progress and create material opportunities through
our unique position in Africa. We are poised for major production
growth and our busy exploration programme continues. Our
capital structure is significantly strengthened and our future
growth and performance prospects are very bright.
Governance highlights 17
2009 built on what has been an extraordinary period of growth
and success for Tullow. Throughout our development one
of our guiding principles has consistently been to become
a better run company.
Key Performance Indicators 18
We measure our progress against seven KPIs and in 2009
added very specific deliverables in the areas of finance,
portfolio management and for our major projects in
Ghana and Uganda.
2 14 Tullow Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Accounts
Chairman’s statement
Directors’ Report: Group overview
Results in line with expectations
The Group’s financial results were in line with
market expectations and reflect the stage we are
at in developing the business. Capital allocation
in recent years has focused on building and
commercialising our resource base. With first oil
from Ghana later this year, we are entering a phase
that should deliver major production growth, which
should underpin a stronger financial performance.
As a result, Tullow is in a period of transition and
this will be reflected in our 2010 and 2011 results.
In 2009, the Group’s financial results were down
compared with a record 2008. This is mainly as
a result of lower production volumes, lower
commodity prices and an increased charge for
IAS 39: Financial Instruments. In addition, while
exploration write-offs in 2009 were lower than 2008,
the Group had less profit on disposal of assets to
offset this as a result of lower levels of portfolio
management activity.
Continued exploration success
Exploration and Appraisal (E&A) activity continued
apace, delivering a record 87% success rate in 2009.
Highlights for the year include:
• The 300 million barrel Jobi-Rii discovery in Uganda,
one of Africa’s largest onshore oil fields;
2009 was another great year for
Tullow. Across the business our
people, processes, operations
and projects delivered on all fronts.
Over the years we have built a strong
reputation with host governments and
partners, which has helped us to grow
and monetise our resources and
deliver value for all stakeholders.
Pat Plunkett
Chairman www.tullowoil.com 15
tragedy has had on his family, whom we continue
to support. In addition, we undertook a comprehensive
response, spearheaded by Paul McDade, our Chief
Operating Officer and Board Director responsible
for EHS, and full details are set out on page 73.
Overall, our safety performance for the year was
satisfactory. We achieved our target of a Lost Time
Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) of less than 1.0, but
we did not achieve our stretch target of 0.50 as
we recorded an outcome of 0.76 (2008: 0.54). Total
Recordable Injuries declined to 20 (2008: 28) and
High Potential Incidents (HIPOs) declined to 10
(2008: 24). Over 6.6 million hours were worked
in Tullow in 2009, an increase of 18% on 2008.
4.4 million of those hours were worked in Africa.
Excellent environmental engagement
Across the Group, a strong environmental
performance was achieved. There were no major
environmental incidents and good progress was
made with toes (Tullow Oil Environment Standards).
Some excellent work was undertaken with the Ghana
Jubilee Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and
public consultation process, the French Guiana EIA
and the environmentally sensitive approach taken
to drilling the Ngassa-2 well in Uganda. While
these case studies will be fully documented in our
upcoming 2009 Corporate Responsibility Report,
further information is available in the corporate
responsibility section on page 72 of this report.
• The commercial threshold for development of the
Lake Albert Rift Basin in Uganda was comfortably
exceeded with a 96% drilling success rate to date;
• An ongoing E&A campaign in Ghana confirmed
significant further potential;
• The Tweneboa discovery indicated the potential
of another world-class oil and gas accumulation,
some 25 km west of the Jubilee field; and
• The successful Venus B-1 exploration well in
Sierra Leone demonstrated a petroleum system
that spans two of the most exciting and highly
prospective basins in the world today.
Solid production and fast-track development
Excellent performance was achieved by production
and development. Highlights include:
• Efficient execution of incremental development
projects throughout our portfolio of assets to
achieve production of 58,300 boepd in 2009;
• Setting a new industry benchmark for the
fast-track development of the Jubilee field,
which is on target to deliver first oil in the
fourth quarter of this year;
• Best in class deepwater well delivery by the
Tullow well engineering team; and
• Initiating development work in Uganda that is
targeting first commercial oil in 2011, with early
production from well testing in 2010.
Creating value for all stakeholders
Our vision is to be the leading global independent oil
and gas company. To achieve this we have a clear and
consistent strategy and a long-term perspective on
how we develop our business. This means we protect
our reputation, carefully manage and mitigate risk
and invest in people and partnerships. We also work
to ensure that we create the internal and external
operating environment Tullow needs to successfully
continue our growth strategy and deliver our business
plans. By doing all of these things well, we create
competitive advantage for Tullow and more importantly
we create long-term benefits for all our stakeholders.
Keeping people safe
Our number one priority is to keep everyone who
works with Tullow or lives in our local communities
safe. We have a very clear Health and Safety (H&S)
policy which is strongly supported by our EHS
Leadership Team and commitment statements.
It is reflected in employee inductions, continuous
training and careful monitoring and reporting to
Tullow’s Board and management.
Despite this, in 2009, Tullow had its first ever fatality
when a building contractor died at the Bangora gas
processing facility in Bangladesh. We deeply regret
his death and are very saddened by the effect this

we continued to invest in building our team and organisation. 16 Tullow Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Accounts
Chairman’s statement continued
Directors’ Report: Group overview
Strong portfolio management
On 17 January 2010, Tullow chose to exercise
its right of pre-emption for the entire interests of
Heritage Oil plc, our partner in the Lake Albert Rift
Basin, in Uganda. A formal request for Government
consent to transfer these assets to Tullow was
submitted on 2 February 2010. The acquisition
price is expected to be up to US$1.5 billion.
Tullow is now working closely with the Government
to gain approval for the pre-emption of the Heritage
interests in parallel with the farmdown process,
which is now at an advanced stage. Two new
potential partners have been identified, CNOOC
and Total, and it is expected that each partner will
take a one third interest in each of the three blocks.
Presentations by all parties have recently been made
to the relevant Ugandan authorities and Tullow expects
the transactions to be signed in April 2010. This will
result in a unified partnership with considerable
experience and financial capability to enable Uganda
to become a significant oil producing nation.
Prudent dividend policy
The Group has very significant capital requirements
with forecast 2010 capital expenditure close to
£1 billion. As a result, the Board feels it is best
to continue to be conservative in its approach to
Tullow’s dividend policy and that it is appropriate
to maintain the final dividend at the 2008 level.
The final dividend proposed is 4.0 pence per share,
which brings the total payout for 2009 to 6.0 pence
per share (2008: 6.0 pence per share). The dividend
will be paid on 21 May 2010 to shareholders on the
register on 16 April 2010. The Annual General Meeting
will be held on 12 May 2010 at Haberdashers Hall
in London.
Consistent strategy
With partners and governments we are working to
commercialise two world-class basins in Ghana and
Uganda. We are retaining our exploration focus with
up to 12 Equatorial Atlantic, 10 Ugandan and eight
wildcat wells planned in our 2010 E&A programme.
We are underpinning these activities with appropriate
financing and risk management strategies.
Our short to medium-term objective is to build a
business with a production output and operational
cash flow that is capable of funding a major annual
exploration programme.
Dynamic risk management
Risk management is an integral part of our strategy
and our operations. As a business we could not
function at such a high level unless we are very
specific about the identification and management
of risk, and how we respond if things go wrong.
Risk factors are reported monthly to the Board in
an independent process which is validated by Group
Internal Audit. It is a dynamic system that continually
I would like to take this opportunity
to thank our shareholders and
banking partners for their
continued strong support, which
is fundamental to the long-term
success of Tullow.
Pat Plunkett
Chairman
Building a very strong team
Each year I write about the level of investment we are
making in building the Tullow organisation. 2009 was
no different. The Tullow team continued to grow with
182 new people joining during the year. Our total
workforce is now 880 people with 669 full time
employees and 211 full time contractors. We are
also investing in developing in-country skills and
now have over 75% Ugandan nationals working in
our operations in Uganda and over 80% Ghanaians
in our operations in Ghana.
Our 2009 independent employee survey delivered
excellent engagement results and most representative
of all was staff turnover of only 2.0% during the year.
This survey also demonstrated good engagement
with our values and culture, which is an important
measure, as the Group continues to grow.
Strengthened capital structure
Our finance team secured US$2 billion and US$250
million debt facilities in March and December 2009
and raised gross proceeds of £1.3 billion with two
successful equity placings in January 2009 and
January 2010. The combination of the Group’s equity
and debt raising and the successful completion of
the Ugandan farmdown will ensure that Tullow is
adequately capitalised to fund its medium-term
strategy. Further information on Tullow’s strategy,
long-term financing and risk management are on
pages 24, 60 and 62.
In February 2010, we received preliminary results
of an independent investment community perception
survey. The results are very positive and the Board
looks forward to a full presentation in April to review,
and address as appropriate, some of the strategic
considerations this research has raised. www.tullowoil.com 17
updates risk factors as they are identified or come
to the fore. It is action-orientated and specifies what
must be done, helping us to develop better mitigation
and responses to changes in the external operating
environment. The key risks for Tullow in 2010 are
execution risk in Ghana and Uganda and exploration
risk in the context of the high level of planned
exploration and appraisal activity across our
portfolio. More detail on risk management
can be found on pages 62 to 65.
Key Performance Indicators
As our business has grown we have become more
disciplined and sophisticated in how we measure our
progress. The Group has seven KPIs split between
two non-financial and five financial indicators.
We also identified the need to recognise the major
transition the Group is currently going through.
Specific performance objectives have therefore
been defined for finance, portfolio management
and our major projects in Ghana and Uganda.
While we did well overall against our performance
indicators and objectives, there were three areas
where we did not achieve the top possible outcome.
We fell marginally short of our production target;
we reduced our safety performance achievement
by 50% as a result of the fatality in Bangladesh and
the Ugandan farmdown was not finalised in 2009.
A very bright future
Tullow had another outstanding year in 2009 and the
pace of activity continues as we move into 2010, with
some remarkable achievements already. We plan to
consolidate the exceptional progress we have made
in the last five years and leverage our unique position
as Africa’s leading independent oil company.

Lost Time Injury
Frequency Rate (LTIFR)
0.76L TIFR
Aim
Our top operational priority is
to keep people safe. To measure this
the Group’s objective is to deliver top
quartile industry safety performance
and achieve a preset absolute target.
Measurement
Rigorous and consistent incident
reporting procedures are in place
throughout Tullow. These include
analysis, follow-up, remedial actions
and communication of learnings.
H&S is reported to the Board
monthly and annually.
Risk management
H&S is part of all operational
planning and activities. We also have
clear H&S policies and procedures
supported by strong EHS leadership,
accountability and commitment in
each asset and at each level of the
business.
2009 Performance
While we achieved our baseline
target of <1.0 LTIFR, the Group did
not deliver top quartile industry
safety performance. In 2009, Tullow
had its first ever fatality. As a result
the bonus element relating to this
KPI was reduced by 50%.
Working interest production
58,300boepd
Aim
Production is key to revenue and
cash generation. We aim to achieve
production in line with the Group’s
annual budget and market guidance.
Measurement
Daily and weekly production is
monitored from key producing
assets. Production is reported weekly
and monthly to senior management
and forecast updates are prepared
regularly during the year .
Risk management
The Group’s investment in major
field development in Ghana and
Uganda will significantly enhance
our production profile and is moving
Tullow’s operating capability to the
next level. A strong operational
performance in production planning
and monitoring mitigates against
unplanned interruptions.
2009 Performance
The Group’s baseline production
target for 2009 was 58,700 boepd.
2009 actual production was
58,300 boepd, therefore the bonus
element relating to this KPI was
not awarded.
Reserves and resources
replacement
437%
Aim
Replacement of reserves and
resources is focused on continuing to
grow the Group’s production potential.
Measurement
Reserves estimates for each field are
reviewed by an independent engineer ,
in the event of significant new data or
a material change. A review of each
field is undertaken every two years.
Resources estimates are also
produced by an independent engineer .
Risk management
The Group manages replacement
risk by maximising reservoir
performance in producing fields,
through operational and technical
capability, and continued
exploration success based
on focused material campaigns.
2009 Performance
The Group achieved 437% organic
reserves and resources replacement
in 2009. This follows-on from a
record 1,232% organic replacement
in 2008.
Staff turnover
2.0%
Aim
We aim to be the employer of
choice in the industry so that we
have the right resources and
capabilities to deliver our strategy
and business plans.
Measurement
We have a Board approved HR
strategy and HR resources are
deployed throughout the Group. There
are systems to identify issues early.
People who leave are debriefed so we
can improve our policies. An annual
global employee survey is conducted.
Risk management
Tullow’s best defence against
the disruption to the business
of a people skills shortage or
unexpected departures is to create
an environment that allows people
to work and contribute in the best
way possible and to recognise and
reward them appropriately for their
contribution.
2009 Performance
2.0% of staff left the Group in 2009,
compared with 2.3% in 2008. This is
a strong performance during a year
when the Group’s total staff grew by
24% to 669 people, following a 50%
increase in 2008.
We measure our progress through seven KPIs that are closely
aligned with delivering our strategy which seeks to deliver
sustainable long-term growth. Four KPIs are linked
to the bonus element of Executive Directors’ remuneration.
Non-financial Financial The bonus element of
the Executive Directors’
remuneration is linked
to LTIFR, Working interest
production, Cash operating
costs per boe and TSR.
Other KPIs relating to
bonus remuneration
include finding costs per
barrel, specific in-year
finance and portfolio
management objectives
and key project milestones
for Ghana and Uganda.

Operating cash flow before
working capital
£374million
Aim
Growing our business is capital and
cash intensive and we aim to ensure
in the medium term that capital
expenditure together with debt and
dividend commitments can be
serviced from strong operating
cash flow.
Measurement
Operating cash flow is reported
monthly with regular forecasting for
longer periods to support long-range
planning and investment decisions.
Annual and project budgets require
Board approval.
Risk management
Strong financial and operating
management, disciplined monitoring
and reporting, long-range cash flow
forecasting and strong banking and
equity relationships assist the Group
in managing liquidity.
2009 Performance
Reduced commodity prices and lower
sales volumes led to a reduction of
28% in operating cash flow in 2009.
The operating cash flow and equity
placing proceeds facilitated capital
investment of £758 million in 2009.
Total Shareholder Return
(TSR)
99%
Aim
Our aim is to create shared
prosperity for all stakeholders and
our strategic objective is to achieve
top quintile TSR growth versus our
industry peer group.
Measurement
TSR – share price movement and
dividend payments – is reported
monthly and on an annual basis at
year-end to the Board. The industry
peer group is regularly reviewed.
Risk management
The Board is responsible for the
execution of Tullow’s strategy and it
is reviewed annually as part of three
year business planning. Being a well
run business, delivering well against
business plans, being open and
transparent and maintaining strong
capital market relationships
underpin delivery of TSR.
2009 Performance
The stretch target relating to the
bonus element for TSR is based
on top quartile performance and
an absolute return of 15% or more.
In 2009, Tullow was third out of a
16 strong peer group and delivered
99% TSR. As a result the bonus
element relating to this KPI
was achieved.
Cash operating costs per boe
£7.28per boe
Aim
Cash operating costs per barrel of oil
equivalent (boe) are a function of
industry costs, inflation, our fixed
cost base and production output. We
aim to maintain these costs within
strict predefined limits.
Measurement
Cash operating costs are reported
monthly on an asset basis and are
monitored closely to ensure that they
are within preset parameters.
Risk management
A comprehensive annual budgeting
process covering all expenditure is
undertaken and approved by the
Board. Monthly reporting highlights
any variances and corrective action is
taken to mitigate against the
potential effects of cost increases.
2009 Performance
In 2009, Tullow set a baseline target
of £7.90 per boe and a stretch target
of £7.51 per boe. Cash operating
costs for 2009 were £7.28 per boe
and the bonus element relating to
this KPI was achieved.

quintile growth
Exploration success and consistent delivery in major projects
has transformed Tullow into Africa’s leading independent oil
company. Big projects bring big responsibilities and we want
to fulfil our role in the long-term sustainable development
of Africa.
Chief Executive’s review 22
2009 was a great year for Tullow and we are clear on our
business plans for the next three years. We have never been
in a better position to grow and take on new opportunities and
we look forward to 2010 with confidence and excitement.
Our strategy 24
Our objective is to deliver top quintile TSR in our industry
peer group. Tullow ranks number one over a five year period
with 802% TSR and number three for 2009 with TSR of 99%.
Our markets and industry 25
Initial indications for the industry in 2010 are positive as demand
for oil is expected to rise as the global economy recovers.
Our approach to exploration and production 26
Exploration and appraisal success is built on teamwork,
scientific follow-through and strong relationships with partners
and governments. Production and development monetise
resources as quickly as possible and this focus is expected
to result in first oil from the Jubilee field in record time.
3 22 Tullow Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Accounts
Chief Executive’s review
Directors’ Report: Business review
Tullow continues to develop a
business that creates value through
combining high-impact exploration
with lower-risk appraisal and growing
production; underpinned by a well
funded capital structure.
Becoming Africa’s leading independent oil company
Tullow has a long history in Africa. We know
and understand the continent well which is rich in
under-explored petroleum basins that offer material
upside potential. We acquired our first licences
in Senegal in 1985 and over the last decade the
continent has been the major focus of our activity.
We have put our energy and capital into exploring,
appraising and developing significant resources
in Africa and are well advanced towards first
commercial production from major new basins
in Ghana and Uganda. We are well organised in
Africa and have 50 licences in 16 countries,
spanning 130,000 sq km. We have key production
and development assets in seven countries, 338
employees, five business units, a main office
in Cape Town and regional offices for our major
developments in Accra and Kampala.
Big projects bring with them
big responsibilities and we are
determined to make a major
contribution to building in-country
capacity and developing indigenous
enterprise.This role fits well with
our entrepreneurial spirit and
our values.
Aidan Heavey
Chief Executive Officer www.tullowoil.com 23
Directors’ Report: Business review
Doing business inatransparentandethicalway
Our longevity and experience means we know how to
do business in Africa in a transparent and ethical way.
We also understand the management of associated
risks. We have major project teams in Ghana and
Uganda who, together with our partners, complete
ongoing risk analysis and reporting. Our African
exploration team champion and develop exploration
opportunities within a competitive global capital
allocation process. We are always challenging
where the greatest opportunities are and as a
result we continue to de-risk our African portfolio
with material discoveries.
There is potential during operations to damage the
ecosystems and biodiversity that often underpins
the sources of food and the livelihoods of local
communities. The open, detailed and transparent
approach we took in Ghana to the EIA, together with
our investment in the development of 21
st
Century
operations, exemplify how seriously we take this
challenge in developing our operations in Africa.
Embracingbigprojects andbigresponsibilities
Our reputation is built on trust, respect, transparency
and strong business ethics. To us it is a key business
enabler . It creates the opportunity for us, for example,
to work closely with the Ugandan Government to gain
their approval for the pre-emption of the Heritage
interests in the Lake Albert Rift Basin, in parallel
with a farmdown of up to two-thirds of the combined
assets to leading industry partners. This process is
now well advanced and we fully expect to agree an
aligned and accelerated basin-wide development
plan this year.
Tullow’s role in the development of two major new oil
provinces gives us a significant position in laying the
foundations for the long-term development of social
and economic capacity and avoiding ‘the curse of oil’.
Through human resource initiatives and training, we
are developing in-country skills and have specific
localisation recruitment policies. In our wider supply
chain we work with local businesses and suppliers to
help them to develop in-country services that Tullow
and the industry will require. Given the scale of our
investment in Africa, over £2 billion in three years
including 2010, we can, and do, exert influence over
our supplier base and how large multinational
suppliers set-up their operations in-country.
Being entrepreneurial is a core value for Tullow and
it is important that other businesses and enterprises
develop alongside our operations. We recognise that
there is always more work to do and in particular in
our contribution and role in social enterprise and
community development.
Managing our operating environment
To function as a business we must have a very
outward looking perspective. We take account of
what our owners, partners, governments, employees,
communities and related social groups are saying
to us. A large part of my role is to ensure that the
environment in which Tullow needs to operate and
prosper is working. Together with Tullow’s Executive
Directors we dedicate a lot of time interacting with our
key stakeholders and have developed strong internal
resources in areas such as Investor Relations,
Human Resources, Internal Communications
and, more recently, External Affairs.
Creatingsharedprosperity
A key responsibility of our new External Affairs
function is to develop an aligned long-term approach
to corporate responsibility activities to underpin and
define all we do in this very important aspect of our
business. This approach will work in partnership
with all our stakeholders to ensure that the oil and
gas resources we manage act as a positive catalyst
for new opportunities and economic development,
creating shared prosperity.
Building a winning team
African cultures are very people centric and this we
feel gives us a natural affinity with Africa. At the heart
of Tullow are our people. We are continuously building
‘best in class’ resources and skill sets across the
Group. We have an exceptional exploration team
and a great portfolio of assets for them to work on.
Our development team has created the benchmark
for deepwater development in Ghana and are now
looking to accelerate plans to develop another
world-class basin in Uganda. We have an experienced
production team with a strong track record of adeptly
maximising production output who are looking forward
to contributing to the management of our growing
production profile. We not only build very strong
internal teams, but it is our ability to bring groups
of companies to work together which means
we can consistently deliver on each challenge
and milestone.
Having clear business plans
We are clear on our business plans for the next three
years. These are developed from our strategy and are
closely aligned with continuing to build a business
that delivers top quintile growth. Our strategy
and business model are outlined on page 24.
Our 2010-2012 business plans are:
1. Deliver Jubilee Phase 1 first oil, production ramp up
and assess all subsequent phases of development
in Ghana;
2. In Uganda, agree an aligned accelerated basin-wide
development plan over the next 12 months, followed
by delivery of first commercial oil and first
commercial power in 2011; 24 Tullow Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Accounts

Directors’ Report: Business review
Rebalancing our business
Increased scale and rapid growth requires us to
adjust and evolve aspects of our business model.
It is an inevitable consequence of our success and
it now sees Tullow transition from a singular focus
and investment in exploration and appraisal to building
up a more appropriate production profile for a Group
of our size. We are rebalancing our business so that
we can continue to fund a very active exploration
programme with an aligned production output and
operating cash flow. Our goal is to have a business
that is capable of spending US$500 million per
annum on exploration and appraisal. This provides
the platform for us to continue to grow and create
new opportunities.
Achieving our strategic objective
In 2009, TSR for Tullow was 99% representing a top
quintile performance versus our peer group and the
14

Challenging markets and industry backdrop
There are some signs that major world economies
are emerging from recession. Equity markets have
improved but remain volatile. Commodity markets
improved over the course of 2009 and Brent Crude
moved from a low of US$39/bbl in February to a high
of US$79/bbl in December 2009. The weakening of
the US Dollar was another notable trend for most
of 2009, with the Sterling/US Dollar rate reaching
a high of £/US$1.70 in August 2009. Our business
plans aim to achieve an appropriate return over the
long run, even in low price environments but sharp
movements can lead to short-term volatility in
earnings as demonstrated in our 2009 results.
In 2009, the uncertain economic outlook, coupled
with weak commodity pricing at the start of the year,
led to delays or postponements in price sensitive
capital expenditure. Lower cash flows forced industry
peers to preserve capital and focus primarily on
development rather than exploration expenditure.
This improved in the second half as commodity
pricing recovered and most oil-field equipment
and services costs fell. Early in 2009, we put in
place a strong financial strategy which delivered
over £3 billion of funding over the course of a year.
Initial indications for the industry in 2010 appear
positive as demand is expected to rise as the global
economy recovers. Longer-term oil supply may
struggle to keep up with future demand and a
growing consensus is that demand in developed
economies has peaked and non-OECD countries
will drive future demand.
The industry cost picture is more complex. Highly
specialised equipment leased on long-term contracts,
such as deepwater rigs, largely retain their value but
the cost of most general equipment and services has
fallen to create a lower cost environment. Delivering
current development projects on time and within
budget remains a key focus for Tullow.
Well capitalised companies, as we now are, retain
financial and operational flexibility, enabling us to
maximise value. Corporate activity is strong and
limited opportunities to access frontier acreage
creates intense competition for these assets. 26 Tullow Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Accounts
Our approach to exploration and production
Directors’ Report: Business review
A fully integrated approach to our business with strong teamwork,
appropriate technology and an entrepreneurial culture is enabling
us to deliver extraordinary results from our Exploration and
Appraisal and Production and Development teams.
Exploration and Appraisal (E&A) and Production and
Development (P&D) are two critical parts of Tullow’s
business. In E&A we explore for oil and gas resources
using geographical and geophysical expertise and
technologies, balancing high-risk exploration drilling
with lower-risk appraisal. In P&D we develop and
produce these discovered resources, growing our
revenue to fund our annual exploration programme.
Tullow’s E&A and P&D teams use a simple, formula
for maximum performance. The reasons behind their
outstanding results are a combination of strong
teamwork, the right technology for each job and
a genuinely entrepreneurial culture.
We strive to ensure that the E&A and P&D teams
are fully and seamlessly embedded into the Group’s
overall business development and growth objectives.
This is co-ordinated at Group level through the Board
and Executive team, who consider the overall capital
and resource allocation and adjust the balance
between the pace of exploration, appraisal,
development and production campaigns with
a view to maximising shareholder value.

Directors’ Report: Business review
Tullow’s strategy enables bold exploration led-growth. By combining
geological insight, teamwork, focus and a lot of experience, we reduce
risk and create significant value by discovering nature’s hidden oil.
To do this well we don’t follow the pack, we try and lead it.
Angus McCoss, Exploration Director
Our performance in exploration is marked by
notable and consistent success. There’s no secret to
it. It is down to teamwork. Strong exploration teams
are built on a basis of openness, trust and creativity.
They are equipped with the most appropriate and
often highly innovative technology, have vast and
diverse experience and a clear geological focus.
This is what makes us different, what gives us an
edge. In a sense, this is Tullow’s unique selling point.
Utilising our collective skills and integrating them
for maximum performance, has led us directly
to major discoveries such as those in Ghana
and Uganda.
The right technology at the right time
In applying our scientific approach Tullow draws on
another key determinant of success – applying the
right technologies at the right time. We select the best
methods and tools at each point of the exploration
cycle from new venture identification through seismic
acquisition, processing and interpretation to precise
well location and drilling methods. We continuously
scrutinise our exploration portfolio selecting only the
best leads to be matured into prospects before being
drilled. Typically only the top 10% of the prevailing
lead inventory will be drilled in any year .
Geology before geography
Only 0.5% of the surface of the earth has readily
movable oil or gas beneath it. To target only the
highest value quartile of this tiny ‘oil patch’, we limit
ourselves to exploring less than 0.125% of the earth’s
surface. This is a tough challenge and one which is
best tackled through scientific methods.
Putting geology before geography means we focus
on building prospective acreage positions and
strengthening our business relationships in areas with
well-founded potential for oil. For Tullow, this means
we focus on three core play types and we leverage
our capabilities in those plays across the world. The
Group has 200 to 300 leads and prospects, covering
all stages of evaluation from initial screening through
to delivering commercial discoveries. Each of the core
plays is proven to have first class potential and each
comes with its particular value and challenges.
• Stratigraphic traps can have exceptional upside
and often lie subtly within held acreage. We
are developing proven expertise in this play and
in particular in the vast potential that lies in the
Equatorial Atlantic regions of West Africa and
South America.
Exploration and Appraisal
• Rift basins are a fundamentally rich setting
for petroleum exploration and benefit
from excellent source rocks and generally
straightforward structural geology. Tullow has
gained extensive expertise in this core play,
mainly in Uganda.
• Salt basins – Salt is a first class seal and salt
tectonics form a rich diversity of Salt Basin trap
types. Tullow’s seismic acquisition, processing
and interpretation expertise in Salt Basins provides
a tangible competitive advantage, which we are
applying to our acreage in Mauritania and Senegal.
None of us is as smart as all of us
Ultimately oil is found through creative teamwork.
When recruiting and developing staff, we emphasise
skills in play-making, prospecting and appraising.
We also encourage and develop those who have
particular technical expertise to deepen their skills,
ensuring Tullow stays at the leading-edge of industry
practice. While Tullow values and fosters individual
creativity in prospecting, this is amplified by
imaginative teamwork and thorough scientific
evaluation by multi-disciplinary teams. We extend
our teams to include partners in the industry and
governments, whose independent approach, local
knowledge and basin-wide perspectives make a
valuable contribution to exploration success.
Learning from experience
Oil and gas exploration always carries a significant
risk of failure. But in this industry any failure helps
us to become better . There is no blame or shame in
a dry-hole, provided that it was drilled for the right
reasons, after due scientific process gave a green
light. Even the latest and the best technology and
methods, such as advanced 3D seismic, cannot
completely remove geological risks. This is especially
the case when geological risks in new basins
can only be calibrated by referring to distant wells.
And they can be very distant. For example, Tullow’s
successful Venus-B well in Sierra Leone was 1,100
km from the nearest comparable discovery, in
deepwater Ghana. Without these challenges, finding
oil and gas would be easy. But such challenges,
along with our occasional failures, help us to better
understand the geological plays and the technology
and methods we use, and to hone our interpretation
skills. We learn equally from discoveries and from
dry-holes. Planning and decisions are guided by
the understanding that we garner in the course
of both experiences. Our approach to exploration and production continued
Directors’ Report: Business review
Equally, what we decide not to do is often what sets
us apart from the rest of the industry. Tullow’s
successes in the Equatorial Atlantic are firmly based
on our focus on Upper Cretaceous turbidites, whilst
most of the industry concentrated on the younger
Tertiary turbidite prospects elsewhere.
Building and developing exploration capability
Our capability owes a great deal to the way in which
we can attract and retain people. The combination of
our track record and our reputation for exciting and
challenging geological projects makes us an attractive
employer for some of the most experienced playmakers
and prospectors in the industry today. The best
geoscientists are independent thinkers who are also
great team players and that’s why they feel at home
with Tullow. Our Global Exploration Leadership Team
(GELT) of 15 leading explorers has over 300 years
experience and oversees the overall management
of our exploration initiatives and ultimately decides
which prospects will be drilled.
The team comprises two distinct elements which
operate in a kind of critical tension, given their
competing yet complementary responsibilities.
There are regional exploration managers who work
closely with the regional business units. There are
portfolio managers for exploration, technology
and new ventures, along with industry specialists.
Their function is to assist, challenge and assure,
as appropriate, in regard to technical, commercial
and financial considerations.
Essentially, this means we get a rigorous and
objective exploration process which sifts out
weaker leads and concentrates on the most
promising opportunities.
Our ability to achieve timely commercialisation of our
hydrocarbon resources requires us to identify very
clearly what assets merit development and which
are better suited to dilution or sale. This ensures
that our exploration success, which has resulted
in very significant growth in hydrocarbon resources,
translates into long-term value for our shareholders.
Unique culture delivers strong results
Tullow’s unique culture has reaped benefits for
the Group and has helped harness co-operation and
knowledge from industry partners and contractors.
Ghana’s Jubilee deepwater development exemplifies
the success of this approach. The field has delivered
a new industry benchmark, with the first oil expected
in just over three years from discovery of this field.
Elsewhere, our new deepwater well engineering
team has been independently ranked as the top
performing team in West Africa deepwater.
A team approach at all times
We believe that the team approach which has
served Tullow so well in recent years can deliver
outstanding results in many of the partnerships in
which we are involved and where others operate
assets on our behalf.
For example, in many projects involving in-fill wells
and incremental developments we contribute ideas
to ensure that the capital we spend is used as
efficiently as possible. This is the case in relation
to the Banda gas field in Mauritania where many
of our ideas have been taken on board by both the
operator and by the national government. Similarly ,
in Namibia we are working as a team combining
the skills of the upstream, downstream and power
companies, along with the government, to
commercialise the Kudu gas field.
Developing local skills and content
Developing local skills and content is just as
important as developing local oil and gas fields.
In Ghana and Uganda, Tullow works in partnership
with government on a variety of development projects.
In Ghana, for example, we have trained staff from the
national oil company and worked with the maritime
agency to help local fisherman whilst protecting
new offshore assets. In Uganda, we have sponsored
projects to educate people in the Lake Albert area
about sustainable fishing practices, swimming,
lifesaving skills and health training. New roads
and transport links will also benefit the region.
Managing the environment
Our approach to the environmental impact of
our operations is simple and exacting. At a bare
minimum, it is our policy that there should be no
net loss in environmental terms wherever we work.
We also strive for a net gain over the course of our
involvement in any given area. This means very careful
planning and using a range of alternative options
28 Tullow Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Accounts
In P&D we work to ensure that Tullow’s exploration success translates
into long-term value for shareholders and the countries in which we operate.
In 2010, we are driving towards first oil in Ghana and considerable effort
will be focused on developing our assets in Uganda.
Paul McDade, Chief Operating Officer
Production and Development Directors’ Report: Business review
and solutions so that we can protect, sustain
and contribute to environmental management
wherever Tullow is active.
Environmental concerns are a core component
of Tullow’s values and are absolutely central to
our current and future success. Environmental and
Social Impact Assessments (ESIA’s) are produced by
independent consultants in order to ensure a robust
and comprehensive account of the potential effects of
our activities. Our overall strategy for environmental
management is a key element within our business
model and has been independently certified to the
internationally recognised ISO 14001 standard.
In addition, core parts of our published data are
independently assessed and assured. Ultimately,
we strive to ensure that our mitigation and
preventative strategies effectively minimise
our environmental impact.
Safe working and continuous learning
As Tullow has grown we have always tried ensure
that the health and safety of our workers, and of those
around us, is never compromised. We formed an EHS
Leadership Team comprising senior managers who
have daily responsibility in this area. The integrated
nature of this working group means that best
practices are shared and implemented right across
all of our operations.
In 2009, the EHS leadership team introduced
new initiatives such as operational management
commitment statements, where each member
states how they plan to deliver a safe working
environment for their staff and stakeholders.
A new EHS training programme has been designed
and launched and will roll out to 110 managers
across the Group during 2010.
We also learn lessons when things go wrong.
In 2009, Tullow had its first fatality with the
tragic death of a subcontractor working
for Tullow in Bangladesh. We immediately launched
initiates to identify improvements in practice
across the Group. Over 85% of our staff attended a
Tullow-wide workshop devoted to learning lessons
from this tragic accident. Further information on
our response is on page 73 of this report.
Value creation through focused commercialisation
Whilst Tullow has continued to increase its capital
expenditure on development and production, with
around £600 million planned in 2010, the discipline
of high-grading assets for development at the
appropriate equity participation level ensures
capital is used efficiently along with available
human resources. By diluting or selling equity
in other assets, we aim to ensure these are also
commercialised in a timely manner . This high-grading
process is also applied to incremental investments in
producing assets so that they attract the correct level
of investment to deliver optimal reserves recovery
and production levels.
In 2010, we will continue to drive towards first oil
in Ghana in the fourth quarter and considerable effort
will be focused on developing world-class discoveries
around Lake Albert in Uganda. As in Ghana, Tullow’s
approach in Uganda is collaborative, involving all
partners and our host government. This will harness
the full range of skills and experience to ensure the
best long-term commercialisation in this
environmentally sensitive area.

Directors’ Report: Business review
Uganda
2009 has been another landmark year for Tullow
in Uganda. The discovered resource base is now in
excess of 800 million barrels of oil and the first phase
of development has commenced, targeting gas to
power and first commercial oil production in 2011.
In addition, through a series of ongoing transactions,
Tullow is in the process of aligning equity interests
across the basin to accelerate development.
Strong partnership to accelerate basin development
In October 2009, Tullow commenced a transparent
farm-down process to sell a proportion of its
interests in Blocks 1, 2 and 3A in the Lake Albert
Rift Basin. The purpose of this process is to bring
in experienced and like-minded partners with
downstream expertise in order to deliver an
accelerated basin-wide development. The process
attracted strong interest from a number of major
international and national oil companies who visited
Tullow’s data rooms and Ugandan operations and
made representations to the Government of Uganda.
On 23 November 2009 Heritage Oil Plc, Tullow’s
partner in the basin and operator of Blocks 1 and 3A,
announced its intention to sell its entire Ugandan
interests to a third party. On 17 January 2010, Tullow
chose to exercise its pre-emption rights on this
deal and on 2 February 2010 a formal request was
submitted to the Government to approve the transfer
of the assets involved to Tullow. The acquisition price
is up to US$1.5 billion.
Tullow continues to work closely with the Government
to gain approval for pre-emption of the Heritage deal
in parallel with the farm-down process which is now
at an advanced stage. Two new potential partners
have been identified, CNOOC and Total, and it is
expected that following completion of the deal each
partner will hold a one third interest in each of the
three blocks. Presentations by all parties have been
made to the relevant Ugandan authorities and Tullow
expects the transactions to be signed in the coming
weeks. This will result in a unified partnership with
considerable experience and the financial capability
to enable Uganda to become a significant oil
producing nation.
Significant discoveries made during the year
In 2009, Tullow continued its exploration and appraisal
campaign in Uganda in order to prove up further
resources and gain a good understanding of the
resource distribution across the basin. Exploration
drilling activities during the year focused mainly on
the Butiaba area but also included the Ngassa-2 well
in Kaiso-Tonya. In 2009, the Group drilled nine wells
and total contingent resources for the basin are now
in excess of 800 million barrels. Tullow is confident
that the basin has the potential to deliver significant
additional resources with over 1.5 billion barrels
awaiting discovery.
Tullow has now gained a good understanding of the
Butiaba region of Blocks 1 and 2 where a high number
of exploration wells and detailed seismic and gravity
imaging have significantly de-risked the remaining
prospectivity. Six of the seven wells drilled in this
region during the year encountered oil: Giraffe-1,
Karuka-2, Nsoga-1, Kigogole-3, Wahrindi-1 and
Ngara-1. The Giraffe-1 well in particular proved to be
transformational as it confirmed the Buffalo-Giraffe
field (subsequently renamed Jobi-Rii) to be a 300
million barrel discovery. The field has significant
further upside which is to be drilled in 2010.
Awaka-1, the only dry well drilled in Uganda during
the year, encountered a new sand fairway but was
unsuccessful in finding hydrocarbons. However,
it effectively delineated the edge of a key geological
play in this region.
Drilling activities in the Butiaba area were
supplemented by leading edge subsurface imaging
technologies. The largest Full Tensor Gravity
Gradiometry (FTG) survey ever carried out in Africa
was acquired during the year. FTG is a specialist
technology ideally suited for imaging near-basement
reservoirs. This survey has been integrated with
regional 2D seismic data using techniques developed
by Tullow’s geoscientists and technology partners.
This technology is being successfully used to improve
definition of the Butiaba fields and prospects in 3D,
at a fraction of the cost and time required for a

regional 3D seismic survey. In addition, a low-impact
weight-drop 3D seismic campaign was successfully
trialled over the Kasamene and Wahrindi discoveries.
The trials proved the technology to be robust, quicker
and cheaper than conventional seismic equipment
and with a much lower environmental impact.
In the Kaiso-Tonya area, the Mputa-5 appraisal well
was drilled and successfully tested at a stable flow
rate of 950 bopd in March 2009. The well results
validated the state of the art seismic modelling
techniques used to identify and target ‘sweet-spots’
in the reservoir. This technology will be deployed
throughout the Butiaba area.
The near-shore Ngassa-2 well, located in Block 2,
commenced drilling in March 2009 from an onshore
location. The well reached a total depth of 3,822 metres
and encountered an over-pressured interval indicating
the potential for a significant oil column which could
cover an area in excess of 150 sq km. This discovery
has the potential to be the largest in the basin to
date. Further drilling from offshore locations will be
required to test multiple prospects and appraise the
expansive Ngassa structure. Tullow expects to make
a commitment to offshore drilling infrastructure in
the first half of 2010.
Exploration and appraisal drilling recommenced
in January 2010, following a planned three month
break. The first well was the Kasamene appraisal
well, Kasamene-2, which successfully confirmed an
oil column in excess of 70 metres and a gas column
of over 20 metres. The well has been suspended as
a future producer and will be part of the Phase 1
Lake Albert Rift Basin development.
A programme of 10 further exploration and appraisal
wells is scheduled to commence in April utilising
two land rigs which will also trial development
drilling techniques. Material prospectivity around
the Jobi-Rii field will be targeted in Block 1 as
well as key appraisal wells in Block 2 in advance
of development.
Phased basin-wide development commenced
Following significant exploration success in 2009
and the progress made in forming a new aligned
partnership, the focus is now on delivering an
accelerated development programme. Tullow is
working with the Government of Uganda on clearly
defining the phases of development. Phase 1 is
already under way.
Lake Albert Phase 1: This involves the development
in Block 2 of the Nzizi gas field, to fuel a regional
thermal power station, and the Kasamene oil field
for industrial consumption within Uganda.
Tullow has embarked on FEED studies to develop the
Nzizi gas field to supply gas to a new-build thermal
power plant which will be built in the Hoima District. 36 Tullow Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Accounts
Operations review: Africa continued
Directors’ Report: Business review
The discovery will be appraised during the second
quarter of 2010 and then developed to supply gas to
the power plant. Both the field and power plant will
come onstream by the end of 2011. The power plant
is being designed to accept both gas and crude
to ensure long-term supply.
Detailed development planning for the Kasamene
field commenced in the second half of 2009 and
FEED studies are currently under way. It is expected
that a Plan of Development will be submitted to the
Government of Uganda by mid-2010 for approval and
subsequent project sanction. Production from this
field is expected to commence by the end of 2011.
The oil will initially be transported by truck and later
by pipeline to a central gathering and distribution
hub for onward transportation to domestic and
regional markets. Initial production capacity is
expected to be around 10,000 bopd with the facilities
capable of modular expansion, as further phases
of the basin development are brought onstream.
An extended well testing programme is planned
to support development planning of Kasamene and
subsequent fields, and to supplement the appraisal
drilling planned for 2010. This programme, which is
focused on gathering essential dynamic production
data and testing proposed production systems,
will commence in mid-2010, starting with the
Kasamene field. The crude oil produced from
the testing operations will be used to supply fuel
to local industrial users and provide the first
domestically produced oil in sub-Saharan East
Africa. The appraisal drilling and well testing
will be complemented by in-fill 2D and 3D
seismic acquisition.
Beyond Phase 1: The first objective of the new
proposed partnership will be to agree a basin-wide
development plan that will encompass the production
of the northern and southern fields via an integrated
infrastructure. Production levels could exceed
200,000 bopd and would supply a local refinery
and allow export of surplus crude to regional
and international markets. The proposed Phase
1 development will provide essential subsurface
and production data to support this basin-wide
development plan.
Congo (DRC)
Tullow has interests in two Congo (DRC) licences
adjacent to its Ugandan acreage on Lake Albert.
Following the award of the licences in 2006, the
validity of the award was disputed in 2008. Tullow
continues to work closely with the Government
of Congo (DRC) and is confident of its title to the
licences and the integrity of the award process.
Tullow expects the President of Congo (DRC)
to ratify the contracts in the near future.
Uganda production could exceed
200,000bopd
A basin-wide development plan is expected to be agreed
with partners. Production levels supplying a local refinery
and export could ultimately exceed 200,000 bopd.

Directors’ Report: Business review
Ghana and Equatorial Atlantic
Tullow’s position in the Equatorial Atlantic region
offshore West Africa incorporates 11 blocks covering
four countries: Sierra Leone, Liberia, Côte d’Ivoire
and Ghana. In total the Group has prospective acreage
over an area of approximately 24,000 sq km stretching
along 1,100 km of coastline.
2009 has been another very successful year in this
region for Tullow. The Group drilled six exploration
and appraisal wells of which five encountered
hydrocarbons. Successful wells included the
discovery of the significant Tweneboa oil and
gas-condensate field and the Venus-1 well, which
proved the extension of the Jubilee play significantly
westwards. In addition, excellent progress was made
on the Phase 1 Jubilee development project which
remains on budget and on schedule for first oil
in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Major exploration and appraisal success in Ghana
Following the successful Mahogany-3 appraisal
well in the West Cape Three Points licence at the
end of 2008, an exploratory appraisal programme
in the south-eastern part of the Greater Jubilee
area commenced in October 2009. To date, the
Mahogany-4 and Mahogany Deep-2 wells have been
drilled. Both encountered significant oil reservoirs and
highlighted further prospectivity to the south and east.
The total gross resource base for the Greater Jubilee
Area is considered to range from 600 mmbo (P90)
through a most likely 1,200 mmbo (P50) to an upside
1,800 mmbo (P10). Interpretation of the recent
appraisal and development drilling results has
however enabled Tullow to better define the resource
estimates for the Jubilee Unit Area within these
gross resource estimates. The Jubilee Unit Area
is considered to have a gross resource base of 500
mmbo (P90) through a most likely 700 mmbo (P50)
to an upside of 1,000 mmbo (P10). This resource
base will be developed in several phases, of which
Phase 1 is under way with first oil expected in the
fourth quarter of 2010.
The remainder of the Greater Jubilee potential is to
the southeast and includes the Sapele and Dahoma
satellite exploration prospects. The next stage of
exploratory appraisal in the south-eastern area
commenced in February 2010 with the spudding
of the Dahoma-1 well. This will be followed by
Mahogany-5 in April.
In March 2009, the Tweneboa-1 exploration well in
the Deep Water Tano block, targeting a 200 sq km
turbidite fan complex, discovered a significant light
hydrocarbon accumulation. The first appraisal well,
Tweneboa-2, was drilled six km southeast of the
discovery well in January 2010 and proved up a
combined oil and gas-condensate column of at least
350 metres. This has confirmed Tweneboa as a
major oil and gas-condensate field with potential
to yield significant volumes of condensate and
light oil. Gross resource volume estimates for the
Tweneboa-Owo-Ntomme fan complex have been
revised upwards to 100 mmboe (P90) through
a most likely 400 mmboe (P50) to an upside
of 1,400 mmboe (P10).
The success at Tweneboa is being followed up by
an accelerated exploration and appraisal drilling
programme in 2010 which will include a flow test.
The first wells will be the Owo-1 exploration well
and Tweneboa-3 which will target the Ntomme lobe
in the southeast of the fan.
In November 2009 the Odum discovery was
successfully appraised by the Odum-2 well.
This accumulation will likely be developed as
a satellite to further discoveries in the area.
Following the reprocessing of the high resolution 3D
seismic acquired in 2008, significant prospectivity has
been identified in the West Cape Three Points licence
east of the Greater Jubilee Area. Detailed seismic
interpretation is ongoing in order to optimise the drilling
location for a strategic exploration well in this area.
The Ghana prospect inventory, plus the
discovered resources in the Greater Jubilee Area
and Tweneboa-Owo-Ntomme amount to a gross
upside potential of over 4.5 billion boe.

Excellent progress on Jubilee Phase 1 development
The Jubilee Phase 1 development project continues
to meet key project milestones, is on track for first oil
in the fourth quarter of 2010 and remains within its
US$3.1 billion budget. The project will produce first
oil approximately 40 months after the field was
discovered, a new benchmark for global deep water
developments. Significant regulatory milestones
were also achieved in 2009 including the formal
approval by the Government of Ghana of the Jubilee
Plan of Development, the signing of the Field
Unitisation Agreement and the approval of the
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). Further
development phases, to access the significant
resource potential of the Jubilee Unit Area, up
to 1,000 mmbo, are now being prepared and
will include further infill wells, additional subsea
systems and reviewing the possibility of increasing
the capacity of the Floating, Production, Storage
and Offloading vessel (FPSO).
Good progress was made on the FPSO construction
in Singapore during 2009. All process modules and
the external turret have now been installed and
module integration and commissioning work is
ongoing. Fabrication of the subsea equipment
including manifolds, risers, flowlines and control
umbilicals was completed in 2009 and installation
work commenced in January 2010. The FPSO is
scheduled to leave Singapore for Ghana in the
second quarter of 2010 and will be connected to
the subsea network during the fourth quarter of 2010.
Phase 1 development includes nine production wells
which are expected to produce at a plateau rate of
120,000 bopd. Pressure support will be provided by
six water injection wells and two gas injection wells.
The wells are being drilled and completed by the
Eirik Raude semi submersible rig. Operations to
date have been on time and on budget with 16 wells
drilled and the installation of production tubing
and completion equipment now under way.
Well completion operations, expected to take
approximately 15 months, commenced in February
2010. Well results continue to be in line with pre-drill
expectations. Well testing has proven deliverability
in excess of 20,000 bopd per well and reservoir
connectivity over distances exceeding six kilometres.
Gas produced during oil production will initially be
re-injected to provide pressure support for production.
An export project to deliver gas to shore for power
generation is however under consideration by GNPC.
It is expected that in the longer term, the Jubilee
field will supply approximately 70% of its associated
gas to this scheme.
Jubilee play extended
In the first half of 2009, Tullow farmed-in to three
blocks in Liberia and two blocks in Sierra Leone,
significantly expanding the Group’s exposure to
the Jubilee play in the West African Equatorial
Atlantic region. This was immediately followed
by the acquisition of 6,000 sq km of high quality
3D seismic data, one of the largest surveys ever
recorded. The results are currently being interpreted
to high-grade a comprehensive prospect inventory
which includes a large number of Jubilee-type
stratigraphic traps. In September, Tullow participated
in the Venus-B1 exploration well in Sierra Leone,
the first ever deepwater well in the Liberian basin.
The well encountered hydrocarbons and proved
a working petroleum system with geological
characteristics analogous to those offshore Ghana.
These well results have been integrated with
the Liberian seismic data to calibrate this highly
prospective deepwater acreage. Three wells are
planned on this acreage in the second half of 2010.
In Côte d’Ivoire, the South Grand Lahou-1 well,
chasing the Jubilee play, was drilled in the CI-105
licence in October 2009. It encountered the targeted
reservoir sands on prognosis but found them
water-bearing at this location. The data gained
is however providing valuable proprietary insights

3.5 years from discovery to first oil
In 2007, based on the results of the first two exploration wells, the Jubilee field partners
and the Government of Ghana jointly took the early decision to proceed with the development
of the Jubilee field. An Integrated Project Team (IPT) was rapidly assembled, bringing together
major deepwater skills and experience from across the partnership. In parallel, Tullow quickly
developed a deepwater development drilling capability and a total of 16 wells have been
drilled to date. First oil is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2010, representing a record
time from discovery to delivery of major deepwater production.
Supporting people
and the environment
Tullow’s EHS performance in Ghana
is excellent with only two lost time
incidents in 2.1 million hours worked
and no major environmental incidents.
Our EHS policy sets out the standards
and expectations to manage key
EHS risks in our operations and,
as an example, a comprehensive
Environmental Impact Assessment
(EIA) was carried out during 2009
including wide public consultation of
stakeholders. Key components of the
EIA include environmental monitoring,
waste management, oil spill contingency
planning and community engagement
and investment.

4. Facilities delivery
Accelerating construction
and delivery deadlines
By delivering first oil in the fourth quarter of 2010, the project
will have realised production in just 3½ years from discovery.
This achievement is a reflection of the confidence and
commitment by all partners to invest based on discovery
and appraisal well results alone.
A highly experienced project team, comprised of personnel
from the main partners including Tullow, Anadarko Petroleum
and led by Technical Operator Kosmos Energy, has set out to
deliver a quality outcome in record time. Proven contractors have
used proven designs to meet functional rather than truly precise
specifications. This has resulted in some quite dramatic schedule
reductions when benchmarked to general industry performance.
Key contractors involved in the facilities delivery include
MODEC Inc. (FPSO), Technip (flowlines, risers and installation),
and FMC and Aker Solutions.
We have worked very
closely with our contractors
and suppliers to deliver
incredible efficiencies. This
project is an outstanding
achievement by all.

Subsea equipment installation
work commenced in Ghana
in January 2010. A fleet of
14 vessels is directly involved
in shipping and then installing
the flowlines, umbilicals,
controls, manifolds and subsea
wellhead trees. The operation
is being run from the port
of Takoradi-Sekondi in
western Ghana.
The facility installation work
will take up to nine months to
complete including the tie-in
of the FPSO during the third
quarter. This will be followed
by a period of commissioning
of the vessel and subsea
systems in-situ and oil is
expected to start producing
into the facilities in the
fourth quarter.
Production ramp up
Various production ramp up scenarios
have been forecast. Following a period
of testing, production will gradually
increase over approximately six months
to a plateau level of 120,000 bopd.
The ramp up in production thereafter
will depend on the number of wells
from further phases of development
that have been completed and the
FPSO/subsea equipment performance.
Marketing Jubilee crude oil
Jubilee crude oil is light and sweet. Independent laboratory analysis indicates that the crude has an API Gravity
of 37.6 degrees and sulphur content of 0.25 % wt, with no unusual characteristics. Crude oils of this type attract
a wide range of refiners and can be expected to command competitive prices in the market. When producing
at 120,000 bopd, three or four large cargoes will be exported each month and Tullow’s share will be marketed
individually on a cargo by cargo basis.
I am extremely proud
of the in-country team
we have built since 2008.
Tullow’s policy is to
employ as many local
nationals as possible and
currently over 80% of our
employees are Ghanaian
and we expect this to rise
to over 90% by 2013.

Equatorial Guinea
Gross combined production from the Okume
Complex and Ceiba fields averaged approximately
106,000 bopd in 2009. Two rigs drilled five development
wells on the Okume Complex during the year in order
to maintain plateau production. Drilling activities are
expected to continue into the second half of 2010
with nine wells planned. A time-lapse (4-D) seismic
survey is planned for 2010 over both fields to identify
infill targets and optimise well locations.
Gabon
Net production from Tullow’s Gabon assets averaged
12,000 bopd in 2009. During the year Tullow exercised
its back-in rights on the Ebouri and Onal fields thereby
adding 1,200 bopd of net production. Production was
also supported by successful workovers on the Echira
and Niungo fields. Niungo production is expected to
be further enhanced during 2010 with four horizontal
infill wells planned. In total, 39 production wells are
planned on the Group’s Gabon assets in 2010 and
net production is expected to average 12,400 bopd.
Tullow completed the acquisition of a 1,300 sq km
3D seismic survey in the Kiarsseny block and
seismic reprocessing and interpretative work in
the Azobe block where the Noix de Coco prospect
has been identified for drilling in 2010. In February
the Maroc-Nord-1 exploration well discovered 50
metres of net oil pay in an emerging under-explored
stratigraphic trap play which will be brought into the
Onal area development and followed-up through
further exploration and appraisal drilling.
Côte d’Ivoire
Gross production from the East and West Espoir
fields was in line with expectations in 2009, averaging
23,550 boepd. A planned upgrade to the processing
capacity of the FPSO was deferred in 2009 and
is now scheduled for mid-2010. The upgrade will
provide capacity for future incremental production
projects including an infill drilling campaign
planned for 2011/12.
Congo (Brazzaville)
An active reservoir management programme on
the onshore M’Boundi field was initiated in 2008 and
continued throughout 2009 focusing on development
drilling and a water injection upgrade. Utilising six
land rigs, a total of 18 producers and five injection
wells were drilled during the year and the water
injection rate was increased from 46,000 to 60,000
bwipd. Gross field production during 2009 averaged
39,500 bopd. In 2010, the combination of the 35 new
wells and an increase in water injection capacity
to 200,000 bwipd by the end of the second quarter,
is expected to increase gross average production
to 42,000 bopd.
Mauritania and Senegal
Gross production from the offshore Chinguetti
field averaged approximately 10,750 bopd for 2009.
Production has declined in line with expectations
through the year and has recently stabilised due
to high facilities uptime and prudent reservoir
management. Potential for further drilling in 2010
and beyond continues to be evaluated. Work is
ongoing to review the development options that
would allow commercialisation of the Banda gas
field. The development options are currently under
discussion with the Mauritanian Government
to ensure that they meet both partner and
Government objectives.
A planned break in exploration drilling has provided
time to complete a thorough two-year regional basin
and prospectivity review. From this review numerous
plays, leads and prospects have emerged. The new
prospects are unrelated to the established thin
Miocene reservoir plays, such as at Chinguetti,
which were pursued by previous operators and
which proved difficult to develop. Instead, Tullow
is drawing on its Equatorial Atlantic successes
to target high-impact Cretaceous prospectivity.
In Mauritania two exploration wells are planned
for 2010 ahead of further exploration activity
planned for 2011 and 2012.
Tanzania
Tullow has interests in the onshore Lindi and
Mtwara blocks in the frontier Ruvuma Basin in
southern Tanzania. Following interpretation of newly
reprocessed seismic data, Likonde-1 was selected as
the first well to establish the potential of a possible
new oil play fairway. The well commenced drilling in
January 2010 and a result is expected in late March
2010. Further evaluation planned for 2010 includes
reprocessing the seismic dataset and incorporating
and interpreting the new drilling results, the
outcome of which will influence the forward
exploration programme.
Namibia
In Namibia, progress is being made to reinvigorate
the development of the 1.3 tcf offshore Kudu field.
Inter-governmental talks between Russia, Namibia
and South Africa have taken place in an attempt to
move forward the development via a gas-to-power
project. This has resulted in Gazprom announcing
its plans to build an 800 MW power station. Eskom,
the South African power utility, will be the targeted
buyer of electricity that is surplus to Namibia’s
requirements. Tullow fully supports this initiative
to commercialise Kudu gas and is working with
the Ministry, Gazprom and the existing partners
to progress this new initiative. Should this initiative
proceed as planned, Tullow will be Upstream Operator
and will reduce its equity to around 30%.

Directors’ Report: Business review
The Group’s Rest of the World assets form an
important part of Tullow’s business. Gas production
in the UK and South Asia generate strong revenues
and combine low risk exploration prospects and
development opportunities in Europe with high-
impact potential in South America and South Asia.
Europe
Tullow’s well established producing assets lie in
the Southern Gas Basin offshore UK and are centred
around two gas producing hubs, associated fields
and infrastructure. Tullow also has a portfolio of
operated exploration blocks offshore the
Netherlands where it is looking to capitalise on the
exploration success it has experienced in adjacent
UK blocks over the last seven years. In 2009, the
decision was taken to assign the Group’s Portuguese
interests to other licence partners, following
completion of an agreed work programme and
detailed analysis of the results.
UK
Net UK production for 2009 was in line with
expectations at 14,450 boepd (2008: 20,095 boepd).
Several factors were responsible for this 28%
reduction including the sale of Tullow’s Hewett field
interests in 2008, the re-scheduling of in-fill wells
in the CMS Area and natural field decline. EHS
performance and production efficiency were excellent
on the Group’s operated fields throughout the year.
Successful in-fill drilling and well interventions were
completed on Boulton and Murdoch and will help
support future production levels.
In the Thames Area, the modifications to allow
combined flow from the Wissey and Horne & Wren
fields were completed in May 2009, thereby boosting
Thames infrastructure throughput and improving
asset longevity. The Bure North development well
targeted an infill opportunity in the Bure field but
results showed that the reservoir compartment was
depleted by other producing wells in the area and
consequently the well was abandoned.
In the CMS Area, the operated Ketch field performed
above expectation during 2009. During July 2009,
works to tie-in the third-party Topaz development to
the Schooner platform were successfully completed.
Production from this field commenced in November
adding tariff income and reducing unit operating cost
of the field. The KA-08Z infill well on the Ketch field
has been sanctioned and is due to spud in the second
quarter of 2010. Planning and design work is well
advanced and a rig has been secured.
In 2009, three non-operated infill wells were drilled
on the Murdoch and Boulton fields. These wells
added over 100 mmscfd to CMS gross production.
Further infill opportunities are being considered for
2010 including a re-drill of the Boulton B1 well which
ceased production in August following a build-up
of salt in the well bore.
The Harrison discovery provides the most attractive
near term development opportunity in the CMS Area.
Work on this project progressed in 2009 and a Joint
Operating Agreement was signed by the field
partners. Major capital expenditure was deferred
to 2010 and first gas is now expected in 2012.
In addition, the partnership is evaluating drilling
possibilities on the adjacent Cameron prospect.
The scope of the Harrison development is likely
to include the option to tie-in a successful
Cameron discovery.

Bangora field producing at maximum capacity
120mmscfd
Following a successful workover and tie-in carried out during
2009, production from the Bangora gas field has increased to
the maximum capacity of the gas processing facility.
Netherlands
Leveraging on the success and experience gained
in the Carboniferous play of the UK CMS, Tullow
has built an extensive exploration position within
the adjacent Carboniferous province of the Dutch
offshore and is now in a strong position to exploit
this play. In April 2009, Tullow added to the six
operated exploration blocks already held with the
award of Block E11. Tullow and its partners initiated
two major regional 3D seismic reprocessing
programmes in 2009. Over 1,000 sq km of seismic
on the E and D blocks have been included and results
thus far are very encouraging. Exploration drilling is
planned for later in 2010.
Portugal
Tullow holds interests in three blocks in the
Alentejo Basin – Lavagante, Santola and Gamba.
Interpretation of 3,000 km of proprietary 2D seismic
and over 5,000 km of 2D has resulted in a number
of high-risk exploration leads being developed.
Following completion of the agreed work programme
and a detailed evaluation of the full subsurface
dataset in 2009, Tullow plans to assign its interest
in this acreage to other licence partners.
South Asia
The demand for energy in Asian economies
remains strong and this region offers Tullow
excellent growth potential through exploration,
particularly in Pakistan where the Group has a
significant non-operated position.
Bangladesh
Production from the Bangora field increased from
100 to 120 mmscfd, the maximum capacity of the
gas processing facility, following a successful
workover and tie-in of the Bangora-3 well in October
2009. In addition, a Hydrocarbon Dewpoint Control
system is being installed at the Bangora Processing
Facility which will enhance condensate recovery
from the gas stream and deliver full specification
gas to the export pipeline. The system is due to
be commissioned during the first half of 2010.
Elsewhere in Bangladesh, Tullow was awarded
offshore Block SS-08-05 as part of the Third
Licensing Round. Contract negotiations are expected
to be completed in early 2010, thereby enabling the
acquisition of a 2D seismic programme during the
2010/2011 weather window.
Pakistan
As part of a restructuring of the Group’s business
in Pakistan Tullow reached agreement, during 2009,
to dispose of its producing assets and focus on
non-operated exploration activities. In January 2009,
a sale and purchase agreement was signed for the
Chachar field and the field interest was transferred
to Pakistan Petroleum Ltd. In November 2009,
a sale and purchase agreement was signed for
our interests in the Sara/Suri gas fields and
completion of that transaction is subject to
approval from the Government of Pakistan.
The Mesozoic and Tertiary aged Tethys Basin between
Kurdistan and Pakistan forms one of the richest
petroleum provinces in the world and provides Tullow
with access to significant upside potential. Existing
hydrocarbon infrastructure provides a ready link to a
growing regional energy market and creates lucrative
opportunities to quickly monetise discoveries.
Shekhan-1, the first exploration well since the
restructuring of our Pakistan business, commenced
drilling in the Kohat block in November 2009. The
well is designed to test a large thrust anticline and
is expected to reach total depth in late-March 2010.
Based on several significant analogous discoveries
made in the surrounding areas in recent years,
multiple sandstone and limestone reservoir
intervals are being targeted.
Elsewhere in Pakistan, seismic operations are
planned to recommence in the Kalchas block. Results
to date enhance the prospectivity of this block with
confirmation that the surface anticline continues into
the subsurface forming a valid trap at depth.

3D Seismic Survey, French Guiana
The Geo Caribbean seismic vessel acquired 2,500 sq km 3D during 2009/2010.
Tullow’s exposure to high-impact drilling in French Guiana
39.5%
During 2009 Tullow farmed down 33% and a further 25% of its Guyana
Maritime block to Shell and Total respectively where high-risk
stratigraphic traps analogous to Jubilee have been identified.
Directors’ Report: Business review
South America
In South America, Tullow’s main focus is on the
transform margin from Guyana through Suriname
to French Guiana, where the Group is seeking to
replicate the success at Jubilee throughout the
Equatorial Atlantic region. Tullow’s frontier exploration
programmes are being matured with a view to a
high-impact drilling campaign in 2010 and 2011.
French Guiana
Following a complete re-evaluation of the exploration
potential of the extensive (32,500 sq km) Guyane
Maritime block in 2008, the focus of attention shifted
to high-impact leads in the southeast portion of the
block, the ‘Eastern Slope’ play. These leads comprise
high-risk stratigraphic traps analogous to the Jubilee
field offshore Ghana being formed in similarly aged
Upper Cretaceous turbidite fans.
To de-risk the prospectivity and delineate drilling
targets, a 2,500 sq km 3D seismic survey commenced
in September 2009 and was completed in March 2010.
Processing and interpretation of this data will take
place during the rest of the year. Planning for drilling
operations has commenced with a view to securing
a deepwater rig to enable Tullow to spud its first
well in the block around year end.
In the fourth quarter of 2009, Tullow farmed out
33% of its 97.5% holding in this block to Shell and
a further 25% to Total, leaving Tullow with 39.5%.
Northpet Investments retains the remaining 2.5%.
Shell has an option to take up a further 12% and
the operatorship in late-2010. The assignment
of interests to both Shell and Total await formal
approval from the French Government.
Guyana
An extensive 3D seismic survey was completed over
the Georgetown block early in 2009. The data has
been processed and interpreted and a number of
stratigraphic trap prospects at Upper Cretaceous
and Tertiary levels have been identified and matured.
A first exploratory well is expected to commence
around year-end.
Suriname
In the onshore Uitkijk block the drilling programme
was completed in early 2009. The wells were
targeting stratigraphically-trapped heavy oil at
shallow depths in Lower Tertiary sands analogous
to the adjacent Tamberadjo field. Oil pay was
encountered in two wells. The drilling of five wells
in the onshore Coronie block, in the same play, was
originally scheduled for 2009 but due to delays with
the rig construction this has now moved into 2010. Brian Macpherson, EHS Superintendent
Ngassa wellsite, Uganda Funding for an exceptional
set of opportunities
We aim to develop the Group’s production and cash flow profile
to enable us to fund a US$500 million exploration programme
per annum so that we can continue to grow and develop Tullow
as the leading global independent oil and gas company.
Finance review 56
We delivered results in line with expectations and the Group’s
financial profile is in a period of transition in anticipation of
first oil and production ramp-up in Ghana. We maintained our
dividend this year and invested £758 million on high-impact
exploration and developing our major projects.
Risk management 62
As a business we could not function at such a high level unless
we are very specific about the identification and management of
risk and how we respond to changes in the external environment.

Finance review
Directors’ Report: Business review
Tullow has materially
strengthened its balance sheet
in the last 12 months with
US$2.25 billion of new debt
facilities and £1.3 billion raised
from equity placings. We now
have an appropriate capital
structure for the medium term.
Historically Tullow has primarily been funded
through a combination of operational cash flow,
portfolio management and reserve based
debt facilities.
The scale of our current exploration portfolio,
exploration success and associated appraisal
together with the fast-track development of
two world-class basins in Ghana and Uganda
have resulted in a number of important
operational and financial strategic decisions
being taken in 2009 and 2010.
These will enable the Group to continue to grow
and underpin the business with an appropriate
capital structure. Key decisions include:
• Continued operational focus on the development
of Jubilee Phase 1 in Ghana, the commercialisation
of the Lake Albert Rift basin in Uganda and a
high-impact exploration drilling programme;
• Raising £402 million of equity and extending the
reserve-based lending debt facility to US$2 billion
in the first quarter of 2009, and adding a Corporate
debt facility of US$250 million in December 2009;
• Taking a decision to pre-empt the sale of Heritage’s
Ugandan assets and then working to farmdown
our interests to 33¹⁄
³
% by bringing in partners
to deliver a unified and accelerated basin
development plan; and
• Raising a further £925 million of equity in January
2010 to facilitate the Uganda pre-emption and then,
after the farmdown, to provide substantial financial
flexibility for the foreseeable future.
From a financial perspective, these decisions allow
Tullow to bridge the gap between the Group’s
current cash and profit generating ability and more
significant production and cash flow in the future.
This starts with Jubilee Phase 1 production in the
fourth quarter of 2010.
We are forecasting almost £1 billion
of capital expenditure for 2010,
over 85% in Africa.
Ian Springett

Directors’ Report: Business review
2009 financial results
2009 financial results were down compared with the
record results recorded in 2008 primarily because
of the following:
• Production volumes were down as expected by 12%;
• Lower oil and gas prices and the impact of Sterling
weakness on Dollar-based costs;
• Exploration write-offs were £174 million lower
in 2009, but this was more than offset by asset
disposal proceeds that were £231 million higher
in 2008; and
• An IAS 39 charge of £37 million in 2009 compared
with a credit of £43 million in 2008.
Production, commodity prices and revenue
Working interest production averaged 58,300 boepd,
12% lower than 2008, due to natural decline in mature
fields and deferred production due to the reallocation
of capital to development projects and high-impact
exploration. Sales volumes averaged 48,350 boepd,
representing a decrease of 12%, also driven by
changes in the proportion of sales arising from
Production Sharing Contracts (PSC).
On average, oil prices in 2009 were lower than 2008
levels reflecting the global economic downturn.
Realised oil price after hedging for 2009 was
US$60.0/bbl (2008: US$73.6/bbl), a reduction of 18%.
Tullow’s oil production sold at an average discount
of 2% to Brent Crude during 2009 (2008: 4% discount).
UK gas prices in 2009 were significantly lower than
2008 levels. The realised UK gas price after hedging for
2009 was 39.3 pence/therm (2008: 52.4 pence/therm),
a reduction of 25%.
Lower commodity prices and lower sales
volumes were partially offset by the weakening
of Sterling against the US Dollar, which averaged
approximately GBP£1:US$1.55 in 2009 compared to
GBP£1:US$1.90 in 2008. Overall revenue decreased
by 16% to £582.3 million (2008: £691.7 million).
Operating costs, depreciation and impairments
Underlying cash operating costs, which exclude
depletion and amortisation and movements on
under/overlift, amounted to £155.1 million; £7.28/boe
(2008: £143.9 million; £5.90/boe). In absolute terms
cash operating costs increased by 8%, principally due
to the significant weakening in Sterling during the
period which materially affected the cost in Sterling
terms of the underlying US Dollar cash operating
costs. Cash operating costs on a per barrel basis
increased by 23% above 2008 levels, also impacted by
the decrease in production volumes during the year.
Depreciation, depletion and amortisation charges
before impairment charges for the year amounted
to £223.2 million; £10.54/boe (2008: £198.4 million;
£8.14/boe). The depreciation rate for 2009 was also
materially affected by the weakening of Sterling
when compared to 2008. The Group has also
recognised an impairment charge of £8.1 million;
£0.38/boe (2008: £26.3 million; £1.08/boe) in
respect of the Chinguetti field in Mauritania.
At the year-end the Group was in a net overlift
position amounting to 148,000 barrels. The
movements during 2009 in the overlift position
compared with 2008 and stock movements during
the year have given rise to a charge of £6.3 million
to cost of sales (2008: credit of £6.4 million).

Directors’ Report: Business review
Commodity hedging summary
At 3 March 2010 the Group’s commodity hedge
position to the end of 2012 was as follows:
Administrative expenses of £49.5 million
(2008: £43.0 million) include an amount of
£11.3 million (2008: £7.9 million) associated with
IFRS 2 – Share-based payments. The increase in
total general and administrative costs is also due
to the continued growth of the Group during 2009
with staff numbers increasing by 24% to 669 people.
Exploration cost written-off
Exploration costs written-off were £52.8 million
(2008: £226.7 million), in accordance with the Group’s
‘successful efforts’ accounting policy, which requires
that all costs associated with unsuccessful exploration
are written-off in the income statement. This write-off
is principally associated with exploration activities in
Côte d’Ivoire, new ventures activity and licence
relinquishments. In 2008, Tullow undertook a
fundamental review of its exploration portfolio
following the decision to focus on fast-tracking its
discoveries in Ghana and Uganda coupled with a
more selective high-impact exploration programme.
This resulted in significant write-offs in respect of
interests in Mauritania, Suriname, Tanzania and
Trinidad and Tobago.
Derivative instruments
Tullow continues to undertake hedging activities
as part of the ongoing management of its business
risk and to protect the availability of cash flow for
reinvestment in capital programmes that are
driving business growth.
At 31 December 2009, the Group’s derivative
instruments had a net negative mark-to-market
value of £11.1 million (2008: positive £49.3 million).
This is principally due to the increase in the oil price
from the beginning of 2009.
While all of the Group’s commodity derivative
instruments currently qualify for hedge accounting,
a pre tax charge of £37.2 million (2008: credit of
£42.9 million) has been recognised in the income
statement for 2009. The charge is principally due
to a combination of Brent forward oil prices
strengthening during the year and reduced
volatilities, with a consequent reduction in the time
value of the oil derivative instruments for Tullow.
This was only partially mitigated by a credit for time
value on gas derivative instruments arising from
UK gas prices, which weakened during the year.

Operating profit
Operating profit amounted to £95.1 million
(2008: £299.7 million), a decrease of 68%. The reduction
was principally due to lower commodity prices and sales
volumes and less profit relating to portfolio management
activities, partly offset by lower exploration costs
written-off during 2009.
Gearing, financing costs and interest cover
The net interest charge for the period was £37.6 million
(2008: £43.3 million) and reflects the increase in net
debt levels during 2009 offset by an increase in interest
capitalised during the year on qualifying assets,
principally due to the Jubilee phase 1 development
in Ghana.
At 31 December 2009, Tullow had net debt of
£718.3 million (2008: £400.3 million), while unutilised debt
capacity was in excess of US$620 million. The Group’s
gearing was 47% (2008: 31%) and EBITDA interest cover
has decreased to 6.3 times (2008: 17.8 times).
Taxation
The tax charge of £1.8 million (2008: £73.1 million)
relates to the Group’s North Sea, Gabon, Equatorial
Guinea, Ghanaian and Mauritanian activities. After
adjusting for exploration costs and profit on disposal of
subsidiaries, the Group’s underlying effective tax rate is
3% (2008: 26%). The reduction in the effective tax rate is
principally due to the recognition of tax losses available
for utilisation against future revenues from Ghana.
Dividend
The Group has significant opportunities to increase
shareholder value by continuing to invest in its portfolio
of assets, principally in Ghana and Uganda, and the Board
feels that it is appropriate to maintain the final dividend
at the 2008 level. Consequently the Board has proposed
a final dividend of 4.0 pence per share (2008: 4.0 pence
per share). This brings the total payout in respect of 2009
to 6.0 pence per share (2008: 6.0 pence per share). The
dividend will be paid on 21 May 2010 to shareholders
on the register on 16 April 2010. www.tullowoil.com 59
Directors’ Report: Business review
Operating cash flow; focused capital investment
Reduced commodity prices and lower sales volumes
led to an operating cash flow before working capital
movements of £373.5 million (2008: £518.8 million),
28% lower than 2008. This cash flow together with
the equity placing proceeds helped facilitate 2009
capital investment of £757.4 million in exploration
and development activities, payment of dividends
and servicing of debt facilities.
Based on the current estimates and work
programmes capital expenditure for 2010 is
forecast to be £990 million. Approximately 40% of
this investment will be for exploration and appraisal
and the remainder will be on development and
production activities. Tullow’s activities in Ghana
and Uganda will comprise approximately 60% of the
anticipated 2010 capital outlay.
Balance sheet
Total net assets at 31 December 2009 amounted
to £1,525.9 million (31 December 2008: £1,309.2
million), with the increase mainly as a result of
the 9.1% share placing in January 2009, currency
translation adjustments and hedge movements.
Net assets decreased by £32.7 million in the year
due to the movement of the hedge reserve in
accordance with IAS 39 – Financial Instruments:
Recognition and Measurement. A reduction in net
assets (foreign currency translation reserve) of
£125.8 million resulted from the strengthening of
Sterling against the US Dollar from US$1.45 to
US$1.60 in the year. As a consequence, underlying
US Dollar denominated assets decreased in Sterling
value terms at the year end.
Portfolio management
During 2009 Tullow completed the sale of the
Chachar field in Pakistan for US$7.5 million
(£4.8 million), received final consideration from
the sale of the Hewett-Bacton interests and farmed
out an interest in the Guyane Maritime licence
in French Guiana to Shell and Total.
In October 2009, Tullow commenced a transparent
farmdown process to sell a proportion of its interests
in Blocks 1, 2 and 3A in the Lake Albert Rift Basin
in Uganda. The purpose of this process was to bring
in an experienced and like-minded partner with
downstream expertise to commence an accelerated
basin-wide development plan. The process gained
strong interest from a number of major international
and national oil companies who visited the dataroom
and operations and made representations to the
Government of Uganda.
On 23 November 2009 Heritage Oil plc, Tullow’s
partner in the basin, announced that it intended
to sell its entire interests in Uganda. On 17 January
2010, Tullow chose to exercise its right of pre-emption
on this transaction and formal request for Government
consent for the assets to be transferred to Tullow was
submitted on 2 February 2010. The acquisition price
for these interests is up to US$1.5 billion.
Tullow is now working closely with the Government
to gain approval for the pre-emption of the Heritage
interests in parallel with the farmdown process
which is now at an advanced stage. Two new
potential partners have been identified, CNOOC and
Total and it is expected that each partner will take a

one third interest in each of the three blocks.
Presentations by all parties have recently been
made to the relevant Ugandan authorities and Tullow
expects the transactions to be signed by the end
of April 2010. This will result in a unified partnership
with considerable experience and financial capability
to enable Uganda to become a significant oil
producing nation.
Long-term funding
In March 2009 Tullow finalised arrangements for
US$2 billion (£1.28 billion) of new debt, structured in
the form of secured reserve-based lending facilities
with a seven-year term. In December 2009 this
was supplemented with a new US$250 million
(£160 million) revolving credit facility. Tullow raised
£402 million in a placing of ordinary shares in
January 2009 and in January 2010 the Group raised
an additional £925 million in a further placing of
ordinary shares. Together with the anticipated
proceeds from the Ugandan farmdown process,
this funding significantly strengthens the balance
sheet as Tullow seeks to:
• Maintain a US$500 million (£320 million) per
annum exploration programme and develop
longer-term exploration options;
• Accelerate development in Uganda across
a unified basin with new partners; and
• Progress activities in Ghana with accelerated
appraisal of the Tweneboa discovery and initiate
subsequent phases of the Jubilee development.
Accounting policies
UK listed companies are required to comply with
the European regulation to report consolidated
statements that conform to International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS). The Group’s significant
accounting policies and details of the significant
accounting judgements and critical accounting
estimates are disclosed within the notes to the
financial statements. The Group has not made
any material changes to its accounting policies
in the year ended 31 December 2009.
Presentational currency
With effect from 1 January 2010 the Group will
present its financial statements in US Dollars.
The Group has decided it is now appropriate to
change the presentational currency from Sterling
as the majority of the Group’s activities are in Africa
where oil revenue and costs are Dollar denominated.
Liquidity risk management and going concern
The Group closely monitors and manages its liquidity
risk. Cash forecasts are regularly produced and
sensitivities run for different scenarios including,
but not limited to, changes in commodity prices,
different production rates from the Group’s portfolio
of producing fields and delays in development
projects. The Group normally seeks to ensure that it
has a minimum ongoing capacity of US$500 million
(£320 million) for a period of at least 12 months
to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a
going concern.
Following the placing announced in January 2010,
the planned portfolio activity and with the
US$2 billion (£1.28 billion) financing already secured
in March 2009, the Group’s forecasts and projections
show that there is significant capacity and financial
flexibility for the 12 months from the date of the
2009 Annual Report and Accounts.
After taking account of the above, the Directors
consider that the Group has adequate resources to
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable
future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going
concern basis in preparing the 2009 Annual Report
and Accounts.
Risk management
Effective risk management is critical to achieving the
Group’s strategic objectives and protecting its people
and reputation. The management of key risks has
been assigned to individual Executive Directors
and senior managers. The principal risks and
uncertainties facing the Group, their potential impact
and the mitigation strategies developed are detailed
in the risk management section commencing on
page 62 of this report.
Risks to 2010 performance
In common with other companies in the oil sector ,
Tullow is exposed to commodity price risk, the delivery
of major projects and ensuring safe operations in all
locations. The Board determines the specific key risks
for the company and required mitigation plans and
reviews delivery on a regular basis. Risks for 2010
include delivery of Jubilee first Oil, completion of
the Uganda pre-emption and farm-down, and
maintaining an adequate hedging programme.
We are always looking at our
business to manage our capital,
our funding and to keep an
appropriate balance between
exploration, major projects
and development.

Directors’ Report: Business review
Capital market relationships
Tullow takes great pride in achieving top quartile
and best practice performance in investor relations
and capital market communications. In 2009,
senior management participated in over 200 investor
meetings in the UK, Europe and North America
and presented at 13 capital market conferences
and hosted investors and sell-side analyst events
in the UK.
There was strong news flow during 2009 which
resulted in positive TSR of 99%, the 14th best
performance in the FTSE 100 index and in the top
quintile in Tullow’s comparator group. We were also
recognised for good disclosure with an award for the
Most Effective Overall Annual Report in the FTSE 100
for our 2008 Annual Report.
As part of our ongoing strategy to improve
shareholder relations, Tullow commissioned the
Rivel Research Group to undertake an independent
Investment Community Perception Study in December
2009. The study’s preliminary findings were received in
February 2010. The full report will be presented to the
Board in April. Initial findings confirmed the high level
of respect the investment community has for the
Tullow management team and the Group’s strategy.
It has also identified specific strategic challenges for
the Board to consider and communicate on during
2010. In addition the study demonstrated a high
approval rating for the effectiveness of Tullow’s
Investor Relations programme, which provides
open and transparent disclosure and good access
to Tullow executive management.
Financial strategy and outlook
Tullow’s financial strategy is to ensure the Group
has a strong and well funded balance sheet. This
means having the capacity to undertake a significant
and growing activity set through a combination of
operating cash flow and an appropriate mix of debt
and equity funding, supplemented by selective
acquisitions and divestments.
The outlook for 2010 is very positive for Tullow.
First oil from Jubilee in the second half of 2010,
the Group’s equity fund raising and the successful
completion of the Ugandan farmdown will all
ensure that Tullow is adequately capitalised to
fund its growth strategy.

Risk management
Directors’ Report: Business review
Managing risk effectively is a critical element of
our corporate responsibility and underpins the
safe delivery of our business plans and strategic
objectives. It protects our reputation, supports our
ability to do business and helps to create long-term
competitive advantage. Risk management is
embedded in Tullow’s organisation structure,
operations and performance management tools.
The Group has a systematic approach to risk
identification and management which combines
the Board’s assessment of risk with risk factors
originating from and identified by the Group’s
business units and in-country operations.
Monitored monthly
Overall responsibility for risk management resides
with Tullow’s Board of Directors. Key risks are
monitored by the Board as part of a monthly
operational and financial management report for
the Group, which includes operational, financial,
EHS and external market progress against predefined
performance indicators. In this report, progress in
implementing plans to manage risks is through a
narrative commentary and a traffic light system. In
this way it is clear whether risk mitigation has been
achieved, is in progress or has escalated and requires
immediate attention. This provides a dynamic risk
management process where new risks are identified
and mitigation processes are refined in the context of
the current external operating environment.
Clear accountability
Tullow has nominated Executive Directors with
responsibility for key risks and this approach is
closely aligned with the Group’s business model
which integrates and coordinates exploration,
production, finance, legal and governance
decision making.
Part of Group strategy
While risk management operates on a rolling
calendar basis, key risks for strategic delivery
of the Group’s business plans and objectives are
identified as part of the Board’s annual review of
Group strategy. The Chief Executive’s review sets out
the Group’s growth strategy, strategic objective and
strategic priorities, which is on page 22 of this Report.
Embedded in the business
The Executive directors meet weekly to discuss
strategy implementation and separately with the
Senior Management Committee (SMC). The SMC
comprises the General Managers of E&A, P&D
and Finance and the Heads of Corporate Planning
& Economics, Commercial, HR and Risk & Marketing
and this group is responsible for delivery of the
annual budget. This reporting and communication
structure between the Executive Directors and SMC
leads to an effective two-way exchange of information
and ensures co-ordinated decision-making takes
place with a premium placed on risk management.
In each area of risk the Executive Directors are
supported by members of the senior management
team or senior managers with functional, business
unit or in-country roles. Accountability for managing
risk is assigned to individual managers and each
employee is personally responsible for managing
risk within the remit of their role.
Independently reported
The risk reporting process is co-ordinated
independently by the Group Internal Audit Manager
with input from the Executive Directors and senior
managers accountable for managing risks. This
provides the Board with an active, action-oriented
process that closely monitors key risks. The system
also validates progress being made in mitigating
risk throughout the year across the business.
Linked to annual performance
Tullow undertakes a detailed annual business
planning and budget process extending over a
three-year planning horizon. The budget provides
the key financial measures against which the
efficiency and management of individual work
programmes and the performance of the Group is
measured. The budget and planning process
includes annual objectives and targets covering
production, development, exploration, EHS and
financial performance, which are set at a business
unit and asset level. Business plans are agreed with
the Board together with risks to delivery and defined
operational targets.
As a business we could not function properly unless we
are very specific about the identification and management
of risk and how we respond to changes in the external
operating environment. www.tullowoil.com 63
Directors’ Report: Business review
Actual performance against the plan is reported on
a monthly basis including an explanation of key
variances. On a quarterly basis senior management
assess the Group’s performance through a series of
reviews with business units. These reviews include
an assessment of risks to delivery and measures
being implemented to manage these potential risks.
Longer range financial projections are also
regularly prepared.
This operational risk management and reporting
process combined with the Board’s strategic risk
review ensures that risk management is linked to
strategic delivery and the achievement of Business
Unit operational targets and objectives.
Defined Audit Committee participation
The Audit Committee plays a key role in reviewing
the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control
procedures and financial risk management systems.
In 2009, the Committee approved the annual internal
audit plan and received summary results from all of
the audits conducted during the year. In addition, the
Committee monitors the integrity of the financial
statements and the work of the external auditors,
reviews the work of the independent reserves
auditors ERC and the arrangements in place for
managing Information Technology risk relating to the
Group’s critical business systems. Further details on
the Audit Committee can be found in the Corporate
Governance section on page 86 of this report.
How risk management responds
A key feature of Tullow’s approach to risk are the
actions taken in response to situations where risks
crystallise. We reacted quickly to our first fatality in
2009 and developed a comprehensive response
culminating in a Group-wide health and safety audit
by the end of the year. The key actions arising from
this audit process will be implemented in 2010. Full
details on our response to this fatality are on
page 73 of this Report.
How risk management evolves
Tullow has established dedicated project teams to
manage major developments in Ghana and Uganda.
As part of that process project milestones were
established covering EHS, cost, schedule and
technical aspects of the development. At each stage
detailed risk analysis is completed with inputs from
partners as appropriate. Plans to mitigate these
risks are developed by the project teams and
reviewed by the Executive and the Board.
On an ongoing basis the Jubilee project development
team produce a comprehensive monthly report that
provides a detailed summary of progress being made
in meeting key project milestones. Key execution risks
are identified along with the mitigation actions being
implemented to manage these risks. Through this
process risk identification, mitigation and monitoring
are completed as part of the day-to-day management
of these operations. As risks are effectively mitigated
they are replaced with emerging risks.
The report is distributed to senior management,
partners and the Ghanaian government and also
forms part of the Group’s monthly operational and
financial report for the Tullow Board.
Appropriate policies and procedures
Tullow has detailed policies, procedures and systems
in place to support risk management across the
Group. These include the Group’s Code of Business
Conduct, HR and EHS policies and systems, supply
chain management, crisis management plans and
ISO14001 certification of the Group’s Environmental
Management System. Further information on these
are contained in the corporate responsibility section
of this report, on page 70.
2010 principal risks
The Group has identified its 2010 principal risks
as being:
• Execution risk in major development projects
in Ghana and Uganda; and
• Exploration risk in the context of a very active 2010
programme which includes up to 12 Equatorial
Atlantic, 10 Ugandan and eight wildcat wells
planned in our 2010 E&A programme.
Enhanced risk disclosure
Tullow groups risk into strategic, financial,
operational and external risk. Throughout the year
we have critically reviewed and evaluated the risks
the Group faces. We have synthesised these in this
year’s report and have improved our disclosure
through aligning risks with Executive Director
responsibility, Group’s KPI’s and related policies and
systems. In recognition of the level of strategic risk
associated with the Group’s major projects key
operational and business milestones have been
added to performance indicators. We have also
reported on the progress made during 2009 in
key Group risks.

Corporate responsibility
Directors’ Report: Business review
Corporate responsibility is part of how we organise and run our business.
At Tullow, we believe it is fundamental to implementing our strategy
and accomplishing our strategic objective.
Our vision is to be the leading global independent
exploration and production company. To achieve
this we take a long-term approach in protecting
our reputation, managing risk, investing in people
and creating the environment that we need to
successfully execute our growth strategy and deliver
our business plans. By doing this well we create
competitive advantage which in turn enables Tullow
to create long-term value for all our stakeholders.
Our vision and growth strategy are supported by
six strategic priorities and three of these relate
to corporate responsibility:
• Ensuring safe people, procedures and operations,
and minimising environmental impacts;
• Building long-term relationships with local
governments, communities and key
stakeholders; and
• Continuing to develop a strong team with excellent
commercial, technical and financial skills.
A transparent and accountable approach
The Group has a strong governance and
organisational framework that promotes
accountability, transparency and achieving
the highest ethical and business standards.
Corporate responsibility spans key areas
that are embedded in how we run our business
and each area is the designated responsibility
of an Executive Director.
• EHS is the responsibility of Paul McDade,
Chief Operating Officer;
• Governance including the Group’s Code of Business
Conduct is the responsibility of Graham Martin,
General Counsel and Company Secretary. Graham
also has responsibility for Human Resources;
• Risk management and supply chain management
are the responsibility of Ian Springett, Chief
Financial Officer, as is Investor Relations which
is an important function in how we engage with
our shareholders and Capital Markets; and
• Social enterprise investment is the responsibility
of Aidan Heavey.

Directors’ Report: Business review
A new External Affairs function
Tullow has grown very rapidly in the last five years
and part of that journey is that we continually strive
to be a better run company. Big projects bring big
responsibility and we need to match our significant
social responsibilities in Africa, in particular, and
the wider reputation management issues that come
with having world-class oil projects. In 2009, Tullow
established an External Affairs function that reports
directly to Aidan Heavey, Chief Executive Officer.
This new function will:
• Reshape our Corporate Responsibility
Committee and its Terms of Reference;
• Create internal relationships and systems that
ensure that corporate responsibility activities
and initiatives are joined-up across the Group;
• Develop a wider programme for stakeholder
engagement and dialogue with communities,
governments, non-governmental organisations
and national and international media; and
• Deliver a major step-change in how we
approach and support social enterprise
and community investment.
Another part of the responsibility of the External
Affairs team will be to improve our disclosure in
the area of corporate responsibility and move Tullow
towards best practice reporting in this area. We know
that being transparent helps us to create trust and
confidence and effective communication is an
essential part of that.
Creating shared prosperity
A key output of a four-day External Affairs
workshop in Uganda in January 2010 was to define
a new long-term approach to inform all corporate
responsibility activities. Moving forward, we will work
more closely with external stakeholders to ensure
that oil and gas resources create shared prosperity.
Growing stakeholder engagement
While we recognise that our new External Affairs
function will enhance wider external stakeholder
engagement processes, the Group’s engagement
processes with shareholders, communities and
employees (see Tullow Talkback on page 75),
developed further in 2009.
Education in Uganda
In Uganda, we are providing education support in teaching standards, learning
materials and physical infrastructure. We have partnered with Link Community
Development to provide teacher training in eight schools surrounding our operations.
In the Hoima and Buliisa districts we are renovating and constructing schools,
building housing for teachers and supporting school library projects. This programme
has been universally welcomed by teachers, the Education Standards Authority and
District Education Officers.
For a company yet to produce first oil,
Tullow Ghana has done so well in consulting
with diverse stakeholders, and this gives a
foretaste of the relationship that will exist
with local communities.
Nana Nketia

Corporate responsibility continued
Directors’ Report: Business review
of our activities. In addition to regular local
community visits, engagements include local
radio talk shows and town hall meetings,
which attract a cross section of stakeholders.
In Uganda, we opened two Community Liaison
Offices in 2009 to support our community engagement
strategy. Community Liaison Offices act as local
resource centres providing information not only on
Tullow’s operations, but also on what stakeholders
can expect from the emerging oil and gas industry.
We will be opening six Community Liaison Offices
in the western region of Ghana in 2010.
Appropriate policies, procedures and
management systems
Part of Tullow’s journey has also been to continually
develop policies, procedures and management
systems that support the highest standards of
governance and corporate responsibility. The Group
has a framework for the consistent application
of the standards that all of our operations must
comply with. We safeguard this through corporate
governance processes together with monitoring
and oversight by the Board. We benchmark
consistent application though Internal
Audit reviews.
Shareholder relations
Communication with shareholders is given
high priority and we hold regular dialogue with
institutional investors and other Capital Markets
participants. Throughout 2009, Executive Directors
and senior management conducted over 200
individual meetings. The Board receives regular
reports covering key investor meetings and activities,
as well as shareholder and investor feedback.
Tullow conducted a community investment
perception survey in the first quarter of 2010, the
findings of which will be presented to the Board for
consideration in April. Preliminary headline results
confirmed a high level of respect for Tullow’s
management team and strategy. In addition,
the survey found that Tullow’s Investor Relations
programme is highly rated in relation to a global
companies peer group, oil and gas peers and
FTSE 100 peers.
Community engagement
We are committed to open and consistent
communication with local stakeholders and we
believe this is pivotal to Tullow’s reputation as a
responsible operator. Our Community Relations
teams are keeping local communities informed
Living our values
We have a shared vision across the
business wherever we work. Living
our values captures and articulates
the four main aspects of the way we
do business in Tullow; so that everyone
working for or with Tullow can be
aligned with our expectations.
Our values are prominently displayed
across the Tullow world. We use them
as the foundation of our recruitment
and performance management
processes, demonstrating that how
we do things is just as important
as what we do.
In a rapidly growing organisation
such as ours, it is easy to forget the
fundamentals of success and we
are determined to maintain the core
values we started with and which
have strongly contributed to our
phenomenal success story.
In our 2009 employee survey, 76%
of respondents were positive that
these values were alive at Tullow.

Key aspects of our policies and systems include:
• Code of Business Conduct incorporating General
Business Principles, Ethics & Integrity Policy,
Whistleblowing Policy and Human Rights Policy
setting out the required standards for employee
and contractor behaviour;
• Integrated Management System which sets
minimum business standards to be used
throughout Tullow, including EHS risk
management guidelines;
• EHS policy sets out Tullow’s commitment to
high standards of EHS performance across
the business supported by EHS leadership
commitment statements;
• Tullow Oil Environmental Standards (toes) provides
guidance and information to internal and external
stakeholders on Tullow’s management approach
to environmental issues and acts as a knowledge
sharing tool within the organisation;
• Human resource policies – Living our values,
Harassment and Equal Opportunity – establish a
consistent set of values and standards for managing
employees and contractors throughout the Group;
• Supply chain management have detailed
procedures for tendering, evaluation, selection
and award of contracts that require competitive
tendering and evaluation with management
approval for all significant contract awards;
• Risk management guideline defines the process
for identifying, quantifying and managing risk
throughout the entire asset life cycle; and
• Crisis management plans define the philosophy
and approach to managing any local emergency
or company crisis.
Further, Tullow has re-certified the corporate
Environmental Management System to ISO 14001
standard in 2009. During this process, specific audits
have been carried out in the UK, Dublin, Cape Town,
Bangladesh, Pakistan and Mauritania. The application
of this standard provides a framework for identifying
and evaluating key areas of environmental risk,
risk management and review through all phases
of operations.
Hathay Bunano project in Bangladesh
The communities surrounding our Bangora operations in the Comilla District, Bangladesh, are predominately employed in the
agricultural sector, which offers very few employment opportunities for women. Our partnership with social business enterprise,
Hathay Bunano Proshikhan Society (HBps) generates sustainable income and economic opportunities for women by offering
training and employment in the production of crochet toys. Currently 200 women have completed training and are now earning
independent incomes. The centre also offers free child care and very flexible working conditions.

key stakeholders that were then carried forward into
the EIA process. In December 2009, the Ghana EPA
issued the first part of a two-stage approval to cover
the installation and commissioning phase of the
project. The EIA met both Ghanaian legislative
requirements and international good practice.
Similarly in French Guiana, before Tullow could
begin its seismic activities offshore it was important
to develop a baseline understanding of marine
biodiversity to ensure we mitigated any negative
impacts from our operations. In 2009, we began
conducting an EIA. We partnered with the South
Paris University to assist us and are working closely
with the Government and national environmental
regulators to ensure we acquire a sound
understanding, particularly of the marine mammals
and turtles that are known to occupy the area.
In 2009 in the Lake Albert Rift Basin in Uganda, we
drilled the Ngassa-2 well, which had to be sensitively
located due to subsurface constraints and distance
under the lake of the target location. All personnel
involved in the Ngassa-2 project, including our rig
contractors, subcontractors, and local employees
worked closely with us to ensure that the project
was completed with no safety issues and no negative
Environment, Health and Safety
Over 6.6 million hours were worked, representing
an 18% increase on 2008. As a result, EHS teams
throughout Tullow undertook a number of very
significant work programmes. The key to successful
EHS performance is to ensure that line management
are fully supportive of and engaged with EHS.
Tullow’s EHS Leadership Team, which was set up
in late-2008, and comprises 21 senior personnel with
specific responsibility for higher risk activities across
Tullow. This group is led by Paul McDade, Chief
Operating Officer.
Environment
During the course of 2009 Tullow, with the support
of its partners and the Ghana Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), carried out the stipulated
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for the
Jubilee Field, an offshore development situated
60 km off the coast of Ghana. The project’s scale
set high expectations and created keen interest.
To address this, extensive public consultations
across the Western and Central regions of Ghana
was undertaken as part of the EIA programme. This
allowed Tullow to communicate information on the
proposed development, and listen to concerns from

Directors’ Report: Business review
EHS Leadership Development
“In my role as Business Unit
ManagerEurope,Iparticipated in
the EHS Leadership Development
trainingduring2009.Iattended
two three-day sessions covering
two modules with others whose
responsibilities include high risk
EHS activities such as operations and
drilling. Both modules provided a
balance of theory, practice, policy,
procedure and case studies. They are
designed to include Tullow material,
which makes the content relevant
and real to all participants.
“This training provided a great
opportunity to spend time with my
Tullow peers and to listen to and
understand their EHS challenges
and lessons learnt. Perhaps most
important though, was that we all
took on the challenge of ensuring
that our new learning is applied,
and linked directly to continuous
improvement in EHS performance
at Tullow.”

Business Unit Manager, Europe environmental legacy. While the remediation work
is ongoing, it is clear that full reinstatement of the
Ngassa-2 site is achievable.
First ever fatality
The safety of our staff, contractors and members of
the public involved in our operations is a core value
for Tullow and we focus our energy on maintaining
safe places of work and establishing high safety
standards in all that we do. In May 2009, however,
we failed to manage this adequately and Tullow
suffered its first ever fatality when one of our
subcontractors was electrocuted at a construction
site in the Bangora gas field in Bangladesh.
Following this incident, we made the site safe and
initiated a full investigation. Three senior managers
were mobilised to Bangladesh and together with the
local team delivered a comprehensive investigation
that was fully documented. The investigation
team reported progress directly to the Tullow Board,
who remained actively involved in this incident
and the ongoing actions. We also sought to provide
support to this man’s family and continue to do so.
While clearly any death is one too many, Tullow has
worked hard to identify improvements from this incident
and implement them across the Group. We embarked
on a communication exercise to ensure everyone
in Tullow understood what happened and reached
approximately 85% of all parties in Tullow over a
six-week period. In other areas, a revised electrical
inspection programme identified a series of installation
improvements. Our Bangladesh team implemented
several operational improvements at the Bangora
site including an improved third party electrical
inspection programme, contractor management
and clarity on roles and responsibilities.
We also undertook an independent health and safety
audit and identified some key learnings, which focus
on our management system including understanding
of risk, the management of change and the lack
of formal audit programme. All of which will be
actioned in 2010.
Health and safety
A key health initiative introduced in 2009 was
developing and implementing a Group malaria
programme. Malaria is a very serious illness and
is prevalent in many of the countries where Tullow
operates. We are strongly aware that malaria
presents a serious health risk to individuals in
our workforce who are travelling to, or working
in malaria-endemic areas, and to the communities
around our operations. Malaria is both preventable
and curable, but can be fatal if not treated promptly.
During the year Tullow developed and rolled out a
malaria management policy in close consultation
with the World Health Organisation and in line with
International Association of Oil and Gas Producers
(OGP) Malaria Guidelines for travellers. Tullow’s EHS
Leadership Team has also developed a personal
malaria programme and in-country programmes.
Supply chain management
We ensure that our suppliers align and comply with
our Code of Business Conduct and adhere to best
practice standards. We operate a competitive bidding
process that is centred around the quality , value and
integrity of the products and services being supplied.
Evaluation and selection of suppliers is based on
criteria such as availability, reliability and price,
providing Tullow with efficient access to the best
commercial arrangements available, mitigating
financial risk, and delivering measurable value.
A key element of our supply chain management
strategy , and one that helps develop local enterprise,
is our drive to promote local content, using local and
regional suppliers. Procurement and supply chain
management is not a centralised function. Instead,
we have in-country teams with local knowledge
and this gives greater opportunity to prioritise
local procurement and support enterprise and
employment creation for local communities.
As a result of this our suppliers range from
small and medium-sized local companies
to multinational corporations.
There are high expectations of Tullow and we
are investing in building a world-class external
stakeholder relations programme in support of
working in partnership to create shared prosperity.

Directors’ Report: Business review
Social enterprise investment
Our overall social enterprise objective is to create
a lasting positive legacy from Tullow’s operations.
Enterprise development is now our priority focus
area and underpins our aim to help communities
to support themselves over the long-term. In 2009,
we invested over US$2 million on voluntary social
enterprise projects, of this US$1.7 million was
invested in projects in Africa. Our budget has
significantly increased in 2010, to enhance our
contribution and support our role in social enterprise
and local community development particularly
around our major projects in Ghana and Uganda.
Our people
We introduced the new human resources strategy
in 2008 and with a 46% increase in staff numbers
in 2008 and 24% in 2009, a lot of work has been
undertaken in this area.
Reward & recognition
2009 saw the formation of a Pensions Governance
Committee comprising company and staff
representatives with new plans being offered in
Bangladesh, Ghana and Uganda in 2010. In the
UK, presentations on the Spring Budget and Finance
Act implications were provided to all staff. A major
review of the way we hire contractors during 2009
resulted in a more streamlined, cost-effective
contractor engagement process.
Talent development
Our T for Talent programme went from strength
to strength in 2009. 231 employees attended an
in-house soft skills course, totalling 470 days
training in London alone. Some core programmes
have been delivered globally, such as effective
management, fulfiling our commitment to
development opportunities for all. We have
also taken the initial step in launching career
development frameworks, with the first one being
undertaken in the Tullow geosciences community.
In April this year we will launch the first leadership
development programme, aimed at our top
50 managers.
Performance Management
Our commitment in 2009 was to provide an electronic
process through Tullow’s intranet for performance
management and this was delivered. We had some
good learning on how the systems functioned and
the process will be further streamlined for mid-year
reviews in 2010. Along with this improvement, a
bespoke performance management e-learning
package was designed and made available to all
staff ensuring that, in even the remotest locations,
a consistent approach can be applied to this
important line management function.
GNPC secondee programme
“AftergraduatingwithaBSc in Geology from the University of Ghana,Ispent
three years with GNPC before joining Tullow’s Ghana sub-surface team in
Londonin2008.Duringmytime there Iwas able to gain insight into welllog
interpretation, reservoir characterisation, software training and well
developmenttechniques.Ialso had coaching and mentoring, team building,
report writing and presentation skills training. The programme is excellent
and has given me sufficient knowledge to fit into a working technical office.
ThesupportIhavereceivedfrom experienced Tullow people was fantasticand
Iwouldlovetoworkforsucha company in the future.”
Mark Prempeh
GNPC Secondee
Mark is now undertaking a Tullow sponsored MSc in Petroleum Sciences
at Imperial College, London. Culture and Engagement
The HR team led the introduction of ‘Living our
Values’, which articulates the four key aspects
of Tullow’s culture we feel are essential for us
to encourage and develop in new recruits. Our
organisation continues to grow rapidly and spread
geographically and we know we must not lose sight
of the unique characteristics that have supported
our success to date. Read more about ‘Living our
Values’ on page 70 of this report.
Developing in-country skills
We were delighted to welcome 14 secondees from
the Ghana National Petroleum Company (GNPC),
one of our partners in the Jubilee development, to
Tullow in 2009. We have a strong commitment to
developing an Exploration and Production (E&P)
skills base in both Ghana and Uganda, and our
experience with secondees from GNPC has
been positive and rewarding.
This young team included talented graduates from
well engineering, EHS, petroleum engineering and
geosciences. They participated in a diverse range
of industry training, exams and environmental
awareness, as well as a broad set of soft skills
training to equip them to play a major role in the
development of an oil industry in Ghana. All have
added value to our business by contributing to real
projects with meaningful work experience in various
functions. We were delighted with their contribution
and the majority of secondees are now completing
Tullow sponsored Masters of Science degrees in
various disciplines at leading UK educational
institutions including Heriot Watt, Imperial
College and Universities in Aberdeen and Leeds.
We also trained four production technicians on a
26 week training programme at TTE in Middlesbrough
(UK), who are specialists in the training of production
and operations technicians. Having completed their
offshore survival training, the technicians returned
to Ghana to join the Tullow team in Accra.

top line results
In October 2009, we launched our first global employee
and contractor survey called Tullow Talkback. The survey
was conducted by a third party to ensure confidentiality
and it was distributed electronically to all Tullow
locations. Talkback addressed job, career, reward
and recognition, leadership and management, team,
company and Tullow values through a series of 80
questions. It also included a range of open questions
seeking views on how to improve internal communications,
what Tullow’s reputation is about or any subject in
particular the respondent wanted to convey their
views on to the Group’s leadership team.
The results achieved were very positive showing high
levels of engagement and enthusiasm across the Group.
We set ourselves two benchmarks for a successful
survey – a 70% response rate and that 90% of employees
would recommend Tullow as an employer to a friend.
We achieved an 83% response rate, and 91% of
employees would recommend Tullow to a friend.
We will report in full on the results of Tullow Talkback
and the progress we have made with our follow-up action
plans in the 2009 Corporate Responsibility Report.

Chairman’s introduction
Directors’ Report: Corporate governance
The Tullow Board seeks
to function in a manner that
encourages open and honest
discussion in an environment
of trust and mutual respect.
At the heart of our continued success lie the principles
of good governance and corporate responsibility, which
underpin our ability to deliver our business plans and strategy.
Governance highlights for the year are summarised in my
statement on pages 16 and 17.
2009 Board evaluation
The internal 2009 Board evaluation undertaken by the
Senior Independent Director concluded that there had been
considerable progress since the last full external evaluation
in 2007. New Directors have settled in well to their Board
duties and contribute fully at meetings. Corporate strategy
is well defined, understood and disseminated throughout
the organisation and to all stakeholders. The re-ordering of
Board agendas in 2009 focused debate on the key strategic
issues facing the Group and communication with employees
has improved substantially.
Rebalancing Board time
While we did not record Board discussion topics by the hour
the chart below is indicative of the themes and matters,
which occupied us most during the year. In such a fast-
paced organisation that operates in a very dynamic
environment, one of the key roles of the Board is to respond
and reprioritise matters as appropriate and this we did,
for example, when Tullow had its first fatality and when
Heritage Oil plc announced the sale of its Ugandan assets.
In addition to a strong strategic focus at Board meetings,
another new feature is invitations to external experts to
meet with the Board with a view to ‘broadening our minds’
on topical issues.
Increased direct interaction with staff
The Board visited Cape Town for three days in June and
through general staff gatherings, presentations and other
initiatives significantly increased our level of direct interaction
with all employees during the year. Four non-executive
Directors visited Kampala and our Ugandan field operations
in 2009 and one visited Accra and our shore base facilities.
The response to these initiatives has been very rewarding
and positive. From the Executive and Board perspective it
reflects the importance of making leadership more visible
and showing strong commitment to the Group, together
with fostering a unified Tullow culture particularly as our
employee numbers have increased 46% and 24% in 2008
and 2009 respectively.

Directors’ Report: Corporate governance
Strong shareholder and employee relations
The support of our shareholders has been fundamental to
the success of Tullow. We have a very active annual Investor
Relations programme that allows us to understand and take
due regard of different shareholder priorities. We undertook
an independent investment community survey in the first
quarter of this year and the headline results are excellent.
Tullow’s Investor Relations efforts were rated very highly
on a global and FTSE 100 scale and this is mirrored by the
Award for the most effective overall Annual Report (printed
and online) in the FTSE 100 for our 2008 Annual Report.
There were some significant strategic challenges to the
Board arising from the survey which we will begin to address
once the full report has been presented in April. As we have
grown we have also invested in developing human resource
initiatives and fostering employee engagement. The results
of our latest global employee survey are presented on
page 75 of this report.
New External Affairs initiatives
In 2009, recognising the need to match our growing social
responsibilities and wider reputation management issues
we established an External Affairs function. It is early days
yet but part of their remit will be to reshape our approach
to corporate responsibility, review the corporate social
responsibility committee, improve our external stakeholder
engagement processes and drive a major revamp of social
enterprise and community investment initiatives.
Consistently improving how we run Tullow
2009 built on what has been an extraordinary period of
growth and success for Tullow. Throughout this time one
of our guiding goals has always been to consistently become
a better run company. We have committed ourselves to being
open and transparent with our employees, owners, partners,
government and other key stakeholders. This has helped us
generate trust, demonstrate accountability and build our
reputation. At the heart of this lies how governance and
corporate responsibility considerations are integrated into
our strategy and strategic priorities. We reflect them in
how we run our business on a day-to-day basis and how
decisions are made, including how risk management
is embedded into our business model. They are equally
reflected in how your Board operates and the activities
we undertake and prioritise during the year.

82 Tullow Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Accounts 
Compliance with the Combined Code  
on corporate governance (the Code) 
In working towards its strategic objectives, the Board continues 
to be committed to ensuring that the highest levels of corporate 
governance are achieved. This is integral to its stated overall 
aim to create a culture amongst the Company’s employees, 
suppliers, contractors and other industry partners which places 
strong emphasis upon high standards of business conduct, 
ethics and integrity. Tullow’s Code of Business Conduct, which  
is reviewed by the Board at least annually, is available on  
the Company’s website.  
As a UK listed company, Tullow Oil plc is required to  
make certain statements relating to the way it is governed 
covering issues laid down in the Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance issued by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) and 
most recently amended in June 2008 (the Code). A copy of the 
Code can be found on the Financial Reporting Council’s website  
at: www.frc.org.uk/corporate/combinedcode.cfm.  
In compliance with these requirements, this report (which is 
deemed to form part of the Directors’ Report) describes the 
manner in which the Company has applied the main principles  
of governance set out in Section 1 of the Code.  
The Company is also required to state whether it has complied 
throughout the year under review with the detailed provisions  
of the Code. In recent years, the Board has been addressing  
the level of its detailed compliance and, following a review, it 
considers that the Company fully complied with the provisions 
set out in Section 1 of the Code throughout the year ended  
31 December 2009. This is the first full year in respect of which  
the Company has, in the Board’s opinion, complied without 
exception to the Code provisions. This follows the re-balancing  
of the Board completed during 2008 which resulted in at  
least half the Board (excluding the Chairman) comprising 
independent non-executive Directors as required by the Code. 
Details of the Company’s corporate governance practices are 
set out below and are also available on the Company’s website 
at: www.tullowoil.com/about-us/corporate-governance.html 
The FRC is currently consulting on proposed revisions to  
the Code. The revised Code (to be re-named The UK Corporate 
Governance Code) is expected to be published in mid-2010, 
following which the Board will address its new provisions  
and report on the Company’s compliance in the next  
Annual Report.  
Board of Directors 
Role of the Board 
The Board sets the Group’s strategy, ensuring that the 
necessary resources are in place to achieve the agreed strategic 
priorities, and reviews management and financial performance.  
It is accountable to shareholders for the creation and delivery 
of strong, sustainable financial performance and long-term 
shareholder value. To achieve this, the Board directs and 
monitors the Group’s affairs within a framework of controls 
which enable risk to be assessed and managed effectively 
through clear procedures, lines of responsibility and delegated 
authorities. The Board also has responsibility for setting the 
Group’s core values and standards of business conduct and for 
ensuring that these, together with the Group’s obligations to its 
stakeholders, are widely understood throughout the Group. 
Composition 
The Board currently comprises a non-executive Chairman,  
five Executive Directors and five independent non-executive 
Directors. Each of the Executive Directors has extensive 
knowledge of the oil and gas industry.  
Together, the non-executive Directors bring a broad range  
of business, commercial and other relevant experience to  
the Board, which is vital to the management of an expanding 
international company. Three of the five non-executive Directors 
either currently hold or previously held appointments in oil and 
gas companies or companies with energy interests.  
The Board considers there is an appropriate balance between 
Executive and non-executive Directors, with a view to promoting 
shareholder interests and governing the business effectively.  
Biographical details of the Board members, including details  
of any other major directorships held, are set out on pages 80  
and 81.

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 
There is a clear separation of the roles of the Chairman,  
Pat Plunkett, and the Chief Executive Officer, Aidan Heavey, 
to ensure an appropriate balance of responsibility and 
accountability. The division of responsibilities has been fully 
established, set out in writing and agreed by the Board. 
The Chairman is responsible for the effective running of the 
Board, ensuring that the Board plays a full and constructive  
part in the development and determination of the Group’s 
strategy, and acting as guardian and facilitator of the  
Board’s decision-making process. 
The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for managing the 
Group’s business, proposing and developing the Group’s strategy 
and overall commercial objectives in consultation with the Board 
and, as leader of the executive team, implementing the decisions  
of the Board and its Committees. In addition, the Chief Executive 
Officer is responsible for maintaining regular dialogue with 
shareholders as part of the Group’s overall investor  
relations programme. 
Non-executive Directors 
Appointment 
Non-executive Directors are appointed for an initial term  
of three years, which may be extended by mutual agreement 
subject to satisfactory performance. The letters of appointment 
of each non-executive Director are available for inspection at  
the registered office. 
Meetings of non-executive Directors 
In addition to their attendance at Board and, as appropriate, 
Committee meetings, the non-executive Directors also met 
formally on two occasions during 2009 without executive 
management present. At these meetings, the non-executive 
Directors examined and reviewed the performance of the 
executive management. This review process is in part dealt  
with by the Board Committees referred to on pages 86 to 88. 
Separately, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer held 
informal meetings with the non-executive Directors to discuss 
issues affecting the Group, such as target objectives, strategy, 
key performance indicators and remuneration matters.  
Senior Independent Director 
The Senior Independent Director is Steven McTiernan. In  
this role Mr McTiernan is available to shareholders who have 
concerns that cannot be resolved through discussion with the 
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer or 
where such contact is inappropriate. No such meetings were 
held or requested during the year. 
Independence and conflicts 
The Board considers each of the current non-executive 
Directors to be independent in character and judgement and 
there are no relationships or circumstances which are likely to 
affect (or could appear to affect) the judgement of any Director.  
With effect from 1 October 2008, a Director has a duty to avoid  
a situation in which he or she has, or can have, a direct or 
indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with  
the interests of the Group. The Board has satisfied itself that 
there is no compromise to the independence of those Directors 
who have appointments on the boards of, or relationships with, 
companies outside the Group. The Board requires Directors  
to declare all appointments and other situations which could  
result in a possible conflict of interest and has adopted 
appropriate processes to manage and, if appropriate,  
approve any such conflicts. 
Election and re-election 
All new Directors are required by the Company’s Articles of 
Association to be elected by shareholders at the first Annual 
General Meeting (AGM) after their appointment. Subsequently, 
Directors are subject to re-election by shareholders every  
three years. Where a non-executive Director has served longer 
than nine years, it is Board policy that the Director be subject 
thereafter to annual re-election in accordance with the Code.  
At the 2010 AGM, Aidan Heavey, Angus McCoss and David 
Williams having been in office for three years since they were 
last elected, retire and being eligible, they offer themselves  
for re-election. In addition, as Pat Plunkett has now been  
a Director for more than nine years he now retires annually  
and a resolution for his re-election will be proposed at this 
year’s AGM.   Corporate governance continued

How the Board operates 
Board meetings 
The Board holds scheduled meetings regularly during the  
year and meets on an ad hoc basis as required. The Board has 
arranged to hold at least one Board meeting each year at one of  
the principal overseas offices of the Group. This provides senior 
managers from across the Group the opportunity to present  
to the Board and to meet the Board members informally. It  
also provides the Board with an opportunity to meet a good 
cross-section of staff and to assess senior managers at  
first hand.  
The attendance record of each Director is shown below.  
During 2009, the Board met formally on 10 occasions. Two  
formal strategy review meetings were also held with senior 
management present. In addition to the formal meetings of  
the Board, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer maintain 
frequent contact with the other Directors to discuss any issues 
of concern they may have relating to the Group or as regards 
their area of responsibility and to keep them fully briefed on  
the Group’s operations. 
Also, in order to ensure that the non-executive Directors are 
fully briefed on the more technical and operational aspects  
of our activities, such as the Jubilee offshore development and  
our extensive exploration programme, those non-executive 
Directors with particular expertise in these areas, meet  
regularly with the Chief Operating Officer and the Exploration 
Director to receive more in-depth briefings.

Information flow 
Directors have access to a regular supply of financial, 
operational, strategic and regulatory information to assist  
them in the discharge of their duties. Much of this information is 
provided as part of the normal management reporting process. 
Board papers are circulated in time to allow Directors to be 
properly briefed in advance of meetings. In addition, Board 
meetings generally include a review of the history, performance 
and future potential of a material individual asset or business 
unit. This is designed to ensure that all material assets are 
considered on a cyclical basis and to enable Board members  
to familiarise themselves with the key assets and operations  
of the Group. 
Independent professional advice 
In accordance with Board policy, all Directors and Committees 
have access to independent professional advice, at the 
Company’s expense, as and when required. 
Matters reserved 
A formal schedule of matters reserved for Board approval is  
in place and is reviewed annually. 
The matters reserved include (amongst others): 
• Agreeing the Group’s overall strategy; 
• Approval of financial statements, material acquisitions and 
disposals, material contracts, major capital expenditure 
projects and budgets;  
• Approval of any amendments to the annual budget; and 
• A regular review of the Group’s overall corporate  
governance arrangements. 
Delegated authorities 
Certain matters are delegated by the Board to the Audit, 
Nominations and Remuneration Committees, each of which  
is described in more detail on pages 86 to 88. 
Subject to these matters, the Board delegates authority for  
the management of the day-to-day business and operational 
matters to the Chief Executive Officer and the other Executive 
Directors who form the Executive Committee. This Committee 
meets weekly and is responsible for implementing Group policy 
and monitoring the detailed performance of all aspects of the 
business. The Executive Committee is assisted by the Senior 
Management Committee (SMC) which is responsible for 
managing the group’s portfolio of assets and delivering against  
the approved budget and plan. The Committee meets weekly 
with the Executive Directors, and enables the right level and 
quality of resources to deliver our business objectives. This 
Committee, which consists of Exploration, P&D and Finance 
General Managers and the Heads of Planning & Economics, 
Commercial, HR and Risk & Marketing is also responsible  
for identifying, evaluating and mitigating business risk as 
explained on pages 62 to 65.

Board effectiveness  
Board performance evaluation 
The 2009 evaluation of the Board, its Committees and individual 
directors was, as in 2008, carried out internally, but this year 
was led by Steven McTiernan, the Senior Independent Director. 
In summary, the 2009 Board evaluation concluded that there 
had been considerable progress in many areas since the last 
full external evaluation in 2007 and the internal evaluation in 
2008. The more recent Directors have settled in well to their 
Board duties and contributed fully at meetings. Corporate 
strategy is believed to be well defined, understood and 
disseminated throughout the organisation to all stakeholders. 
The re-ordering of Board agendas in 2009 focused debate on the 
key strategic issues facing the Group and communication with 
employees has improved substantially. 
The Board recognised however that Tullow’s exceptional growth 
and success had also brought challenges and that the Board 
must continue to upgrade its approach and composition to meet 
them. Succession planning for Directors was recognised as an 
area that will require special attention in 2010, to ensure that 
the Board continued to have available to it the correct balance  
of skills and experience to meet the financial, operational and 
governance challenges of growth. 
The Board’s Committees continued to operate efficiently, and 
although consideration was given to changing the composition  
of the Committees it was felt that the current structure 
continued to suit Tullow for the time being. Certain 
improvements in communications between the Committees  
and the full Board were noted for action in 2010. 
As part of the Board evaluation, the Senior Independent Director 
had discussions with each of the Directors on his or her 
individual performance and separately, the non-executive 
Directors have reviewed the performance of the Chairman  
with input from the Executive Directors. The Board is of the  
view that each non-executive Director commits sufficient  
time to discharge his or her duties effectively. 
In conclusion, while recognising the need for continued 
improvement in the structure of Board meetings and 
administrative procedures, the Board members considered that  
the Board continues to function in a manner that encourages 
open and honest discussion in an environment of trust and 
mutual respect. 
Induction 
All new Directors receive an induction as soon as practicable after 
appointment. This includes meetings with senior management, 
functional and business unit heads and where appropriate, visits 
to the principal offices and operations. The Company Secretary 
also provides new Directors with an overview of their duties as 
Directors, corporate governance policies and established Board 
procedures as part of the induction process.  
Continuing professional development 
All members of the Board have access to appropriate training in 
respect of their obligations and duties as Directors, and during 
the year, a number of the Directors attended external seminars 
on relevant topics. In addition, specific briefings were also given 
to the Board to ensure Board members remain up-to-date with 
current regulations and developments. These included the 
implications for Tullow of the 2009 UK Bribery Bill.   Corporate governance continued

Main responsibilities Main responsibilities 
• Monitoring the integrity of the financial statements  
and formal announcements relating to the Group’s 
financial performance; 
• Reviewing significant financial reporting issues and 
accounting policies and disclosures in financial reports; 
• Reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control 
procedures and risk management systems; 
• Considering how the Group’s internal audit requirements 
shall be satisfied and making recommendations to the Board;
• Making recommendations to the Board on the appointment 
or re-appointment of the Group’s external auditors; 
• Overseeing the Board’s relationship with the external 
auditors and, where appropriate, the selection of new 
external auditors; and 
• Ensuring that an effective whistle-blowing procedure  
is in place. 
The Committee comprises five independent non-executive 
Directors and oversees the Group’s financial reporting and 
internal controls and provides a formal reporting link with  
the auditors.  
David Williams, who is Chairman of the Committee, is a 
Chartered Accountant and until his retirement in 2006 was 
Finance Director of Bunzl plc. Currently, he also chairs the audit 
committees of Meggitt PLC and DP World Limited and is a 
member of the audit committee of Taylor Wimpey plc until  
he retires as a non-executive director of Taylor Wimpey on  
31 March 2010. It is a requirement of the Combined Code that at 
least one Committee member has recent and relevant financial 
experience. David Williams therefore meets this requirement.  
The performance of the Committee was evaluated as part of  
the Board evaluation process described on page 85.  
Directors’ Report: Corporate governance Directors’ Report: Corporate governance
www.tullowoil.com 87
The Group’s external auditors are Deloitte LLP and the 
Committee closely monitors the level of audit and non-audit 
services they provide to the Group. Non-audit services are 
normally limited to assignments that are closely related to  
the annual audit or where the work is of such a nature that  
a detailed understanding of the Group is necessary. A policy  
for the engagement of the external auditors to supply  
non-audit services has been implemented to formalise these 
arrangements which requires Audit Committee approval for 
certain categories or work. A breakdown of the fees paid to  
the external auditors in respect of audit and non-audit work  
is included in note 3 on page 119 to the financial statements. In 
addition to processes put in place to ensure segregation of 
audit and non-audit roles, Deloitte LLP are required as part of  
the assurance process in relation to the audit, to confirm to the 
Committee that they have both the appropriate independence 
and objectivity to allow them to continue to serve the members 
of the Company. This confirmation was given and no matters of 
concern were identified by the Committee. 
The Chief Financial Officer, the Group Internal Audit Manager, 
the General Manager Finance, the Deputy Company Secretary 
and representatives of the external auditors are normally invited  
to attend each meeting of the Committee. The Chairman of the 
Board also attends meetings of the Committee by invitation. The 
external auditors have unrestricted access to the Committee 
Chairman. During the 2009 audit process, the Audit Committee 
Chairman met with Deloitte’s Audit Engagement Partner 
without the presence of management. 
In 2009, the Audit Committee met on four occasions.  
The key work undertaken by the Committee was as follows: 
• Consideration and review of full year and half-yearly results 
 The Committee met with the external auditors as a part  
of the full year and half-yearly accounts approval process.  
 During this exercise the Committee considered the  
most appropriate treatment and disclosure of any new or 
judgemental matters identified during the audit or half-yearly 
review, as well as any recommendations or observations 
made by the external auditors. 
• Audit planning and update on relevant accounting developments 
 The Group prepares financial statements under International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs). The adoption of new 
and revised Standards and interpretations during 2009 and 
their impact on the financial statements are described on 
page 111 and 112. 
• Consideration and approval of the risk management 
framework, annual Internal Audit Plan and periodic  
reports from Internal Audit 
 The Group Internal Audit Manager has direct access and 
responsibility to the Audit Committee. His main 
responsibilities include: evaluating and developing the 
Group’s overall control environment, operating efficiency  
and risk identification and management at operating, regional 
and corporate levels. In fulfilling his role, the Group Internal 
Audit Manager has direct access to the Committee without 
reference to executive management. During 2009, the Audit 
Committee Chairman met with the Group Internal Audit 
Manager without the presence of management.  
The Committee approved the programme of 2009 internal  
audit work aimed at addressing both financial and overall  
risk management objectives identified within the Group. A 
number of internal audit reviews were undertaken during 
2009 covering a range of financial and business processes  
in the Group’s main business units in London and Cape  
Town and the main operational locations in Ghana and 
Uganda. Detailed results from these reviews were reported to 
management and in summary to the Audit Committee during 
the year. Recommendations made as a result of the work of 
Internal Audit are tracked for timely implementation and 
reported to the Audit Committee periodically. No significant 
weaknesses were identified as a result of risk management 
and internal controls reviews undertaken by Internal Audit 
during 2009. The Group also undertook regular audits of  
non-operated joint ventures under the supervision of business  
unit management and the Group Internal Audit Manager. In 
addition the Committee oversee the work of the independent 
reserves auditors ERC and arrangements in place for 
managing Information Technology risk relating to the  
Group’s critical business systems. 
 Updated whistle-blowing procedures for the Group were 
implemented during the year and an independent external 
reporting service is being introduced to enable staff to raise 
concerns confidentially. The Committee considers these 
amended whistle-blowing procedures to be appropriate  
for the size and scale of the Group.  
• Review of the effectiveness of the Audit Committee 
 During the year, the Audit Committee completed a review  
of the effectiveness of external audit, internal audit and of  
the Audit Committee itself through a series of questionnaires. 
Internal Audit co-ordinated the review with results presented 
to the members of the Audit Committee. The Committee was 
considered to be operating effectively and in accordance with 
the guidance recommended by the Smith Committee included 
in the Combined Code. 
 In addition, and in line with best practice, the effectiveness  
of Tullow’s Internal Audit function, that was established in 
2006, was independently reviewed by Deloitte LLP. The results  
of this review confirmed that significant progress had been 
made in developing the function and that the internal audit 
process was operating effectively. A plan to further develop 
the functions resources and capabilities is being implemented  
to ensure Internal Audit continues to effectively support  
the Group. 
 The external audit process was also considered to be 
operating effectively.  Corporate governance continued

The Committee comprises all the non-executive Directors  
and the Chief Executive and meets as required. During the year, 
the Committee met twice, primarily to review Board and Board 
Committee composition and succession matters. 
The Nominations Committee continually reviews the composition 
and balance of the Board to ensure that the Group has the  
right structure, skills and experience in place for the effective 
management of the Group’s expanding business. It has been 
recognised that the Committee is likely to be particularly active 
in 2010 in planning for the progressive refreshment of the  
Board in the coming years to ensure that there are Directors 
with the appropriate skills and experience to match the 
particular challenges that will face Tullow in the future. The  
views of major shareholders will be sought at the same time.

Shareholder relations 
Communication with shareholders is given high priority and 
there is regular dialogue with institutional investors, as well  
as general presentations to analysts at the time of the release  
of the full year and half-yearly results. Throughout 2009, 
Executive Directors and senior management met with 
institutional investors in London and across the UK, as well  
as in Dublin and several other European cities. Five roadshow 
trips took place in North America and attendances at 13 UK  
and European conferences provided for comprehensive and  
engaging dialogue with shareholders, with over 200 individual 
meetings held. During 2010, Tullow is planning to host a  
Capital Markets Day in Ghana for UK analysts. The Board 
receives regular investor relations reports covering key investor 
meetings and activities, as well as shareholder and investor 
feedback. As part of our ongoing strategy to improve  
shareholder relations, Tullow commissioned the Rivel Research 
Group to undertake an independent investment community 
Perception Study in December 2009. The study’s preliminary 
findings were received in February 2010. The full report will be 
presented to the Board in April. Initial findings confirmed the 
high level of respect the investment community has for the 
Tullow management team and the Group’s strategy. It has 
identified specific strategic challenges for the Board to consider 
and communicate on during 2010. The study also demonstrated  
a high approval rating for the effectiveness of Tullow’s Investor 
Relations programme which provides open and transparent 
disclosure and good access to Executive Management.  
The Group issues its results and other news releases promptly 
via the London Stock Exchange’s Regulatory News Service  
and publishes them on the Investor Relations section of the 
Group’s website: www.tullowoil.com. Regular updates  
to record news in relation to the Group and the status of 
exploration and development programmes are also included  
on the website. Shareholders and other interested parties can 
subscribe to receive these news updates by email by registering 
online on the website. A new corporate website with additional 
functionality was launched in February 2010 to enhance the 
Group’s communication with all stakeholders. The Chairman is 
available to meet with institutional shareholders to discuss any 
issues and address any concerns in relation to the Company’s 
governance and strategy. Non-executive Directors have the 
opportunity to attend meetings with major shareholders and  
are available to attend if requested to do so. Meetings are  
also held with the corporate governance representatives of 
institutional investors when requested.  
At the AGM, a business presentation is provided for the  
benefit of shareholders. Individual shareholders are given the 
opportunity to put questions to the Chairman, the chairmen  
of the Audit, Nominations and Remuneration Committees  
and to other members of the Board. In addition, the Board is 
committed to maintaining strong links with its significant Irish 
shareholder base and holds a business presentation in Dublin 
following the AGM to allow these shareholders similar access to 
the Company. Notice of the AGM is sent to shareholders at least 
20 working days before the meeting and details of proxy votes 
for and against each resolution, together with votes withheld, 
are made available after the vote has been dealt with on a show of 
hands. In the event a vote at the AGM is held on a poll, the result  
of the poll (including the votes cast for and against together  
with the votes withheld) is made available as soon as reasonably 
practicable through a regulatory information service and on the 
Group’s website.  
All shareholders are offered the choice of receiving shareholder 
documentation, including the Annual Report, electronically or  
in paper format as well as the choice of submitting proxy votes 
either electronically or by post. 
Internal controls 
The Directors acknowledge their responsibility for the Group’s  
and the Company’s systems of internal control, which are 
designed to safeguard the assets of the Group and to ensure  
the reliability of financial information for both internal use and 
external publication and comply with the Turnbull Committee 
guidance on the Combined Code. The Group’s internal control 
procedures require technical, financial and Board approval for 
all projects. All major expenditures require senior management 
approval at the appropriate stages of each transaction. Overall 
control is ensured by a regular detailed reporting system 
covering both technical progress of projects and the state of the 
Group’s financial affairs. The Board has put in place procedures 
for identifying, evaluating and managing any significant risks 
that face the Group. Risk assessment and evaluation is an 
integral part of the annual planning cycle. Each business unit 
documents its strategic objectives and the significant risks in 
achieving them and regularly reports on progress against these 
objectives. Key risks are also reported monthly to the Board. 
There is a comprehensive budgeting and planning system for  
all items of expenditure with an annual budget approved by the 
Board. Actual results are reported against budget on a monthly 
basis. Revised financial forecasts for the year and financial 
projections for future years are regularly prepared.  
The Board has ultimate responsibility for the effectiveness of  
the Group’s risk management activities and internal control 
processes. Any system of internal control can provide only 
reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that material financial 
irregularities will be detected or that the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives is eliminated. The Board’s objective  
is to ensure Tullow has appropriate systems in place for the 
identification and management of risks. 
The Board receives reports from business unit and corporate 
teams throughout the year to enable them to assess on an 
ongoing basis the effectiveness of the system of internal 
controls and risk management.  
During the year, the Group Internal Audit Manager reviewed  
a number of areas of risk and his findings were reported to the 
Audit Committee. No significant weaknesses were identified. 
The Board has confirmed that through its Audit Committee  
it has reviewed the effectiveness of the system of internal 
financial, operational and compliance controls and risk 
management, and considers that the system of internal  
controls operated effectively throughout the financial  
year and up to the date on which the financial statements  
were signed.  Corporate governance continued

Going concern 
The Group closely monitors and manages its liquidity risk.  
Cash forecasts are regularly produced and sensitivities run  
for different scenarios including, but not limited to, changes in 
commodity prices, different production rates from the Group’s 
portfolio of producing fields and delays in development projects. 
The Group normally seeks to ensure that it has a minimum 
ongoing capacity of US$500 million (£320 million) for a period  
of at least 12 months to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue  
as a going concern.  
Following the placing announced in January 2010, the planned 
portfolio activity and with the US$2.25 billion (£1.44 billion) 
financing already secured in 2009, the Group’s forecasts and 
projections show that there is significant capacity and financial 
flexibility for the 12 months from the date of the 2009 Annual 
Report and Accounts.  
After taking account of the above, the Directors consider that 
the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue 
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 2009 Annual 
Report and Accounts.  
Further information which is relevant to the application of the 
going concern assumption is provided in Notes 17 and 18 to the 
Financial Statements and the sections related to funding within 
the Business Review.

Directors’ remuneration report 
Year ended 31 December 2009 
www.tullowoil.com 91
Dear Shareholder  
Tullow’s Executive Directors continue to deliver outstanding 
returns to shareholders, with the Company now an established 
member of the FTSE 100 – the share price having increased by 
over 90% in 2009 and Total Shareholder Return growth over 
750% higher than that of the FTSE 100 over the last five years. 
In this context, the Remuneration Committee is very mindful of  
the need to ensure that the Executive Directors are appropriately 
remunerated and incentivised. As a result, and following  
the Committee’s most recent review of Tullow’s executive 
remuneration policy against market and best practice, it has 
been decided that certain changes be made to the Executive 
Directors’ remuneration packages. These changes are 
summarised below and described more fully later in  
this report. 
Base Salary 
Notwithstanding another year of exceptional performance, base 
salaries have been increased by only 2% (reflecting the general rate  
of salary increase applied across the Group). 
Pension 
Pension provision will be increased so that all Executive 
Directors will receive a defined contribution pension provision  
at a rate of 25% of salary (from 15%, or 10% below aged 50).  
Annual Bonus 
The maximum annual bonus opportunity of the Executive 
Directors will be increased to 200% of salary (from 150% of 
salary) which reflects median practice. There will also be a 
corresponding increase in target bonus opportunity from 60%  
of salary to 80% of salary, which will remain below median. The 
underlying structure of the annual bonus will remain unchanged 
from last year, in that (i) 25% of the bonus opportunity will be 
based on Tullow’s relative TSR performance against the bespoke  
Oil & Gas comparator group used for Performance Share Plan 
awards, (ii) 25% will be based upon absolute TSR growth targets,  
(iii) 50% will be based upon corporate KPIs (relating to  
Health & Safety, Operational & Financial, and Project-specific 
targets) and (iv) any bonus in excess of 75% of salary will 
continue to be deferred into shares for three years under  
the Company’s Deferred Share Bonus Plan. 
Long-Term Incentives 
The main other element of the Executive Directors’ packages –  
long-term incentive provision – will remain unchanged and  
will be provided via regular annual awards of shares worth up  
to 200% of salary under the Company’s Performance Share  
Plan which will vest three years after grant subject to continued 
employment and the Company’s relative TSR performance 
against (i) a bespoke group of international Oil & Gas companies  
(as to 50%) and (ii) the FTSE 100 (as to the remaining 50%).  
In addition, the Company’s share ownership guidelines, which 
require Executive Directors to build up and hold a shareholding 
worth at least 200% of salary, will be retained. 
The Committee is conscious of the fact that these changes 
increase the value of the Executive Directors’ remuneration 
packages. However, in this regard, the Committee considers  
this approach entirely appropriate and that, notwithstanding 
these increases, the remuneration packages of this highly 
regarded management team remain below median of 
comparable benchmarks. 
The Committee also believes that the executive remuneration 
policy does not encourage inappropriate risk-taking which  
may be to the long-term detriment of shareholders, with the 
Executive Directors’ interests very closely aligned with the long-
term interests of investors through (i) the significant compulsory 
share deferral feature in the annual bonus plan, (ii) the regular 
annual grant of awards of share incentives, (iii) the application of 
share ownership guidelines and (iv) the use of Total Shareholder 
Return targets in both short-and long-term incentives albeit,  
in both cases, underpinned by a Remuneration Committee 
discretion to reduce payouts if other factors make it  
appropriate to do so.  
Finally, I would like to draw your attention to the resolution  
that is to be tabled at the forthcoming AGM relating to the 
establishment of a new 2010 Share Option Plan. This new  
Plan will effectively replace the Company’s existing Option 
Scheme which will shortly expire. As before, it is not intended  
that Executive Directors (nor any other participants in the 
Performance Share Plan) will receive awards under this  
new Plan. 
Should any shareholder wish to contact me in connection  
with the Group’s senior executive remuneration policy,  
please email me at: remunerationchair@tullowoil.com.  
Yours sincerely

Directors’ Report: Corporate governance Directors’ remuneration report continued
92 Tullow Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Accounts 
Introduction 
This Directors’ remuneration report has been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 
and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium Sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts & Reports Regulations) 2008 which set out 
requirements for the disclosure of Directors’ remuneration, and 
also in accordance with the requirements of the Listing Rules of 
the Financial Services Authority. 
The relevant legislation requires the auditors to report to the 
Company’s members on the ‘auditable part’ of the Directors’ 
remuneration report and to state whether, in their opinion,  
the part of the report that has been subject to audit has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the relevant legislation. 
This report is therefore divided into separate sections to  
disclose the audited and unaudited information.

the Group. 
The Committee met four times during the year. The full  
terms of reference for the Committee are available on  
the Group’s website. 
Committee’s advisers 
The Committee invites individuals to attend meetings to provide 
advice so as to ensure that the Committee’s decisions are 
informed and take account of pay and conditions in the Group  
as a whole. These individuals include Gordon Headley, Chief HR 
Officer. No Director takes part in any decision directly affecting 
his own remuneration. The Company Chairman, Pat Plunkett, 
also absents himself during discussion relating to his own fees. 
The Committee has appointed Hewitt New Bridge Street (HNBS)  
as its independent remuneration advisers. They also provide 
technical advice to the Group in connection with the operation  
of its share incentive arrangements. A statement outlining the 
business relationship with HNBS can be viewed on the Investor 
Relations section of the Group’s website. The Committee also 
consults with the Company’s major investors and investor 
representative groups as appropriate. 
Directors’ Report: Corporate governance Directors’ Report: Corporate governance

Remuneration policy 
The Group’s policy is to maintain levels of remuneration so as  
to attract, motivate and retain Executive Directors and senior 
executives of the highest calibre who can contribute their 
experience to the Group’s operations. The elements of the 
remuneration package for Executive Directors and senior 
management are base salary, annual bonus, taxable benefits, 
pension payments and participation in the Group’s share 
incentive arrangements. A significant element of the potential 
remuneration package is, therefore, performance-linked. 
When determining the total remuneration of the Executive  
Directors and senior management, the Committee predominately 
takes into account the remuneration practices adopted by UK  
listed companies of a similar market capitalisation and overseas 
complexity to Tullow. Practice within other relevant Oil & Gas 
companies is also considered.  
The key elements of the remuneration package for the  
Executive Directors are set out below.  
Executive Directors’ remuneration 
Base salary 
Base salaries are reviewed annually with effect from 1 January, and 
are set primarily by reference to external benchmarking data for 
other UK listed companies of similar market capitalisation and 
overseas complexity with, as stated above, practice in the Oil  
& Gas sector also taken into account. 
Following the most recent review, the base salary of each 
Executive Director with effect from January 2010 is: 
Director 2010 salary
Approx. % 
increase 
since 2009
Aidan Heavey £679,450 2%
Graham Martin £384,250 2%
Angus McCoss £384,250 2%
Paul McDade £384,250 2%
Ian Springett £408,000 2%
In setting these salaries, the Committee has kept percentage 
increases in line with those across the rest of the Group and has 
reflected the Group’s policy that there is a significant weighting 
attached to the performance-related elements of pay. 
Consequently, the salaries of the Executive Directors  
are currently positioned below median.  
Annual bonus 
Each Executive Director is entitled to participate in the  
Executive Annual Bonus Scheme in respect of each  
financial year of the Company. 
2009 Annual Bonus Scheme 
The key features of the Annual Bonus Scheme for the  
Executive Directors for 2009 were as follows: 
• The maximum annual bonus potential for the Executive 
Directors was 150% of salary; 
• For meeting target performance, a bonus of 60% of  
salary was payable (40% of the maximum); 
• Any bonus earned in excess of 75% of salary will be paid  
in shares and deferred for three years under the Deferred 
Share Bonus Plan (DSBP); and 
• All the Executive Directors were subject to the same 
performance targets, as follows:  
– 25% was based on Tullow’s TSR performance relative to the 
same Oil & Gas group as is used to measure performance 
for the PSP awards made in 2009 (see page 94) – no bonus is 
paid unless median performance is delivered, with the full 
bonus for upper quartile performance; 
– 25% was based on growth in absolute TSR, with a full 
bonus payable if Tullow’s TSR grows by 15% over the 
year; and 
– 50% was based on certain corporate key performance 
indicators (KPIs) comprising Health & Safety,  
Operational & Financial and Project-specific targets. 
The Committee also has broad discretion before finalising  
any award level on the above parameters to take into account  
other factors and circumstances reflecting the general  
financial condition and the performance of the Group as  
it considers appropriate.  
The Committee’s assessment of performance under  
each of the bonus elements for 2009 was as follows: 
• Relative TSR: 100% of maximum achievement; 
• Absolute TSR: 100% of maximum achievement; and 
• Corporate KPIs: 72% of maximum achievement.  
In assessing the performance of the Corporate KPIs, the  
Health & Safety element was reduced to reflect a fatality that 
occurred to one of our contractors in our Bangladesh operation 
during 2009.  
Based upon the above achievements, the bonus awards for all the 
Executive Directors in 2009 are 129% of salary, reflecting another 
year of excellent performance. As set out above, the bonus in  
excess of 75% of salary (i.e. 54% of salary) will be paid in shares  
and deferred for three years under the DSBP. Since the end of the 
financial year, the terms of past DSBP awards have been amended 
to allow recipients to delay receiving the shares for up to seven 
years after vesting. The method of achieving this and the potential 
tax benefits of doing this are explained below in relation to the 
Company’s Performance Share Plan. Future awards will be 
structured in a similar manner.  
2010 Annual Bonus Scheme 
For 2010, maximum annual bonus opportunity for the Executive 
Directors will be increased to 200% of salary. For meeting target 
performance, a bonus of 80% of salary will be payable (40% of 
the maximum). Any bonus earned in excess of 75% of salary will 
continue to be paid in shares and deferred for three years under 
the DSBP (with the ability to defer receipt of the shares beyond 
vesting, as mentioned above). The same approach to targets will 
apply as were employed in 2009: 
• 25% will be based on relative TSR compared to the same  
Oil & Gas comparator group as is used for the PSP award  
to be made in 2010 (see page 94); 
• 25% will be based on growth in absolute TSR with the same 
growth range as for 2009; and 
• 50% will be based on corporate KPIs, comprising Health & 
Safety, Operational & Financial and Project-specific targets.   Directors’ remuneration report continued
94 Tullow Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Accounts 
Notwithstanding this increase in bonus opportunity, the 
remuneration packages of the Executive Directors remain  
below median. The increased target bonus of 80% is below 
median, with the new maximum bonus of 200% of salary  
around median levels. 
Pension and other benefits 
From January 2010, each Executive Director is entitled to receive  
a payment of 25% of his base salary into the Company’s group 
personal pension plan or his private pension arrangements 
(previously 15%, 10% below age 50). These increased pension 
contributions are around median levels.  
Each Executive Director is entitled to 30 days’ annual leave, 
permanent health insurance, private medical insurance  
and life assurance benefits. The Group also reimburses the 
Executive Directors in respect of all expenses reasonably 
incurred by them in the proper performance of their duties. 
Share incentive arrangements 
Performance Share Plan (PSP) 
Under the PSP, senior executives are eligible for conditional 
awards of rights over whole shares worth up to 200% of salary  
each year (300% in exceptional circumstances, such as to 
facilitate the recruitment of a new Executive Director). Currently,  
it is the policy to grant the Executive Directors 200% of salary 
each year, although the Committee may vary the allocation 
taking into account the circumstances which prevail at the  
time (but always subject to the plan maximum). 
PSP awards vest subject to a TSR-based performance condition 
under which the Company’s TSR performance is measured  
over a fixed three-year period commencing on 1 January in  
the financial year in which the award is granted, with no 
opportunity to re-test.  
For the awards made in 2008 and 2009, half are subject to 
performance against the constituents of the FTSE 100 Index  
at the start of the performance period (of which Tullow is a 
constituent) and the other half are subject to performance 
against the following comparator group of international Oil  
& Gas companies:  
Addax Petroleum Niko Resources 
Anadarko Noble Energy Inc. 
Apache Corporation Pioneer Natural Resources 
Cairn Energy Premier Oil 
Dana Petroleum Santos 
Forest Oil Corporation SOCO International 
Lundin Petroleum AB Talisman Energy Inc. 
Nexen Inc. Venture Production 
In line with best practice, a ‘common currency’ approach  
is adopted for calculating TSR. 
For each portion of the award, vesting is as follows: 
Company’s ranking  
in comparator group Vesting percentage 
Below median 0% 
Median 30% 
Upper quintile (top 20%) 100% 
Intermediate performance Pro rata between 30% and 100% 
In addition, no award will vest unless the Committee considers 
that both the Group’s underlying financial performance and its 
performance against other key factors (e.g. Health & Safety)  
over the relevant period is satisfactory. 
The Committee continues to believe that this approach remains 
appropriate. It encourages the Executive Directors to generate 
returns to shareholders in excess of both the market generally and 
a group of sector peers, and is a robust reflection of management’s 
success in achieving the strategic targets required to ensure the 
Group’s continued growth. Therefore, the performance condition 
applying to the forthcoming 2010 awards will remain unchanged, 
save that the following Oil & Gas comparator group will be used: 
Anadarko Marathon Oil Corporation 
Apache Corporation Nexen Inc 
BG Group Niko Resources 
Cairn Energy Noble Energy Inc 
Canadian Natural Resources Pioneer National Resources 
Dana Petroleum Premier Oil  
EOG Resources Santos  
Forest Oil Corporation Talisman Energy Inc 
Hess Corporation Woodside Petroleum 
Lundin Petroleum 
The performance condition applying to outstanding PSP awards 
made in 2007 are shown in the notes to the table on page 99.  
As permitted by the PSP rules, future awards will be granted  
as nil exercise price share options. Since the end of the financial 
year, the PSP rules have also been altered so that the exercise 
period from the end of the three year vesting period will be up to 
seven years rather than six months. This revised basis for PSP 
awards will provide participants with greater flexibility to decide 
the tax year in which their awards are taxed (very similar to the 
2000 Executive Share Option Scheme and the proposed new 
share option plan referred to below). Those who choose to defer 
exercising their awards will generally retain an interest in a 
greater number of shares than if the awards had vested earlier  
and shares had been sold to pay the tax due. The terms of 
existing unvested PSP awards vesting after 6 April 2010  
have also been amended to provide similar flexibility.  
Share Ownership Guidelines 
From 2008, to further align their interests with shareholders,  
the Executive Directors are required to retain at least 50% of  
the shares that vest under the PSP and DSBP (after selling 
sufficient shares to pay tax liabilities) until they have built up  
a shareholding worth at least 200% of base salary (with existing 
holdings taken into account). 
Share Option Scheme 
Before the introduction of the PSP in 2005, Executive Directors 
were eligible for grants of options under the 2000 Executive 
Share Option Scheme (the ‘2000 Scheme’). During 2009, options 
were granted to substantially all employees of the Group under 
the 2000 Scheme, other than the Executive Directors and other 
senior executives who were granted PSP awards.  
The 2000 Scheme will shortly expire. Therefore, as set out in the 
notice of the forthcoming AGM, shareholder approval is being 
sought for a new 2010 Share Option Plan. Its main features will 
remain largely unchanged from the 2000 Scheme. For example, 
it is intended that Executive Directors (and other PSP 
participants) will not be granted options under the new Plan. 
Directors’ Report: Corporate governance Directors’ Report: Corporate governance
www.tullowoil.com 95
All-employee Share Incentive Plans 
Executive Directors may also participate, on the same terms as 
other employees, in the Tullow Oil UK and Irish Share Incentive 
Plans. These all-employee plans enable employees to save out 
of salary up to prescribed limits each month. Each quarter’s 
contributions are used by the Plan trustees to acquire Tullow  
Oil shares (Partnership shares). The Group makes a matching 
contribution to acquire a matching number of shares (Matching 
shares) on a one-for-one basis. 
Sourcing of shares and dilution 
Awards under all the Group share schemes may be satisfied 
using either newly issued shares or shares purchased in the 
market and held in the Tullow Oil Employee Trust. Awards under 
the Group’s discretionary schemes which may be satisfied by 
new issue shares must not exceed 5% of the Company’s issued 
share capital in any rolling 10-year period, and the total of all 
awards satisfied via new issue shares under all plans must  
not exceed 10% of the Company’s issued share capital in any 
rolling 10-year period.  
As at 31 December 2009, the headroom under the Company’s  
5% and 10% limits was 6.0 million and 46.2 million shares 
respectively, out of an issued share capital of 804.3 million shares.  
As at 31 December 2009, the Tullow Oil Employee Trust  
held 0.94 million shares. 
Non-executive Directors’ fees 
A Committee of the Board comprising the Chairman and 
Executive Directors sets the remuneration of non-executive 
Directors. The fees paid are set at a level to attract individuals 
with the necessary experience and ability to make a significant 
contribution to the Group’s activities, while also reflecting the 
time commitment and responsibility of the role. Each non-
executive Director currently receives an annual fee of £57,000. 
Steven McTiernan receives an additional annual fee of £12,000  
to reflect his responsibilities as Senior Independent Director and 
Clare Spottiswoode and David Williams each receive an additional 
annual fee of £12,000 to reflect their responsibilities as Chairman 
of the Remuneration and Audit Committees respectively. Each 
non-executive Director is also entitled to reimbursement of 
necessary travel and other expenses. 
Non-executive Directors do not participate in any share scheme 
or annual bonus scheme and are not eligible to join the Group’s 
Pension Schemes. 
The Remuneration Committee, with the Chairman absenting 
himself from discussions, sets the remuneration of the 
Chairman, whose annual fee is currently £200,000.  
Performance graph 
The graph below shows Tullow’s TSR against both the FTSE  
100 Index and FTSE 250 Index over the five-year period from  
1 January 2005 to 31 December 2009. Over this period Tullow 
outperformed the indices by 766% and 746% respectively. The 
indices are set to 100 at the beginning of the period. They have 
both been shown because the FTSE 250 is the comparator Index 
for awards made under the PSP in March 2007 before Tullow 
moved to the FTSE 100 in September 2007.

points plotted are the values at intervening financial year ends. 
Service agreements and letters of appointment 
Each Executive Director has entered into a service agreement  
with Tullow Group Services Limited (dated 2 September 2002 in  
the case of Aidan Heavey and Graham Martin, dated 29 March  
2006 in the case of Paul McDade, dated 18 April 2006 in the case  
of Angus McCoss and dated 1 September 2008 in the case  
of Ian Springett). Aidan Heavey has also entered into a  
service agreement with Tullow Oil International Limited  
on 16 September 2002 on similar terms.  
The term of each service contract is not fixed, although each 
Executive Director is required to retire from service on attaining  
age 65. Each agreement is terminable by the Director on six 
months’ notice and by the relevant employing company on 12 
months’ notice. There are no specific provisions under which  
any Executive Director is entitled to receive compensation upon 
the early termination of his service agreement, other than in 
accordance with these notice periods. 
Each service agreement sets out restrictions on the ability of  
the Director to participate in businesses competing with those  
of the Group or to entice or solicit away from the Group any 
senior employees in the six months after ceasing employment. 
The above reflects the Committee’s policy that service contracts 
should be structured to reflect the interests of the Group and the 
individuals concerned, while also taking due account of market 
and best practice. It is also the Committee’s policy that, on any 
early termination of a Director’s service contract, the Committee 
will take account of the departing Director’s duty to mitigate  
his loss when determining the amount of any compensation.  Directors’ remuneration report continued

1. The awards of conditional shares made on 18 March 2009 equated to shares worth 200% of salary for each Executive Director based on the average of the  
share prices for the five dealing days preceding the date of grant. The Tullow share price on the date of grant of the awards made on 18 March 2009 was 778p.  
2.  Under the PSP 2007 awards, 50% of each award is subject to a condition that compares Tullow’s TSR to the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index (excluding  
investment trusts). The other 50% of the award is subject to a condition that compares Tullow’s TSR to a comparator group of specific oil and gas companies.  
For median performance, 30% of the relevant part of the award will vest, with full vesting for upper quartile performance. Details of the conditions applying  
to the awards made in 2008 and 2009 are set out on page 94.  
3.  The PSP awards made in March 2007 reached the end of their performance period on 31 December 2009. The Remuneration Committee determined that both parts  
of the relevant performance condition were met in full, as the Company was ranked in the upper quartile compared to both the relevant comparator groups, and the 
underlying performance of the Company was determined to be a fair reflection of the Company’s TSR. Accordingly, the Executive Directors will be eligible to receive 
their awards on 22 March 2010, the third anniversary of grant, subject to continued employment.  
4.  On 30 March 2009 and 27 April 2009, being the dates on which awards made in March and April 2006 vested, the market prices of a Tullow share were 771.5p and  
783.0p respectively.   Directors’ remuneration report continued

Results and dividends 
The profit on ordinary activities after taxation of the Group for 
the year ended 31 December 2009 amounted to £1 million
(2008: £226.2 million).  
An interim dividend of Stg2.0p (2008: Stg2.0p) per ordinary share 
was paid on 6 November 2009. The Directors recommend a final 
dividend of Stg4.0p (2008: Stg4.0p) per ordinary share which,  
if approved at the 2010 AGM, will be paid on 21 May 2010 to 
shareholders whose names are on the Register of Members  
on 16 April 2010. 
Subsequent events  
In January 2010, the Group announced the successful  
placing and subsequent issue of a total of 80,431,796 new 
ordinary shares with institutions at Stg1,150.0p per share. This 
represented an increase of approximately 9.99% in Tullow’s 
existing issued share capital. These shares were credited  
as fully paid and rank pari passu in all respects with existing 
ordinary shares of 10p each in the capital of the Company, 
including the right to receive all dividends and other 
distributions declared, made or paid on or in respect  
of such shares after the date of issue. 
In January 2010, the Group announced that it had exercised  
its pre-emption rights over Heritage Oil’s Ugandan sale for up to 
US$1.5 billion (£1.0 billion). In addition, two new potential partners 
have been identified, CNOOC and Total, and it is expected that 
each partner will acquire a one third interest in each of the 
three Ugandan blocks.  
In January 2010, the Group announced that the appraisal well, 
Tweneboa 2, proved up a combined oil and gas-condensate 
column of at least 35 metres. This has confirmed Tweneboa  
as a major oil and gas-condensate field. 
Share capital 
As at 9 March 2010, the Company had an allotted and fully paid 
up share capital of 884,749,772 ordinary shares of Stg10p each 
with an aggregate nominal value of £88,474,977.20. 
Substantial shareholdings 
As at 9 March 2010, the Company had been notified of the 
following significant holdings (being 3% or more) in the 
Company’s ordinary share capital.  
Shareholder  
Number 
of shares

BlackRock Inc  107,963,933 12.20%
Prudential plc 72,123,865 8.15%

Company Limited 38,960,366 4.40%
Legal & General Group Plc 32,230,429 3.64%
Shareholders’ rights 
The rights and obligations attaching to the shares are  
as follows: 
• Dividend rights – holders of the Company’s ordinary shares 
may, by ordinary resolution, declare dividends but may not 
declare dividends in excess of the amount recommended by 
the Directors. The Directors may also pay interim dividends. 
No dividend may be paid other than out of profits available  
for distribution. Subject to shareholder approval, payment  
or satisfaction of a dividend may be made wholly or partly  
by distribution of specific assets.  
• Voting rights – voting at any general meeting is by a show  
of hands unless a poll is duly demanded. On a show of hands 
every shareholder who is present in person at a general 
meeting (and every proxy appointed by a shareholder and 
present at a general meeting) has one vote regardless of the 
number of shares held by the shareholder (or represented by  
the proxy). On a poll, every shareholder who is present in 
person or by proxy has one vote for every share held by  
that shareholder (the deadline for exercising voting rights by 
proxy is set out in the form of proxy). A poll may be demanded  
by any of the following: (a) the Chairman of the meeting; (b) at 
least five shareholders entitled to vote and present in person 
or by proxy or represented by a duly authorised corporate 
representative at the meeting; (c) any shareholder or 
shareholders present in person or by proxy or represented by  
a duly authorised corporate representative and representing 
in the aggregate not less than one-tenth of the total voting 
rights of all shareholders entitled to attend and vote at the 
meeting; or (d) any shareholder or shareholders present in 
person or by proxy or represented by a duly authorised 
corporate representative and holding shares conferring  
a right to attend and vote at the meeting on which there  
have been paid up sums in the aggregate equal to not less 
than one-tenth of the total sum paid up on all the shares 
conferring that right.  
• Return of capital – in the event of the liquidation of the 
Company, after payment of all liabilities and deductions taking 
priority, the balance of assets available for distribution will be 
distributed among the holders of ordinary shares according to 
the amounts paid up on the shares held by them. A liquidator 
may, with the sanction of a special resolution of the 
shareholders and any other sanction required by the 
applicable legislation, (a) divide among the shareholders  
the whole or any part of the Company’s assets; or (b) vest the 
Company’s assets in whole or in part in trustees upon such 
trusts for the benefit of shareholders, but no shareholder is 
compelled to accept any assets upon which there is a liability. 
Control rights under employee share schemes 
The Company operates a number of employee share schemes. 
Under some of these arrangements, shares are held by trustees on 
behalf of employees. The employees are not entitled to exercise 
directly any voting or other control rights. The trustees will 
generally vote in accordance with employees' instructions and 
abstain where no instructions are received. Unallocated shares 
are generally voted at the discretion of the trustees. 
Restrictions on holding securities 
There are no restrictions under the Company’s Articles of 
Association or under UK law that either restrict the rights of  
UK resident shareholders to hold shares or limit the right of 
non-resident or foreign shareholders to hold or vote the 
Company’s ordinary shares. 
There are no UK foreign exchange control restrictions on  
the payment of dividends to US persons on the Company’s 
ordinary shares.

Powers of Directors 
The general powers of the Company’s Directors are set out  
in Article 97 of the Articles of Association of the Company. It 
provides that the business of the Company shall be managed  
by the Board which may exercise all the powers of the Company 
whether relating to the management of the business of the 
Company or not. This power is subject to any limitations 
imposed on the Company by applicable legislation. It is also 
limited by the provisions of the Memorandum and Articles  
of Association of the Company and any directions given by 
special resolution of the shareholders of the Company which  
are applicable on the date that any power is exercised. 
Please note the following specific provisions relevant to  
the exercise of power by the Directors:  
• Pre-emptive rights and new issues of shares – the holders  
of ordinary shares have no pre-emptive rights under the Articles 
of Association of the Company. However, the ability of the 
Directors to cause the Company to issue shares, securities 
convertible into shares or rights to shares, otherwise than 
pursuant to an employee share scheme, is restricted under 
the Companies Act 2006 which provides that the directors  
of a company are, with certain exceptions, unable to allot any 
equity securities without express authorisation, which may be 
contained in a company’s articles of association or given by its 
shareholders in general meeting, but which in either event 
Directors’ Report: Corporate governance Directors’ Report: Corporate governance
www.tullowoil.com 103
cannot last for more than five years. Under the Companies  
Act 2006, the Company may also not allot shares for cash 
(otherwise than pursuant to an employee share scheme)  
without first making an offer on a pre-emptive basis to existing 
shareholders, unless this requirement is waived by a special 
resolution of the shareholders. The Company received 
authority at the last Annual General Meeting to allot shares  
for cash on a non pre-emptive basis up to a maximum 
nominal amount of £4,004,047. The authority lasts until  
the earlier of the Annual General Meeting of the Company  
in 2010 or 30 June 2010; 
• Repurchase of shares – subject to authorisation by 
shareholder resolution, the Company may purchase its  
own shares in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.  
Any shares which have been bought back may be held as 
treasury shares or must be cancelled immediately upon 
completion of the purchase. The Company does not currently 
have shareholder authority to buy back shares; and  
• Borrowing powers – the net external borrowings of the Group 
outstanding at any time shall not exceed an amount equal to 
four times the aggregate of the Group’s adjusted capital and 
reserves calculated in the manner prescribed in Article 98  
of the Company’s Articles of Association, unless sanctioned  
by an ordinary resolution of the Company’s shareholders. 
Appointment and replacement of Directors 
The Company shall appoint (disregarding Alternate Directors) 
not less than two nor more than 15 Directors. The appointment 
and replacement of Directors may be made as follows: 
• The members may by ordinary resolution appoint any  
person who is willing to act to be a Director; 
• The Board may appoint any person who is willing to act to be a 
Director. Any Director so appointed shall hold office only until 
the next Annual General Meeting and shall then be eligible  
for election; 
• Each Director shall retire from office at the third Annual 
General Meeting after the Annual General Meeting at  
which he was last elected but he may be reappointed  
by ordinary resolution if eligible and willing;  
• The Company may by special resolution remove any Director 
before the expiration of his period of office or may, by ordinary 
resolution, remove a Director where special notice has been 
given and the necessary statutory procedures are complied 
with; and  
• There are a number of other grounds on which a Director’s 
office may cease, namely voluntary resignation, where all the 
other Directors (being at least three in number) request his 
resignation, where he suffers mental incapacity, compounds 
with his creditors, is declared bankrupt or is prohibited by  
law from being a Director. 
Charitable and political donations 
The Group made charitable, social and community-related 
donations during the year totalling £1.4 million (2008: £1.0 million). 
In line with Group policy, no donations were made for  
political purposes. 
Corporate responsibility 
The Group is fully committed to high standards of 
environmental, health and safety management. A review, 
together with an outline of the Group’s involvement in the 
community, is set out in the Corporate Responsibility section  
on pages 68 to 75. In addition, Tullow publishes annually a 
separate Corporate Responsibility Report which is available  
on the Group website: www.tullowoil.com 
Supplier payment policy 
It is Company and Group policy to settle all debts with creditors 
on a timely basis and in accordance with the terms of credit 
agreed with each supplier. The Company had no trade creditors 
outstanding at 31 December 2009. 
Auditors and disclosure of relevant audit information 
Having made the requisite enquires, so far as the Directors  
are aware, there is no relevant audit information (as defined  
by Section 418(3) of the Companies Act 2006) of which the 
Company’s auditors are unaware and each Director has taken 
all steps that ought to have been taken to make themselves 
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that  
the Company’s auditors are aware of that information 
A resolution to re-appoint Deloitte LLP as the Company’s 
auditors will be proposed at the AGM. 
Annual General Meeting 
Your attention is drawn to the Notice of Meeting enclosed  
with this Annual Report which sets out the resolutions to be 
proposed at the forthcoming AGM. The meeting will be held  
at Haberdashers’ Hall, 18 West Smithfield, London EC1A 9HQ  
on Wednesday 12 May 2010 at 12 noon.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
106 Tullow Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Accounts  
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements  
in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Group 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. The Directors are required  
by the IAS Regulation to prepare the Group financial statements 
under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union. The Group financial statements 
are also required by law to be properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.  
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that IFRS financial 
statements present fairly for each financial year the Group’s 
financial position, financial performance and cash flows.  
This requires the faithful representation of the effects of 
transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with  
the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities,  
income and expenses set out in the International Accounting 
Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the Preparation and 
Presentation of Financial Statements’. In virtually all 
circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by 
compliance with all applicable IFRSs. However, Directors  
are also required to: 
• Properly select and apply accounting policies; 
• Present information, including accounting policies, in  
a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable  
and understandable information; and  
• Provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users  
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other 
events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and 
financial performance. 
Company 
The Directors have elected to prepare the Parent Company 
financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable law). The Parent Company 
financial statements are required by law to give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Company. In preparing these 
financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently; 
• Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable  
and prudent; 
• State whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and 
• Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the Parent Company financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and  
other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity  
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Directors’ responsibility statement required by DTR 4.1.12R 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge: 
• The financial statements, prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit 
or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and 
• The management report, which is incorporated into the 
Directors’ report, includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face.

Independent auditors’ report 
To the members of Tullow Oil plc 
www.tullowoil.com 107
We have audited the Group financial statements of Tullow Oil plc  
for the year ended 31 December 2009 which comprise the Group 
income statement, the Group statement of comprehensive 
income and expense, the Group balance sheet, the Group cash flow 
statement and the related notes 1 to 33. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable 
law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)  
as adopted by the European Union. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a 
body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and 
the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for  
this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the Group financial statements and for being satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the Group 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts  
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies 
are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have  
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made  
by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the  
financial statements. 
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the Group financial statements: 
• Give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as 
at 31 December 2009 and of its profit for the year then ended; 
• Have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs  
as adopted by the European Union; and 
• Have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of 
the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation 
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued by the IASB 
As explained in the accounting policies to the Group financial 
statements, the Group in addition to complying with its legal 
obligation to apply IFRSs as adopted by the European Union,  
has also applied IFRSs as issued by the International  
Accounting Standards Board (IASB).  
In our opinion the Group financial statements comply with  
IFRSs as issued by the IASB 
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report  
for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the Group financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if,  
in our opinion: 
• Certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified  
by law are not made; or 
• We have not received all the information and explanations  
we require for our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
• The Directors’ statement contained within the Directors’ 
report in relation to going concern; and 
• The part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to 
the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 
June 2008 Combined Code specified for our review. 
Other matters 
We have reported separately on the parent company financial 
statements of Tullow Oil plc for the year ended 31 December 
2009 and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report that is described as having been audited.

(a) General information  
Tullow Oil plc is a company incorporated in Great Britain under 
the Companies Act 2006. The address of the registered office  
is given on page 162. The nature of the Group’s operations and 
its principal activities are set out in the operations and finance 
reviews on pages 32 to 61. 
(b) Adoption of new and revised standards  
In the current year, the following new and revised Standards  
and Interpretations have been adopted and have affected the 
amounts reported in these financial statements. 
Standards affecting presentation and disclosure 
IAS 1 (revised 2007) Presentation of Financial Statements 
IAS 1(2007) has introduced a number of changes in the format 
and content of the financial statements.  
Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments 
(Amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures) 
The amendments to IFRS 7 expand the disclosures required in 
respect of fair value measurements and liquidity risk. The Group 
has elected not to provide comparative information for these 
expanded disclosures in the current year in accordance with  
the transitional reliefs offered in these amendments. 
IFRS 8 Operating Segments 
IFRS 8 is a disclosure Standard that requires analyses of the 
Group’s reportable segments based on management reporting 
to the chief operating decision maker (see note 1). This has not 
resulted in any amendments to the reporting of the Group’s 
operating segments. 
Standards not affecting the reported results nor  
the financial position 
The following new and revised Standards and Interpretations 
have been adopted in the current year. Their adoption has not 
had any significant impact on the amounts reported in these 
financial statements but may impact the accounting for future 
transactions and arrangements. 
Amendment to IAS 20 Accounting for Government Grants and 
Disclosure of Government Assistance 
IAS 20 has been amended to require that the benefit of a 
government loan at a below-market rate of interest to be 
treated as a government grant. This accounting treatment  
was not permitted prior to this amendment. 
IAS 23 (revised 2007) Borrowing Costs 
The principal change to the Standard was to eliminate the option 
to expense all borrowing costs when incurred. This change has 
had no impact on these financial statements because it has 
always been the Group’s accounting policy to capitalise 
borrowing costs incurred on qualifying assets. 
Amendments to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and 
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements – Puttable Financial 
Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation 
The revisions to IAS 32 amend the criteria for debt/equity 
classification by permitting certain puttable financial 
instruments and instruments (or components of instruments)  
that impose on an entity an obligation to deliver to another  
party a pro-rata share of the net assets of the entity only on 
liquidation, to be classified as equity, subject to specified  
criteria being met. 
Amendment to IAS 38 Intangible Assets 
IAS 38 has been amended to state that an entity is permitted  
to recognise a prepayment asset for advertising or promotional 
expenditure only up to the point at which the entity has the right 
to access the goods purchased or up to the point of receipt  
of services. 
Amendments to IAS 39 Financial Instruments:  
Recognition and Measurement – Eligible Hedged Items 
The amendments provide clarification on two aspects of hedge 
accounting: identifying inflation as a hedged risk or portion,  
and hedging with options. 
Amendment to IAS 40 Investment Property 
IAS 40 has been amended to include within its scope investment 
property in the course of construction. 
Amendment to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment – Vesting 
Conditions and Cancellations 
The amendments clarify the definition of vesting conditions  
for the purposes of IFRS 2, introduce the concept of ‘non-
vesting’ conditions and clarify the accounting treatment  
for cancellations. 
Embedded Derivatives (Amendments to IFRIC 9 Reassessment 
of Embedded Derivatives and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement
The amendments clarify the accounting for embedded 
derivatives in the case of a reclassification of a financial asset 
out of the ‘fair value through profit or loss’ (FVTPL) category as 
permitted by the October 2008 amendments to IAS 39 Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. 
IFRIC 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate 
The Interpretation addresses how entities should determine 
whether an agreement for the construction of real estate is 
within the scope of IAS 11 Construction Contracts or IAS 18 
Revenue and when revenue from the construction of real  
estate should be recognised. 
IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation 
The Interpretation provides guidance on the detailed 
requirements for net investment hedging for certain  
hedge accounting designations. 
IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets from Customers (adopted  
for transfers of assets from customers received on or after  
1 July 2009) 
The Interpretation addresses the accounting by recipients  
for transfers of property, plant and equipment from ‘customers’ 
and concludes what item of property, plant and equipment 
transferred meets the definition of an asset from the 
perspective of the recipient, the recipient should recognise  
the asset at its fair value on the date of transfer, with the  
credit recognised in accordance with IAS 18 Revenue. 
) Financial statements 
Accounting policies continued
112 Tullow Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Accounts  
(b) Adoption of new and revised standards continued
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements,  
the following Standards and Interpretations which have not  
been applied in these financial statements were in issue but  
not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted  
by the EU):  
IFRS 1/ IAS 27 Cost of and investment in a subsidiary, 
jointly controlled entity or associate 
(amended) 
IFRS 3 Business combinations (revised 2008) 
IAS 27 Consolidated and separate financial 
statements (revised 2008) 
IAS 28 Investments in Associates (revised 2008) 
IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to 
Owners    
Improvements to IFRSs (April 2009) 
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of these Standards 
and Interpretations in future periods will have a material impact 
on the financial statements of the Group except for treatment of 
acquisition of subsidiaries and associates when IFRS 3 (revised 
2008), IAS 27 (revised 2008) and IAS 28 (revised 2008) come into 
effect for business combinations for which the acquisition date 
is on or after the beginning of the first annual period beginning 
on or after 1 July 2009. 
(c) Basis of accounting  
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as issued by 
the IASB and adopted by the European Union and therefore the 
Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the  
EU IAS Regulation.  
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical 
cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments that have 
been measured at fair value. The principal accounting policies 
adopted by the Group are set out below. 
The financial statements have been prepared on a going 
concern basis (see Directors’ report page 90 for further details). 
(d) Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial 
statements of the Company and entities controlled by the 
Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. 
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern 
the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as  
to obtain benefits from its activities. 
Minority interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are 
identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. Minority 
interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of 
the original business combination (see below) and the minority’s 
share of changes in equity since the date of the combination. 
Losses applicable to the minority in excess of the minority’s 
interest in the subsidiary’s equity are allocated against the 
interests of the Group except to the extent that the minority  
has a binding obligation and is able to make an additional 
investment to cover the losses. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during  
the year are included in the Group income statement from  
the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date  
of disposal, as appropriate. 
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial 
statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies  
used into line with those used by the Group. 
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses 
are eliminated on consolidation. 
Business combinations 
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the 
purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the 
aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets 
given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments 
issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus 
any costs directly attributable to the business combination. The 
acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are 
recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for 
non-current assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as 
held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 non-current assets held 
for sale and discontinued operations, which are recognised and 
measured at fair value less costs to sell. Goodwill arising on 
acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at 
cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination 
over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. If, after 
reassessment, the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the 
acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is 
recognised immediately in profit or loss. 
Joint ventures 
The Group is engaged in oil and gas exploration, development 
and production through unincorporated joint ventures. The 
Group accounts for its share of the results and net assets  
of these joint ventures as jointly controlled assets. In addition, 
where Tullow acts as operator to the joint venture, the gross 
liabilities and receivables (including amounts due to or from 
non-operating partners) of the joint venture are included in  
the Group balance sheet. 
(e) Non-current assets held for sale  
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) classified as held  
for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair 
value less costs to sell. Non-current assets and disposal groups 
are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be 
recovered through a sale transaction rather than through 
continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when  
the sale is highly probable and the asset (or disposal group)  
is available for immediate sale in its present condition. 
Management must be committed to the sale which should  
be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale  
within one year from the date of classification.   Financial statements

(f) Revenue 
Sales revenue represents the sales value, net of VAT and 
overriding royalties, of the Group’s share of liftings in the year 
together with tariff income. Revenue is recognised when goods 
are delivered and title has passed. 
Revenues received under take-or-pay sales contracts in respect 
of undelivered volumes are accounted for as deferred income. 
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference  
to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate 
applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated 
future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial 
asset to that asset’s net carrying amount. 
(g) Over/underlift 
Lifting or offtake arrangements for oil and gas produced in 
certain of the Group’s jointly owned operations are such that 
each participant may not receive and sell its precise share  
of the overall production in each period. The resulting imbalance 
between cumulative entitlement and cumulative production less 
stock is ‘underlift’ or ‘overlift’. Underlift and overlift are valued 
at market value and included within debtors and creditors 
respectively. Movements during an accounting period are 
adjusted through cost of sales such that gross profit is 
recognised on an entitlements basis. The Group’s share of any 
physical stock, warehouse stock and materials are accounted  
for at the lower of cost and net realisable value.  
(h) Inventory  
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. Cost is determined by the first-in first-out method  
and comprises direct purchase costs, cost of production, 
transportation and manufacturing expenses. Net realisable 
value is determined by reference to prices existing at the 
balance sheet date. 
(i) Foreign currencies 
The Pound Sterling is the presentation currency of the  
Group. For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial 
statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign 
operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the 
balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated  
at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange 
rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the 
exchange rates at the date of transactions are used. Currency 
translation adjustments arising on the restatement of opening 
net assets of foreign subsidiaries, together with differences 
between the subsidiaries’ results translated at average rates 
versus closing rates, are taken directly to reserves. All resulting 
exchange differences are classified as equity until disposal of 
the subsidiary. On disposal, the cumulative amounts of the 
exchange differences are recognised as income or expense. 
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of 
exchange ruling at the transaction dates. Monetary assets and 
liabilities are translated into Sterling at the exchange rate ruling 
at the balance sheet date, with a corresponding charge or credit 
to the income statement. However, exchange gains and losses 
arising on monetary items receivable from or payable to a 
foreign operation for which settlement is neither planned  
nor likely to occur, which form part of the net investment  
in a foreign operation, are recognised in the foreign currency 
translation reserve and recognised in profit or loss on disposal 
of the net investment. In addition, exchange gains and losses 
arising on long-term foreign currency borrowings which are  
a hedge against the Group’s overseas investments, are dealt 
with in reserves. 
(j) Exploration, evaluation and production assets 
The Group adopts the successful efforts method of accounting  
for exploration and appraisal costs. All licence acquisition, 
exploration and evaluation costs are initially capitalised in  
cost centres by well, field or exploration area, as appropriate. 
Directly attributable administration costs and interest payable 
are capitalised insofar as they relate to specific development 
activities. Pre-licence costs are expensed in the period in  
which they are incurred. 
These costs are then written off as exploration costs in  
the income statement unless commercial reserves have  
been established or the determination process has not  
been completed and there are no indications of impairment. 
All field development costs are capitalised as property, plant 
and equipment. Property, plant and equipment related to 
production activities are amortised in accordance with the 
Group’s depletion and amortisation accounting policy. 
(k) Commercial reserves 
Commercial reserves are proven and probable oil and gas 
reserves, which are defined as the estimated quantities of  
crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological, 
geophysical and engineering data demonstrate with a specified 
degree of certainty to be recoverable in future years from known 
reservoirs and which are considered commercially producible. 
There should be a 50 per cent statistical probability that the 
actual quantity of recoverable reserves will be more than the 
amount estimated as a proven and probable reserves and  
a 50 per cent statistical probability that it will be less. 
(l) Depletion and amortisation – discovery fields  
All expenditure carried within each field is amortised from  
the commencement of production on a unit of production  
basis, which is the ratio of oil and gas production in the period  
to the estimated quantities of commercial reserves at the end  
of the period plus the production in the period, generally on  
a field-by-field basis. Costs used in the unit of production 
calculation comprise the net book value of capitalised costs plus 
the estimated future field development costs. Changes in the 
estimates of commercial reserves or future field development 
costs are dealt with prospectively.  Financial statements 
Accounting policies continued
114 Tullow Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Accounts  
(l) Depletion and amortisation – discovery fields continued
Where there has been a change in economic conditions  
that indicates a possible impairment in a discovery field,  
the recoverability of the net book value relating to that field is 
assessed by comparison with the estimated discounted future 
cash flows based on management’s expectations of future oil 
and gas prices and future costs. Where there is evidence of 
economic interdependency between fields, such as common 
infrastructure, the fields are grouped as a single cash 
generating unit for impairment purposes. 
Any impairment identified is charged to the income statement  
as additional depletion and amortisation. Where conditions 
giving rise to impairment subsequently reverse, the effect  
of the impairment charge is also reversed as a credit to the 
income statement, net of any depreciation that would have  
been charged since the impairment. 
(m) Decommissioning 
Provision for decommissioning is recognised in full when  
the related facilities are installed. A corresponding amount 
equivalent to the provision is also recognised as part of the  
cost of the related property, plant and equipment. The  
amount recognised is the estimated cost of decommissioning, 
discounted to its net present value, and is reassessed each  
year in accordance with local conditions and requirements. 
Changes in the estimated timing of decommissioning or 
decommissioning cost estimates are dealt with prospectively by 
recording an adjustment to the provision, and a corresponding 
adjustment to property, plant and equipment. The unwinding  
of the discount on the decommissioning provision is included  
as a finance cost. 
(n) Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated in the balance sheet  
at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised 
impairment loss. Depreciation on property, plant and equipment 
other than production assets, is provided at rates calculated  
to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset 
on a straight-line basis over its expected useful economic life  
of between three and five years. 
(o) Finance costs and debt 
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets 
that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for 
their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, 
until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their 
intended use or sale.  
Finance costs of debt are allocated to periods over the term  
of the related debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount. 
Arrangement fees and issue costs are deducted from the debt 
proceeds on initial recognition of the liability and are amortised 
and charged to the Income Statement as finance costs over the 
term of the debt. 
(p) Share issue expenses and share premium account 
Costs of share issues are written off against the premium 
arising on the issues of share capital. 
(q) Taxation 
Current and deferred tax, including UK corporation tax and 
overseas corporation tax, are provided at amounts expected  
to be paid using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted 
or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred 
corporation tax is recognised on all temporary differences  
that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date 
where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay 
more, or right to pay less, tax in the future have occurred at the 
balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the 
extent that it is considered more likely than not that there will 
be suitable taxable profits from which the underlying temporary 
differences can be deducted. Deferred tax is measured on a 
non-discounted basis. 
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on 
acquisitions that are categorised as Business Combinations. 
Deferred tax is recognised at acquisition as part of the 
assessment of the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired.  
Any deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement  
as the underlying temporary difference is reversed.  
Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) is treated as an income tax  
and deferred PRT is accounted for under the temporary 
difference method. Current UK PRT is charged as a tax  
expense on chargeable field profits included in the income 
statement and is deductible for UK corporation tax. 
(r) Pensions 
Contributions to the Group’s defined contribution pension 
schemes are charged to operating profit on an accruals basis.  
(s) Derivative financial instruments  
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage  
its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates,  
interest rates and movements in oil and gas prices. 
Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value. 
The purpose for which a derivative is used is established  
at inception. To qualify for hedge accounting, the derivative  
must be ‘highly effective’ in achieving its objective and this 
effectiveness must be documented at inception and throughout  
the period of the hedge relationship. The hedge must be 
assessed on an ongoing basis and determined to have been 
‘highly effective’ throughout the financial reporting periods  
for which the hedge was designated. 
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified  
as either fair value hedges, when they hedge the exposure  
to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability,  
or cash flow hedges, where they hedge exposure to variability  
in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular  
risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or  
forecasted transaction. 
In relation to fair value hedges which meet the conditions  
for hedge accounting, any gain or loss from re-measuring  
the derivative and the hedged item at fair value is recognised 
immediately in the income statement. Any gain or loss on the 
hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against 
the carrying amount of the hedged item and recognised in the 
income statement.  Financial statements
www.tullowoil.com 115
For cash flow hedges, the portion of the gains and losses on  
the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective 
hedge is taken to equity and the ineffective portion, as well  
as any change in time value, is recognised in the income 
statement. The gains and losses taken to equity are 
subsequently transferred to the income statement during  
the period in which the hedged transaction affects the income 
statement or if the hedge is subsequently deemed to be 
ineffective. A similar treatment applies to foreign currency  
loans which are hedges of the Group’s net investment in  
the net assets of a foreign operation. 
Gains or losses on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge 
accounting treatment (either from inception or during the life of 
the instrument) are taken directly to the income statement in 
the period. 
(t) Leases 
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms  
of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards  
of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as 
operating leases and are charged to the income statement  
on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of  
the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the 
minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the 
lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the 
balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are 
apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease 
obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the 
remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged 
directly against income, unless they are directly attributable to 
qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance 
with the Group’s policy on borrowing costs. 
(u) Share-based payments 
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based 
payments. In accordance with the transitional provisions of  
that standard, only those awards that were granted after  
7 November 2002, and had not vested at 1 January 2005,  
are included. 
All share-based awards of the Company are equity settled  
as defined by IFRS 2. The fair value of these awards has been 
determined at the date of grant of the award allowing for the 
effect of any market-based performance conditions. This fair 
value, adjusted by the Group’s estimate of the number of awards 
that will eventually vest as a result of non-market conditions,  
is expensed uniformly over the vesting period. 
The fair values were calculated using a binomial option  
pricing model with suitable modifications to allow for employee 
turnover after vesting and early exercise. Where necessary, this 
model was supplemented with a Monte Carlo model. The inputs 
to the models include: the share price at date of grant; exercise 
price; expected volatility; expected dividends; risk free rate of 
interest; and patterns of exercise of the plan participants. 
(v) Financial assets 
All financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade 
date where the purchase or sale of a financial asset is under a 
contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within 
the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are 
initially measured at fair value, plus transaction costs. 
Financial assets are classified into the following specified 
categories: financial assets ‘at fair value through profit  
or loss’ (FVTPL); ‘held-to-maturity’ investments;  
‘available-for-sale’ (AFS) financial assets; and ‘loans and 
receivables’. The classification depends on the nature and 
purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the  
time of initial recognition. 
(w) Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand 
deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that 
are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are 
subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
(x) Loans and receivables 
Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have  
fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market are classified as loans and receivables. Loans and 
receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, less any impairment. Interest income is 
recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for 
short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would 
be immaterial. 
(y) Effective interest method 
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the 
amortised cost of a financial asset and of allocating interest 
income over the relevant period. The effective interest rate  
is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts 
(including all fees on points paid or received that form an 
integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and 
other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the 
financial asset, or, where appropriate, a shorter period. 
Income is recognised on an effective interest basis for debt 
instruments other than those financial assets classified as at 
FVTPL. The Group chooses not to disclose the effective interest 
rate for debt instruments that are classified as at fair value 
through profit or loss. 
(z) Financial liabilities and equity 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified 
according to the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into. 
(aa) Equity instruments 
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a  
residual interest in the assets of the group after deducting  
all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Group are 
recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.  Financial statements 
Accounting policies continued
116 Tullow Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Accounts  
(ab) Other financial liabilities 
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially 
measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Other financial 
liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised 
on an effective yield basis. The effective interest method is a 
method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability 
and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period.  
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts 
estimated future cash payments through the expected life of  
the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period. 
(ac) Critical accounting judgements and key sources of 
estimation uncertainty 
Details of the Group’s significant accounting judgements and 
critical accounting estimates are set out in these financial 
statements and include: 
• Carrying value of intangible exploration and evaluation fixed 
assets (note 9); 
The recoverability of intangible exploration assets is assessed by 
comparing the carrying value to internal and operator estimates 
of the net present value of projects. Intangible exploration 
assets are inherently judgemental to value and further details 
on the accounting policy is included in accounting note (j). 
• Carrying value of property, plant and equipment (note 10); 
Management perform impairment tests on the Group’s property, 
plant and equipment assets at least annually with reference to 
indicators in IAS 36. Key assumptions in the impairment models 
relate to prices that are based on forward curves for two years  
and the long-term corporate assumptions thereafter and 
discount rates that are risked to reflect conditions specific  
to individual assets. 
• Commercial reserves estimates (note 10); 
Proven and probable reserves are estimated using standard 
recognised evaluation techniques. The estimate is reviewed at 
least twice annually and is regularly reviewed by independent 
consultants. Future development costs are estimated taking  
into account the level of development required to produce the 
reserves by reference to operators, where applicable, and 
internal engineers.  
• Presumption of going concern; 
Refer to directors report page 90. 
• Derivative financial instruments (note 17); 
The Groups derivative financial instruments are marked  
to market.  
• Decommissioning costs (note 20); and 
The cost of decommissioning are reviewed twice annually and is 
estimated by reference to operators, where applicable, and 
internal engineers. 
Provision for environmental clean-up and remediation costs are 
based on current legal and constructive requirements, 
technology and price levels. 
• Recoverability of deferred tax assets (note 20).  Financial statements

Note 1. Segmental reporting 
The Group has adopted IFRS 8 Operating Segments with effect from 1 January 2009. IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be 
identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive to
allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance. The adoption of IFRS 8 has not resulted in any changes in the 
disclosure of the Group’s operating segments. 
In the opinion of the Directors, the operations of the Group comprise one class of business, oil and gas exploration, development and 
production and the sale of hydrocarbons and related activities. The Group also operates within four geographical markets, Europe, 
Africa, South Asia and South America. 
The following tables present revenue, profit and certain asset and liability information regarding the Group’s business segments for

(b) Factors affecting tax charge for period 
The tax rates applied to profit on ordinary activities in preparing the reconciliation below is the upstream UK corporation tax
applicable to the Group’s oil and gas activities plus the rate of Supplementary corporation tax (SCT).  
The difference between the total current tax charge shown above and the amount calculated by applying the standard rate  
of UK corporation tax applicable to UK profits derived from upstream activities (30%) plus the rate of SCT in respect of UK  
upstream profits (20%) to the profit before tax is as follows:

Income taxed at a different rate 3.5 (29.8)
Income not subject to corporation tax (41.3) (170.0)
Group total tax expense for the year 1.8 73.1
The Group’s profit before taxation will continue to be subject to jurisdictions where the effective rate of taxation differs from that  
in the UK. Furthermore, unsuccessful exploration expenditure is often incurred in jurisdictions where the Group has no taxable 
profits, such that no related tax benefit arises. Accordingly, the Group’s tax charge will continue to depend on the jurisdictions  
in which pre-tax profits and exploration costs written off arise.  
The Group has tax losses of £363.3 million (2008: £155.0 million) that are available indefinitely for offset against future taxable profits 
in the companies in which the losses arose. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as they may not 
be used to offset taxable profits elsewhere in the Group. 
The Group has recognised £24.4 million in deferred tax assets in relation to taxable losses (2008: £nil). 
No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of £277.0 million (2008: £270.0 million) relating to unremitted 
earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and
it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The amounts for intangible exploration and evaluation assets represent active exploration projects. These amounts will be written  
off to the Income Statement as exploration costs unless commercial reserves are established or the determination process is not
completed and there are no indications of impairment. The outcome of ongoing exploration, and therefore whether the carrying 
value of exploration and evaluation assets will ultimately be recovered, is inherently uncertain. 
Additions include capitalised interest of £11.0 million (2008: £nil). The Group only capitalises interest in respect of intangible 
exploration and evaluation assets where it is considered that development is inevitable and advanced appraisal and development 
is ongoing. 
In 2008 amounts written off included an impairment charge calculated in accordance with IAS 36 – Impairment of assets of  
£60.1 million determined by estimating its value in use. The impairment resulted from lower reserves estimates following a  
change in the most likely development plans and lower assumed oil prices following the fall in oil prices in the second half of
2008. In calculating this impairment, management used a range of assumptions, including a long-term oil price of $80 per  
barrel and a 15% pre-tax discount rate.   Financial statements

Additions include capitalised interest of £14.3 million (2008: £6.0 million). 
The carrying amount of the Group’s oil and gas assets includes an amount of £8.5 million (2008: £9.8 million) in respect of assets 
held under finance leases. 
Other fixed assets include leasehold improvements, motor vehicles and office equipment. 
The 2009 impairment loss relates to the Chinguetti field in Mauritania (2008: Chinguetti field in Mauritania).The recoverable amount was 
determined by estimating its value in use. In calculating this impairment, management used a production profile based on proven
and probable reserves estimates and a range of assumptions, including an oil price assumption equal to the forward curve  
in 2010 and 2011 and $80 per barrel thereafter and a pre-tax discount rate assumption of 15%.  
Depletion and amortisation for oil and gas properties is calculated on a unit-of-production basis, using the ratio of oil and gas 
production in the period to the estimated quantities of commercial reserves at the end of the period plus production in the period, 
generally on a field-by-field basis. Commercial reserves estimates are based on a number of underlying assumptions including oil 
and gas prices, future costs, oil and gas in place and reservoir performance, which are inherently uncertain. Commercial reserves 
estimates are based on a Group reserves report produced by an independent engineer. However, the amount of reserves that will 
ultimately be recovered from any field cannot be known with certainty until the end of the field’s life.  Financial statements

Capital management  
The Group defines capital as the total equity of the Group. Capital is managed in order to provide returns for shareholders and
benefits to stakeholders and to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. Tullow is not subject to any externally-
imposed capital requirements. 
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may put in place new debt facilities, issue new shares for cash, repay  
debt, engage in active portfolio management, adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, or other such restructuring activities  
as appropriate. 
No significant changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the year ended 31 December 2009. 
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the net debt ratio, that is, the ratio of net debt to net debt plus equity. Net debt is 
calculated as gross debt, as shown in the balance sheet, less cash and cash equivalents.

The movement from 2008 is attributable to higher external borrowings during 2009, principally as a result of the Group’s  
£757.4 million investment in development, appraisal and exploration activities in conjunction with holding less cash as at  
31 December 2009 which is offset by an increase in equity attributable to the equity raise in January 2009.

payables, at 31 December 2009 was as follows:

www.tullowoil.com 129
The profile at 31 December 2008 for comparison purposes was as follows: 
Floating rate debt comprises bank borrowings at interest rates fixed in advance from overnight to three months at rates determined 
by US Dollar LIBOR and Sterling LIBOR. Fixed rate debt comprises bank borrowings at interest rates fixed in advance for periods
greater than three months or bank borrowings where the interest rate has been fixed through interest rate hedging. The  
US$2 billion Reserves Based Lending Facility incurs interest on outstanding debt at Sterling or US Dollar LIBOR plus a margin 
ranging from 350 basis points to 375 basis points. The outstanding debt is repayable in variable amounts (determined semi-annually)  
over the period to 31 December 2015, or such time as is determined by reference to the remaining reserves of the assets, whichever 
is earlier. There is no requirement under the Reserves Based Lending Facility to hedge interest rate exposure to Sterling LIBOR
and US Dollar LIBOR. The Reserves Based Lending Facility states that consideration should be given to hedging at least 30% of the 
interest rate exposure to fluctuations in LIBOR for Sterling and US Dollars in respect of loans under the facility, net of relevant  
cash balances. 
The US$250m Revolving Credit Facility is repayable in full on 31 December 2011. The facility incurs interest on outstanding debt  
at US Dollar LIBOR plus a margin of 500 basis points. The Revolving Credit Facility states that the terms of the Reserves Based
Lending Facility Hedging Policy (above) shall apply to the Revolving Credit Facility.  
At the end of December 2009, the headroom under the two facilities amounted to US$620 million (£389.3 million); US$370 million 
(£232.3 million) under the US$2 billion Reserves Based Lending and US$250 million (£157.0 million) under the Revolving Credit 
Facility. At the end of December 2008, the headroom under the two facilities was US$335 million (£231.4 million); US$235 million 
(£162.3 million) under the US$1,350 million Reserves Based Lending Facility and US$100 million (£69.1 million) under the Hardman 
Bridge Facility. 
The Group is exposed to floating rate interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at floating interest rates. The Group 
hedges its floating rate interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis through the use of interest rate derivatives, namely interest  
rate swaps, interest rate collars and interest rate caps. The Group put in place a material interest rate hedging programme in mid  
2009. The two year interest rate swaps currently in place have an average swap rate of 2.61% for a current notional principal  
of US$100 million (£62.8 million). The three year interest rate swaps currently in place have an average swap rate of 2.19% for a 
current notional principal of US$250 million (£156.7 million). The five year interest rate swaps currently in place have an average 
swap rate of 3.14% for a notional principal of US$50 million (£31.4 million). The effect of the interest rate collar currently in place 
limits the exposure to US Dollar LIBOR at varying rates (maximum of 4.3%) over the remaining life of the derivative (May 2011) for  
a current notional principal of US$50 million (£31.4 million). The combined mark-to-market position as at 31 December 2009 was 
£5.6 million out of the money (2008: £2.1 million out of the money). The interest rate hedges excluding the collar are included in  
the fixed rate debt in 2009, in the above table, and were also included in the fixed rate debt in 2008. 
Foreign currency risk  
Wherever possible, the Group conducts and manages its business in Sterling (UK) and US Dollars (all other countries), the operating 
currencies of the industry in the areas in which it operates. The Group’s borrowing facilities are also denominated in Sterling and  
US Dollars, which further assists in foreign currency risk management. From time to time the Group undertakes certain transactions 
denominated in foreign currencies. These exposures are managed by executing foreign currency financial derivatives, typically to 
manage exposures arising on corporate transactions such as acquisitions and disposals. There were no foreign currency financial
derivatives in place at the 2009 year end. Cash balances are held in other currencies to meet immediate operating and 
administrative expenses or to comply with local currency regulations.  
As at 31 December 2009, the only material monetary assets or liabilities of the Group that were not denominated in the functional 
currency of the respective subsidiaries involved were US$1,337 million (£839.4 million) cash drawings under the US$2 billion 
Reserved Based Lending Facility. As at 31 December 2008, the only material monetary assets or liabilities of the Group that were not 
denominated in the functional currency of the respective subsidiaries involved were US$930 million (£642.3 million) cash drawings 
under the US$1,350 million Borrowing Base Facility and US$100 million (£69.1 million) cash drawings under the US$200 million 
Hardman Bridge Facility. These US Dollar cash drawings at 31 December 2009 continue to be held as a hedge against US Dollar 
denominated net assets in subsidiaries.  
The carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date
are net liabilities of £739.9 million (2008: net liabilities of £444.5 million).

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis  
The Group is mainly exposed to fluctuations in the US Dollar. The Group measures its market risk exposure by running various 
sensitivity analyses including 20% favourable and adverse changes in the key variables. The sensitivity analyses include only 
outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 20% change  
in foreign currency rates. 
As at 31 December 2009, a 20% increase in Sterling against the US Dollar would have resulted in a decrease in foreign  
currency denominated liabilities and equity of £142.3 million (2008: £133.1 million) and a 20% decrease in Sterling against  
US Dollar would have resulted in an increase in foreign currency denominated liabilities and equity of £213.4 million  
(2008: £199.7 million). 
Liquidity risk  
The Group manages the liquidity requirements by the use of both short- and long-term cash flow projections, supplemented by 
maintaining debt financing plans and active portfolio management. Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with 
the Board of Directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Group’s 
short-, medium- and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements. 
The Group closely monitors and manages its liquidity risk. Cash forecasts are regularly produced and sensitivities run for different 
scenarios including, but not limited to, changes in commodity prices, different production rates from the Group’s portfolio of 
producing fields and delays in development projects. The Group normally seeks to ensure that it has a minimum ongoing capacity 
of $500 million (£320 million) for a period of at least 12 months to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
Following the equity placing announced in January 2010, the planned portfolio activity and the US$2 billion financing already secured 
in March 2009, the Group’s forecasts and projections show that there is significant capacity and financial flexibility for the 12 months 
from the date of this Annual Report and Accounts. 
After taking account of the above, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue  
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
Annual Report and Accounts. 
The following table details the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities with agreed
repayment periods. The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the  
earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.

Note 18. Financial instruments 
Financial risk management objectives 
The Group holds a portfolio of commodity derivative contracts, with various counterparties, covering both its underlying oil and gas 
businesses. In addition, the Group holds a small portfolio of interest rate derivatives. The use of financial derivatives is governed by 
the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors. Compliance with policies and exposure limits is reviewed by the internal 
auditors on a regular basis. The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, 
for speculative purposes. 
Fair values of financial assets and liabilities 
The Group considers the carrying value of all the financial assets and liabilities to be materially the same as the fair value.
The Group has no material financial assets that are past due. The Group predominately sells to large oil and gas multinationals and 
no financial assets are impaired at the balance sheet date and all are considered to be fully recoverable. 
Fair values of derivative instruments 
Under IAS 39 all derivatives must be recognised at fair value on the balance sheet with changes in such fair value between 
accounting periods being recognised immediately in the income statement, unless the derivatives have been designated as cash flow 
or fair value hedges. The fair value is the amount for which the asset or liability could be exchanged in an arm’s length transaction at 
the relevant date. Fair values are determined using quoted market prices (marked-to-market values) where available. To the extent 
that market prices are not available, fair values are estimated by reference to market-based transactions, or using standard 
valuation techniques for the applicable instruments and commodities involved. 
The Group’s derivative instrument book and fair values were as follows: 
The derivatives’ maturity and the timing of the recycling into profit or loss coincide. 
The following provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, 
grouped into Level 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: 
All derivative financial instruments of the Group are level 2 (2008: level 2). 
Level 1: fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
Level 2: fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable 
for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and 
Level 3: fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are 
not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). 
There were no transfers between Level 1 and 2 during the year. 
Market risk 
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and 
interest rates.

Oil and gas prices 
The Group uses a number of derivative instruments to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with its underlying oil and  
gas revenues. Such commodity derivatives will tend to be priced using pricing benchmarks, such as Brent Dated, D-1 Heren and  
M-1 Heren, which correlate as far as possible to the underlying oil and gas revenues respectively. The Group hedges its estimated  
oil and gas revenues on a portfolio basis, aggregating its oil revenues from substantially all of its African oil interests and its gas 
revenues from substantially all of its UK gas interests. 
At 31 December 2009, the Group’s oil hedge position was summarised as follows:  
Oil hedges H1 2010 H2 2010 2011 2012
Volume – bopd 14,500 14,500 10,500 6,500
Average Price* – $/bbl 81.39 83.83 85.77 88.02
* Average hedge prices are based on market prices as at 31 December 2009 and represent the current value of hedged volumes at that date. 
At 31 December 2009, the Group’s gas hedge position was summarised as follows:  
Gas hedges H1 2010 H2 2010 2011 2012
Volume – mmscfd 32.73 19.71 10.43 4.31

* Average hedge prices are based on market prices as at 31 December 2009 and represent the current value of hedged volumes at that date. 
As at 31 December 2009, all of the Group’s oil and gas derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedges. The Group’s oil and  
gas hedges have been assessed to be ‘highly effective’ within the range prescribed under IAS 39 using regression analysis on oil and ratio 
analysis on gas. There is, however, a degree of ineffectiveness inherent in the Group’s oil hedges arising from, among other factors, 
the discount on the Group’s underlying African crude relative to Brent and the timing of oil liftings relative to the hedges. There is 
also a degree of ineffectiveness inherent in the Group’s gas hedges which arise from, among other factors, field production 
performance on any day.

The hedge reserve represents the cumulative portion of gains and losses on hedging instruments deemed effective in cash flow 
hedges. The movement for the period in the hedge reserve is recognised in other comprehensive income. 
Gains from settlements during the period amounted to £15.3 million, while revaluation losses during the period amounted to  
£25.6 million. The resulting total reclassification from equity to profit or loss during the period was £40.9 million. Gains transferred 
from equity into profit and loss during the period of £15.3 million are included in the revenue line. 
Financial derivatives 
The Group internally measures its market risk exposure by running various sensitivity analyses, including utilising 10% favourable 
and adverse changes in the key variables. 
Oil and gas sensitivity analysis 
The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being Dated Brent 
oil prices and UK D-1 Heren and M-1 Heren natural gas prices. The sensitivity analysis, which is used internally by management to 
monitor financial derivatives, has been prepared using the following assumptions: 
• The pricing adjustments relate only to the point forward mark-to-market (MTM) evaluations; 
• The price sensitivities assume there is no ineffectiveness related to the oil and gas hedges; and 
• The sensitivities have been run only on the intrinsic element of the hedge as management consider this to be the material 
component of the MTM oil and gas hedges. 
As at 31 December 2009, a 10% increase in the dated Brent oil price curve would have decreased equity by approximately  
£10.3 million (2008: £22.0 million), a 10% decrease would have increased equity by approximately £6.6 million (2008: £27.0 million). 
As at 31 December 2009, a 10% increase in the UK D-1 Heren and M-1 Heren natural gas price curves would have decreased  
equity by approximately £2.9 million (2008: £10.5 million), a 10% decrease would have increased equity by approximately £3.2 million  
(2008: £10.3 million). 
Interest rate sensitivity analysis 
As at 31 December 2009, the interest rate derivative position was out-of-the-money to an amount of £5.6 million (2008: £2.1 million); 
a 25bps increase in the underlying interest rate would increase equity by approximately £1.5 million (2008: £0.5 million). 
Credit risk 
Credit risk refers to the risk that the counterparty will fail to perform or fail to pay amounts due, resulting in financial loss to the 
Group. The primary activities of the Group are oil and gas exploration and production. The Group has a credit policy that governs the 
management of credit risk, including the establishment of counterparty credit limits and specific transaction approvals. The Group 
limits credit risk by assessing creditworthiness of potential counterparties before entering into transactions with them and 
continuing to evaluate their credit worthiness after transactions have been initiated. The Group attempts to mitigate credit risk by 
entering into contracts that permit netting and allow for termination of the contract upon the occurrence of certain events of default. 
The Group’s exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of 
transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties. 
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having  
similar characteristics. The maximum financial exposure due to credit risk on the Group’s financial assets, representing the sum  
of cash and cash equivalents, investments, derivative assets, trade receivables and other current assets, as at 31 December was
£404.2 million (2008: £490.2 million).

The decommissioning provision represents the present value of decommissioning costs relating to the UK, African and Asian oil  
and gas interests, which are expected to be incurred up to 2025. These provisions have been created based on Tullow’s internal 
estimates and, where available and appropriate, operator’s estimates. Assumptions, based on the current economic environment, 
have been made which management believe are a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the future liability. These estimates  
are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions. However, actual decommissioning costs  
will ultimately depend upon future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works required which will reflect market 
conditions at the relevant time. Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning is likely to depend on when the fields cease to  
produce at economically viable rates. This in turn will depend upon future oil and gas prices, which are inherently uncertain.

Deferred tax liabilities (297.6) (347.9)
Deferred tax assets 31.6 –
No deferred tax has been provided on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, as the Group has no plans to remit these to the 
UK in the foreseeable future.  
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent it is considered probable that those assets will be recoverable. This involves  
an assessment of when those deferred tax assets are likely to reverse, and a judgement as to whether or not there will be sufficient  
taxable profits available to offset the tax assets when they do reverse. This requires assumptions regarding future profitability and  
is therefore inherently uncertain. To the extent assumptions regarding future profitability change, there can be an increase  
or decrease in the level of deferred tax assets recognised which can result in a charge or credit in the period in which the  
change occurs.

2005 Performance Share Plan (PSP) 
Under the PSP, senior executives can receive conditional awards of rights over whole shares worth up to 200% of salary p.a. (300% in 
exceptional circumstances). Awards granted in 2009 vest subject to a Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance condition. Half of 
an award is tested against constituents of the FTSE 100 index (excluding investment trusts) and the other half against a comparator 
group of oil and gas companies. Performance is measured over a fixed three year period starting on 1 January prior to grant, and  
an individual must normally remain in employment for three-years from grant for the shares to vest. No dividends are paid over 
the vesting period. There are further details of PSP award measurement in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 94.

The expected life is the period from date of grant to vesting. Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility 
of the Company’s share price over a period commensurate with the expected life of the awards. The weighted average fair value of 
the awards granted in 2009 was 579.9p per award (2008: 653.9p). 
The Group recognised a total expense of £3.6 million (2008: £4.0 million) in respect of the PSP. 
2005 Deferred Share Bonus Plan (DSBP) 
Under the DSBP, the portion of any annual bonus above 75% of the base salary (60% for bonuses paid for 2007 and earlier years) of  
a senior executive nominated by the Remuneration Committee is deferred into shares. DSBP awards normally vest following the end
of three financial years commencing with that in which the award is granted.

2000 Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) 
The only share option scheme operated by the Company during the year was the 2000 ESOS. Options normally only become 
exercisable from the third anniversary of the date of the grant and if the performance condition has been met. The awards are tested 
against constituents of an index and 100% of awards will vest if the Company’s TSR is above the median of the index over three years 
following grant. For awards from March 2008 the Index is the FTSE 100 index (excluding investment trusts); for awards before March 
2008, the Index is the FTSE 250 index (excluding investment trusts).  
Options granted under the previous 1998 ESOS had all been exercised at 31 December 2009. All awards under the 1998 ESOS  
were made prior to 7 November 2002 and therefore, under the IFRS transitional provisions, they have not been accounted for  
in accordance with IFRS 2 – Share-based payments. 
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average exercise prices (WAEP) of, and movements in, share options under 
the 1998 ESOS and the 2000 ESOS during the year.

The weighted average share price at exercise for options exercised in 2009 was 1,000.5p (2008: 854.3p).  
Options outstanding at 31 December 2009 had exercise prices of 63.0p to 1,179.0p and remaining contractual lives of 1 to 10 years.  
The fair values were calculated using a proprietary binomial valuation model. The principal inputs to the options valuation  
model were: 
Risk free interest rate 1.9-2.5% pa
Expected volatility 49%
Dividend yield 0.5-0.8% pa
Employee turnover 5% pa

UK & Irish Share Incentive Plans (SIPs) 
The SIPs were launched at the beginning of 2004. These are all employee plans, which have been set up in the UK and Ireland, 
enable employees to save out of salary up to prescribed monthly limits. Contributions are used by the Plan trustees to acquire 
Tullow shares (‘Partnership Shares’). The Company makes a matching contribution to acquire a matching number of Tullow shares 
(‘Matching Shares’) on a one-for-one basis at the end of each three month accumulation period. Matching shares are subject to time 
based forfeiture over three years on leaving employment in certain circumstances or if the related Partnership shares are sold.
The fair value of a Matching Share is its market value at the start of the accumulation period. 
For the UK plan, Partnership Shares are purchased at the lower of the market values at the start of the Accumulation Period and
the purchase date (which is treated as a three month share option for IFRS 2 purposes). For the Irish plan, shares are bought at the 
market price at the purchase date which does not result in any IFRS 2 accounting charge. 
Matching shares vest three years after grant and dividends are paid to the employee during this period. 
The Group recognised a total expense of £0.1 million (2008: £0.1 million) for the matching shares and £0.1 million (2008: £0.1 million) 
for the partnership shares.

Operating lease payments represent rentals payable by the Group for certain of its office properties and a lease for an FPSO vessel 
for use on the Chinguetti field in Mauritania. Leases on office properties are negotiated for an average of six years and rentals are 
fixed for an average of six years. The FPSO lease runs for a minimum period of seven years from February 2006 and the contract 
provides for an option to extend the lease for a further three years at a slightly reduced rate.

Note 32. Subsequent events 
Since the balance sheet date Tullow has continued to progress its exploration, development and business growth strategies. 
In January 2010 the Group announced the successful placing and subsequent issue of a total of 80,431,796 new ordinary shares with 
institutions at 1,150 pence per share. This represents an increase of approximately 9.99% in Tullow’s existing issued share capital. 
These shares are credited as fully paid and rank pari passu in all respects with existing ordinary shares of 10 pence each in the 
capital of the Company, including the right to receive all dividends and other distributions declared, made or paid on or in respect  
of such shares after the date of issue. 
In January 2010 the Group announced that it had exercised its pre-emption rights over Heritage Oil’s Ugandan sale for up to  
$1.5 billion (£1.0 billion). In addition, two new potential partners have been identified, CNOOC and Total, and it is expected that  
each partner will acquire a one third interest in each of the three Ugandan blocks. The Group expects the transaction to be signed  
in the coming weeks. 
In January 2010 the Group announced that the appraisal well, Tweneboa 2, proved up a combined oil and gas-condensate column  
of at least 35 metres. This has confirmed Tweneboa as a major oil and gas-condensate field. 
Note 33. Pension schemes 
The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes for staff and Executive Directors. The contributions are payable  
to external funds which are administered by independent trustees. Contributions during the year amounted to £3.3 million  
(2008: £2.2 million). At 31 December 2009, there was a liability of £0.6 (2008: £0.1 million) for contributions payable included  
in creditors.  Financial statements

An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts  
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies 
are appropriate to the Parent Company’s circumstances and 
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed;  
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates  
made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements. 
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the Parent Company financial statements:  
• Give a true and fair view of the state of the Parent Company’s 
affairs as at 31 December 2009; 
• Have been properly prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and

year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the Parent Company financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if,  
in our opinion: 
• Adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have  
not been received from branches not visited by us; or 
• The Parent Company financial statements and the part of  
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not  
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
• Certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified  
by law are not made; or 
• We have not received all the information and explanations  
we require for our audit.

Notes to the Company financial statements 
Year ended 31 December 2009 
www.tullowoil.com 
(a) Basis of accounting  
The financial statements have been prepared under the 
historical cost convention in accordance with the Companies  
Act 2006 and UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles  
(UK GAAP). The following paragraphs describe the main 
accounting policies under UK GAAP which have been  
applied consistently.  
In accordance with the provisions of Section 408 of the 
Companies Act, the profit and loss account of the Company  
is not presented separately. During the year the Company  
made a loss of £15.4 million. In accordance with the exemptions 
available under FRS 1 ‘Cash Flow Statements’, the Company 
has not presented a cash flow statement as the cash flow of  
the Company has been included in the cash flow statement  
of Tullow Oil plc Group set out on page 110. 
(b) Investments 
Fixed asset investments, including investments in subsidiaries, 
are stated at cost and reviewed for impairment if there are 
indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. 
(c) Finance costs and debt 
Finance costs of debt are allocated to periods over the term  
of the related debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount.  
Interest-bearing bank loans are recorded at the proceeds 
received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including 
premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue 
costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the profit and 
loss account using the effective interest method and are added 
to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they 
are not settled in the period in which they arise. 
(d) Financial liabilities and equity 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified 
according to the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences  
a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting  
all of its liabilities. 
(e) Foreign currencies 
Sterling is the reporting currency of the Company. Transactions 
in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange 
ruling at the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling  
at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date, with  
a corresponding charge or credit to the profit and loss account. 
However, exchange gains and losses arising on long-term 
foreign currency borrowings, which are a hedge against the 
Company’s overseas investments, are dealt with in reserves. 
(f) Share issue expenses and share premium account 
Costs of share issues are written off against the premium 
arising on the issues of share capital. 
(g) Taxation 
Current and deferred tax, including UK corporation tax, is 
provided at amounts expected to be paid using the tax rates  
and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by  
the balance sheet date. 
(h) Share-based payments 
The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20  
Share-based payments. In accordance with the transitional 
provisions of that standard, only those awards that were  
granted after 7 November 2002, and had not vested at  
1 January 2005, are included. 
All share-based awards of the Company are equity settled  
as defined by FRS 20. The fair value of these awards has been 
determined at the date of grant of the award allowing for the 
effect of any market-based performance conditions. This fair 
value, adjusted by the Company’s estimate of the number of 
awards that will eventually vest as a result of non-market 
conditions, is expensed uniformly over the vesting period. 
The fair values were calculated using a binomial option  
pricing model with suitable modifications to allow for employee 
turnover after vesting and early exercise. Where necessary this 
model was supplemented with a Monte Carlo model. The inputs 
to the models include: the share price at date of grant; exercise 
price; expected volatility; expected dividends; risk free rate of 
interest; and patterns of exercise of the plan participants. 
(i) Capital management 
The Company defines capital as the total equity of the Company. 
Capital is managed in order to provide returns for shareholders 
and benefits to stakeholders and to safeguard the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. Tullow is not subject to 
any externally-imposed capital requirements. To maintain or 
adjust the capital structure, the Company may adjust the 
dividend payment to shareholders, return capital, issue new  
shares for cash, repay debt, and put in place new debt facilities.

* The Company is deemed to control Tulipe Oil SA in accordance with FRS 2 as it has a majority of the voting rights on the board of Tulipe Oil SA. 
The Company is required to assess the carrying values of each of its investments in subsidiaries for impairment. The net assets
of certain of the Company’s subsidiaries are predominantly intangible exploration and evaluation (E&E) assets. Where facts and 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an E&E asset held by a subsidiary may exceed its recoverable amount, by 
reference to the specific indicators of impairment of E&E assets in IFRS 6, an impairment test of the asset is performed by the
subsidiary undertaking and the asset is impaired by any difference between its carrying value and its recoverable amount. The 
recognition of such an impairment by a subsidiary is used by the Company as the primary basis for determining whether or not  
there are indications that the investment in the related subsidiary may also be impaired, and thus whether an impairment test  
of the investment carrying value needs to be performed. The results of exploration activities are inherently uncertain, and the
assessment for impairment of E&E assets by the subsidiary, and that of the related investment by the Company, is judgemental.  Financial statements

Company bank loans are stated net of unamortised arrangement fees of £51.2 million (2008: £11.8 million). 
Term loans and guarantees are secured by fixed and floating charges over the oil and gas assets (note 10) of the Group.  
Interest rate risk  
The interest rate profile of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2009 was as follows: 
The profile at 31 December 2008 for comparison purposes was as follows: 
Cash at bank at floating interest rate consisted of deposits which earn interest at rates set in advance for periods ranging  
from overnight to one month by reference to market rates. 
Floating rate debt comprises bank borrowings at interest rates fixed in advance from overnight to three months at rates determined 
by US Dollar LIBOR and Sterling LIBOR. Fixed rate debt comprises bank borrowings at interest rates fixed in advance for periods
greater than three months or bank borrowings where the interest rate has been fixed through interest rate hedging. 
The US$2 billion Reserves Based Lending Facility incurs interest on outstanding debt at Sterling or US Dollar LIBOR plus a margin  
ranging from 350 basis points to 375 basis points depending on utilisation and concentration of non-OECD assets. The outstanding debt  
is repayable in variable amounts (determined semi-annually) over the period to 31 December 2015, or such time as is determined 
by reference to the remaining reserves of the assets, whichever is earlier. The Reserves Based Lending Facility states that 
consideration should be given to hedging at least 30% of the interest rate exposure to fluctuations in LIBOR for Sterling and  
US Dollars in respect of loans under the facility, net of relevant cash balances. 
The $250 million Corporate Facility is a revolving facility which is repayable in full on 31 December 2011. The facility incurs interest 
ints. The Corporate Facility states that the terms of the
 shall apply to the Corporate Facility.

Company hedges its floating rate interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis through the use of interest rate derivatives, namely 
interest rate swaps, interest rate collars and interest rate caps. The two year interest rate swaps currently in place have an average 
swap rate of 2.61% for a current notional principal of US$100 million (£62.8 million). The three year interest rate swaps currently  
in place have an average swap rate of 2.19% for a current notional principal of US$250 million (£156.7 million). The five year interest 
rate swaps currently in place have an average swap rate of 3.14% for a notional principal of US $50 million (£31.4 million). The  
effect of the interest rate collar currently in place limits the exposure to US Dollar LIBOR at varying rates (maximum of 4.3%)
over the remaining life of the derivative (May 2011) for a current notional principal of US$50 million (£31.4 million). The combined 
mark-to-market position as at the 2009 year end was £5.6 million (2008: £2.1 million). The interest rate hedges are included in
the fixed rate debt in 2009, in the above table, and were also included in fixed rate debt in 2008.  
Foreign currency risk  
As at 31 December 2009, the only material monetary assets or liabilities of the Company that were not denominated in the functional 
currency of the respective subsidiaries involved were US$1,337 million (£839.4 million) cash drawings under the US$2 billion 
Borrowing Base Facility. As at 31 December 2008 the only material assets or liabilities that were not denominated in the functional 
currency of the respective subsidiaries involved were US$930 million (£642.3 million) cash drawings under the US$1,350 million 
Borrowing Base facility and US$100 million (£69.1 million) cash drawings under the $200 million Hardman Bridge Facility. These 
US Dollar cash drawings at 31 December 2009 continue to be held as a hedge against US Dollar denominated net assets in subsidiaries.  
The net carrying amount of the Company’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting
date was £825.3 million (2008: £711.3 million).  
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis  
The Company is mainly exposed to fluctuation in the US dollar. The Group measures its market risk exposure by running various 
sensitivity analyses including 20% favourable and adverse changes in the key variables. The sensitivity analyses include only 
outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 20% change in 
foreign currency rates. 
As at 31 December 2009, a 20% increase in Sterling against the US Dollar would have resulted in a decrease in foreign currency 
denominated liabilities and equity of £140.0 million (2008: £118.6 million 20% decrease) and a 20% decrease in Sterling against
US Dollar would have resulted in an increase in foreign currency denominated liabilities and equity of £209.9 million  
(2008: £177.8million 20% increase).

Note 11. Share-based payments 
2005 Performance Share Plan (PSP) 
Under the PSP, senior executives can receive conditional awards of rights over whole shares worth up to 200% of salary p.a. (300% in 
exceptional circumstances). Awards granted in 2009 vest subject to a Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance condition. Half of 
an award is tested against constituents of the FTSE 100 index (excluding investment trusts) and the other half against a comparator 
group of oil and gas companies. Performance is measured over a fixed three year period starting on 1 January prior to grant, and  
an individual must normally remain in employment for three-years from grant for the shares to vest. No dividends are paid over 
the vesting period. There are further details of PSP award measurement in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 94. 
The shares outstanding under the PSP are as follows:

2005 Deferred Share Bonus Plan (DSBP) 
Under the DSBP, the portion of any annual bonus above 75% of the base salary (60% for bonuses paid for 2007 and earlier years) of  
a senior executive nominated by the Remuneration Committee is deferred into shares. DSBP awards normally vest following the end
of three financial years commencing with that in which the award is granted.

The Company recognised a total expense of £0.5 million (2008: £0.5 million) in respect of the DSBP. 
2000 Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) 
The only share option scheme operated by the Company during the year was the 2000 ESOS. Options normally only become 
exercisable from the third anniversary of the date of the grant and if the performance condition has been met. The awards are tested 
against constituents of an index and 100% of awards will vest if the Company’s TSR is above the median of the index over three years 
following grant. For awards from March 2008 the Index is the FTSE 100 index (excluding investment trusts); for awards before March 
2008, the Index is the FTSE 250 index (excluding investment trusts). 
Options granted under the previous 1998 ESOS had all been exercised at 31 December 2009. All awards under the 1998 ESOS  
were made prior to 7 November 2002 and therefore, under the FRS transitional provisions, they have not been accounted for in 
accordance with FRS 20 – Share-based payments. 
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average exercise prices (WAEP) of, and movements in, share options under 
the 1988 ESOS, the 1998 ESOS and the 2000 ESOS during the year.

The Company recognised a total expense of £nil (2008: £nil) in respect of the ESOS. 
UK & Irish Share Incentive Plans (SIPs) 
The SIPs were launched at the beginning of 2004. These are all employee plans, which have been set up in the UK and Ireland,  
that enable employees to save out of salary up to prescribed monthly limits. Contributions are used by the Plan trustees to acquire 
Tullow shares (‘Partnership Shares’). The Company makes a matching contribution to acquire a matching number of Tullow shares 
(‘Matching Shares’) on a one-for-one basis at the end of each three month accumulation period. Matching shares are subject to  
time based forfeiture over three years on leaving employment in certain circumstances or if the related Partnership shares are sold. 
The fair value of a Matching Share is its market value at the start of the accumulation period. 
For the UK plan, Partnership Shares are purchased at the lower of the market values at the start of the Accumulation Period and
the purchase date (which is treated as a three month share option for IFRS 2 purposes). For the Irish plan, shares are bought at  
the market price at the purchase date which does not result in any IFRS 2 accounting charge. 
Matching shares vest three years after grant and dividends are paid to the employee during this period. 
Matching shares vest three years after grant and dividends are paid to the employee during this period. The Company recognised 
a total expense of £0.1 million (2008: £0.1 million) for the matching shares and £0.1 million (2008: £0.1 million) for the partnership shares.  Financial statements

Note 13. Subsequent events 
Since the balance sheet date Tullow has continued to progress its exploration, development and business growth strategies. 
In January 2010 the Group announced the successful placing and subsequent issue of a total of 80,431,796 new ordinary shares  
with institutions at 1,150 pence per share. This represents an increase of approximately 9.99% in Tullow’s existing issued share 
capital. These shares are credited as fully paid and rank pari passu in all respects with existing ordinary shares of 10 pence each in 
the capital of the Company, including the right to receive all dividends and other distributions declared, made or paid on or in respect 
of such shares after the date of issue. 
In January 2010 the Group announced that it had exercised its pre-emption rights over Heritage Oil’s Ugandan sale for up to  
$1.5 billion (£1.0 billion). In addition, two new potential partners have been identified, CNOOC and Total, and it is expected that each 
partner will acquire a one third interest in each of the three Ugandan blocks. The Group expects the transaction to be signed in the 
coming weeks. 
In January 2010 the Group announced that the appraisal well, Tweneboa 2, proved up a combined oil and gas-condensate column  
of at least 35 metres. This has confirmed Tweneboa as a major oil and gas-condensate field.  Financial statements

Review of the year
Overview
Our strategy of holding London 
assets for capital growth and 
regional assets for income has 
delivered strong results again this 
year. Included within the £155.3m 
total property return is £95.3m of 
capital appreciation in London and 
£30.7m from regional income. 
At points in the property cycle where there 
is yield compression and rental growth, we 
are able to deliver outstanding profits. We 
achieve these returns from working our 
assets hard, creating value from asset 
management and development rather than 
relying solely on market improvements. 
This year we have been extremely active, 
acquiring 58 properties, the equivalent of 
one purchase every six days. We have 
entered the delivery phase for the majority 
of our developments with construction 
having commenced at The Bower, London 
EC1, Barts Square, London EC1, One 
Creechurch Place, London EC3, and 
C-Space, London EC1. Occupational 
demand remains very strong in these 
locations giving us confidence that we will 
continue to achieve favourable letting 
outcomes, well in excess of our original 
expectations. 
Our income producing assets continue to 
perform well with considerable letting 
progress at Churchgate and Lee House, 
Manchester, The Shepherds Building, 
London W14 and New Loom House, London 
E1. We are enjoying rising income levels as 
we continue to acquire high yielding assets 
and begin to capture some of the 
reversionary potential of our properties. THE BOWER OLD STREET LONDON EC1  C-SPACE LONDON EC1

Regional portfolio
Distribution warehouses
The move out of secondary retail into high 
yielding distribution warehouses has resulted in 
the Group holding 36 units at the year end. These 
units have very few bespoke features and the 
majority are single let, making them relatively 
straightforward to both re-let and manage. 
Churchgate and Lee House, 
Manchester
Refurbishment and remodelling of this 248,000 
sq ft office has progressed well in the year, with in 
excess of 30,000 sq ft being let since its 
acquisition in March 2014. 
St Vincent Street, Glasgow
Construction of the new headquarters for Scottish 
Power has continued to progress with completion 
expected in February 2016. As a result we have 
recognised £1.3m of development management 
fees in the year. 
Retirement villages
Development has continued at our four primary 
retirement village sites. Bramshott Place, Liphook 
is complete with just four of the 151 units left to 
sell. At Durrants Village, Faygate, the Clubhouse is 
expected to open in summer 2015 and 28 units 
have been sold. 
Retail assets 
During the year we have sold our shopping 
centres at Corby Town Centre; Clyde Shopping 
Centre; The Guineas, Newmarket; Idlewells 
Shopping Centre, Sutton-in-Ashfield and Town 
Square, Basildon. Our prime retail asset in Cardiff, 
The Morgan Quarter, has been retained and 
continues to be highly reversionary. 
Poland
Sale of our completed out-of-town retail 
development in Wroclaw, West Poland, is expected 
in July 2015. At our retail park and shopping 
centre in Europa Centralna, Gliwice, we have 
agreed terms for the sale of our 50% interest to 
our joint venture partner Standard Life. This is 
expected to complete in July 2015. →

Financing 
Convertible Bond issue 
The Group issued an unsecured £100m Convertible 
Bond in June 2014 at a fixed rate of 4.0%. The 
bond is repayable in 2019 unless the conversion 
conditions are met, whereby the Group has the 
option to settle in ordinary shares, the corresponding 
value in cash or a combination of the two. The 
initial conversion price is set at a 35% premium 
above the price on the day of issue and a 59% 
premium above the Company’s EPRA net asset 
value per share at 31 March 2014.
Aviva Comercial Finance
In December 2014 the Group entered into a new 
£81m secured facility with Aviva Commercial 
Finance fixed for ten years at 3.48%.
HSBC 
In December 2014 our joint venture at Barts 
Square, London EC1 entered into a five year 
£165m development facility to fund phase one of 
the scheme and to finance the holding of the 
remaining assets. 
Revolving credit facilities
During the year we extended our £75m revolving 
credit facility with Barclays, now repayable in 
November 2019. Since the year end we have 
extended our £100m revolving credit facility with 
RBS to April 2020 with the option to extend for 
two further one year periods.
Cash and cash flow
At the year end the Group had over £229m of 
cash and agreed, undrawn, committed facilities 
including its share in joint ventures, as well as 
£131m of uncharged property on which it could 
borrow funds.
Debt profile
At 31 March 2015, Helical’s debt had an average 
maturity of 4.3 years (2014: 3.9 years) and a

STRATEGIC REPORT
It has been another good year for 
Helical with returns from its portfolio 
reaffirming the Group’s multi-sectoral 
and multi-disciplined approach to the 
property cycle. 
This involves identifying opportunities across the 
property spectrum which contribute to a regular 
and increasing flow of rental income as well as 
creating capital growth and development profits 
throughout the cycle. We seek a balance between 
an investment portfolio that provides income for 
the Group and a development programme that, 
through the use of limited equity, seeks to 
maximise returns. This balance currently targets, 
and has achieved, an investment portfolio 
representing at least 75% of our total property 
assets and a development programme covering 
the remaining 25% which is capable of producing 
exceptional profits. The portfolio is primarily 
targeted towards London for capital growth and 
development profits and the regions for high 
yielding investment assets and trading profits.
Results for the year
The profit before tax for the year to 31 March 
2015 was £87 .4m, the second highest in the 
Group’s history following last year’s record pre-tax 
profits of £101.7m. Total property return 
increased by 10.8% to £155.3m (2014: 
£140.1m) and included growing net rents of 
£38.6m (up 30% on 2014) and development 
profits of £17 .6m (2014: £65.0m). The gain on 
sale and revaluation of the investment portfolio 
contributed £96.6m (2014: £45.0m) and there 
were trading profits of £2.5m (2014: £0.3m). 
Net finance costs of £21.2m were significantly 
higher than in 2014 (£12.7m), with the Income 
Statement also adversely affected by falls in 
expected future interest rates which led to an 
£8.4m charge arising from valuing the Group’s 
derivative financial instruments (2014: a gain of 
£5.3m) and a £3.3m charge from valuing the 
£100m Convertible Bond issued in June 2014. 
Recurring administration costs were higher at 
£10.2m (2014: £8.8m) with increased numbers 
of head office employees reflecting the growth of 
the Group’s portfolio and the acceleration of the 
delivery phase of its development programme. 
Performance related awards, before national 
insurance costs, reflecting the success of the 
Group’s activities in the year were £13.4m, down 
from £15.7m in 2014. 
The growth in rents and the surpluses on the 
investment portfolio contributed to an increase in 
the EPRA net asset value per share to 385p, up 
23% from 313p at 31 March 2014. EPRA 
earnings per share were 2.4p (2014: 33.3p) 
reflecting the exclusion of the £96.6m (2014: 
£45.0m) investment portfolio gain from this 
measure. These results allow the Board to 
continue its progressive dividend policy and to 
recommend to shareholders a final dividend of 
5.15p, an increase of 8.4% on 2014 (4.75p), 
taking the total for the year to 7 .25p (2014: 
6.75p), an overall increase of 7 .4%.
The London Portfolio
The London investment and development portfolio 
continues to combine exceptional contributions 
from individual schemes with significant progress 
in delivering the Group’s programme of new and 
refurbished properties. 
At Clifton Street, London EC2, we have forward 
sold an office development of 45,000 sq ft which 
is due to complete this summer, for £38.25m, having 
committed to purchase it on completion for £21.0m. 
At Barts Square, London EC1, our scheme in joint 
venture with The Baupost Group LLC, we have 
exchanged contracts for sale, at an average of 
£1,574 psf, on 64 of the 92 residential units 
released in September 2014 from phase one of 
the development, which commenced in January 
2015 and is due for completion in summer 2017 . 
Subsequent phases will commence in 2016. 
At The Bower, Old Street, London EC1, our joint 
venture with Crosstree Real Estate Partners LLP, 
we expect to complete phase one, the refurbishment 
and extension of The Warehouse (122,000 sq ft 
NIA of offices, 5,300 sq ft of restaurant use) and 
The Studio (18,363 sq ft of offices, 3,7 46 sq ft of 
restaurant use) by summer 2015 having pre-let 
Empire House (20,726 sq ft) to Z Hotels and 
restaurant Ceviche who carried out their own 
refurbishment works. The second phase, a 
complete refurbishment of The Tower at 207 Old 
Street, is due to commence in summer 2015. At 
C-Space, London EC1 we expect to complete the 
refurbishment in August 2015 and are confident 
that the whole building will be let by the end of 
this year. 
Chief Executive’s 
statement STRATEGIC REPORT

Our 271,000 sq ft office development at One 
Creechurch Place, London EC3, equity funded 
with our joint venture partner HOOPP (Healthcare 
of Ontario Pension Plan), is under construction 
and due for completion in September 2016. At 
23-28 Charterhouse Square, London EC1 we 
have acquired an existing office building which 
will comprise 38,600 sq ft of offices and 5,350 sq 
ft of retail/restaurant use on completion of 
refurbishment works in late 2016.
At Shepherds Building, London W14, having 
completed the refurbishment of the common 
parts, we have recently let space at £47 .50 psf 
which compares to a current average passing rent 
of £30.50 psf. At New Loom House, London E1, 
we continue to refurbish space as it becomes 
available and are achieving rents of £37 .50 psf 
compared to an average rent on acquisition of this 
building in 2013 of £18 psf. In 2015 we shall be 
embarking on a substantial refurbishment 
programme which will provide a new entrance and 
refresh many of the common parts of the building. 
At Artillery Lane, London E1 we expect to 
complete the comprehensive refurbishment of this 
17 ,000 sq ft office building in September 2015, 
following which we will complete the sale of the 
building at an agreed price of £15.1m. 
This level of asset management activity has 
contributed to a 27% valuation increase of the 
London investment portfolio, which is now valued 
at £370m (47% of the total investment portfolio). 
Passing rents on the portfolio are £9.3m, but will 
grow over the next few years towards its ERV, 
now estimated to be £28.1m. 
The Regional Portfolio
The regional investment and development portfolio 
provides a growing stream of net rents from a high 
yielding investment portfolio whilst contributing 
development surpluses from the retirement village 
and retail development programmes. The 
investment portfolio has seen a major switch out of 
secondary retail assets, acquired in 2010 and 
2011, into high yielding distribution warehouses, 
regional offices and out-of-town retail parks. We 
have sold our shopping centres at Corby T own 
Centre; Clyde Shopping Centre; The Guineas, 
Newmarket; Idlewells Shopping Centre, Sutton-in-
Ashfield and T own Square Basildon. We now retain 
just one in-town retail investment asset at The 
Morgan Quarter, Cardiff, a prime retail asset 
opposite the St David’s Shopping Centre. We have 
reinvested the proceeds into 44 new regional 
assets, primarily distribution warehouses 
throughout the country but also offices in 
Manchester, Bristol, Cobham and out-of-town retail 
park units in Harrogate, Stockport, Great Y armouth, 
Southend, Stoke-on-Trent and other locations. 
The regional portfolio also includes our retirement 
village development programme where we have 
continued construction works at Durrants Village 
Horsham, Millbrook Village Exeter and Maudslay 
Park Great Alne near Stratford-upon-Avon. During 
the year we sold 36 residential units and look 
forward to the opening of the Clubhouse at 
Durrants Village later this year. Our retail 
development programme, with partners Oswin 
Developments, continues to progress schemes at 
Truro, Cortonwood, Kingswinford and Evesham 
having completed its scheme at Shirley, West 
Midlands. 
Finance
The £100m 4% Convertible Bond, issued in June 
2014, continued the move away from the use of 
secured borrowings which started in 2013 with 
the issue of the £80m 6% Retail Bond. The issue 
of these two financing instruments allowed the 
Group to increase its investment in the property 
market without significant dilution of existing 
shareholders and without putting pressure on the 
Group’s loan covenants. We draw a distinction 
between secured borrowings, on which we have a 
net L TV (loan to value) of 34% and unsecured 
forms of debt i.e. our Retail and Convertible 
Bonds, which increase our overall L TV to 52%. 
During the year we agreed a 10 year facility with 
Aviva Commercial Finance and extended our 
revolving credit facilities with Barclays and, since 
the year end, with RBS, whilst taking advantage 
of the low interest rates to arrange medium to 
long term interest rate hedging. The effect of 
these financial arrangements has been to extend 
the average debt maturity to 4.3 years (2014: 3.9 
years) whilst reducing our average cost of debt to 
4.1% (2014: 4.5%). The Group continues to have 
a significant level of cash and unutilised bank 
facilities at the year end of £229m (2014: 
£186m) to fund any additional purchases and 
capital works on its portfolio. 
Outlook
Our strategy of investing and developing in London 
whilst maintaining a high yielding regional investment 
programme continues to bear fruit. We expect our 
London portfolio to continue to provide significant 
surpluses over the next few years as rental levels 
grow and we complete and let our development 
schemes. In the regions, we have completed our 
rotation out of secondary shopping centres and into 
high yielding distribution warehouses, regional offices 
and out-of-town retail parks. We have seen good 
demand from occupiers for the assets in our portfolio 
and strong interest in those types of assets from 
institutions. This is leading to a rise in both rental and 
capital values as the UK economy strengthens 
outside London.
With the General Election behind us we can look 
forward with confidence to a more stable domestic 
political situation, which should help the UK economy 
to grow, and we anticipate providing shareholders 
with continued strong growth in the value of our 
business.

Investment strategy
The investment portfolio, which is mainly let and 
income producing, has two main purposes:
•  To provide a steady stream of rental income for 
the Group; and,
•  To produce above average capital growth over 
the cycle to contribute to growth in the Group’s 
net asset value.
We seek to achieve this through careful, disciplined 
selection of properties which currently include 
multi-let offices in London, distribution warehouses, 
regional offices and mixed-use portfolios. Our key 
aim, when undertaking this selection process, is to 
ensure that there is sustainable demand from 
potential occupiers for all of our assets. We look to 
have a blend of London properties, where yields 
are lower but the potential for capital growth 
higher, and properties outside London where 
surplus cash flow is greater.
We acquire properties where good management 
can enhance value rather than relying simply on 
market improvements.
We frequently refurbish and/or extend our 
properties to create value. We also work closely 
with tenants with the aim of maintaining maximum 
occupancy in our properties. Our relationship with 
tenants can lead to opportunities to increase value 
through re-gearing leases or moving tenants within 
a building as their businesses expand or contract. 
Development strategy
The Group aims to limit the amount of equity that 
it deploys into development situations through a 
variety of different structures. The intention is to 
maximise the Group’s share of profits in a 
development by leveraging the capital employed 
by the Group and with a view to managing the 
risks inherent in the development process. The 
Group’s approach to development activities 
includes:
•  Co-investment alongside a larger partner where 
we have a minority equity stake, receiving a 
“waterfall” payment whereby we obtain a 
greater profit share than the percentage of our 
investment, depending upon the profitability of 
the project. This strategy is used for the 
developments at Barts Square, The Bower and 
Creechurch Place.
•  Reduce up-front equity required by entering 
into conditional contracts or options. We are 
using this approach at Creechurch Place and 
for our out-of-town retail development 
programme, for example Cortonwood (where 
land is optioned or put under contract which is 
conditional upon achieving planning permission 
and pre-lets to retailers), thereby mitigating the 
risks of the developments.
•  Participation in profit share situations where 
little or no equity investment is required, 
seeking to minimise any fixed base fee to 
maximise our profit share so that our interests 
are completely aligned with our partners. In this 
way, for a minimal equity commitment, we can 
benefit from a significant profit share if we 
contribute to a project’s success by using our 
skills and experience throughout the entire 
development process. 
 
Our risk strategy
Risk is an integral part of any Group’s business 
activities and Helical’s ability to identify, assess, 
monitor and manage each risk to which it is 
exposed is fundamental to its financial stability, 
current and future financial performance and 
reputation. As well as seeing changes in our 
internal and external environment as potential 
risks, we also see them as being opportunities 
which can drive performance.
Risk management starts at Board level where the 
Directors set the overall risk appetite of the Group 
and the risk management strategies. Helical’s 
management runs the business within these 
guidelines and part of its role is to act within 
these strategies and to report to the Board on 
how they are being operated.
The Group’s risk appetite and risk management 
strategies are continually assessed by the Board 
to ensure that they are appropriate and consistent 
with the Group’s overall strategy and with external 
market conditions. The effectiveness of the 
Group’s risk management strategy is reviewed 
every six months by the Audit Committee and by 
the full Board.
The risks faced by the Group do not change 
significantly from year to year but their importance 
and the Group’s response to them vary in 
accordance with changes in the internal and 
external environment. The Board considers not 
only the current situation but also potential future 
scenarios and how these might impact our 
business.
The Board has ultimate responsibility for risk 
within the business. However, the small size of our 
team and our flat management structure allows 
the Executive Directors to have close contact with 
all aspects of the business and allows us to 
ensure that the identification and management of 
risks and opportunities is part of the mindset of all 
decision makers at Helical.
The principal risks faced by the Group, and the 
steps taken by the Group to mitigate these risks, 
can be found in the Principal Risks Review on 
pages 40 to 42.
Helical is a UK focused property company 
investing in London for capital growth and 
the regions for income. 16
 
 
 
HELICAL BAR PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015
STRATEGIC REPORT
Performance 
We measure our performance using a 
number of financial and non-financial 
key performance indicators (“KPIs”).
We incentivise management to outperform the 
Group’s competitors by setting appropriate levels 
for performance indicators against which rewards 
are measured. We also design our remuneration 
packages to align management’s interests with 
shareholders’ aspirations. Key to this is the 
monitoring and reporting against identifiable 
performance targets and benchmarks.
Investment Property Databank
The Investment Property Databank (“IPD”) 
produces a number of independent benchmarks of 
property returns which are regarded as the main 
industry indices. 
IPD has compared the ungeared performance of 
Helical’s total property portfolio against that of 
portfolios within IPD for the last 20 years. The 
Group’s annual performance target is to exceed the 
top quartile of the IPD database, which it has 
consistently achieved. Helical’s ungeared 
performance for the year to 31 March 2015 was 
20.4% (2014: 23.8%) compared to the IPD 
median benchmark of 17 .5% (2014: 13.4%) and 
upper quartile benchmark of 19.6% (2014: 15.4%). 
Helical Bar portfolio unleveraged returns to  
31 March 2015 are as follows:
 
Source: Investment Property Databank. 
Helical’s trading & development portfolio (23% of 
gross assets) is shown in IPD at the lower of book 
cost or fair value and uplifts are only included on 
the sale of an asset.
EPRA net asset value  
per share (pence) 
A property company’s share price should reflect 
growth in net assets per share. The Group’s main 
objective is to maximise growth in assets from 
increases in investment portfolio values and from 
retained earnings from other property related 
activities. Net asset value per share represents the 
share of net assets attributable to each ordinary 
share. Whilst the basic and diluted net asset value 
per share calculations provide a guide to performance, 
the property industry prefers to use an EPRA 
adjusted net asset value per share to represent 
the fair value of net assets on an ongoing long 
term basis. The adjustments necessary to arrive at 
this figure are shown in note 34 to these results. 
Management is incentivised to exceed 15% pa 
growth in net asset value per share. 
The diluted net asset value per share, excluding 
trading stock surplus, at 31 March 2015 increased 
by 15.3% to 332p (2014: 288p). Including the 
surplus on valuation of trading and development 
stock, the EPRA net asset value per share at 31 
March 2015 increased by 23.0% to 385p (2014: 
313p). EPRA triple net asset value per share 
increased by 17 .0% to 364p (2014: 311p).
Total shareholder return
T otal Shareholder Return is a measure of the 
return on investment for shareholders. The table 
demonstrates this return compared to various 
indices. Over three, ten, fifteen, twenty and twenty

Helical’s strategy is to hold approximately 75% of 
its real estate assets as investment property and 
25% as development property. Helical believes 
that at this point in the property cycle, this ratio 
provides us with sufficient investment return to 
provide a steady income stream for our investors 
but allows us to make ‘super-profits’ on our

STRATEGIC REPORT
Helical’s property portfolio
Investment portfolio overview
Our £789.8m investment portfolio provides income 
for the Group. We have a strong focus on asset 
management, maximising net operating income 
and working closely with our tenants. 
Our aim is to have at least 75% of our portfolio in 
investment properties and 25% in development 
properties, blending stable recurring income with 
exposure to potentially superior profitability in 
developments. We currently have 77% of our 
assets in investment properties and, having 
realised our stated goal, we will look to broadly 
retain this balance going forward. 
Our income stream is diverse and secure with no 
tenant accounting for more than 6.2% of the rent 
roll. Our average weighted unexpired lease term is 
7 .0 years (2014: 7 .2 years). 
The income stream has grown steadily since 2010 
and is highly reversionary. The passing rent from 
our investment portfolio is £36.7m (2014: 
£37 .7m) and the estimated rental value of our 
portfolio is £59.5m (2014: £45.6m). This 
reversionary income will be captured through 
letting vacant units and rent reviews. 
The marginal fall in passing rent at 31 March 
2015 reflects the impact of the sale of the 
majority of our in-town retail portfolio, including 
Corby Town Centre, Clyde Shopping Centre, the 
Guineas Newmarket and Idlewells in Sutton-in-
Ashfield. These assets have been replaced with a 
number of logistics purchases. 
Through judicious buying of under-rented buildings in 
growth areas, securing lettings and undertaking 
refurbishments, we aim to generate substantial 
capital growth in our property values.

THE BOWER,  
OLD STREET, EC1  
This 3.12 acre asset was acquired in November 
2012 for £60.8m in joint venture with Crosstree 
Real Estate Partners LLP (Helical interest 33.3%). 
The site is in the heart of an area which has become 
a “creative halo”, a district of London which is a 
hub for technology, media and telecommunications 
companies and which is benefitting from substantial 
investment in infrastructure. 
Since acquisition, a planning consent has been 
obtained to increase the floor space on the site by 
116,000 sq ft, to refurbish existing areas and 
significantly upgrade the public realm with the 
creation of a new pedestrian street. 
Phase One
Building work started on phase one (211 Old Street) 
in January 2014 comprising The Warehouse, 
127 ,300 sq ft and The Studio, 22,109 sq ft, and is 
due for completion in July 2015. During this 
process rental income is still being received on 
the retail parade and the office building at 207 
Old Street. The basement area under the retail 
parade has been let to Gym Box at a rent of 
£150,000 pa.
Phase Two
Comprising The Tower (207 Old Street), planning 
has been obtained to comprehensively refurbish 
the existing building of 114,900 sq ft NIA, 
increasing the building to 170,000 sq ft NIA of 
office and 7 ,300 sq ft of retail/restaurant. Works 
are due to commence in July 2015.

New Loom House, Whitechapel E1
This 112,000 sq ft listed building was acquired in 
2013 and Helical has secured planning consent 
for a comprehensive refurbishment/reconfiguration 
of the common parts to include a new entrance/
reception, showers, bike store, refurbishment of 
c.15,000 sq ft of offices, including the creation of a 
single 11,000 sq ft unit and 4,000 sq ft of café and 
restaurants. The works are underway and are due 
for completion in early 2016. Strong rental growth 
is already being achieved with new lettings being 
agreed at £37 .50 psf compared to an average 
passing rent of £22.00 psf. Further increases in 
rents are anticipated as the opening of Crossrail 
approaches. 
Enterprise House, Paddington W2
Enterprise House, Paddington W2 is a freehold 
investment adjacent to Paddington Station in London 
comprising 45,000 sq ft of offices. The building was 
acquired on a sale and lease back agreement from 
Network Rail, which holds a 20 year lease without 
breaks, for c. £31m representing a 5.7% yield 
generating annual rental income of £1.8m.
Clifton Street, Shoreditch EC2
In November 2013, we committed to forward 
purchase a new 45,000 sq ft office building in 
Clifton Street, London EC2 for £21m. Since 
contracting to acquire the building, Helical has 
worked with the developer to achieve a revised 
planning consent and to refine the building’s 
specifications to ensure it meets the demands of 
the Shoreditch tech occupiers. It was intended 
that the Group would complete the freehold 
purchase upon practical completion of the 
construction in summer 2015. However, on 30 
September 2014, Helical exchanged contracts on 
the forward sale of Clifton Street for £38.25m, 
allowing the Group to recognise development 
profits of £16.4m in the year.
One King Street, Hammersmith W6
One King Street, Hammersmith W6 is a 35,000 sq 
ft building acquired in 2012 comprising 22,000 sq 
ft of offices and 13,000 sq ft of retail. 
Refurbishment of the fourth floor and the addition 
of a fifth floor of offices on top of the building is 
expected to be completed by August 2015 
providing 3,500 sq ft of extra space. 
C-Space, 37-45 City Road EC1
Helical acquired C-Space in June 2013. Planning 
consent has been obtained for a complete 
refurbishment of the building which will increase 
the existing 50,000 sq ft office building to 62,000 
sq ft. The works involve an additional floor and 
extensions to the third floor, a landscaped 
courtyard and entrance “pavilion” to the rear and 
full height glazing to the raised ground floor. Works 
have commenced and are expected to complete by 
August 2015. Significant interest is being shown 
by prospective tenants and we expect to let c. 75% 
of the new space before completion.
Artillery Lane, Bishopsgate E1
Artillery Lane, Bishopsgate E1 is an office building 
in the City of London. The building is undergoing 
work to provide 17 ,000 sq ft of newly refurbished 
offices and a restaurant. Acquired for £6.8m in 
2013 the property has been sold to Standard Life 
for £15.1m once the refurbishment works which 
will cost £3.2m are completed in September 2015. 
A new 25 year lease with Manicomio has been 
signed on the ground and lower ground floor to 
operate the restaurant.

Shepherds Building,  
Shepherds Bush W14 
This 151,000 sq ft multi-let office building close to 
the Westfield London shopping centre maintains 
an occupancy approaching 100%, as it has for 
seven consecutive years. The refurbishment of the 
common parts including new receptions and a 
café/bar is now complete. These works have given 
the building a refresh and have been positively 
received by occupiers. Significant rental growth is 
beginning to be seen with ERV now c. £50 psf 
compared to an average passing rent of £31.00 
psf. The most recent significant letting in the 
building in February 2015 was at £47 .50 psf.
Chart House, Islington N1
Chart House is a 10,500 sq ft office building in 
Islington which was acquired during the year. There 
is currently planning consent for an additional floor 
of residential on top of the building. It is our intention 
to renegotiate the planning consent and add an extra 
floor of office accommodation in place of the planned 
residential upon getting vacant possession in 2018. 
One Creechurch Place,  
City of London EC3 
Creechurch Place, London EC3 is a landmark City 
office scheme in the heart of the insurance sector 
in London. In May 2014, Helical signed a joint 
venture agreement with HOOPP (Healthcare of 
Ontario Pension Plan) to redevelop the site. Under 
the terms of the joint venture, HOOPP and Helical 
will jointly fund the project on a 90:10 split, with 
Helical acting as development manager, for which 
it will receive a promote payment depending on the 
successful outcome of the scheme. It is anticipated 
the completed development will have a capital 
value of circa £250m. Demolition and ground 
works have been completed to facilitate the 
construction of a new building comprising 271,000 
sq ft NIA of offices and 2,227 sq ft of retail, which 
is expected to be completed in September 2016.
King Street, Hammersmith W6
King Street, Hammersmith W6 is a mixed use scheme, 
in joint venture with Grainger plc, for the regeneration 
of the west end of King Street. Planning permission 
for the scheme was granted in April 2014 for 196 
apartments, a three screen cinema to be operated 
by Curzon, new retail, restaurant and café space 
and replacement offices for the Council with a 
new public square. During the period the joint 
venture acquired the existing cinema which is now 
let on a short term basis to the current operator. 
Work is expected to commence in late 2015.
23-28 Charterhouse Square, 
Smithfield EC1
In December 2014, Helical exchanged contracts to 
acquire a new 155 year leasehold interest in 23-28 
Charterhouse Square, London EC1 from the 
Governors of Sutton’s Hospital in Charterhouse for 
£16m. The Group plan to carry out a major 
refurbishment of the existing building, increasing 
the current 34,000 sq ft to 38,600 sq ft NIA of 
offices and 5,350 sq ft of retail/restaurant use with 
the addition of a new sixth floor. Works are due to 
commence in December 2015 and the completed 
building is expected to be delivered in late 2016.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Our regional portfolio provides 
significant income for the Group. 
We have a broad spread of income 
providing diversity between tenants 
and sectors of the market. 
Our £419.6m regional investment portfolio 
comprises £103.5m of offices (13.1% of the 
investment portfolio), £145.7m of industrial/
logistics (18.5%), £159.1m of retail comprising 
£97 .9m of retail warehousing and £61.2m of in 
town retail, largely The Morgan Quarter, Cardiff 
(in aggregate 20.1%) and £11.3m of retirement 
village investment assets (1.4%).
Our strategy is to acquire multi-tenanted 
properties where there is significant opportunity 
to increase net operating income and capital 
values. We acquire properties with rents which are 
low compared to equivalent buildings, providing 
scope for rental growth. We spend a considerable 
amount of time talking to our tenants both prior to 
acquiring properties and during the course of our 
ownership to ensure that the space they occupy 
continues to be fit for their purpose.

REGIONAL OFFICES
Churchgate and Lee House, 
Manchester
Helical acquired Churchgate and Lee House, two 
interlinked office buildings comprising 248,000 sq ft 
of offices, in March 2014. We have refurbished the 
reception, café and fourth floor of Churchgate 
House and continue to reposition the asset. 
Projects are underway to refurbish the first floor  
of Lee House and the Courtyard Suite where we 
hope to attract TMT Sector tenants. We are also 
remodelling the reception of Lee House. Since 
acquisition we have let in excess of 30,000 sq ft 
and have a further 10,000 sq ft under offer.
Dale House, Manchester
Dale House is a 42,000 sq ft office building 
situated in the Northern Quarter of Manchester.  
It is fully let to a number of tenants at an average 
rent of £12.00 psf and was acquired in March 
2015 for £7 .4m. The property is a long term hold 
with plans to refurbish the building over time and 
moving rents upwards as the location improves.
St Vincent Street, Glasgow
In partnership with local development partner, 
Dawn Developments Ltd, Helical is the development 
manager for the construction of the new headquarters 
building for Scottish Power at St Vincent Street, 
Glasgow. The completed building will comprise 
circa 220,000 sq ft of prime office space in the 
heart of the City’s commercial district. Funded by 
M&G Investments, the scheme is under construction 
and all works including Scottish Power’s fit out, are 
due to be completed in February 2016. As part of 
the overall deal, Helical is taking on three existing 
Scottish Power sites which are surplus to requirements. 
At Cathcart we have received planning permission 
for a change of use of the grounds of Cathcart 
House to 158 residential units and will look to sell 
the site. At Y oker, we have agreed heads of terms 
with a supermarket operator to sell the site and at 
Falkirk we have agreed a sale of the site with 
completion expected in October 2015.
 
RETAIL WAREHOUSING
We have acquired a number of retail warehouse 
assets during the year including properties in 
Harrogate, Stockport, Southend-on-Sea, 
Scarborough, Ellesmere Port and Stoke-on-Trent. 
We see good occupational demand in this sector 
with vacancy levels at a long term low. 
RETAIL DEVELOPMENTS
Parkgate, Shirley, West Midlands
The Shopping Centre at Parkgate, Shirley, where 
Helical has a 50% interest has completed on site 
and the 80,000 sq ft Asda together with a number 
of other retailers have opened successfully for 
trade. The space beyond the food-store is 80% 
pre-let to occupiers such as Peacocks, 99p Stores, 
Pizza Express, Wetherspoons, Prezzo, Shoe Zone 
and Shirley Library. Two residential sites have been 
sold to provide 97 private and extra-care units, six 
apartments and eight townhouses which are being 
built out directly. The food-store has been pre-sold 
to Asda and the retail units will be marketed for 
sale once the remaining units are let.
A second phase high density residential led 
scheme is being considered on a ten acre site 
opposite the Parkgate scheme. T erms have been 
agreed with a care home provider, a residential 
developer and a supermarket operator for a petrol 
filling station. 
Truro
In Truro Helical has entered into a Conditional 
Purchase Agreement on the six acre Truro City 
Football Club site and have submitted a Planning 
Application for a 78,000 sq ft non-food retail park. 
The scheme proposals provide for the relocation of 
the football club and, if approved, we anticipate 
starting on site in May 2016. 
Cortonwood
Planning consent has been secured at appeal and 
marketing is in hand for an 80,000 sq ft Open A1 
non-food retail park. Negotiations are proceeding 
with a number of leading fashion retailers and a 
start on site is anticipated in January 2016, once 
funding has been obtained. 
Park Handlowy Mlyn, Wroclaw
Wroclaw is a large city in West Poland, some 100km 
from the German border and 470km south of 
Warsaw. This 9,600 sq m (103,000 sq ft) out-of-town 
retail development was completed in December 
2008 and is fully let to a number of domestic and 
international retailers including Sports Direct, T K 
Maxx, Media Expert, Makro, Deichmann, Smyk, 
Komfort and others. We have agreed terms to sell 
the development at a price marginally above book 
value and expect to complete the sale by July 2015.
Europa Centralna, Gliwice
This retail park and shopping centre was built in 
50:50 joint venture with clients of Standard Life. 
The scheme is situated to the south of Gliwice at 
the intersection of the A4 and A1 motorways. This 
highly visible scheme has good accessibility and is 
becoming a major regional shopping destination. It 
comprises approximately 66,000 sq m (720,000 sq 
ft) of retail space, incorporating three distinct parts; 
being a foodstore, DIY and household goods and 
fashion outlets. The scheme is now over 85% let to 
T esco, Castorama, H&M, Media Saturn, Sports 
Direct, Jula and others. Construction was completed 
in February 2013 and the scheme opened on 1 March 
2013. Helical’s sale of 50% in 2011 includes a 
provision that we will sell the remaining ownership 
stake two years after the date of completion of the 
development to the same clients of Standard Life. 
This is now expected to complete in July 2015.

MILLBROOK VILLAGE EXETER BRAMSHOTT PLACE LIPHOOK

A retirement village is a private 
residential community in which 
active over-55s are able to live 
independently in retirement. 
Residents have typically down-sized 
from a larger family home into a 
cottage or apartment which ensures 
no maintenance or security issues.
With access to a central clubhouse containing  
a bar and restaurant facilities, health and fitness 
rooms and surrounded by maintained grounds, this 
retirement option is proving increasingly popular. 
The Group has four retirement village developments.
Bramshott Place, Liphook, 
Hampshire
The original Bramshott Place Village was an 
Elizabethan mansion built in 1580, although now 
only the original Grade II listed Tudor Gatehouse 
remains which Helical has fully restored. The land 
and buildings were derelict when we acquired the 
site in 2001. Changing planning from its previously 
designated employment use to a retirement village 
took several years but was eventually achieved in 
2006.
The development of 151 cottages and apartments, 
and the new clubhouse, has completed. To date, 
we have sold 147 units with one reserved and just 
three units, all apartments, left to sell. 
Durrants Village, Faygate, Horsham, 
West Sussex
Durrants Village, a 30 acre site, had operated as a 
saw-mill with outside storage for many years. 
Helical was granted planning permission, at 
appeal, in May 2009 where the Inspector allowed 
a development comprising a retirement village of 
148 units, eight affordable housing units, a 50 
bed residential care home and a central facilities 
clubhouse building. Following changes to the 
scheme the development will now comprise 173 
units. The first phase started in May 2012 for the 
construction of the retirement village and 
clubhouse and we have sold 28 units, exchanged 
on one further sale and have reservations on  
10 additional units in the first two phases. 
Maudslay Park, Great Alne, 
Warwickshire
This is a Green Belt site which has 320,000 sq ft 
of built footprint and benefits from Major 
Development Site planning policy. Covering 82 
acres, this site received outline planning 
permission in April 2011 for a retirement village 
of 164 units. Demolition and enabling works have 
completed and construction is due to commence 
shortly.
Millbrook Village, Exeter
This 19 acre site was acquired in 2007 from the 
St Loye’s Foundation, a long established 
rehabilitation college in the City of Exeter. 
Resolution to grant planning permission was 
obtained in October 2009 for a retirement village 
of 206 units, a 50 bed residential care home, an 
affordable extra-care block of 50 units and a 
central facilities clubhouse building. Demolition, 
site clearance and archaeological survey work 
have been completed. In 2011 we received 
planning consent for 63 open market housing 
units on part of the site and sold this in summer 
2012. Construction of a 164 unit retirement 
village and clubhouse in phases on the remainder 
of the site commenced in October 2013. We have 
sold seven units, have exchanged contracts on a 
further four units and have reservations on 22 
other units.

Acquisitions and sales
It has been another extremely active year of buying 
and selling. During the year we have acquired 58 
properties, the equivalent of one purchase every six 
days. In aggregate, we have acquired £276.7m of 
assets (including costs) with £245.7m added to 
our investment portfolio and £31.0m traded out of 
portfolios, either on acquisition or shortly 
afterwards. Net sales values totalled £211.2m with 
£133.8m of net proceeds from the sale of 
investment properties, £41.4m being our share of 
the net proceeds of the sale of Clyde Shopping 
Centre and £36.0m being the net proceeds from 
the sale of trading properties. Including capital 
expenditure of £41.1m, this represents a net 
investment in investment assets of £106.6m.
During the year we acquired five portfolios of 
industrial/logistics, out-of-town retail and office 
investments. In April 2014 we acquired The 
Constellation Portfolio, a mixed-use portfolio for 
£40.2m reflecting an 8.35% net initial yield. In 
August we acquired a portfolio of eleven industrial 
and distribution warehouse assets, known as the 
Boss Portfolio, for £29.7m, reflecting a net initial 
yield of 8.0% (excluding a vacant property at 
Rugby which was subsequently sold). In December 
we acquired the Sun and Mint Portfolios for 
£46.6m, reflecting a net initial yield of 7 .9%. The 
Sun Portfolio comprised three single let units and 
two multi let industrial estates of eight units. We 
also acquired the 4:2 Portfolio for £22.1m 
reflecting a net initial yield of 8.3%. This comprised 
three office properties and two industrial properties 
(excluding an office in Southampton which was sold 
on completion of the purchase). In addition we have 
purchased two retail warehouses in Harrogate and 
Stockport for £12.1m at a net initial yield of 6.95% 
and a regional distribution warehouse in Y ate, Bristol, 
for £11.5m at a net initial yield of 10.1%. We have 
also acquired a distribution facility in Leighton 
Buzzard for £9.9m at a net initial yield of 7 .85% and 
a distribution warehouse in Hinckley, Leicestershire 
for £9.5m at a net initial yield of 7 .75%, as well as a 
number of smaller assets. 
The most significant sales have been of our shopping 
centres, including Corby for £71.7m, Clydebank for 
£69.7m (Helical’s share 60%), Newmarket for 
£18.2m and Sutton-in-Ashfield for £16.1m. This has 
concluded our move out of in-town retail.

Asset management review
 
During the year contracted income increased by £1.1m as a result of new lettings and rent reviews, net of any losses from breaks and expiries (2014: £0.4m). 
There was significant activity within the investment portfolio with a lease event on over 200 leases. 
We concluded £5.1m of new lettings and uplifts at renewal (12.2% rent roll) and benefited from uplifts at rent review of £0.1m (0.3% rent roll), offsetting the 
loss of rent at lease end or break (£4.0m, 9.6% rent roll) and a further £0.1m through tenant administrations (0.3% rent roll).

Overall we have seen good letting demand across the portfolio, maintaining our vacancy rate around 5.0% (31 March 2014: 4.6%). Approximately £1m of rent 
has deliberately been forgone as properties are vacated for redevelopment and refurbishment. We have seen strong take up and rental growth in our London 
office portfolio with estimated rental values increasing by 20.4% in the year for our London portfolio (excluding Barts Square, London EC1, which will be 
redeveloped).

Financial review
REVIEW OF THE YEAR
The main areas that we focused on in the year to 31 March 2015 were to 
drive growth in rents through asset management, to increase our exposure to 
London assets where we see continued growth in rental and capital values, 
to grow the overall size of our regional portfolio and to switch out of 
secondary shopping centres and into high yielding distribution warehouses, 
out-of-town retail parks and offices. 
The results for the year, having delivered on these initiatives, have created 
growing rental surpluses, significant revaluation gains on the investment 
portfolio and profits from the development programme in London and are 
reflected in pre-tax profits of £87 .4m (2014: £101.7m) and shareholders’ 
funds which increased by 19% in the year to 31 March 2015. The Group’s 
portfolio, including its share of property held in joint ventures, increased to 
£1,021m (2014: £802m), largely the result of investment property 
acquisitions during the year funded by a £100m Convertible Bond plus 
substantial revaluation surpluses. This expansion of the Group’s activities has 
resulted in an increase in its loan to value to 52% (2014: 46%) and an 
increase in balance sheet gearing to 132% (2014: 107%).
During the year the Group continued to lengthen and diversify its borrowings 
profile. New secured borrowings included an £81m 10 year fixed rate 
investment facility, supplemented by the issue of a five year unsecured 
Convertible Bond, raising a further £100m. These new sources of funding 
enabled the Group to extend its overall debt maturity profile to 4.3 years 
(2014: 3.9 years), with a reduced weighted average cost of debt of 4.1% 
(2014: 4.5%). 
At 31 March 2015, the Group had unutilised bank facilities of £93m and 
£136m of cash. These facilities are available to fund the Group’s retirement 
village development programme, refurbishment works at C-Space, London 
EC1, The Bower, Old Street, London EC1 and the phase one construction 
works at Barts Square, London EC1.
EPRA Earnings
EPRA Earnings is a measure of operational performance representing the net 
income generated from a company’s operational activities. These activities 
exclude gains on the sale and revaluation of investment properties, trading 
property gains and losses and fair value movements of assets and liabilities, most 
notably in respect of derivative financial instruments, net of associated tax. The 
measure, as defined by the European Public Real Estate Association, does not 
make any adjustment for additional costs associated with such excluded gains, 
the most notable of which are performance related awards. At Helical such 
awards derive from all sources of profits and gains and, accordingly, to provide a 
more meaningful comparison, an Adjusted Earnings per share is noted below, 
which is calculated on earnings before the charge for performance related 
awards relating to those items excluded from this measure. 
EPRA Earnings per share were 2.4p (2014: 33.3p), reflecting the Group’s 
share of net rental income of £38.6m (2014: £29.8m), development profits 
of £17 .6m (2014: £65.0m) and excluding gains on sale and revaluation of 
investment properties of £96.6m (2014: 45.0m) and trading profits of £2.5m 
(2014: £0.3m). After adding back performance related awards of £15.6m 
(2014: £11.6m), Adjusted Earnings per share were 16.0p (2014: 43.3p).

EPRA Net Asset Value
EPRA net asset value per share increased by 23.0% to 385p per share 
(2014: 313p). This rise was principally due to a total comprehensive income 
of £74.9m (2014: £86.7m), plus an increase in the surplus on valuation of 
the trading and development stock to £36.2m (2014: £27 .5m).

Rental income and property overheads
Gross rental income receivable by the Group in respect of wholly owned 
properties increased by 27 .7% to £38.3m (2014: £30.0m). The Group’s share 
of gross rents receivable in joint ventures reduced to £6.1m (2014: £6.6m) 
reflecting the termination of leases at Barts Square, London EC1 where the 
phase one residential development has commenced. See-through gross rents 
totalled £44.4m, an increase of 21.4% on 2014. After taking account of head 
rents payable on those properties held on long leases, and the costs of 
managing the assets, void costs and letting costs, see-through net rents 
increased by 29.5% to £38.6m (2014: £29.8m). Bad debts from tenant 
administrations and failures fell below 0.1% of gross rents (2014: 0.4%).
Development programme
Development profits were down on last year, which had seen exceptional 
profits at 200 Aldersgate London and White City of £62m. This year we have 
recognised 95% of the profit on the Clifton Street, London EC2 forward sale to 
UBS (Triton), amounting to £16.4m and development management fees on our 
Barts Square, London EC1 The Bower, Old Street, London EC1 and One 
Creechurch Place, London EC3 developments, totalling £1.1m. In addition, our 
development management role in building the new Scottish Power 
headquarters in Glasgow has generated fees of £1.3m. In our joint ventures we 
have recognised £1.9m of development profit on our schemes at Leisure Plaza 
and C4.1, both in Milton Keynes. Our retirement village programme contributed 
£1.0m of profits. Set against these profits is an impairment of £3.0m against 
our retail development at Europa Centralna, Poland and a provision against a 
site in T elford of £1.0m.  
Share of results of joint ventures
Helical has increasingly sought to acquire larger assets in joint ventures with 
property funds that provide the majority of the equity required to purchase the 
assets, who in turn rely on Helical to provide the asset management or 
development expertise. These joint ventures include our share of the investment 
properties at Clyde Shopping Centre, Clydebank (sold in March 2015) and The 
Bower, Old Street, London EC1, and our development schemes at Barts 
Square, London EC1; One Creechurch Place, London EC3; Europa Centralna, 
Gliwice, Poland; Shirley T own Centre, West Midlands; Leisure Plaza, Milton 
Keynes and King Street, London W6. Detailed analysis of the financial position 
of our share of these joint ventures is provided in note 19 to this report and in 
the see-through analysis on pages 114-116. In the year under review, net 
rents of £4.4m (2014: £5.4m) were received, offset by net finance costs of 
£3.6m (2014: £2.5m). A gain on revaluation of the investment portfolio of 
£26.1m (2014: £15.7m), primarily arose in respect of Barts Square, London 
EC1 and The Bower, Old Street, London EC1. Net of taxes, our joint ventures 
contributed £27 .5m (2014: £16.4m).  38

Administration costs
Administration costs, before performance related awards, increased by 16%, 
from £8.8m to £10.2m. This reflects an increase in the number of asset 
managers and development executives within the Group as it expands its 
investment portfolio and moves through the delivery phase of its development 
portfolio as well as from costs incurred in connection with the move of the 
Company’s head office to Hanover Square, London W1S.
Performance related share awards and bonus payments, before National 
Insurance costs, reduced to £13.4m (2014: £15.7m) for the year. Of this 
amount, the £6.4m (2014: £6.3m) charge for share awards under the 
Performance Share Plan is expensed through the Income Statement but 
added back to Shareholders Funds through the Statement of Changes in 
Equity. The £6.9m (2014: £9.4m) accrual for bonus payments comprises 
£5.8m (2014: £5.1m) which will be paid in June 2015, £nil (2014: £2.9m) 
which will be carried forward to next year in accordance with the terms of the 
Annual Bonus Scheme 2012 and £1.1m (2014: £1.4m) which will be paid in 
deferred shares to be held for a minimum of three years. In addition, National 
Insurance of £3.0m (2014: £2.2m) has been accrued in the year.

Finance costs, finance income and derivative financial 
instruments
Interest payable on bank loans including our share of loans on assets held in 
joint ventures but before capitalised interest increased to £24.7m (2014: 
£17 .3m),  reflecting the increased debt taken on to finance the expansion of 
the Group’s investment activities. 
The fall in medium and long term interest rate projections since 31 March 2014 
contributed to a charge of £8.4m (2014: credit of £5.3m) on the derivative 
financial instruments which have been valued on a mark to market basis. 
Capitalised interest increased from £2.8m to £3.6m as development 
schemes progressed. Other interest payable increased from £2.5m to £6.3m 
as the Group wrote off £2.8m of costs incurred in issuing the £100m 
Convertible Bond. As a consequence of these movements, total finance costs 
increased by £10.3m from £17 .0m to £27 .3m. Finance income earned was 
£2.5m (2014: £1.2m). 
Taxation 
The deferred tax charge for the year is principally derived from the revaluation 
surpluses recognised in the year offset by tax losses which the Group believe 
will be utilised against profits in the foreseeable future.
Investment portfolio
The issue of the £100m Convertible Bond in June 2014, together with sales 
of over £170m of investment assets, mainly shopping centres where our 
asset management initiatives were completed, provided funds, net of loan 
repayments, for £246m of acquisitions and £41m of further value enhancing 
capital expenditure. Revaluation surpluses of £68m (£1m attributable to our 
profit share partners) in our main portfolio and £26m in our joint venture 
assets, increased the overall size of the investment portfolio on a see-through 
basis to £790m (2014: £601m). The sales of investment assets generated 
profits of £2.5m (2014: £8.6m) in the main portfolio and £1.1m (2014: £nil) 
in our joint ventures. 
Debt and financial risk
Since 31 March 2014, the Group has raised £100m through the issue of a 
five year Convertible Bond with a 4.0% coupon and £81m of long term debt 
repayable in December 2024 with a fixed interest rate of 3.48%. The composition 
of the Group’s debt structure has significantly changed since 31 March 2014 
with unsecured debt now representing 27% of debt drawn at 31 March 2015. 
In total, Helical’s outstanding debt at 31 March 2015 of £674.6m had an 
average maturity of 4.3 years (2014: 3.9 years) and a weighted cost of 4.1% 
(2014: 4.5%).

FINANCIAL REVIEw continued
The Group arranges its borrowings to suit its investment and development 
intentions as follows: 
Investment facilities
These are typically for four to five years, financing the Group’s investment 
portfolio and a fully let retail development at Wroclaw in Poland with loan to 
value and income covenants. The value of the Group’s properties secured on 
these facilities at 31 March 2015 was £639.0m (2014: £486.3m) with a 
corresponding loan to value of 58% (2014: 53%). The average maturity of the 
Group’s investment facilities at 31 March 2015 was 4.6 years (2014: 3.7 
years).
Development and site holding facilities
These facilities finance the construction of the retirement villages at Durrants 
Village, Horsham, Maudslay Park, Great Alne and Millbrook Village, Exeter. 
They also include a site holding facility at Telford. The average maturity of the 
Group’s development and site holding facilities at 31 March 2015 was 2.0 
years (2014: 3.0 years).
Joint venture bank facilities
As noted above we hold a number of investment and development properties 
in joint venture with third parties and include in the above table our share, in 
proportion to our economic interest, of the debt associated with each asset. 
During the year we agreed a new five year facility to December 2019 
providing finance for the first phase of the redevelopment of Barts Square, 
London EC1. The average maturity of the Group’s share of bank facilities in 
joint ventures at 31 March 2015 was 3.0 years (2014: 2.5 years).
Retail Bond
In June 2013, the Group raised £80m from the issue of an unsecured Retail 
Bond with a 6.00% coupon. This bond is repayable in June 2020.
Convertible Bond
In June 2014, the Group raised £100m from the issue of an unsecured 
Convertible Bond with a 4.0% coupon, repayable in June 2019 or, subject to 
certain conditions, convertible at the option of the bondholders into ordinary 
shares, unless a cash settlement option is exercised by the Company. The 
initial conversion price has been set at £4.9694 per share, representing a 
35% premium above the price on the day of the issue and a premium of 59% 
above the Company’s EPRA net asset value per share at 31 March 2014. 
Short term working capital facilities
These facilities provide working capital for the Group.
Cash and cash flow
At 31 March 2015, the Group had over £229m (2014: £186m) of cash and 
agreed, undrawn, committed bank facilities including its share in joint ventures 
as well as £131m (2014: £82m) of uncharged property on which it could 
borrow funds.
Net borrowings and gearing
Net borrowings held by the Group have increased during the year from 
£312.8m to £477 .2m. Including the Group’s share of net debt of its joint 
ventures the Group’s share of total net debt has increased from £365.1m to 
£531.9m. There has been a corresponding increase from 99% to 113% in 
see-through net asset value gearing. This gearing measure, which is the ratio 
of see-through net borrowings to EPRA net asset value, represents a longer 
term view than the standard gearing measure.

At 31 March 2015 the Group had £496.9m (2014: £291.5m) of fixed rate 
debt with an average effective interest rate of 4.4% (2014: 4.8%) and 
£98.1m (2014: £84.6m) of floating rate debt with an average effective 
interest rate of 2.4% (2014: 3.50%). In addition, the Group had £143.2m of 
interest rate caps at an average of 4.0% (2014: £132m at 4.0%). In the joint 
ventures, the Group’s share of fixed rate debt was £49.6m (2014: £29.6m) 
with an average effective interest rate of 5.0% (2014: 6.0%), and £21.6m 
(2014: £43.6m) of floating rate debt with an effective rate of 3.4% (2014: 
3.3%). In addition, the joint ventures benefited from £35.0m (2014: £49.0m) 
of interest rate caps at an average of 5.0% (2014: 5.0%).
Interest cover
In assessing the results of the Group for each financial year, Helical 
considers its interest cover as a measure of its performance and its ability to 
finance its annual interest payments from its net operating income, before 
revaluation gains or losses on the investment portfolio and net realisable 
provisions on the trading and development stock. In the year to 31 March 
2015, this interest cover was 2.5 times (2014: 8.3 times).

STRATEGIC REPORT

Principal risks review
STRATEGIC RISK 
  Strategic risk includes the risk that the Group’s business strategy or capital structure results in the Group underperforming the 
rest of the property sector, or being unable to take advantage of opportunities that may arise. 
RISK DESCRIPTION MITIGATION/ACTION
Group’s strategy is inconsistent with market 
conditions, for example:
-  Asset concentration/lot size impacts on liquidity  
(e.g. if investments become difficult to sell, does this 
affect our liquidity?)
-  Asset concentration/mix creates excessive volatility 
in property revaluation movements
 Management constantly monitors and considers changes to the Group strategy in 
the light of any changes to market conditions. The management team is very 
experienced and has a good track record in the property market
Due to the small size of the Group and the management team, changes to the 
strategy can be effected quickly
MARKET RISK 
  Market risks are risks specific to the economy as a whole and to the property sector. 
RISK DESCRIPTION MITIGATION/ACTION
Property values decline Helical management reviews external data
Helical has been active in disposing of non-performing assets and rebalancing its 
portfolio for the changing market
Helical keeps a diversified portfolio to prevent being over-exposed to one sector
Reduced tenant demand for space Our focus is on buying well let investment properties in good locations
We continue to ensure that vacant space is kept to a minimum
Appropriate timing of investment and divestment 
decisions
Our management team is highly experienced
Market conditions result in difficulties in divestment of 
properties at a time when the proceeds are required 
for new investments
Management constantly reviews the market conditions
Risk is an integral part of any group’s business activities 
and Helical’s ability to identify, assess, monitor and manage 
each risk to which it is exposed is fundamental to its 
financial stability, current and future financial performance 
and reputation. As well as seeing changes in our internal 
and external environment as potential risks, we also see 
them as being opportunities which can drive performance.
Risk management starts at Board level where the Directors set the overall risk 
appetite of the Group and the risk management strategies. Helical’s management 
runs the business within these guidelines and part of its role is to act within 
these strategies and to report to the Board on how they are being operated.
The Group’s risk appetite and risk management strategies are continually 
assessed by the Board to ensure that they are appropriate and consistent 
with the Group’s overall strategy and with external market conditions. The 
effectiveness of the Group’s risk management strategy is reviewed every 
six months by the Audit Committee and by the full Board.
The risks faced by the Group do not change significantly from year to year 
but their importance and the Group’s response to them vary in accordance 
with changes in the internal and external environment. The Board considers 
not only the current situation but also potential future scenarios and how 
these might impact our business.
The Board has ultimate responsibility for risk within the business. However 
the small size of our team and our flat management structure allows the 
executive directors to have close contact with all aspects of the business 
and allows us to ensure that the identification and management of risks 
and opportunities is part of the mindset of all decision makers at Helical.
The principal risks faced by the Group, and the steps taken by the Group 
to mitigate these risks, are as follows: STRATEGIC REPORT

STRATEGIC REPORT 44
The Group recognises that its business activities impact 
on the environment and the wider communities in which 
it operates. Helical implements responsible environmental 
and social practices across its direct business, via partners, 
contractors and suppliers and through its joint 
venture activities.
An endorsement of Helical’s commitment to managing environmental and social 
impacts is its continued listing in the FTSE4Good Index. The FTSE4Good Index 
measures the performance of companies that meet globally recognised 
corporate responsibility standards and facilitates investment in those companies. 
Maintaining listed status on this Index remains a key priority for Helical, and 
informs the evolving approach to Corporate Responsibility. 
Managing Corporate Responsibility
Each year the Group reviews and updates its environmental management 
system, which has been in place since 2003. The updated environmental 
management system, which is available on the Company website, is embedded 
within the operations of Helical. Key elements of the system include:
•  ‘Environment’ and ‘Corporate Responsibility’ policies which set out Helical’s 
high-level commitment across a number of impact areas. These are reviewed 
annually at Board level and are implemented by the senior management team. 
•  Annual (and ongoing) performance targets to enable Helical to focus its 
efforts throughout the year on measurable and achievable performance goals. 
This year the Group has continued to report on energy and water consumption 
at its larger managed multi-let assets, and measured performance against 
quantitative targets set in 2014. In addition, the proportion of waste recycled 
has been measured at managed assets and Group owned development 
projects.
•  Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to help Helical monitor progress towards 
these targets and to ensure they are able to report in line with investor 
disclosure requirements, notably FTSE4Good. It should be acknowledged 
that the particular business model of the buying and selling of assets means 
that absolute performance measures can be difficult to compare year on 
year, hence this year the reporting against selected intensity (resource 
consumption) and like for like KPIs will be investigated.
•  Checklists to assist in applying minimum sustainability requirements across 
its development activities. Helical has developed a sustainability project 
management checklist to ensure that sustainability issues are incorporated 
into all decisions throughout the development lifecycle. In addition, an 
Environmental Impact Checklist is issued to individual contractors in order 
to address corporate goals at the construction stage. 
•  Effective use of internal audit and review through quarterly meetings 
of key Helical personnel, external corporate responsibility advisors and 
principal managing agents to ensure effective delivery of the objectives 
and targets.
The management system developed has been designed specifically to 
reflect the flexibility of the Group’s business model. It also reflects the key 
role that Helical’s partners play in delivering enhanced sustainability 
outcomes in all its business ventures, be they developments/refurbishments 
or in the management of individual multi-let assets.
Review of progress in the year to 31 March 2015
The benefits of managing environmental and social impacts include increased 
ability to secure planning consents, improved marketability of assets to 
prospective tenants, reduced operating costs of assets, mitigating the risk of 
future legislation and regulation, and enhanced corporate reputation.
Below we outline the progress in relation to the each of Helical’s Corporate 
Responsibility impact areas. 
Environment
The Group’s corporate commitments to environmental issues are outlined in 
the Group’s Environmental Policy which can be found on the Company website. 
The policy details Helical’s commitments across a range of impact areas and 
its development and property management activities. For this year, Helical set 
itself 29 targets (versus 26 in 2014) to guide the environmental element of 
its Corporate Responsibility programme over the 12 months. These targets 
address a range of impacts arising from the development and property 
management activities, including resource use and waste production, pollution, 
biodiversity, timber sourcing, tenant engagement, flood risk and sustainable 
design and construction. A full list of these targets can be found on the Company 
website. The performance against the key targets is summarised below.
•  Previously, year on year improvement targets have been reported for the 
Head Office at Farm Street, London W1J 5RS, however, in August 2014 
Helical moved to 5 Hanover Square, London W1S 1HQ. Performance data 
has been collated for energy but improvement targets will not be set until 
a full year’s baseline data is available. Waste and water consumption data 
will not be available going forward as the office is a multi-let building and 
the data is difficult to obtain from the owner. 
•  Helical managed multi-let offices continue to improve their energy and 
water efficiency through the implementation of low and no cost measures. 
The specific target for 2015 was to achieve a 2% improvement against the 
2014 baseline. A review of the data in the table below shows that performance 
is variable, complicated by the changing nature of the portfolio with three 
new properties purchased in the year, including Churchgate & Lee House, 
Manchester and 25 King Street, Bristol. Other changes include the ongoing 
refurbishment of The Bower (207 and 211), Old Street, London EC1and the 
Head Office move from 11-15 Farm Street, London W1J, to 5 Hanover 
Square, London W1S. The table highlights the inherent difficulties in 
monitoring such a varying portfolio where there is significant year on year 
change.
•  Of those that can be compared, The Hub, Glasgow has shown an improved 
performance with a 7% decrease in gas consumption, however it also reports 
a 4.5% increase in electricity due to data understatement in 2014 during 
the fit out project. The data received during 2015 is more representative of 
the actual usage. The Hub also saw a 46% increase in water use during 
2015; which can be attributed to an increase in occupancy levels. The 
Shepherds Building, London W14 has increased its electricity consumption, 
which can be linked to the café area and showers now being metred under 
common parts; however water consumption has decreased by 6%. 
•  Helical’s shopping centres, where comparative figures are available, show a 
similar story, where the performance is unsurprisingly allied to overall occupancy 
and programmed refurbishment. Overall electricity usage at Corby T own 
Centre reduced by 3%, despite an increase during quarter four as a result 
of additional full time plant equipment running due to onsite works. Corby 
Town Centre saw an unusual 84% reduction in its gas usage during the 
year. This significant reduction was a result of a new more efficient boiler 
being installed. The Morgan Quarter, Cardiff saw an increase in energy 
usage relating to development works at the Creative Quarter which ran to 
early 2015. 
•  Water consumption increased in both Corby and Cardiff during the year.  
At Cardiff this is as a direct result of work associated with the current 
development of the Creative Quarter. These works relate to the re-location 
of welfare facilities, increase in office tenant occupancy and relocation of 
the centre management office to the Creative Quarter.
•  Helical continues to offer recycling facilities at all managed assets. New Loom 
House, London EC1 is diverting nearly 100% waste from landfill as did Corby 
T own Centre and Clyde Shopping Centre prior to their sale in March 2015. 
Where data is available at other managed assets, Helical comfortably exceeded 
its ongoing target of a recycling rate of at least 35%. The only exception to this 
is The Morgan Quarter, Cardiff, where Helical are currently reviewing waste 
management strategies via the cleaning contract to increase recycling rates.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY continued
•  One of Helical’s ongoing targets is to proactively engage with tenants to 
encourage improvements in efficient use of the buildings. Individual property 
managers have engaged with tenants to try and see if there are ways in 
which efficiency initiatives can be introduced and to particularly encourage 
increased recycling within the portfolio. 
•  Of those multi-let office buildings that can be compared, The Hub, 
Glasgow and Shepherds Building, the average percentage change of 
electricity use equated to a 24% increase in 2015 in comparison to 2014 
for Shepherd’s Building, London W14 but a 2% decrease for the Hub. The 
Morgan Quarter, Cardiff’s electricity use increased by a nominal 2% in 2015 
in comparison to 2014. 
Helical has maintained its registration with the Carbon Reduction 
Commitment Energy Efficiency Scheme (CRC). The confirmed purchased 
allowance for 1 April 2013 to 31 March 2014 was 5,602 tonnes. The 
projected allowance for the year to 31 March 2015 is a similar figure based on 
the current reported emissions for the portfolio as a whole. Helical has again 
reported to the Carbon Disclosure Project in the year and achieved an 
improvement in its disclosure scoring 77%. In line with the mandatory requirement 
for reporting its greenhouse gas emissions, Helical has provided a separate 
disclosure in this report.
Below, Helical presents its utility consumption performance for multi-let buildings 
under management as well as their Head Office (where data availability permits). 
As previously, the data provision focuses on energy consumption that is the 
responsibility of the landlord within common parts, vacant space and 
during refurbishment.

Greenhouse gas emissions reporting
For the reporting year 1 April 2014 to 31 March 2015 the 2014 UK 
Government’s Conversion Factors for Company Reporting has been followed. 
Greenhouse gas emissions are reported using the following parameters to 
determine what is included within the reporting boundaries.
•  Scope 1 – direct emissions includes any gas data for landlord controlled 
parts and fuel use for company owned vehicles.  Fugitive emissions from 
air conditioning are included where it is Helical’s responsibility within the 
managed portfolio. 
•  Scope 2 – indirect energy emissions includes purchased electricity throughout 
the Group operations within landlord controlled parts. Electricity used in 
refurbishment projects has not been recorded separately. In the majority of 
cases the electricity consumed is recorded for the individual properties as 
part of the data collection for the management of common parts, and 
contractors have been required to collect project specific data. 
The table below highlights that overall GHG emissions have increased by 44% 
year on year. The reason for this is primarily due to the increased number of 
properties that have been acquired over the reporting period and the diversity 
of the portfolio. Other contributing factors to the increase are:
- 207 Old Street energy consumption has been high due to construction activities.
- Air conditioning is more fully reported than in previous years
- Construction sites have not been reported in previous years
For the reasons explained on page 44, namely the changing nature of the  
portfolio, only two multi-let office buildings and one Shopping Centre can 
report its carbon intensity. At the Hub and Shepherds Building, average 
carbon intensity equates to 0.09 tCO

HELICAL BAR PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015
 
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY continued
The specific target set by Helical is to reduce energy consumption by 2% per 
annum in the principal managed assets. As discussed earlier in this section of 
the report, year on year performance is variable across the portfolio complicated 
by the changing nature of the portfolio through acquisition and divestment, 
increasing occupancy and ongoing refurbishment of the component assets.
Construction site performance
As part of the ongoing refurbishment and development programme, a number 
of key performance indicators are measured and recorded for the Group’s 
schemes, as follows. 
BREEAM/Considerate Constructors Scheme (CCS)
In accordance with Helical’s corporate objectives, six out of the eligible six 
commercial developments are registered under the BREEAM scheme to meet 
a minimum of BREEAM Very Good. The Bower, Old Street, London EC1, 
Leisure Plaza, Milton Keynes, St Vincent Street, Glasgow and One 
Creechurch Place, London EC3 have indicated that they are expecting to 
achieve an ‘Excellent’ rating. Where schemes also include residential 
elements such as Barts Square, London EC1, the objective is to achieve 
Code for Sustainable Homes Level 4. In addition, of the schemes registered 
with CCS all are expected to achieve scores well above compliance as well as 
above the current industry average of 35.70 with One Creechurch Place, 
London EC3 being awarded a Bronze Medal.  
Energy and Water
Out of the sixteen developments, ten are required to report on the monitoring of 
purchased water and energy use. The remaining six developments report 
purchased water and energy use under its managed buildings data set.

Ecology/Biodiversity
Six out of the sixteen sites have indicated that they have prepared an ecology 
report for their development. For The Bower, Old Street, London EC1 the number 
of green and brown roofing bird boxes installed around the site is maximised. 
Within Millbrook Village, Exeter there are a number of ecological features, 
including enhancing the wildlife area closest to the Mill Race and the bat 
house building, installing additional bat boxes on retained trees, adding reptile 
habitat, and also installing bee/invertebrate boxes within the wildlife area. To 
encourage biodiversity in an urban area, a green roof for the auditorium area 
has been installed at St Vincent Street, Glasgow. One Creechurch Place, 
London EC3 which is currently under construction has landscaping and 
enhancement of biodiversity incorporated into the design, as well as a green 
roof. Durrants Village, Faygate has a bat house, an exclusion zone for badger 
protection and a wild flower meadow is to be planted. 
Resource use/Supply chain 
A strong performance is shown by all sites that reported against the key 
performance indicator for sourcing sustainable timber. Eleven sites sourced 
100% of their timber from sustainable sources and a further four sites 
sourced a minimum of 80% timber from sustainable sources.  
Proximity to public transport/Sustainable travel 
The majority of Helical’s developments are within 1,000m of a rail station and 
seven developments include cycle provisions on site.  
Flood risk/Climate change 
It is a Group objective to ensure that Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems 
(SuDS) are included into the design to mitigate against flooding. This is only 
relevant to seven of the developments of which three have incorporated SuDS. 
Environmental incidents/Environmental Management 
There have been no prosecutions or fines for environmental pollution incidents 
reported on the operational sites during the year. Where appropriate to the size 
and capital value of the developments, certified Environmental Management 
Systems (EMS) are implemented. This applied to six projects during the year.
Employees
•  As at 31 March 2015, Helical had 52 permanent employees, 35 of whom 
were based at Helical’s head office in London, 6 employed by a related 
company, Asset Space Limited, and 11 in Poland.
•  Gender diversity of the Board and the Company as at 31 March 2015 is 
set out below:
MALE FEMALE
BOARD 100% -
SENIOR MANAGERS 83% 17%
ALL EMPLOYEES 41% 59%
•  Helical continues to enforce its equal opportunities, anti harassment and 
anti sexual discrimination policies. They also continue to monitor 
compliance with its anti-bribery and whistle blowing policies. There have 
been no incidents to report against these policies to date.
•  A high level of staff retention remains a key feature of its business. Helical 
has retained a highly skilled and experienced team and the table below 
shows a breakdown of staff by length of service.

•  Helical’s staff retention levels not only reflect competitive remuneration 
and benefits packages but also its commitment to enhancing the 
professional and personal skills of its team by supporting employee 
training and development, by means of training courses, seminars and 
mentoring where appropriate. As in previous years, Helical continues to 
evaluate training needs in line with business objectives. There are no 
human rights issues of which the Board are aware that are considered 
relevant to the Group. 48

Communities 
The Group takes a strong interest in community issues and seeks to be 
actively engaged with the local communities that it works with on an ongoing 
basis. Our community initiatives over the year included the following: 
•  For the third time, The Morgan Quarter, Cardiff ran an initiative called 
Trading Places during November and December 2014, in partnership with 
the University of South Wales. Students from six local colleges worked 
with the shopping centre and the University in a business game including 
running stalls within a pop-up shop, using a vacant shop unit within the 
Morgan Quarter. This enabled this group of 16-18 year olds to put their 
entrepreneurial skills into practice, whilst also being given the opportunity 
to understand the higher education opportunities on offer at the University. 
  The project aims to help develop and nurture self-sufficient, entrepreneurial 
young people who will contribute positively to economic and social success. 
A review of Trading Places took place in February 2015, which concluded 
that the scheme continues to achieve its objectives. Plans are in place for 
a fourth Trading Places to take place during November and December 2015.
•  Clyde Shopping Centre encouraged local businesses to follow its lead and 
boost its environmental performance by making a Resource Efficiency 
Pledge, which asks businesses and organisations to show their commitment 
to the environment by taking action to enhance their green credentials. 
The shopping centre signed up to the pledge to demonstrate its dedication 
to the environment and to encourage its employees, partners and tenants 
to also take steps towards achieving a low carbon economy. Initiatives in 
place at Clyde include food waste composting for tenants, LED lighting 
and timers, water harvesting and on site electric vehicles.  The shopping 
centre’s commitment to greener practices has seen it nominated for a 
number of sustainability awards.
  In addition, Clyde runs several community projects to maintain links to the 
local community. These include providing electronic equipment for schools, 
a safe child scheme (the Harry Otter Kids Club) and bee keeping on the 
premises. Support is also given to a number of local charities and community 
groups by providing free spaces within the shopping centre to hold stalls. 
The centre also raised around £10,000 for Landaid during the year.
•  Corby Town Centre has sponsored Corby Football Club Youth Team for the 
past two seasons. This helps to fund a number of projects focussed on 
encouraging physical activity for young people and raising awareness of 
health issues. In addition, space is made available in the town centre during 
the summer for Corby Football Club to hold interactive football based 
events, utilising a pop up five-a-side football pitch. Corby first team players 
regularly attend these events, which help to encourage support for the 
local team.
•  Idlewells Shopping Centre, Sutton-in-Ashfield invited local community 
groups and charities to bid for funding to run a project.  A shortlist was 
created followed by a public vote to decide which project should receive 
the funding. With over 900 votes cast, a local playgroup won the funding 
to host a Christmas Party for terminally ill children. As well as funding one 
charity to run a specific project, Idlewells also supports many other local 
groups and charities to raise money by providing free mall space for stalls 
and coffee mornings. 
•  The Guineas, Newmarket allocated free space in the shopping centre to a 
number of charities and other not-for-profit organisations, to enable them 
to host stalls for fundraising and raising awareness of their activities.
•  Helical is also part of the recently formed Aldgate Partnership which has 
been created to help promote the Aldgate area. Members of the group 
currently include landowners, commercial occupiers, and developers. The 
Aldgate Partnership will work together to deliver a range of interventions 
to support community development and develop a premier business hub 
with high quality public realm and environment that is a desirable 
destination for all employees, residents and visitors. 
Health & safety
Helical’s Health & Safety policy aims to develop a corporate culture that is 
committed to the prevention of injuries and ill health to its employees or 
others that may be affected by its activities. The Board of Directors and 
senior staff are responsible for implementing this policy and they look to 
ensure that health and safety considerations are always given priority in 
planning and in day-to-day activities. The Group’s Health & Safety Policy was 
reviewed and updated in February 2015 to reflect the latest legislative and 
regulatory developments. The Group’s Health & Safety policy can be found 
on the Company website and a summary of performance for fourteen active 
sites is below.

Chairman’s review
Dear Shareholder,
This Annual Report reflects on another excellent set of results for Helical Bar 
building on the record profits of last year. Our London portfolio has produced 
a valuation increase of 27 .0% and is now valued at £370m (47% of the total 
investment portfolio). The switch within our regional portfolio from shopping 
centres to industrial assets, mainly distribution warehouses and offices, helps 
to maintain the balance between a high yielding investment portfolio and a 
London investment and development programme providing both capital and 
rental growth.
Our Governance
The Board is accountable to the Group’s shareholders for good corporate 
governance. We believe in applying the highest principals of corporate 
governance and have complied throughout the year with the principles set 
out in the UK Corporate Governance Code, except in relation to those 
matters referred to on page 54. 
Major Decisions
The Board meeting agendas during the year contained many issues including 
consideration and approval of the £100m Convertible Bond, a review of the 
Group’s strategy, succession issues, and Board changes including the departure 
of investment director, Jack Pitman, and the appointment of a new 
Remuneration Committee Chairman, Michael O’Donnell.
Convertible Bond 
In June 2014, the Company issued £100m of Convertible Bonds with a 4% 
coupon repayable in 2019 or, subject to certain conditions, convertible at the 
option of bondholders into ordinary shares, unless a cash settlement option is 
exercised by the Company. The initial conversion price has been set at 
£4.9694 per share, representing a premium of 35% above the price on the 
day of issue and a premium of 59% above the Company’s previously 
reported EPRA net asset value per share. 
Annual Strategy Review 
In September 2014, the Company undertook its annual strategy review 
examining the economic, geopolitical, societal and environmental risks 
affecting the business. This review reaffirmed the Company’s principal 
objective of combining investment and development activity to ensure 
maximum shareholder returns whilst managing risks appropriately. The 
development pipeline is larger than competitors/peers with the use of deal 
structures with joint venture parties and third party finance in order to secure 
superior returns at the same time as mitigating risk. The investment portfolio 
has two main purposes, to provide an income stream to cover overheads, 
finance costs and dividends and to produce above average growth over the 
economic cycle. 
Board Composition and Evaluation 
In order that we may implement our strategy successfully the Board annually 
evaluates its own performance and that of its committees and directors. As 
Helical is currently a FTSE Small Cap company the Code does not require 
the Company to undertake this evaluation process externally. This evaluation 
concluded that the Board and its committees continue to operate effectively. 
In February 2015 Andrew Gulliford stepped down as Chairman and member 
of the Remuneration Committee and as member of the Audit and 
Remuneration Committee. He was replaced as Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee by Michael O’Donnell, who has been on the board 
and a member of that Committee since 2011. Andrew Gulliford remains on 
the board as a non-executive director and continues to advise the Board on 
property matters. Also in February 2015 Jack Pitman, an executive director 
since 2007 , stepped down from the Board and left the Company on 31 
March 2015. We thank him for his significant contribution to the Company 
over the last 14 years. He played an important part in the growth of the 
investment portfolio and in our retirement village business and we wish him 
every success in his new venture.
Investor Relations
We have an extensive programme of meetings and presentations with 
shareholders throughout the year with the majority of these taking place in 
the periods following our annual and half year results. In addition, we took 
part in an investor conference in January 2015 where we met with a number 
of financial institutions. The Chief Executive, Michael Slade, and the Finance 
Director, Tim Murphy, attend the majority of meetings with an investment 
director, Duncan Walker, and a development director, Gerald Kaye or Matthew 
Bonning-Snook, also attending. The Senior Independent Director, Richard 
Gillingwater, is available to meet shareholders and attended one investor 
meeting during the year. I am also available to meet shareholders if they wish 
to raise any matters with me. 
The following pages describe in greater detail our governance structure and 
the work of the Board and its Committees.

GOVERNANCE
Governance structure
The Board of Helical is collectively responsible for providing the leadership of 
the Company within a framework of controls and reporting structures which 
assist in pursuing its strategic aims and business objectives. It comprises the 
Chairman, the Chief Executive, four non-executive directors and four executive 
directors. The Board delegates operational responsibilities to an Executive 
Committee and governance responsibilities to Nominations, Audit and 
Remuneration Committees whilst retaining overall responsibility for the 
running of the Company.
LEADERSHIP 
The Chairman is Nigel McNair Scott. The Chief Executive is Michael Slade 
and the four executive directors are Tim Murphy (Finance Director), Gerald 
Kaye, Matthew Bonning-Snook and Duncan Walker. The non-executive 
directors are Richard Gillingwater (Senior Independent Director), Richard 
Grant, Andrew Gulliford and Michael O’Donnell. All the directors will be 
offering themselves for re-appointment at the 2015 AGM. 
Biographies of all directors and details of their shareholdings in the Company 
are on pages 52 and 53.
Roles of Chairman and Chief Executive
The Chairman and the Chief Executive are responsible for the leadership of 
the Company. The Chairman’s primary responsibility is for leading the Board 
and ensuring its effectiveness, whilst the Chief Executive is responsible for 
running the Company’s business. The division of responsibilities is clearly 
established at Helical, is set out in writing and is approved by the Board.
Board responsibilities
The main purpose of the Board is to create and deliver the long term success 
of the Group and returns for its shareholders. The Board is collectively responsible 
for providing the entrepreneurial leadership of the Group within a framework 
of controls and reporting structures which assist the Group in pursuing its 
strategic aims and business objectives. The Board sets the Group’s strategic 
aims, ensures that the necessary financial and human resources are in place 
for the Group to meet its objectives and also reviews management performance. 
The Board sets the Group’s values and standards and ensures that the 
Group’s obligations to its shareholders and others are understood and met.
All directors take decisions objectively in the interests of the Group. As part 
of their roles as members of the Board, non-executive directors constructively 
challenge and help develop proposals on strategy and the risk appetite of the 
Group. Non-executive directors scrutinise the performance of management in 
meeting agreed goals and objectives and monitor the reporting of performance. 
They satisfy themselves on the integrity of financial information and that financial 
controls and systems of risk management are robust and defensible. They are 
responsible for determining appropriate levels of remuneration of the executive 
directors and have a prime role in appointing and, where necessary, removing 
executive directors. In conjunction with the Nominations Committee, the 
Board considers succession planning of Board members and senior management. 
In addition to Boardroom discussions, the Chairman maintains contact with 
other non-executive directors by telephone and at least annually, will hold 
meetings with the non-executive directors without the executive directors 
present. Richard Gillingwater (Senior Independent Director) holds meetings 
of the independent non-executive directors separately from the rest of the 
Board at least once a year to ensure that any issues may be discussed 
without the presence of a non-independent director.
The Board has a schedule of matters specifically reserved to it for decision. 
The Board controls the business but delegates day-to-day responsibility to 
the executive management. An Executive Committee, comprising all the executive 
directors, meets regularly to discuss the development of strategy, to review 
and implement proposed transactions, to review policies and procedures 
(including health and safety), to monitor budget and financial performance 
and to assess risk. The full Board reviews all minutes of proceedings at 
Executive Committee meetings and receives reports from the Executive 
Committee Chairman (Michael Slade) at every Board meeting. 
However, there are a number of matters which are required to be or, in the 
interests of the Group, should only be, decided by the Board as a whole. A 
summary of the schedule of matters reserved for the Board is set out below:
•  Strategy and management - responsibility for the overall management of 
the Group; approval of the Group’s long-term strategic aims and objectives; 
approval of annual operating and capital expenditure budgets; oversight of 
the Group’s operations and review of performance; extension of the 
Group’s activities into new business areas; approval of major capital 
projects and projects outside the normal course of business; any decision 
to cease to operate all or any material part of the Group’s business.
•  Structure and capital - changes to the Group’s capital structure; major 
changes to the Group’s corporate structure; changes to the Group’s 
management and control structure; changes to the Group’s listing or plc status.
•  Financial reporting and controls - approval of half yearly report, approval of 
interim and final results announcements; approval of annual report and accounts, 
including the directors’ report, corporate governance statement and the 
directors’ remuneration report; approval of dividend policy; approval of 
significant changes in accounting policies or practices; approval of treasury 
policies; approval of material unbudgeted capital or operating expenditures.
•  Internal controls - ensuring maintenance of a sound system of control and 
risk management.
•  Contracts - approval of major capital projects; approval of contracts above 
limits of authority delegated by the Board.
•  Communication - approval of resolutions and corresponding 
documentation to be put to shareholders in general meeting; approval of 
all circulars and listing particulars.
•  Board membership and other appointments to senior management - 
appointment and removal of the Company Secretary; membership of Board 
committees following recommendations from the Nominations Committee.
•  Corporate governance matters - including directors’ performance evaluations 
and review of the Company’s corporate governance arrangements.
•  Remuneration - determine the remuneration policy for the Chairman, 
executive directors, Company Secretary and other senior executives 
following recommendation from the Remuneration Committee; determine 
the remuneration of the non-executive directors subject to the Articles of 
Association and shareholder approval as appropriate.
•  Approval of policies - including anti-bribery policy; whistleblowing procedures; 
equal opportunities policy; diversity policy; share dealing code; health and 
safety policy; environmental and corporate social responsibility policy; charitable 
donations policy.

GOVERNANCE
Governance review
At Helical we believe that robust corporate governance is of fundamental 
importance in delivering for shareholders the long-term success of the 
Company through the effective, entrepreneurial and prudent management of 
the Company. The Board of Helical is collectively responsible for providing 
the leadership of the Company within a framework of controls and reporting 
structures which assist in pursuing its strategic aims and business objectives. 
The UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”)
The Board is accountable to the Group’s shareholders for good corporate 
governance and we believe in applying the highest principles of corporate 
governance. Except in relation to the appointment of Nigel McNair Scott, who 
was formerly the Group’s Finance Director before his appointment as 
Chairman of the company in 2012, and the posting of the Notice of Meeting 
and related papers for the 2014 AGM, we have complied throughout the year 
with the principles as set out in the section of the Code headed “The Main 
Principles of the Code”. The Group also takes into account the corporate 
governance guidelines of institutional shareholders and their representative 
bodies.
Composition of the Board
The Code requires a Board to have an appropriate balance of skills, 
experience, independence and knowledge of the Company to enable it to 
discharge its duties and responsibilities effectively. Helical operates with a 
strong management team of senior decision makers backed up by a finance 
team and other support staff. The Group is keen to promote exceptional 
talent to Board level at the earliest opportunity to expose such individuals to 
the broader issues facing the business, encourage their long term 
commitment to the Group and to provide for future succession. It is for these 
reasons that Helical’s Board includes five executive directors, which is more 
than those of other comparable listed real estate companies.
Provision B.1.2 of the Code notes that companies such as Helical, which 
are below the FTSE350, are required to have at least two independent 
non-executive directors. The Board has determined that in Helical’s case a 
total of four non-executive directors, of which three are independent, is 
appropriate to balance the current executive team, to provide the experience 
and advice that the executive team seeks and to ensure the interests of 
shareholders and other stakeholders are adequately protected. The current 
independent non-executive directors are Richard Gillingwater, Richard Grant 
and Michael O’Donnell. With effect from 1 March 2015, Andrew Gulliford was 
no longer considered independent under the Code, having been a director for 
nine years.
In the Board’s view, the composition of the Board has an appropriate balance 
of skills, experience, independence and knowledge of the Company as 
required by the Code.
Annual evaluation of the Board and its Committees
The annual evaluation process, led by the Senior Independent Director, 
involves each director submitting an appraisal in respect of the performance 
of the main Board, its committees and directors, including the Chairman. 
Since the Company is outside the FTSE350 and as permitted by the Code, it 
does not currently make use of an external evaluation process.
During the year the Board undertook a formal evaluation of its own 
performance and that of its committees and the Senior Independent Director 
reported the results of that evaluation process to the Board. The process 
covered criteria including real estate matters, Board composition and Board 
and Committee processes. There were no significant areas of concern raised 
by the Directors and any points raised have been dealt with appropriately.
Directors - information and professional development
The Board is supplied in a timely manner with information in a form and of a 
quality appropriate to enable it to discharge its duties and its directors are 
free to seek any further information they consider necessary. The directors 
have access to the services of a Company Secretary who is responsible for 
advising the Board on all governance matters and ensuring compliance with 
Board procedures and applicable laws and regulations. Under the direction of 
the Chairman, the Company Secretary’s responsibilities include ensuring 
good information flows within the Board and its Committees and between 
senior management and non-executive directors, as well as facilitating 
induction of new directors and assisting with professional development as 
required. The Board ensures that directors have access to independent 
professional advice at the Group’s expense where they judge it necessary to 
discharge their responsibilities as directors. Training is available for all 
directors as necessary. 
Nominations Committee
The report of the Nominations Committee, which describes the work of the 
Committee, is on page 56. 
ACCOUNTABILITY
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee Chairman is Richard Grant, who is the Finance Director 
of Cadogan Estates Limited and a former partner of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers. As a result, the Board considers that he has recent 
and relevant financial experience. The report of the Chairman of the Audit 
Committee describing the issues considered by the Committee in the year 
under review is on pages 56 to 57 . 
Risk management and internal controls
The Board is responsible for maintaining a sound system of internal control 
to safeguard shareholders’ investment and the Group’s assets. Such a system 
is designed to manage, but cannot eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives. There are inherent limitations in any control system and, 
accordingly, even the most effective system can provide only reasonable, and 
not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The key features of the Group’s system of internal control are as follows:
•  Clearly defined organisational responsibilities and limits of authority. The 
day-to-day involvement of the executive directors in the running of the 
business ensures that these responsibilities and limits are adhered to.
• Financial controls and review procedures.
•  Financial information systems including cash flow, profit and capital 
expenditure forecasts. The Board receives regular and comprehensive 
reports on the day-to-day running of the business.
•  An Audit Committee which meets with the auditors and deals with any 
significant internal control matters. In the year under review the Audit 
Committee met with the Auditors on two occasions.
•  The Board is responsible for the management of the Group’s risk profile 
which is reviewed by the Audit Committee during the year. An analysis of 
the Group’s principal risks can be found on pages 40 to 42.
Internal audit
The Board reviewed its position during the year to 31 March 2015 and 
reaffirmed its stance that in view of the relatively small size of the Group it 
does not consider that an internal audit function would provide any significant 
additional assistance in maintaining a system of internal controls.
  
HELICAL BAR PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 GOVERNANCE

Going concern
The directors have reviewed the current and projected financial position of 
the Group making reasonable assumptions about future trading performance.
The key areas of sensitivity are:
• Timing and value of property sales.
• Availability of loan finance and related cash flows.
•  Future property valuations and their impact on covenants and potential 
loan repayments.
• Committed future expenditure.
• Future rental income and bad debts.
• Payment timings and the value of trade receivables.
The forecast cash flows have been sensitised to reflect those cash inflows 
which are less certain and to take account of a potential deterioration of 
property valuations. From their review, the directors believe that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue to be operational as a going concern for the 
foreseeable future.
Attendance at Board and Committee meetings during 
the year
Six scheduled meetings of the Board were held during the year ended  
31 March 2015. In addition, several unscheduled meetings were arranged to 
discuss particular transactions and events. On occasions, directors who are 
not members of the Committees attend at the invitation of the Committee 
Chairman. The attendance record of the directors at the scheduled meetings 
and at meetings of the Board’s committees is shown in the table below:
 
* Richard Gillingwater was absent from these meetings due to an operation which had to be 
performed at short notice.
* Richard Gillingwater was absent from these meetings due to an operation which had to be 
performed at short notice.
REMUNERATION
This information is contained in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 
58 to 71.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
Notice of Annual General Meeting
The Code recommends that the Notice of AGM and related papers be sent 
to shareholders at least 20 working days before the meeting. For the 2014 
AGM the Notice and related papers were sent out 18 working days before 
the AGM. 
Engagement with shareholders
The directors value the views of the Company’s shareholders and recognise 
their interest in the Group’s strategy and performance, Board membership 
and quality of management. They hold regular meetings with, and give 
presentations to, the Company’s institutional shareholders to discuss the 
Group’s results and objectives. The directors regularly meet, with the help of 
the Company’s brokers, institutions that do not currently hold shares in the 
Group to inform them of the Company’s objectives. Michael Slade, as Chief 
Executive, attends most of these meetings and is usually accompanied by 
one of the other executive directors. 
During the year under review, Andrew Gulliford, then Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee, engaged with principal shareholders (holding more 
than 3% of the Company’s shares) and shareholder representative bodies to 
seek their approval for the renewal of the Company’s Long Term Incentive 
Plan, which was approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM. 
The Senior Independent Director, Richard Gillingwater, was available to meet 
with shareholders throughout the year under review and will hold meetings 
with shareholders whenever requested in order to ensure sufficient 
understanding of any issues and concerns they may have. 
The AGM is used to communicate with investors and they are encouraged to 
participate. The Chairman, Senior Independent Director and members of the 
Audit, Remuneration and Nominations Committees will attend the AGM and 
will be available to answer questions. Separate resolutions are proposed on 
each issue in order that they can be given proper consideration and there is a 
separate resolution to consider the annual report and accounts. All proxy 
votes are counted and the level of proxies lodged on each resolution will be 
indicated after it has been dealt with by a show of hands.
The directors receive regular reports from sector analysts and investor 
relations advisors on how the Group is viewed by its shareholders. The Group 
communicates with all shareholders through the issue of regular press 
releases and through its website at www.helical.co.uk.

GOVERNANCE
Dear Shareholder,
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the role of the 
Nominations Committee, and my primary responsibility as its Chairman, is to 
ensure that the Company is headed by an effective Board which is collectively 
responsible for the long-term success of the Company. This is best achieved 
through the provision of entrepreneurial leadership and a talented executive 
team, supported by committees with an appropriate balance of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge of the Company to be able to constructively 
challenge and assist the executive team in achieving its objectives. Alongside me, 
the Committee comprises Richard Gillingwater, Richard Grant and Michael O’Donnell. 
Board appointments
Appointments to the Board and its Committees are made against objective 
criteria. Care is taken to ensure that appointees have enough time available to 
devote to the job. The Nominations Committee controls the process for Board 
appointments and makes recommendations to the Board. The Board is mindful 
of the Group’s diversity policy and the Committee will give full consideration 
to diversity, including gender diversity, when recommending to the Board any 
future Board appointments. All Board appointments will be based on 
experience and will be made on merit.
The work of the Nominations Committee in the year
The Committee met twice during the year. A record of attendance at all 
Board and Committee meetings is shown on page 55. 
The Committee reviewed the following matters during the year:
• Structure, size and composition of the Board;
• Membership of the Board committees;
• Performance Evaluation of the Board and its committees; and 
• Succession planning
The terms of reference of the Nominations Committee, which were reviewed 
during the year, are available on request and are included on the Group’s 
website at www.helical.co.uk.
Directors’ re-election
The Board believes that the requirements of Code Provision B.7 .1 of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code should be fulfilled. This provision requires all 
directors of FTSE350 companies to be subject to annual re-election by 
shareholders. Whilst the Company is not in the FTSE350, the Board has 
chosen to comply with this provision as it accepts that shareholders should 
annually have the right to vote on each director’s re-election to the Board. 
At the Annual General Meeting to be held on 24 July 2015, the following 
resolutions relating to the appointment of directors are being proposed: 
• The re-election of Nigel McNair Scott as non-executive Chairman;
•  The re-election, as executive directors, of Michael Slade, Tim Murphy, 
Gerald Kaye, Matthew Bonning-Snook and Duncan Walker; and
•  The re-election, as non-executive directors, of Richard Gillingwater, 
Richard Grant, Andrew Gulliford and Michael O’Donnell.
The Nominations Committee confirms to shareholders that, following the 
annual formal performance evaluation and taking into account their qualifications 
and experience, these directors continue to be effective and demonstrate 
commitment to their roles. Biographical details of the directors are given 
on pages 52 to 53.
I trust that shareholders will support the Committee and vote in favour 
of these resolutions. 
Nigel McNair Scott 
Chairman of the Nominations Committee
12 June 2015
Dear Shareholder,
I chair the Audit Committee and the other members are Richard Gillingwater 
and Michael O’Donnell. Further details of these directors may be found on 
pages 52 to 53. None of the Committee members have any personal or 
financial interest in the matters to be decided (other than as shareholders), 
potential conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships, or any 
day-to-day involvement in running the business. 
The Committee endorses the principles set out in the FRC Guidance on 
Audit Committees. The Board has formal and transparent arrangements for 
considering how it applies the Group’s financial reporting and internal control 
principles and for maintaining an appropriate relationship with its auditors. 
Whilst all directors have a duty to act in the interests of the Group the 
Committee has a particular role, acting independently from the executive 
directors, to ensure that the interests of shareholders are properly protected 
in relation to financial reporting and internal control. Appointments to the 
Committee are made by the Board on the recommendation of the 
Nominations Committee in consultation with the Audit Committee Chairman.
The terms of reference of the Audit Committee, which were reviewed during 
the year, are available on request and are included on the Company’s website 
at www.helical.co.uk.
The work of the audit committee in the year
The Committee met five times during the year and a record of attendance at 
these meetings is shown on page 55. It is common practice at Helical for 
Audit Committee meetings to be attended by all Board members who are 
available, whether or not they are members of the Committee so that their 
contribution to the matters discussed may be obtained.
In conjunction with the Board, the Audit Committee reviewed the following 
matters during the year:
• Review of risk and internal controls;
• Recommendations to the Board for the payment of dividends;
•  The financial statements of the Group and the announcement of the 
annual results to 31 March 2014 and the interim statement on the 
half year results to 30 September 2014; 
• The re-appointment of the Group’s external auditor; and
•  The external auditors’ independence and the provision of non-audit 
services by the external auditor.
The Audit Committee met the external auditor on two occasions to discuss 
matters arising from the annual and interim audits.
Other matters formally reviewed and discussed by the Committee during the 
year included:
•  Review of various company policies including those relating to anti-bribery, 
share dealing and whistleblowing;
•  Review of the group’s need for an internal audit function and issues 
related to IT risk and business continuity planning; and
•  Review of the annual bonus scheme calculations to ensure they are in 
accordance with the scheme rules and that any judgements are 
appropriate. GOVERNANCE

HELICAL BAR PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015
In discharging its responsibilities in connection with the preparation of the 
financial statements for the year to 31 March 2015, the Committee is 
responsible for reviewing the appropriateness of the Group’s accounting 
policies, assumptions, judgements and estimates as applied by the executive 
management to the financial statements. During this review the following 
matters were considered:
• Internal controls 
  The Committee annually reviews the need for an internal audit function and 
recently reaffirmed its stance that in view of the close involvement of the 
executive directors in the running of the business and the relatively small 
size of the Group, it does not consider an internal audit function would 
provide any additional assistance in maintaining a system of internal 
control. However, periodically, the Committee asks the Group’s auditors to 
review its internal controls and their most recent report was presented to 
the Committee in April 2015. Grant Thornton’s ‘Report on the Design and 
Operating Effectiveness of Internal Controls of Helical Bar plc’ provided a 
review of the Group’s control environment and internal controls. This report 
did not highlight any material weaknesses in the design and effectiveness 
of the Group’s systems and controls. Its key recommendations will be 
reviewed and, where appropriate, additional controls will be introduced 
during the year. 
• Valuation  
  The valuation of the Group’s investment and trading and development 
portfolio is the key area of judgement in preparing the annual and half 
yearly financial statements and reports. For this reason the fair value of the 
Group’s investment portfolio is determined by independent third party 
experts familiar with the markets in which the Group operates and suitably 
professionally qualified to enable them to provide appropriate valuations of 
the portfolio.
  The Group’s trading and development stock is accounted for in a different 
way to investment properties, being carried in the financial statements at 
the lower of cost and net realisable value. Accordingly, the Committee 
reviews the assumptions made in considering whether an asset should be 
written down to its net realisable value, if lower than cost. In addition, the 
Committee reviews those instances where stock is considered to have a 
fair value above its current book value. The surplus of fair value above book 
value is not included in the Group’s balance sheet nor is any movement 
reflected in the income statement. However, in accordance with the best 
practice recommendations of the European Public Real Estate Association, 
the surplus is included in the calculation of the EPRA net asset value per 
share at each balance sheet date. The fair value calculation of the trading 
and development stock is reviewed by an independent third party valuer 
and by Andrew Gulliford, FRICS, a non-executive director.
• Directors’ Remuneration
  The Group operates two bonus schemes and two performance share plans, 
as explained in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 58 to 71. The 
determination of the bonuses to be paid and the awards to be made involve 
judgement and are required to be calculated in accordance with the 
scheme rules, as approved by shareholders.
  Accordingly, the Committee is presented with the calculations to confirm 
that they have been made in accordance with the scheme rules and that 
any judgements involved in these calculations are appropriate.
• Revenue Recognition
  Where the Group enters into complex material transactions, judgement 
must be applied in determining when revenue should be recognised. 
Technical papers are presented to the Committee on each issue and the 
Committee also requests that the Group’s external auditors provide 
commentary.
  The Committee assesses the appropriateness of the proposed revenue 
recognition for each transaction and any issues requiring significant 
judgement are discussed between the external auditor and Richard Grant, 
Chair of the Audit Committee, independently from the Executive Board.
Effectiveness of the external auditor
During the year, the Audit Committee reviewed Grant Thornton UK LLP’s 
fees, effectiveness and whether the agreed audit plan had been fulfilled and 
the reasons for any variation from the plan. The Audit Committee also 
considered its robustness and the degree to which Grant Thornton UK LLP 
was able to assess key accounting and audit judgements and the content of 
the management report issued by the external auditor. This was performed 
through meeting with the external auditor and discussing the issues they had 
addressed. The Audit Committee concluded that both the audit and the audit 
process were effective.
Audit independence
The Audit Committee considers the external auditor to be independent and 
has satisfied itself of the effectiveness of the external auditor. The Audit 
Committee has noted the rules on mandatory audit firm rotation contained in 
the EU Audit Regulation and the requirements under the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. Helical is currently below the threshold for inclusion in the 
FTSE 350 and, accordingly, there is no requirement for it to consider the 
rotation of its auditor. Grant Thornton UK LLP has been the auditor of the 
Group for greater than ten years and there has been no audit tender during 
this time. However, the Committee will continue to monitor the effectiveness 
of the external auditor and will act in accordance with the EU regulations and 
the Code as appropriate.
The Group’s policy on awarding non-audit work to its auditor is designed to 
ensure that the Group receives the most appropriate advice without 
compromising the independence of the auditor. A policy of reviewing audit 
independence has been adopted whereby non-audit services undertaken by 
the auditor are approved prior to work being carried out. Fees for non-audit 
work cannot exceed £20,000 without the appointment being approved by the 
Audit Committee. In the year to 31 March 2015, no fees were paid to the 
auditors for non-audit work.
Annual General Meeting 
At the Annual General Meeting to be held on 24 July 2015 the following 
resolutions relating to the auditor are being proposed: 
• The re-appointment of Grant Thornton UK LLP as Independent Auditor; and
• T o authorise the Directors to set the remuneration of the Independent Auditor.
I hope that shareholders will support the Committee and vote in favour 
of these resolutions.

Directors’ 
remuneration report
Annual statement
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the Remuneration Committee’s Report on directors’ 
remuneration for the year to 31 March 2015. This report has been approved 
by the Board of Helical Bar plc. 
The main duty of the Remuneration Committee (“Committee”) is to determine 
and agree with the Board, the framework or broad policy for the remuneration 
of the Chairman and the executive directors and, subject to proposals being 
submitted by the Chief Executive, recommend and monitor the level and 
structure of remuneration for such other members of the executive management 
who report directly to the Chief Executive. The remuneration of non-executive 
directors shall be a matter for the Chairman and Executive members of the Board. 
This Directors’ Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with 
the Directors’ Remuneration Reporting Regulations and Narrative Reporting 
Regulations issued by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills in 
2013. In particular, the report has been divided into the following two sections:
•  Remuneration Policy Report, which sets out the Group’s policy on the 
remuneration of executive and non-executive directors; and
•  Annual Report on Remuneration, which discloses how the remuneration 
policy has been implemented in the year ended 31 March 2015 and how 
the policy will be operated in the year ending 31 March 2016. 
The Committee is not proposing any changes to the Group’s remuneration 
policy and will not, therefore, be seeking a renewal of shareholders’ approval 
of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy at the forthcoming AGM on 24th July 
2015. However, an advisory vote on the Annual Statement and the Annual 
Report on Remuneration will be tabled at the 2015 AGM. 
Remuneration issues dealt with during the year
The Committee considered a number of matters during the financial year 
under review and the following decisions were taken:
•  Basic salaries of executive directors were reviewed in July 2014 and 
inflationary increases of 2% were awarded with effect from 1 July 2014 to 
Michael Slade, Tim Murphy, Gerald Kaye and Jack Pitman. As disclosed in 
last year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report; (i) Matthew Bonning-Snook’s 
basic salary was last increased on 1 January 2014, and, consequently, no 
further increase was awarded in July 2014; and (ii) Duncan Walker’s basic 
salary was increased by 16% from 1 July 2014 to reflect his significantly 
increased contribution to the business and to bring his remuneration more 
in alignment with his fellow directors;
•  The fees payable to the non-executive directors were reviewed and 
inflationary increases of 2% were awarded with effect from 1 July 2014;
•  The Committee reviewed the awards made in accordance with the terms 
of the Performance Share Plan 2004 (“2004 PSP”) in 2011 and considered 
the performance of the Company during the three year performance period 
to 31 March 2014. The performance conditions required for vesting of the 
shares were partially met and 62.56% of shares vested;
•  The Committee determined annual bonus awards for the year to 31 March 
2014 in accordance with the rules of the Helical Bar Annual Bonus Scheme 
2012 and the Executive Bonus Plan 2011; 
•  The Committee recommended that the Company’s Employee Share Ownership 
Plan Trust (“ESOP”) acquire a further 3,790,000 shares in the Company to 
enable it to satisfy the anticipated vesting of share awards in 2015 and 
future years;
•  The Committee approved the terms of the Performance Share Plan 2014 
(“2014 PSP”) and 94.4% of shareholders voted to approve the Plan at the 
2014 AGM;
•  The Committee resolved in July 2014 to make an award of shares under 
the terms of the 2014 PSP; and,
• The Committee determined the leaving arrangements for Jack Pitman.
The implementation of these decisions is detailed in this report, together with 
additional information on the fixed and variable remuneration paid and payable 
to the directors of the Group.
Performance and reward during 2014
As noted in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 48, the Group has delivered an 
increase in EPRA net assets per share of 23.0% (2014: 18.6%) and a total 
portfolio return, as reported by IPD, of 20.4% (2014: 23.8%). Pre-tax profits of 
the Group, before performance related awards, were £104m (2014: £120m).
Subsequent to the year end, and in accordance with the rules of the Helical 
Bar Annual Bonus Scheme 2012 and the Executive Bonus Plan 2011, cash 
and deferred shares have been approved for inclusion in the financial 
statements for the year to 31 March 2015. Details of the bonuses payable 
are disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration below.
Awards made under the 2004 PSP in 2012 were subject to two 
performance conditions over the three years to 31 March 2015. Two thirds of 
the awards were based on absolute net asset value performance with a vesting 
threshold of 7 .5% p.a. (24% over three years) growth and maximum vesting 
at 15.0% p.a. (52% over three years) growth. The remaining third of the awards 
were based on a comparison of the Group’s portfolio return to the IPD Total 
Return index with a vesting threshold of the median of the index and full 
vesting at the upper quartile of the index. The performance criteria were 
measured at the end of the three year period and 100% of the awards are 
expected to vest.
The Committee believes that the provision for annual cash and deferred 
shares bonuses and the expected 2004 PSP vesting in respect of the 
performance periods ending 31 March 2015 accurately and fairly represents 
the reward determined by the Group’s remuneration schemes based on the 
performance of the Group over the respective performance periods.
Remuneration policy for 2015/16
The Remuneration Committee of Helical Bar plc is committed to ensuring 
that its remuneration policy remains aligned to the interests of shareholders, 
incentivising management to increase total returns and growing net asset 
value per share whilst ensuring that an appropriate balance is maintained 
between the targets set for management and the risk profile of the Group. 
The Committee believes that it has struck the right balance between fixed 
annual remuneration and an incentive structure with challenging targets 
which seeks to reward outperformance with a mixture of cash-based annual 
bonus payments and longer term share awards. 
Reviewing the current remuneration the Committee has determined that the 
basic salaries of the executive directors, should be increased from 1 July 
2015 by 2% (2014: 2%), which is below the average 8% (2014: 6%) 
awarded to all other employees of the Group. 
Annual General Meeting 
At the Annual General Meeting to be held on 24 July 2015 the following 
resolution relating to remuneration is being proposed:
•  The approval of the Annual Statement and Annual Report on 
Remuneration for the year ended 31 March 2015.
I trust that shareholders will support the Committee and vote in favour of this 
resolution.

Remuneration policy report
The Report of the Remuneration Committee has been prepared in accordance 
with the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2013 (the “Act”). The Remuneration Policy Report 
noted below was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting 
held on 25 July 2014 and has an effective date from that point and for a 
period of three years. The Company’s remuneration policy follows the principles 
and guidelines of the Listing Rules and the UK Corporate Governance 
Code 2012 as they relate to directors’ remuneration.
Remuneration policy report
This section of the Remuneration Report sets out the remuneration policy of 
the Group. There have been no changes to this policy since 1 April 2014 and 
the Committee believes that the policy continues to support the Group’s strategy 
and is aligned with shareholders’ interests. 
Remuneration policy
Helical’s approach to the remuneration of its executive directors is to provide 
a basic remuneration package below the median level of its peers within the 
listed real estate sector (the FTSE 350 Super Sector Real Estate Index, 
excluding storage companies and agencies) combined with an incentive 
based bonus and share scheme structure aligned with the interests of its 
shareholders. Remuneration within the real estate sector is monitored and 
reviewed regularly to ensure that the Group’s positioning of its remuneration 
remains in line with these objectives. In addition to this external view, the 
Committee also monitors the remuneration levels of senior management 
below Board level and the remuneration of other employees to ensure that 
these are taken into account in determining the remuneration of executive 
directors and considers environmental, social, governance and risk issues.
In determining such policy, the Committee shall take into account all factors 
which it deems necessary. The objective of the remuneration policy shall be 
to ensure that executive directors and senior management are provided with 
appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced performance and are, in a fair 
and responsible manner, rewarded for their individual contributions to the 
success of the Group. Within the terms of the agreed policy, the Committee 
shall determine, for the executive directors:
•  the total individual remuneration packages of each executive director 
including, where appropriate, basic salaries, bonuses, share awards, 
and other benefits;
• targets for any performance related remuneration schemes; and
•  service agreements incorporating termination payments and 
compensation commitments.
Operation of performance related remuneration
The Committee operates the two annual bonus schemes and the two PSP 
schemes (2004 and 2014) in accordance with their respective rules, as 
approved by shareholders, and the Listing Rules. In seeking shareholder 
approval to the performance related remuneration schemes the Committee 
has incorporated a number of shareholder protections and will apply these 
in the operation of the schemes. In particular, the Committee has:
•  applied a profit sharing and net asset value model to ensure cash bonuses 
vest only on performance and with maximum limits;
•  included clawback provisions in the Annual Bonus Scheme 2012 and the 
2014 PSP;
•  retained absolute discretion with regard to the payment of cash bonuses 
or the vesting of shares in the determination of good/bad leavers, or 
change of control or if payment of bonuses is not deemed to be in the 
interests of shareholders; and
• included enhanced share retention guidelines.

Recruitment policy
In considering the structure of the Board, the balance between executive directors and independent non-executive directors and the skills, knowledge and 
experience required to ensure the Board functions in accordance with the Group’s objectives, the Committee will seek to apply the following principles in 
relation to the remuneration of new directors, whether by internal promotion or external appointment:
ELEMENt POLICY
SALARY The salary of newly appointed executive directors would reflect the individual’s experience and skills, and be targeted at 
between lower quartile and median of appropriate sector comparables, taking into account internal comparisons. On initial 
appointment, salaries would generally be set at a level lower than benchmarked for that role to allow for pay increases to 
market levels subject to satisfactory progress and contribution.
BENEFITS Benefits would be as are currently provided and periodically reviewed, being car or car allowance, private medical cover, 
permanent health insurance and life assurance.
PENSION There is no Group pension scheme for directors and no contributions are payable to directors’ own pension schemes.
ANNUAL BONUS Annual bonus arrangements would be set in line with existing arrangements as approved by shareholders, with the 
Committee retaining the right to pro-rata any bonus payable in respect of the year of appointment.
LONG TERM INCENTIVES Annual awards under the terms of the 2014 PSP will be made in accordance with the terms of that Plan.
SHARE INCENTIVE PLAN In line with that of existing executive directors.
BUY-OUT AWARDS Should it be deemed necessary to compensate a new director for loss of bonus or incentives from a previous employer, the 
Committee may structure the remuneration of such director to buy-out any such bonus or incentives on a like-for-like basis in 
respect of currency (i.e. cash versus shares), timing and performance targets. Where possible such buy-out will be structured 
within the Company’s existing incentive arrangements but the Committee has the discretion to implement the exemption 
under rule 9.4.2 of the Listing Rules.
NON-EXECUTIVE 
DIRECTORS
Newly appointed non-executive directors will be paid fees at a level consistent with existing non-executive directors. 
Fees would be paid pro-rata in the year of appointment.
How employee pay is taken into account and how it 
compares to the remuneration policy of executive directors
All permanent employees of the Company, including executive directors, 
receive a basic remuneration package including base salary, private medical 
cover, permanent health insurance, life assurance and membership of the 
Share Incentive Plan. In addition, directors and senior management are entitled 
to the use of company cars or the payment of a car allowance. Whilst employees 
below Board level are not entitled to participate in the Executive Bonus Plan 
2011 or Annual Bonus Scheme 2012, discretionary bonuses are paid to 
employees on an individual basis depending on their performance and 
contribution. The Performance Share Plan is available to all employees but is 
primarily utilised to incentivise executive directors and senior management. 
An Inland Revenue approved Share Option Scheme is available for the 
Committee to grant options to those who do not receive awards under the 
Performance Share Plan. Consequently, directors are not granted awards 
under this scheme. In determining executive remuneration, the Committee 
considers the overall remuneration of all the Company’s employees and, other 
than in exceptional circumstances, seeks to award increases in salaries at 
levels below those made to other staff and within its own guidelines. The 
remaining remuneration is weighted towards performance related awards. The 
Committee does not consult with its employees when drawing up the 
Company’s remuneration policy.
Performance Metrics
The performance metrics used in the two annual bonus schemes and the 
long term incentive plan are aligned with the Company’s Key Performance 
Indicators, discussed on pages 16 to 17 .
The Executive Bonus Plan 2011 compares the net asset value per share 
performance of the Company to an index of property performance as measured 
by the Investment Property Databank (“IPD”). The intention is to compare the 
Company’s overall financial performance to that of the real estate sector’s primary 
index. The scheme is open to the Chief Executive and the Finance Director.
The Annual Bonus Scheme 2012 is a profit sharing model which takes the 
results of the Company, including valuation movements on its property portfolio, 
and, after charging all finance costs, non-performance related administration 
costs and a charge for the use of the Company’s equity, allocates the net results 
into a profit pool for payment to participants with maximum limits, deferral, 
clawback and other shareholder protections. The scheme is open to 
executive directors, other than the Chief Executive and the Finance Director.
Long term incentives, awarded in accordance with the rules of the 2004 PSP 
are subject to an absolute net asset value growth test and a relative 
performance metric based on the performance of the Company’s property 
portfolio compared to an IPD index. For the 2014 PSP, these two criteria are 
joined by a third metric, based on relative Total Shareholder Return.
Service contracts 
The service contract of Michael Slade operates from 1 August 2007 , those of 
Gerald Kaye and Matthew Bonning-Snook from 1 March 2010, that of Duncan 
Walker from 24 June 2011 and of Tim Murphy from 24 July 2012. No service 
contract provides for more than a one year notice period. All service contracts 
can be inspected at the registered offices of the Company.
Leaver Policy
On termination of employment each director may be entitled to a payment in 
lieu of notice of basic salary and other contractual entitlements i.e. provision 
of a car, health and life insurance. The Group may make payments in lieu of 
notice as one lump sum or in instalments, at its own discretion. If the Group 
chooses to pay in instalments the director is obliged to seek alternative 
income over the relevant period and to disclose the amount to the Group. 
Instalment payments will be reduced by any alternative income. GOVERNANCE

Awards under the Executive Bonus Plan 2011 may be payable with respect 
to the period of the financial year served although amounts will be paid at the 
normal payout date and, normally, pro-rated for the period of the financial 
year worked. Under the Helical Bar Annual Bonus Scheme 2012, participants 
shall not normally be entitled to receive any distribution under the scheme 
following cessation and shall immediately cease to have any interests, 
benefits, rights and/or entitlements under the scheme howsoever arising on 
the date of such cessation except where good leaver status applies (i.e. 
death; injury, disability; redundancy; retirement; sale or transfer of employing 
company or business outside of the Group or any other reason permitted by 
the Committee). For good leavers, individuals would cease to accrue future 
amounts into Bonus Award Pools although would continue to receive 
deferred share awards and any remaining amounts held in the Bonus Award 
Pools for a period of three years from cessation.
Any share-based entitlements granted to an executive director under the 
Company’s share plans will be determined based on the relevant plan rules. 
For awards granted under the 2004 PSP, awards will normally lapse at cessation 
except where the good leaver status applies (e.g. death, redundancy, retirement 
due to injury, disability or retirement otherwise with the Committee’s agreement). 
For good leavers, awards will vest at cessation having regard to the satisfaction 
of the relevant performance conditions and the time elapsed since the date 
of the award (rounded up to the nearest whole year).
For awards granted under the 2014 PSP, awards held by good leavers will 
vest on the normal vesting date subject to performance conditions and time 
pro-rating, unless the Committee determines that awards should vest at 
cessation and/or time pro-rating should not apply.
Non-executive directors 
Non-executive directors are appointed by a Letter of Appointment and their 
remuneration is determined by the Board. Current letters of Appointment, setting 
out the terms of appointment, operate from 1 April 2015.The appointment of 
non-executive directors is terminable on three months’ notice. Non-executive 
directors are not eligible to participate in any new awards made under the terms 
of the Group’s bonus or share award schemes. In exceptional circumstances, 
where an executive director becomes a non-executive director e.g. Nigel McNair 
Scott became Chairman in 2012, ongoing participation in awards previously 
made in bonus and share schemes will be subject to the rules of those 
schemes and will be subject to the discretion of the Committee.
Share ownership guidelines
Senior executives will not normally be permitted to sell shares received through 
the 2004 PSP/2014 PSP, other than to meet taxation (and national insurance 
contributions) liabilities, for at least two years and until they own shares to the 
value of 200% of basic salary for executive directors and 100% of salary for 
other executives. This is increased for executive directors to 300% on the 
first vesting of share awards in respect of the 2014 PSP. 
Alignment with shareholder interests
The Remuneration Committee has analysed the potential gains that may be 
made by executives (directors and those below Board level) through the 2004 
PSP/2014 PSP and other incentive arrangements currently in place. It has 
concluded that the share of the increase in the value of the Group (measured as 
the increase in the net asset value, before incentives, plus cash returned as 
dividends to shareholders) that could accrue to all executives through the 
Group’s long and short-term incentive and bonus plans at the point at which 
the maximum awards vest over the term of the plans might be of the order of 
20%. At this point, in absolute terms, the Group will have increased its triple 
net asset value by at least 15% per annum with the Group’s relative 
performance placing it in the top quartile of IPD and Total Shareholder 
Return, over each three year period. 
Reward scenarios
The charts below show how the composition of the executive directors’ 
remuneration packages varies at three performance levels, namely, at minimum 
(i.e. fixed pay), target (assumed to be 50% of the maximum incentive levels) 
and maximum levels, under the policy set out in the table overleaf. 
Value of remuneration packages at different levels of performance
The chart is based on:
• salary levels effective 1 April 2015.
• an approximated annual value of benefits (no pension is provided).
•  a £1.5m maximum annual bonus for the Chief Executive, a £500,000 
maximum annual bonus for the Finance Director and a 300% of salary 
maximum annual bonus for the other executive directors (based on Gerald 
Kaye’s package for simplicity) (with target assumed to be 50% of the 
maximum).
•  a 300% of salary award under the 2014 PSP in line with the normal 
maximum award (with target assumed to be 50% of the maximum). No 
share price appreciation in respect of the 2014 PSP awards has been 
assumed. 
Remuneration Committee
The Committee comprises Michael O’Donnell, as Chairman, Richard Gillingwater 
and Richard Grant, all of whom have served throughout the year. Andrew Gulliford 
stepped down as Chairman and member of the Committee on 11 February 
2015. Each member of the Committee is an independent non-executive director. 
The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee. The terms of 
reference of the Committee are available on request and are included on the 
Group’s website at www.helical.co.uk. 
Advisors to the Committee
The Committee consults the Chief Executive and Finance Director about its 
proposals and has access to professional advice from independent remuneration 
consultants, New Bridge Street, to help it determine appropriate remuneration 
arrangements. Terms of reference for New Bridge Street, which provided no 
other services to the Company, are available from the Company Secretary on 
request. Their fees for the year to 31 March 2015 amounted to £42,710 
(2014: £46,167).

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REMUNERATION POLICY 
FOR THE YEAR TO 31 MARCH 2016
Executive directors’ basic annual salary and benefits-in-kind
The basic package of salary and benefits is designed to match the experience 
and responsibilities of each director and is reviewed annually to ensure that it 
is consistent with and appropriate to their responsibilities and expectations. 
The Group does not provide any separate pension provision for executive 
directors and expects individuals to provide for their retirement through their 
basic salaries and incentive payments. Executive directors’ basic annual salaries 
at 31 March 2015 and increases from 1 July 2015 are as follows:

375,000 7 ,500 382,500
DUNCAN WALKER 318,270 6,330 324,600
The Committee’s policy in respect of basic salaries is that they should be 
reviewed annually and increased to reflect an appropriate level of salary inflation 
or greater to reflect increases in the scale, scope or responsibility of their roles 
or to allow recently appointed executives to move to market norms as their 
experience and contribution increase. Reflecting this policy, the Committee 
has determined that all the executive directors, will receive increases of 2% 
from 1 July 2015, compared to an average 8% awarded to other employees. 
Benefits-in-Kind 
Benefits-in-kind provided to executive directors comprise the provision of a 
company car or car allowance, private medical cover, permanent health insurance 
and life insurance. There is no Group pension scheme for directors and no 
contributions will be paid by the Group to the directors’ own pension schemes. 
Non-executive directors’ fees
In line with executive directors, the non-executive directors receive annual 
inflationary increases which, with effect from 1 July 2015, will be 2%.

1 July 2015, are as follows:

ANNUAL BONUSES
Executive Bonus Plan 2011
Michael Slade and Tim Murphy will continue to be eligible to participate in the 
Executive Bonus Plan 2011 (the “2011 Plan”) for the year ending 31 March 
2016. The Committee may, at its discretion, award bonuses in respect of the 
year ending 31 March 2016 subject to performance conditions based on 
absolute net asset value, un-geared total property return and relative net 
asset value per share versus the IPD, the aim of which is to link the size of 
bonuses paid to the financial growth of the Group over that financial year. 
The total amount payable under the 2011 Plan in any one year will continue to be 
limited to £2.0m. An individual employee’s participation in the 2011 Plan is limited 
so that the bonus which may be paid to him under the 2011 Plan will not exceed 
£1.5m per annum. There is a further limit that payments under the 2011 Plan in 
any year may not exceed 20% of the Group’s pre-tax profits adding back any 
payments under the Group’s bonus schemes. Among other constraints the 
Committee could restrict the bonuses if payment would affect the financial or 
trading position of the Group.
Participants in this scheme who do not have a minimum shareholding in the 
Company of 200% of basic salary will receive up to one third of any bonus in 
shares deferred for three years.
The main features of the 2011 Plan and details of how it operated for the 
year ended 31 March 2015, which will be consistent with how it will operate 
for the year ending 31 March 2016, are set out on pages 66 to 67 . The year 
to 31 March 2016 will be the final year of operation of the 2011 Plan and 
proposals for its replacement will be considered during that year and put to 
shareholders for approval at the 2016 AGM.
Helical Bar Annual Bonus Scheme 2012
Gerald Kaye, Matthew Bonning-Snook and Duncan Walker will continue to 
participate in the Helical Bar Annual Bonus Scheme 2012 which was approved 
by Shareholders at the 2012 AGM. Neither the Chief Executive nor the Finance 
Director participate in the Scheme given their participation in the 2011 Plan. 
This scheme provides annual bonuses based on the performance of the Group’s 
property portfolio and is aligned with shareholders’ interests through a profit 
sharing model, with appropriate hurdles and shareholder protections 
(including deferral and clawback). 
The distribution of the Bonus Award Pools to participants will continue to be 
restricted for 2015/16 to the lower of 70% of the balance of the Bonus Award 
Pool and 300% of salary. Any excess will be deferred and carried forward to the 
subsequent year to form part of the Bonus Award Pool for the subsequent year(s).
The main features of the 2012 Bonus Scheme and details of how it operated 
for the year ended 31 March 2015, which will be consistent with how it will 
operate for the year ending 31 March 2016, are set out on page 67 .
Jack Pitman, a former director, will continue to receive annual bonuses out of 
the Bonus Award Pool as at 31 March 2015 in accordance with the “Good 
Leaver” provisions of the scheme. 
LONG-TERM INCENTIVES 
Performance Share plan
It is anticipated that long-term incentives will be granted to all executive directors 
and senior management in the form of shares awarded under the terms of the 
2014 PSP Scheme. For executive directors the awards will be granted at 
300% of base salary. 
The main features of the 2014 PSP are as follows:
•  awards will normally vest no earlier than the third anniversary of their grant 
to the extent that the applicable performance conditions (see below) have 
been satisfied and the participant is still employed by the Group. Once 
exercisable, awards will remain capable of exercise for a period of normally 
no more than six months.
•  no award may be granted to an individual in any financial year over shares 
worth more than three times salary.
•    there are three performance conditions, one based on absolute growth in 
the Group’s net asset value per share, one based on the gross (ungeared) 
total property return per share relative to other property funds as 
determined by IPD and one based on relative total shareholder return.
•  performance conditions for the awards to be granted in 2015 will, subject 
to shareholder approval, be measured over the three years following grant 
as follows:

The comparator group for the awards to be granted in 2015 will be the companies included in the FTSE 350 Super Sector Real Estate Index, excluding 
storage companies and agencies. 
Share awards will lapse in full where:
 - net asset value per share (having added back dividends) does not increase over the three year performance period; or
 -  the gross return falls below the IPD median, the growth in triple net asset value is below 7 .5% per annum and relative TSR is below median over the three 
year period.
APPLICATION OF THE REMUNERATION POLICY IN THE YEAR TO 31 MARCH 2015
Balance of fixed versus variable pay
In line with its policy, the Committee seeks to ensure that the balance of remuneration provides a basic salary below the median, and performance related 
bonuses and share awards that reward absolute performance and outperformance relative to the Group’s peer group. In the year to 31 March 2015, the 
balance of fixed versus variable pay on an actual basis for the executive directors compared to the maximum payable was as follows:

Executive Bonus Plan 2011 
In 2011, shareholders approved the renewal of the Executive Bonus Plan 
(the “2011 Plan”) for a further five years. Michael Slade and Tim Murphy 
were eligible for 2011 Plan bonuses during the year. T otal 2011 Plan bonuses 
for the year to 31 March 2015 of £2,000,000 (2014: £2,000,000) have been 
accrued in the financial statements for the year to 31 March 2015 and are 
payable in June 2015.
The performance conditions which applied for the year ended 31 March 2015 
were as follows:
•  increase in net asset value: net asset value at the end of the financial year 
exceeds net asset value at the beginning of the financial year;
•  absolute performance of the portfolio - un-geared total return: the percentage 
increase in the total return on property assets of the Group over the financial 
year (the “Performance Period”) is greater than the percentage increase 
achieved by the portfolio ranked nearest to three-quarters up the performance 
table (taken in ascending order of return) (the “Upper Quartile”) of the 
portfolios of all quarterly valued funds measured by the Investment Property 
Databank at the beginning of the relevant Performance Period and 
compounded monthly during the Performance Period (the “IPD Total 
Return Benchmark”); and
•  performance of the net asset value per share: the percentage increase in 
net asset value per share for the Performance Period must be greater than 
the percentage increase achieved by the Upper Quartile of the portfolios 
of all quarterly valued funds measured by the Investment Property Databank 
at the beginning of the relevant Performance Period and compounded monthly 
during the Performance Period (the “IPD Capital Growth Benchmark”).

dIREC t ORs’ REMUNERAt ION REPORt continued
The total amount of bonus payable in the year ended 31 March 2015 was 
determined by: 
•  calculating the difference between the percentage increase in net asset value 
per share for the Performance Period and the percentage increase in the 
Upper Quartile of the IPD Capital Growth Benchmark over the same period 
(the “Difference”); and
•  calculating the sum of the amounts payable in relation to each 1% of the 
Difference on the following basis:
AMOUNT OF DIFFERENCE
% OF BASE NET ASSET VALUE 
PAYABLE
LESS THAN 1% 0.01
1% TO LESS THAN 2% 0.02
AND THEREAFTER FOR EVERY ADDITIONAL 1% An increment of 0.01
FOR EXAMPLE: FROM 4% TO LESS THAN 5% 0.05
If the net asset value at the end of a financial year is less than the net asset value 
at the beginning of that year, the bonus payable for any subsequent year will 
be calculated by reference to the highest net asset value in the preceding year.
In the year to 31 March 2015, the application of the bonus calculation to the 
results of the Group resulted in a potential total bonus payment of £4,612,000. 
This was reduced to the maximum amount payable of £2,000,000. Bonuses 
paid under the terms of this 2011 Plan in the last six years are as follows:
YEAR

Helical Bar Annual Bonus Scheme 2012
The Helical Bar Annual Bonus Scheme 2012 was approved by shareholders 
at the 2012 AGM. This scheme provides annual cash bonuses based on the 
performance of the Group’s property portfolio and is aligned with shareholders 
through a profit sharing model, with appropriate hurdles and shareholder 
protections (including deferral and clawback). Total 2012 Bonus Scheme 
Bonuses have been accrued in the financial statements for the year to 
31 March 2015 and the cash element will be payable in June 2015. 
The main features of the 2012 Bonus Scheme as applied to the year to 
31 March 2015 are as follows:
•  the scheme participants were Gerald Kaye, Matthew Bonning-Snook, 
Duncan Walker and former director, Jack Pitman. Neither the Chief Executive 
nor the Finance Director participate in the Scheme given their participation 
in the 2011 Plan;
•  all property assets held during the year were allocated to one of two pools 
namely the “Investment Pool” or the “Development Pool” (“Profit Pools”);
•  investment assets are included at valuation as at 31 March 2014 with 
subsequent valuation movements increasing or decreasing the size of the 
relevant Profit Pool. Development assets were also included at valuation as 
at 31 March 2014 with subsequent valuation movements increasing or 
decreasing the size of the Profit Pool. Any opening surpluses or deficits in 
the value of the trading and development assets as at the introduction of 
the scheme on 1 April 2012 were only included in the Profit Pools if they 
were realised;
•  development profits, development management fees, net rents, other income 
and profits/losses on the sale of property assets were allocated to the 
relevant Profit Pools; and
•  profits in the two Profit Pools were eligible for the award of bonuses once 
they were sufficient to exceed the recovery of all related finance costs, a charge 
for the use of the Company’s equity at a rate equivalent to the Company’s 
weighted average cost of debt plus a margin (reviewed regularly to reflect 
any changes in the cost of debt and the risk profile of the Company’s activities), 
the Group’s total administrative costs (excluding performance related 
remuneration) and any unallocated losses from the previous three 
financial years.
SHAREHOLDER PROTECTIONS 
•  no more than 10% of profits are available to participants for distribution 
(“Bonus Award Pool”) at the end of the relevant financial year. Pool allocations 
between participants are based on a set formula agreed at the start of the 
financial year;
•  the distribution of the Bonus Award Pools to participants are restricted in 
any financial year to the lower of 70% of the balance of the Bonus Award 
Pool and 300% of salary (except in years five and ten as noted below). Any 
excess is deferred and carried forward to the subsequent year to form part 
of the Bonus Award Pool for the subsequent year(s);
•  two thirds of any payment is made in cash after the relevant financial year 
end and one third is deferred for three years into Helical Bar plc shares;
•  in addition to any annual payments, at the end of the fifth and tenth years 
of operating the scheme, any Bonus Award Pool not paid out will be distributed 
to participants in the form of deferred shares for three years, subject to an 
additional individual limit of 300% of salary each time;
•  no payments will be made where the Company has not generated a profit 
(amounts will be deferred until a profit is generated). In addition, the 
Remuneration Committee will retain discretion to increase the deferred 
share amount (up to 100% of the payment) or not to make a payment at 
all (with any amounts reverting back to the Company rather than remaining 
in the Bonus Award Pool) where it is considered appropriate to do so;
•  net losses will be carried forward in Profit Pools for offset against future 
net profits. Carry forward of losses will be for a minimum of three years, 
subject to extension at the request of the Remuneration Committee;
•  The scheme will operate a clawback provision whereby amounts deferred, 
amounts held in Bonus Award Pools or the net of tax amounts paid may be 
recovered in the event of a misstatement of results, an error being made in 
assessing the calculation of Bonus Award Pools or in the event of gross 
misconduct; and
•  The share of any increase in value of the Company (measured as the 
increase in net asset value plus cash returned as dividends) that could 
accrue to all executives through the Group’s long and short-term incentive 
and bonus plans at maximum vesting/payouts during the lifetime of the 
plans will continue to be no more than 20%. 68

The share price used to calculate the expected value at vesting was 387 .24p, based on the average share price over the three months to 31 March 2015.
The 2004 PSP numbers presented for the comparatives in the remuneration table above are based on the 2004 PSP awards granted on 5 July 2011. The 
three year performance period to 31 March 2014 showed that the net asset value per share, calculated in accordance with the terms of the 2004 PSP, had 
increased by 10.42% p.a. During this three year period the total return of Helical’s property portfolio, as determined by IPD, was 12.9% compared to the 
median of the IPD Benchmark which showed a return of 8.3%. Therefore, 62.56% of the shares vested.

scheme will continue until its renewal in October 2015 but other benefits-in-kind ceased on 31 March 2015. In respect of his incentives, it was determined by

and 2014 PSP. He will receive cash bonuses in respect of the Annual Bonus Scheme 2012 for the year to 31 March 2015 and in respect of the balance 
remaining in that scheme at that date for a further three years in line with the plan rules, subject to offset of future losses and clawback. The 2012 PSP is

Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the 
Remuneration Report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
The directors consider that the annual report and the financial statements, 
taken as a whole, provide the information necessary to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy and is fair, balanced and 
understandable.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the directors have to prepare financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by 
the European Union (IFRSs).
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Group and Company and of the profit or loss of the Group and 
Company for that period.
In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
•  state whether applicable IFRSs have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and,
•  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that 
are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company 
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements and Remuneration 
Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and article 4 of the IAS 
Regulations. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
•  the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of 
accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit or loss of the Group and the undertakings included in 
the consolidation taken as a whole; and,
•  the annual report, including the strategic report, includes a fair review of 
the development and performance of the business and the position of the 
Group and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on the Group’s website. Legislation in the 
United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

•  the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union;
•  the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as applied 
in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and

Who we are reporting to
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance 
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has 
been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other 
purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.
What we have audited
Helical Bar plc’s financial statements comprise the Consolidated Income 
Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the 
Consolidated and Company Balance Sheets, the Consolidated and Company 
Cash Flow Statements, the Consolidated and Company Statements of 
Changes in Equity and the related notes.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation 
is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and, as 
regards the parent company financial statements, as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Our assessment of risk 
In arriving at our opinions set out in this report, we highlight the following 
risks that are, in our judgement, likely to be most important to users’ 
understanding of our audit. 
AUd It RIs K HOW WE REs PONd Ed t O t HE RIs K
Revenue recognition
The risk: The Group enters into contracts under which 
the recognition of revenue and profit often involves 
management judgement in applying International Accounting 
Standard (IAS) 18, IAS 11 and International Financial 
Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) 15, or is 
determined by complex criteria such as staged recognition 
of revenue upon completion of specified contractual 
obligations. In addition, auditing standards prescribe a 
presumed risk of fraud in revenue recognition in that 
revenue may be misstated through improper recognition. 
We have therefore identified revenue recognition as a 
significant risk requiring special audit consideration.
Our response: Our audit work included, but was not limited to:
•  evaluating the Group’s revenue recognition policies are in line with accounting standards and 
their application to key development contracts;
• testing property proceeds to completion statements;
•  agreeing rental income to tenant records and reconciling differences to relevant evidence such 
as changes to lease terms;
•  testing a sample of revenue items for each revenue stream, agreeing items selected for testing 
to supporting documentation; 
•  reviewing contracts to ensure that revenue and profit has been correctly accounted for; and 
•  discussing and challenging key management judgements in interpreting contractual terms. 
The Group’s accounting policy on the recognition of income is shown in note 38 and the 
components of that income are included in note 2. 
Valuation of investment properties 
The risk: The Group holds investment property for rental 
income and capital appreciation which it has chosen to 
revalue to fair value at each reporting date in accordance 
with IAS 40 ‘Investment Property’. The fair values of 
significant investment properties are determined by 
professionally qualified external valuers. 
These valuations involve a number of estimates and 
assumptions, some of which derive from information 
provided by management and can be highly judgemental. 
In addition a small percentage difference in individual 
property valuations could, when aggregated, result in a 
material misstatement. We have therefore identified the 
valuation of investment properties as a significant risk 
requiring special audit consideration.
Our response: Our audit work included, but was not restricted to:
•  obtaining an understanding of the approach to, and controls over, the valuation of investment 
property through discussions with management; 
•  meeting with the external valuer, discussing and challenging the estimates, assumptions and 
valuation methodology used; 
•  discussing and challenging the estimates, assumptions and valuation methodology used in the 
directors’ valuations;
•  comparing the accuracy of prior period valuations in the context of subsequent sales;
•  reviewing the accounting treatment of complex transactions to confirm the recognition of any 
sale or purchase as appropriate; and 
•  assessing the independence and credentials of the external valuer and evaluating the 
adequacy of the valuer’s work in respect of our audit. 
The group’s accounting policy on investment properties is included in note 38 and its 
disclosures about investment properties are shown in note 15. The Audit Committee also 
identified the valuation of the Group’s investment and trading and development portfolio is 
the key area of judgement in its report on pages 56 and 57 , where the Committee also 
describes how it addressed this issue. 
Directors’ remuneration – bonus and performance 
share plans 
The risk: The Group operates three directors’ bonus and 
share plans being the Executive Bonus Plan 2011, the 
Helical Bar Annual Bonus Scheme 2012 and the 
Performance Share Plan. 
Determining the charge in respect of the Performance 
Share Plan in accordance with IFRS 2 ‘Share Based 
Payments’ involves complex calculations and elements of 
management judgement. The bonus calculation is driven 
by the results of the Group and the performance of the 
property portfolio, the latter of which is considered a key 
area of management judgement. We have therefore 
identified the bonus and performance share plans as 
areas requiring particular audit attention. 
Our response: Our audit work included, but was not restricted to:
• confirming that the calculation methodologies adopted accord with the schemes’ rules;
•  discussing and challenging management judgements over the key inputs into the bonus 
calculation and performance share plan. Appropriate explanations and supporting evidence 
were provided;
•  confirming that matters in relation to the changes in the performance measures, to include an 
increase in total shareholder returns, and approval of awards that required approval of the 
Remuneration Committee have been approved; 
•  assessing and challenging management assumptions relating to the development stock 
surplus which is a key input into the bonus calculation. Supporting evidence was provided for 
explanations obtained; and
•  challenging the assumptions underlying the forecast net asset value growth of the Group over 
the three year vesting period of the Performance Share Plan options and future bonus cap. 
The group’s disclosure of staff costs, share options and share based payments is shown in note 8.

OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY AND AN 
OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT
Materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements 
that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable 
user would be changed or influenced. We determined materiality for the audit of 
the Group financial statements as a whole to be £3.605 million, which is 
approximately 1% of net assets. This benchmark is considered the most 
appropriate because this is a key performance measure used by the Board of 
Directors to report to investors on the financial position of the Group. We use a 
different level of materiality, performance materiality, to drive the extent of our 
testing and this was set at 75% of financial statement materiality for the audit of 
the Group financial statements. We also determine a lower level of specific 
materiality for certain areas such as directors’ remuneration and related party 
transactions. 
We determined the threshold at which we will communicate misstatements to the 
Audit Committee to be £181,000. In addition we will communicate misstatements 
below that threshold that, in our view, warrant reporting on qualitative grounds.
Overview of the scope of our audit
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). Our responsibilities under those standards are 
further described in the ‘Responsibilities for the financial statements and the 
audit’ section of our report. We consider the audit evidence we have obtained 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with those Ethical Standards.
Our audit approach was based on a thorough understanding of the Group’s 
business and was risk-based. The Group’s properties are spread across 
wholly owned statutory entities and the Group’s 11 joint ventures. The 
components of the Group were evaluated by the group audit team based on 
a measure of materiality, considering each as a percentage of total Group 
assets, revenues and profit before tax, to assess the significance of each 
component and to determine the planned audit response. For those 
components that were deemed significant either a full scope or targeted 
audit approach was determined based on their relative materiality to the 
Group and our assessment of audit risk. For significant components requiring 
a full scope approach we evaluated and tested controls over the financial 
reporting systems identified as part of our risk assessment, reviewed the 
accounts production process and addressed critical accounting matters. 
In order to address the audit risks described above, as identified during our 
planning procedures, we performed a full scope audit of the consolidated 
financial statements of the parent company, Helical Bar plc, and of the 
financial information of the Group’s operations throughout the United 
Kingdom. The operations that were subject to full scope audit procedures 
make up 82% of net assets. Statutory audits of subsidiaries are performed to 
lower materiality where applicable.
While the majority of the operations are located within the United Kingdom, the 
Group has joint ventures overseas. Through an analysis of these operations we 
determined that targeted audit procedures should be carried out, these targeted 
procedures addressed the significant risks described above. Those components 
subjected to targeted audit procedures comprise 18% of net assets.
The components that were subject to full scope audit procedures make up 
82% of the Group’s net assets at the balance sheet date, 100% of the 
Group’s revenue for the year and 68% of the Group’s profit before tax for the 
year. In total our full scope and targeted procedures covered 100% of the 
Group’s net assets at the balance sheet date, 100% of the Group’s revenue 
for the year and 100% of the Group’s profit before tax for the year.

during the audit and the directors’ statement that they consider the annual 
report is fair, balanced and understandable; or

or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches 
not visited by us; or

Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or
•  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

on page 74, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.

Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.

of investment properties, available-for-sale investments, convertible bonds and derivative financial instruments. The measurement bases and principal 
accounting policies of the Group are set out in note 38. These accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the year to 31 March 2014, as amended

During the year to 31 March 2014, the Group purchased a loan from one of its lenders realising a gain of £2,899,000.
On projects where specific third party loans have been arranged, interest has been capitalised in accordance with IAS 23 - Borrowing Costs, at the rate for the 
individual loan. The weighted average capitalised interest rate of such loans was 3.68% (2014: 3.57%). Where general finance has been used to fund the 
acquisition and construction of properties the rate used was a weighted average of the financing costs for the applicable borrowings of 4.62% (2014: 4.60%).

Factors that may affect future tax charges
The tax charge is expected to be less than the full rate in future years, primarily due to the Group continuing to claim allowances in respect of eligible 
expenditure on investment properties. 87

DEFERRED TAX (LIABILITY)/ASSET (1,456) 8,458 1,233 749
Other temporary differences include deferred tax assets arising from the recognition of the fair value of derivative financial instruments and future tax relief 
available to the Group from capital allowances and when share awards vest. The deferred tax liability of £3,278,000 arising on the profit on the fair value of the 
forward property contract has also been included in other temporary differences. £2,477 ,000 of the increase in the deferred tax in respect of future tax relief 
for share awards has been recognised in reserves in accordance with IAS12.
The Group contains entities with tax losses for which no deferred tax asset is recognised. The total unrecognised losses amount to approximately £9,036,000. 
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised because the entities in which the losses have been generated either do not have forecast taxable profits or the 
losses have restrictions whereby their utilisation is considered to be unlikely.
If upon sale of the investment properties the Group retained all the capital allowances, the deferred tax provision in respect of capital allowances of £1,561,000 
(2014: £1,264,000) would be released and further capital allowances of £18,031,000 (2014: £11,400,000) would be available to reduce future tax liabilities.

The loss for the year of the Company was £1,316,000 (2014: profit of £23,072,000).
14.  EARNINGS PER SHARE
The calculation of the basic earnings per share is based on the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the weighted average number of 
shares in issue during the year. This is a different basis to the net asset per share calculations which are based on the number of shares at the year end. 
Shares held by the ESOP, which has waived its entitlement to receive dividends, are treated as cancelled for the purposes of this calculation.
The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on the basic earnings per share, adjusted to allow for the effect of all dilutive options and awards. 88

Interest capitalised in respect of the refurbishment of investment properties is included in investment properties to the extent of £5,449,000 (2014: 
£4,782,000).
Investment properties with a total fair value of £628,621,000 (2014: £474,200,000) were held as security against borrowings.
All of the Group’s properties are level 3, as defined by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement, in the fair value hierarchy as at 31 March 2015 and there were no 
transfers between levels during the year. Level 3 inputs used in valuing the properties, are those which are unobservable, as opposed to level 1 (inputs from 
quoted prices) and level 2 (observable inputs either directly, i.e. as prices, or indirectly, i.e. derived from prices).
Transfers into and transfers out of the fair value hierarchy levels are recognised on the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer. 
There were no transfers in or out of Level 3 for investment properties during the year.
Valuation methodology
The fair value of the Group’s investment property as at 31 March 2015 was determined by independent external valuers at that date, except for investment 
properties valued by the Directors. The valuations are in accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (‘RICS’) Valuation – Professional 
Standards (“The Red Book”) and the International Valuation Standards and were arrived at by reference to market transactions for similar properties. Fair values 
for investment properties are calculated using the present value income approach. The main assumptions underlying the valuations are in relation to rent profile 
and yields as discussed below. A key driver of the property valuations is the terms of the leases in place at the valuation date. These determine the cash flow 
profile of the property for a number of years. The valuation assumes adjustments from these rental values to current market rent at the time of the next rent 
review (where a typical lease allows only for upward adjustment) and as leases expire and are replaced by new leases. The current market level of rent is 
assessed based on evidence provided by the most recent relevant leasing transactions and negotiations. The nominal equivalent yield is applied as a discount 
rate to the rental cash flows which, after taking into account other input assumptions such as vacancies and costs, generates the market value of the property. 
The equivalent yield applied is assessed by reference to market transactions for similar properties and takes into account, amongst other things, any risks 
associated with the rent uplift assumptions.
The net initial yield is calculated as the current net income over the gross market value of the asset and is used as a sense check and to compare against 
market transactions for similar properties. The valuation output, along with inputs and assumptions, are reviewed to ensure these are in line with what a market 
participant would use when pricing each asset.
There are interrelationships between all the inputs as they are determined by market conditions. The existence of an increase in more than one input would be 
to magnify the input on the valuation. The impact on the valuation will be mitigated by the interrelationship of two inputs in opposite directions.
Details of the investment portfolio yields can be found on page 19 of this report. 90

Significant Judgements and Estimates 
There are a number of companies which are accounted for as joint ventures where the Group has an equity interest of less than 50%. This typically occurs 
where the Group’s joint venture partner is providing a greater share of finance into the Company, with the Group contributing a greater share towards the day 
to day management of the underlying project. In these cases neither party has control over the entity and therefore it is considered appropriate to account for 
our interest as a joint venture. 
Dividends of £17 ,013,000 were received from joint venture companies during the year (2014: £1,350,000). The joint venture companies are private 
companies, therefore no quoted market prices are available for their shares. 
The Group’s investment in Helical Sosnica Sp. zoo has been accounted for as an investment held for sale due to a commitment to sell the Group’s share within 
the next year. At 31 March 2015 Helical Sosnica Sp. zoo held a development property the fair value of which the Directors believe to be £81,866,000 (of 
which Helical’s share is £40,933,000) and a bank loan of £51,156,000 (of which Helical’s share is £25,578,000) repayable in September 2017 .

The Group has assigned its forward purchase contract on Clifton Street, London EC2 to a third party. The agreement to assign the forward purchase contract is 
considered to be a derivative financial instrument. As such, under IAS 39, it is carried at its fair value with gains and losses taken to the Income Statement. The 
fair value inputs represent Level 2 fair value measurements as defined by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement. The fair value of this assignment contract at 31 
March 2015 is £16,388,000, being the contracted cash receipt of £17 .3m discounted for risk and the time value of money. The gain of £16,388,000 has been 
taken to the Income Statement as a development profit.

IMPAIRMENT IN THE YEAR (773) (1,024)
AT 31 MARCH 4,342 4,973
Included within available-for-sale investments are an amount lent to a company promoting a mainly residential mixed-use development and a holding of 20% of 
the equity of this company.
The loan and the equity are together classed as an available-for-sale investment and held at fair value. It is considered to be Level 3 of the IFRS 13 fair value 
hierarchy. The Group has determined its fair value by considering both the loan and the equity element separately. The loan element is valued at the fair value 
of the expected consideration to be received including anticipated future costs of recovering this loan. This amount has been impaired in the year due to a 
revision in the expected receipt. The value of the available-for-sale investment is 100% sensitive to changes in the expected repayment proceeds. The equity 
element is given a £nil value with the Group valuing the underlying company on a break up basis at £nil as it is believed that this is the most probable outcome. 
This £nil valuation is derived because the Group believe that the value of the property and any other of the company’s assets, after the repayment of the loan 
payable to the Group, would be required to repay the outstanding creditors leaving negligible value to the shareholders.
The Group does not consider that it has significant influence over this company despite having 20% of the equity as another party owns a majority 
shareholding and the Group does not have a representative on the board of the company.
The decline in value of £773,000 has been recognised in the Income Statement.

Bonds can be converted from 28 July 2014 up to and including 7 July 2017 , if the share price has traded at a level exceeding 130% of the exchange price for 
a specified period, and from 8 July 2017 to (but excluding) the seventh dealing day before 17 June 2019 at any time. On conversion, the Group can elect to 
settle the Bonds by any combination of ordinary shares and cash. The Convertible Bond is included at its carrying amount of £103,263,000 in borrowings

interest at rates based on LIBOR.

respectively. Interest is fixed on the retail bond and convertible bond as shown above, with the remaining borrowings being at floating rates. At 31 March 2014 
the Company’s borrowings consisted of fixed rate borrowings of £6,690,000 at 5.645%.
In addition to the above, the Group has a £50,000,000 interest rate swap at 1.865% starting in June 2016 and expiring in June 2026.

Capital Management
The Group’s capital management objectives are:
-  to ensure the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern; and, 
-  to provide an adequate return to shareholders.
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to its overall financing structure. It manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of 
changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust 
the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to reduce debt. Capital is defined as being issued 
share capital, share premium, retained earnings, revaluation reserve and other reserves (2015: £396,825,000; 2014: £333,977 ,000). The Group continually 
monitors its gearing level to ensure that it is appropriate. Gearing increased from 92% to 118% in the year as the Group took advantage of favourable debt 
market conditions.
The deferred shares were issued on 23 December 2004 to those shareholders electing to receive a dividend, rather than a capital repayment or further shares 
in the Company, as part of the Return of Cash approved by shareholders on 20 December 2004. The deferred shares carry no voting rights and have no right 
to a dividend or capital payment in the event of a winding up of the Company. 
The Company’s Articles of Association give the Company irrevocable authority to purchase all or any of the deferred shares for a maximum aggregate total of 1 
penny for all deferred shares in issue on the date of such purchase. 101

The carrying value of trade and other payables and borrowings is not deemed to be materially different from the fair value. Financial liabilities are stated in 
accordance with IAS 32.
The Group and Company financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are available-for-sale assets, forward exchange 
contracts and interest rate swaps, caps and floors, and those designated on initial recognition. 
Forward foreign exchange contracts are externally measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates 
matching maturities of the contracts. Interest rate swaps, caps and floors are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted 
based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates. 
IFRS 13 categorises financial assets and liabilities as being valued in 3 hierarchical levels:
-  Level 1: values are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
-  Level 2: values are derived from observing market data
-  Level 3: values cannot be derived from observable market data
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified as below:
LEVEL 1 CONVERTIBLE BOND (NOTE 26)
LEVEL 2 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (NOTE 27)
PROPERTY DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL ASSET (NOTE 21)
LEVEL 3 AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENT (NOTE 22)

The Group’s movement in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments in the year was a gain of £7 ,999,000 (2014: £5,312,000), of which a gain of 
£16,388,000 was due to the property derivative financial asset and a loss of £8,389,000 was due to interest rate caps and swaps. In accordance with IAS 39, 
the convertible bond is split into a loan and derivative element in the Company balance sheet. On initial recognition the derivative element had a value of 
£8,190,000. At 31 March 2015, the derivative element had a value of £9,182 ,000 with a corresponding loss of £992,000 recognised in the Income 
Statement. The movement in the Company’s interest rate swaps in the year was a loss of £2,021,000 (2014: gain of £1,098,000).
Credit risk
Credit risks arise from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed. To manage this risk the Group periodically assesses 
the financial reliability of customers, taking into account their financial position, past experience and other factors. 
As at 31 March 2015 the Group had total credit risk exposure excluding cash of £64,062,000 of which £4,342,000 is available-for-sale assets and 
£59,720,000 is loans and receivables. Available-for-sale assets are analysed in note 22. The cash is held with reputable banking institutions and in client 
accounts with solicitors and managing agents and therefore credit risk is considered low.
All other debtors are deemed to be recoverable.
All Company debtors are considered to be fully recoverable.
The Group is not reliant on any major customer for its ability to continue as a going concern.

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group would not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price. 
Liquidity and funding risks, related processes and policies are overseen by management.
The Group manages its liquidity risk on a consolidated basis based on business needs, tax, capital or regulatory considerations, if applicable, and through 
numerous sources of finance in order to maintain flexibility. Management monitors the Group’s net liquidity position through rolling forecasts on the basis of 
expected cash flows. The Group’s cash and cash equivalents are held with major regulated financial institutions and the directors regularly monitor the financial 
institutions that the group uses to ensure its exposure to liquidity risk is minimised.

The above contracted liabilities assume that no loans are extended beyond their current facility expiry date. Management believe that these facilities, together 
with anticipated sales and the renewal of some of these loan facilities, mean that the Group can meet its contracted liabilities as they fall due.
Market risk
The Group is exposed to market risk, primarily related to interest rates, foreign currency exchange movements, the market value of the investments and 
accrued development profits. The Group actively monitors these exposures.
Interest rate risk
It is the Group’s policy and practice to minimise interest rate cash flow exposures on long-term financing. The Group does this by using a number of derivative 
financial instruments including interest rate swaps and interest rate caps. The purpose of these derivatives is to manage the interest rate risks arising from the 
Group’s sources of finance. The Group does not use financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Details of financing and financial instruments can be found in note 27 .
In the year to 31 March 2015, if interest rates had moved by 0.5%, this would have resulted in the following movement to net profits and equity due to 
movements in interest charges and mark-to-market valuations of derivatives.

Foreign currency exchange risk
Due to its operations in Poland and its investment in a non-UK based property developer, the Group has exposure to exchange movements on foreign 
currencies. Helical’s management monitors its exposure to risks associated with foreign currency exchange risk and reviews any requirements to act to 
minimise these risks.
In the year to 31 March 2015 the Group made foreign exchange losses of £2,061,000 (2014: £501,000) resulting from movements in foreign exchange rates 
during the year affecting its assets and liabilities related to its overseas operations. 107

37 .  POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS
There were no material post balance sheet events.
38. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Basis of consolidation 
The Group financial statements consolidate those of Helical Bar plc (the “Company”) and all of its subsidiary undertakings (together the “Group”) drawn up to 
31 March 2015. Subsidiary undertakings are entities for which the Group is exposed to variable returns and has the ability to control those returns. Subsidiaries 
are accounted for under the purchase method and are held in the Company balance sheet at cost and reviewed annually for impairment.
Joint Ventures are entities whose economic activities are controlled jointly by the Group and by other ventures independent of the Group, where both parties 
are exposed to variable returns but neither has control over those returns. They are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, whereby the Group’s 
share of profit after tax in the Joint Venture is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement and the Group’s share of the Joint Venture’s net assets are 
incorporated in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The Company’s cost of investment in Joint Ventures less any provision for permanent impairment loss is shown in the Company Balance Sheet.
Associates are those entities over which the Group has significant influence but which are neither subsidiaries nor joint ventures. 
Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains on transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries and between subsidiaries are eliminated. Unrealised 
losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Going concern
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis as explained in the Governance Review on page 55.
Revenue recognition 
Rental income - rental income receivable is recognised in the Income Statement on a straight line basis over the lease term. Any incentive for lessees to enter 
into a lease agreement and any costs associated with entering into the lease are spread over the same period.
Sale of goods - assets, such as trading properties, development sites and completed developments, are regarded as sold upon the transfer of the significant 
risks and rewards of ownership to the purchaser, in accordance with IAS 18 Revenue. This occurs on exchange of unconditional contracts for the sale of the 
site, on satisfaction of any and all conditions on a conditional contract for the sale of the site or on completion of the contract on a conditional sale where those 
conditions are satisfied at completion. Measurements of revenue arising from the sale of such assets are derived from the fair value of the consideration 
received in accordance with IAS 18 Revenue. 108
 
HELICAL BAR PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015
 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued
38. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Construction contracts - where an asset is constructed under a specific 
contract with a purchaser (a “pre-sold development”) the initial sale of the site 
to that purchaser is recognised as a sale of goods in accordance with IAS 18 
Revenue, where the sale of the land is not conditional on the construction of 
the buildings and is not reversible in the event that the building is not 
constructed. The construction element of the contract is treated, for the 
purposes of revenue recognition, as a construction contract in accordance with 
IAS 11 Construction Contracts. Revenue is recognised by reference to the 
stage of completion which is typically determined by reference to project 
appraisals, normally supported by independent valuation certificates provided 
by quantity surveyors. The Company’s principal other responsibility on pre-sold 
developments is the identification of and agreement of terms with potential 
tenants of the completed building(s). The revenue recognition of this additional 
component of the funding agreements is considered separately to reflect the 
substance of the transaction as the rendering of services, in accordance with 
IAS 18 Revenue. The amount of revenue recognised is determined by 
reference to the percentage of the building(s) that are let. 
Property advisory/development management services - where the Group 
provides these services to the third party property site owner the Group 
recognises income over the period these services are provided and in 
accordance with the specific terms of the contract. If the amount and 
payment of the consideration for these services are contingent upon a future 
event (such as sale of the property) and if the fair value of the consideration 
can be reliably estimated, the Group recognises this income as its services 
are performed, discounting for time and risk if appropriate.
Investment income - revenue in respect of investment and other income 
represents investment income, fees and commissions earned on an accruals 
basis and the fair value of the consideration received/receivable on investments 
held for the short-term. Dividends are recognised when the shareholders’ right to 
receive payment has been established. Interest income is accrued on a time 
basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate.
Deferred income - money received in advance of the provision of goods or 
services is held in the balance sheet until the income can be recognised in 
the Income Statement.
Share-based payments 
The Group provides share-based payments in the form of performance share 
plan awards and a share incentive plan. These payments are discussed in 
greater detail in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 58 to 71. The 
fair value of share-based payments related to employees’ service are 
determined indirectly by reference to the fair value of the related instrument at 
the grant date. The Group uses the stochastic valuation model and the 
resulting value is amortised through the Consolidated Income Statement 
(“Income Statement”) over the vesting period of the share-based payments.
For the performance share plan and share incentive plan awards, where 
non-market conditions apply, the expense is allocated, over the vesting 
period, to the Income Statement based on the best available estimate of the 
number of awards that are expected to vest. Estimates are subsequently 
revised if there is any indication that the number of awards expected to vest 
differs from previous estimates.
The amount charged to the Income Statement is credited to the Retained 
Earnings reserve.
On exercise of the performance share plan options, the total cumulative 
amount recognised in the Income Statement for the options is moved from 
Retained Earnings to the Share Capital and Share Premium accounts. On 
lapsing of the performance share plan options, the total cumulative amount 
recognised in the Income Statement is reversed in the Income Statement and 
Retained Earnings.
Depreciation 
In accordance with IAS 40 Investment Property, depreciation is not provided 
for on freehold investment properties or on leasehold investment properties. 
The Group does not own the freehold land and buildings which it occupies. 
Costs incurred in respect of leasehold improvements to the Group’s head 
office at 5 Hanover Square, London W1S 1HQ are capitalised and held as 
short-term leasehold improvements. Leasehold improvements, plant and 
equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any 
recognised impairment loss. Residual values are reassessed annually.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets less residual 
value, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight line method, on the 
following basis:
Short leasehold improvements - 10% or length of lease, if shorter 
Plant and equipment - 25%
Taxation 
The taxation charge represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred 
tax. The charge for current taxation is based on the results for the year as 
adjusted for items which are non-assessable or disallowed. It is calculated 
using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date. Tax payable upon realisation of revaluation gains recognised in 
prior periods is recorded as a current tax charge with a release of the 
associated deferred taxation.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences 
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of 
taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences 
and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be 
utilised. The measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities reflects the tax 
consequences of the manner in which the Group expects, at the balance sheet 
date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of those assets and liabilities. Such 
assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from the 
initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business 
combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the 
tax profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance 
sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the assets to 
be recovered.
The deferred tax asset relating to share based payment awards reflects the 
estimated value of tax relief available on the vesting of the awards at the 
balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply 
when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is 
settled. It is recognised in the Income Statement except when it relates to 
items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is 
also dealt with in equity.
The Group recognises a deferred tax liability for all taxable temporary 
differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and 
interests in joint ventures, except to the extent that both of the following 
conditions are satisfied:
a)   the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
difference; and,
b)  it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future. 109

38. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Dividends 
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a 
liability in the financial statements in the period in which dividends are 
approved.
Investment properties 
Investment properties are properties owned or leased by the Group which are 
held for long-term rental income and for capital appreciation. Investment 
properties are initially recognised at cost, including associated transaction 
costs, and revalued at the balance sheet date to fair value. These fair values 
are based on market values as determined by professionally qualified external 
valuers or are determined by the directors of the Group based on their 
knowledge of the property. In accordance with IAS 40, investment properties 
held under leases are stated gross of the recognised finance lease liability.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment 
properties are recognised as gains or losses on revaluation in the Income 
Statement of the period in which they arise.
In accordance with IAS 40, as the Group uses the fair value model, no 
depreciation is provided in respect of investment properties including integral 
plant.
Property that is being constructed or developed for future use as an investment 
property is treated as investment property in accordance with IAS 40. 
When the Group redevelops an existing investment property for continued 
future use as investment property, the property remains an investment 
property measured at fair value and is not reclassified. Interest is capitalised 
before tax relief until the date of practical completion.
Details of the valuation of investment properties can be found in note 15.
Land, developments and trading properties
Land, developments and trading properties held for sale are inventory and are 
included in the Balance Sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of 
business less estimated costs to completion and estimated costs necessary 
to make the sale.
Gross borrowing costs associated with expenditure on properties under 
development or undergoing major refurbishment are capitalised. The interest 
capitalised is either based on the interest paid (where a project has a specific 
loan) or calculated using the Group’s weighted average cost of borrowings 
(where there are no specific borrowings for the project). Interest is capitalised 
from the date of commencement of the development work until date of 
practical completion. 
Investments 
Available-for-sale investments are revalued to fair value at the balance sheet 
date. Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income except to the extent that losses are 
attributable to impairment below historic cost, in which case they are 
recognised in the Income Statement. Upon disposal, accumulated fair value 
adjustments are included in the Income Statement. 
Held for sale investments 
Investments are defined as held for sale when the Group intends to sell the 
investment and if sale is highly probable. Such held for sale investments are 
measured at the lower of their carrying amounts immediately prior to their 
classification as held for sale and their fair value less costs to sell. 
Trade receivables 
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated initially at fair value 
and subsequently at amortised cost as reduced by appropriate allowances for 
estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the Balance Sheet at amortised 
cost. For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents 
comprise cash in hand, deposits with banks, cash held at solicitors, cash in 
blocked accounts and other short-term, highly liquid investments with original 
maturities of three months or less.
Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are not interest bearing and are initially recognised 
at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
Borrowing and borrowing costs 
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts and the Group’s retail bond are 
initially recorded at fair value, net of finance and other costs yet to be 
amortised in accordance with IAS39. Embedded derivatives contained within 
the borrowing agreements are treated in accordance with IAS39, which 
includes consideration of whether embedded derivatives require bifurcation. 
The retail bond and bank loans are held at amortised cost.
Convertible bonds are designated as fair value through the profit and loss 
and so are presented on the Balance Sheet at fair value, with all gains and 
losses, including the write-off of issuance costs, recognised in the Income 
Statement. The interest charge in respect of the coupon rate on the bonds 
has been recognised within Finance Costs on an accruals basis. 
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition and construction of 
new developments and investment properties are added to the costs of such 
properties until the date of completion of the development or investment. 
After initial recognition borrowings are carried at amortised cost. This 
treatment has been adopted since transition to IFRS.
Gains or losses on extinguishing debt are recognised in the Income 
Statement in the period in which they occur.
Derivative financial instruments 
Derivative financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the 
Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions 
of the instrument.
The Group enters into derivative transactions such as interest rate caps and 
floors, and forward foreign currency contracts in order to manage the risks 
arising from its activities. Derivatives are initially recorded at fair value and are 
subsequently remeasured to fair value based on market prices, estimated 
future cash flows and forward rates as appropriate. Any change in the fair 
value of such derivatives is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
A derivative property asset is recognised on the Balance Sheet when the 
Group has contractually assigned an existing purchase contract. A derivative 
property asset is initially recorded at its fair value and is remeasured at each 
reporting period date to its fair value, which is based upon the future 
contracted cash flow discounted for both time and risk. Any change in fair 
value is recognised in the Income Statement as a development profit.
Further information on the categorisation of financial instruments can be 
found in note 36. 110

38.    PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Leases 
Leases are classified according to the substance of the transaction. A lease 
that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
lessee is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as 
operating leases.
In accordance with IAS 40, finance leases of investment property are 
accounted for as finance leases and recognised as an asset and an 
obligation to pay future minimum lease payments. The investment property 
asset is included in the Balance Sheet at fair value, gross of the recognised 
finance lease liability. Lease payments are allocated between the liability and 
finance charges so as to achieve a constant financing rate.
In accordance with IAS17 , operating leases receipts are spread on a 
straight-line basis over the length of the lease.
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling 
at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign 
currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet 
date. Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign 
currency are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. 
Any exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on 
translating monetary items at rates different from those at which they were 
initially recorded are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in 
which they arise. Exchange differences on non-monetary items are 
recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income to the extent that 
they relate to a gain or loss on that non-monetary item which is included in 
the Statement of Comprehensive Income, otherwise such gains and losses 
are recognised in the Income Statement. 
The assets and liabilities in the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries 
are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 
Income and expenses are translated at the average rate. The exchange 
differences arising from the retranslation of the opening net investment in 
subsidiaries are recognised in Other Comprehensive Income. On disposal of 
a foreign operation the cumulative translation differences (including, if 
applicable, gains and losses on related hedges) are transferred to the Income 
Statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal. 
Net asset values per share 
Net asset values per share have been calculated in accordance with the best 
practice recommendations of the European Public Real Estate Association 
(“EPRA”).
Earnings per share 
Earnings per share have been calculated in accordance with IAS 33 and the 
best practice recommendations of EPRA.
Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust 
Shares held in the Helical Bar Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust 
(“ESOP”) are shown as a deduction in arriving at equity funds on 
consolidation. Assets, liabilities and reserves of the ESOP are included in the 
statutory headings to which they relate. Purchases and sales of own shares 
increase or decrease the book value of “Own shares held” in the Balance 
Sheet. At each period end the Group assesses and recognises the value of 
“Own shares held” with reference to the expected cash proceeds and 
accounts for movement between book value and fair value as a reserves 
transfer.
Use of estimates and judgements 
To be able to prepare accounts according to the accounting principles, 
management must make estimates and assumptions that affect the asset 
and liability items and revenue and expense amounts recorded in the 
financial statements. These estimates are based on historical experience and 
various other assumptions that management and the Board of Directors 
believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these 
considerations form the basis for making judgements about the carrying 
value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources.
Areas requiring the use of estimates and critical judgement that may 
significantly impact on the Group’s earnings and financial position are:
Estimates
-  Recognition of share-based payments which is dependent upon the 
estimated number of performance share plan awards that will vest at the 
end of the periods based on future forecast performance and employee 
retention (note 30);
-  The provision for future bonuses payable under the Annual Bonus scheme 
(note 8);
-  Valuation of investment properties, including Directors’ valuations and where 
external valuers are used to provide third party valuations (note 15); and
-  Directors’ valuation of land, development and trading properties include 
subjective assumptions including the results of future planning decisions 
and future sales values and timings (note 20).
Judgements
-  Calculation and assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, 
where it has been assumed that sufficient taxable profits will be available 
in future periods to allow all of the assets to be recovered (note 11);
-  Assessment of whether the exercise of option contracts entered into by 
the Group over the sale and purchase of properties are considered 
probable (note 15);
-  Assessment of whether forward sales can be recognised as a 
development profit by considering the likelihood of the inflow of the 
economic benefits and assessing the level of profit, taking into account the 
time value of money and risk (note 21);
-  An assessment of the most suitable accounting treatment for convertible 
bonds (note 26);
-  Consideration of the nature of joint arrangements. In the context of IFRS 
10, this involves consideration of where the control lies and whether either 
party has the power to vary its returns from the arrangements. In particular, 
significant judgement is exercised where the shareholding of the Group is 
not 50% (note 19); and
-  Consideration of whether an investment property purchase that has 
exchanged but not completed should be recognised as investment 
property under IAS 40. The judgement lies in assessing whether the 
exchange is unconditional, in which case it is recognised (note 15). 111

This analysis incorporates the separate components of the results of the consolidated subsidiaries and Helical’s share of its joint ventures’ results into 
‘See-through’ analysis of our property portfolio, debt profile and the associated income streams and financing costs, to assist in providing a comprehensive 
overview of the Group’s activities.
See-through net rental income and property overheads

updates to the Financial Reports, Results, Press Releases and Event 
Calendar sections of the Group’s website by subscribing to the Alert Service 
in the ‘News’ area of our website.
Payment of dividends
Shareholders whose dividends are not currently paid to mandated accounts may 
wish to consider having their dividends paid directly into their bank or building 
society account. This has a number of advantages, including the crediting of 
cleared funds into the nominated account on the dividend payment date. If 
shareholders would like their future dividends to be paid in this way, they should 
complete a mandate instruction available from the Registrars. Under this 
arrangement tax vouchers are sent to the shareholder’s registered address. 
Dividends for shareholders resident outside the UK
Instead of waiting for a sterling cheque to arrive by mail, you can ask us to 
send your dividends direct to your bank account. For information, contact the 
Company’s Registrar.
Dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP)
The Company offers shareholders the option to participate in a DRIP. This 
enables shareholders to reinvest their cash dividends in Helical Bar plc shares. 
For further details, contact the Company’s Registrar.
For participants in the DRIP, key dates of forthcoming dividends can be found 
in the online financial calendar in the ‘Investors’ area at www.helical.co.uk.
Share dealing service
An online and telephone share dealing service is available to our shareholders 
through Capita Deal. For further information on this service or to buy and sell 
shares online, please visit www.capitadeal.com. For telephone dealing, please 
call 0871 664 0446 (calls cost 10p per minute plus network extras).
ShareGift
Shareholders with a small number of shares, the value of which makes it 
uneconomic to sell them, may wish to consider donating them to a charity, 
ShareGift, (registered charity 1052686), which specialises in using such 
holdings for charitable benefit.
Further information about ShareGift is available at www.sharegift.org or by 
writing to: ShareGift, PO Box 72253, London, SW1P 9LQ.  
Email: help@sharegift.org. Telephone: 020 7930 3737 .

Unsolicited investment advice - warning to shareholders
Many companies have become aware that their shareholders have received 
unsolicited phone calls or correspondence concerning investment matters. 
These are typically from overseas-based ‘brokers’ who target UK 
shareholders offering to sell them what often turn out to be worthless or high 
risk shares in US or UK investments. They can be very persistent and 
extremely persuasive. It is not just the novice investor who has been duped in 
this way; many of the victims had been successfully investing for several 
years. Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, 
offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free reports into the Company.
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice:
•  Make sure you get the correct name of the person and organisation.
•   Check that they are properly authorised by the FCA (Financial Conduct 
Authority) before getting involved.  
You can check at www.fca.org.uk/consumers.
•  Report the matter to the FCA either by calling 0800 111 6768 or by 
completing an online form at:
  www .fca.org.uk/consumers/scams/investment-scams/share-fraud-and-
boiler-room-scams/reporting-form.
If you deal with an unauthorised firm, you would not be eligible to receive 
payment under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. Also keep in 
mind that some fraudsters use the name of genuine firms or individuals on 
the FCA Register to suggest that they are legitimate. However, authorised 
firms are unlikely to contact you out of the blue offering to buy or sell shares.

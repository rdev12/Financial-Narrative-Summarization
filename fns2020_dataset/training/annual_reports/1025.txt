Travel
Anite supplies systems to help leisure travel 
companies run their businesses profitably. 
Continuing market consolidation results in 
fewer companies managing ever larger 
volumes of travellers. Our technology enables 
them to achieve this while managing costs, 
offering an increasing range of products, and 
improving productivity and customer service.
Network Testing 
Anite helps network operators and  
base-station manufacturers manage  
their businesses efficiently. We supply a 
range of tools to enable them to collect  
and analyse data on coverage and 
performance; and to check that networks 
are strong enough to minimise “dropped” 
calls, and that phones will work on  
different operators’ networks.
Handset Testing
Anite helps chipset and handset 
manufacturers design efficient mobile 
phones, and bring them to market quickly 
and cost-effectively. Our systems enable  
the manufacturers to ensure that their  
new products conform to industry 
standards, meet end-customers’ 
expectations and are able to communicate 
with other devices on all networks.

Anite had a good finish to the financial 
year in both its divisions. We believe that 
the success and leadership of our products 
in their respective markets will result in 
future profitable growth.
Overview
The highlights of the year were the launch of 
our new wireless 4G LTE (LTE) product range 
(Anite 9000) and the continuing development 
handset and chipset customers. This success 
is being underpinned by focusing on LTE as 
the global 4G wireless technology of choice.
Although still in its early development phase, 
LTE is beginning to be widely adopted. The 
smartphone revolution, and the pressure that 
is putting on operators’ networks, means LTE 
is a much more vital technology upgrade 
than was the transition from 2G to 3G.
of our successful @comRes travel reservation 
system. These products, the leaders in their 
respective markets, are the foundations for 
our future profitable growth.
The changes we made to our LTE product 
strategy have put us in a much stronger position 
to control the pace of the commercialisation 
of our offer. They have resulted in early 
success for our product with Tier 1 global

for the valuable contribution he made, both 
as a Board member and as Chairman of the 
Audit Committee.
People
On behalf of the Board, I thank all 
employees for their contribution, hard work 
and support during the year.
Group summary 
Although we had a difficult start to last year 
there were signs of recovery in the second 
half. During the year we continued to invest 
in our products and are now well positioned 
to move forward.
Trading in the opening part of this year has 
started well, in line with our expectations, 
and we look forward to making progress 
through the year.
Clay Brendish
Chairman
5 July 2010 
As a consequence of these factors, results  
for 2009/10 are generally lower than those  
for the previous year, although they still 
demonstrate the strength of our divisions: 
adjusted operating margins of 14% were 
reported by the Wireless division and 24% by 
the Travel division. Encouragingly, the Group 
closed the financial year well: performance in 
Q4 meant that full-year orders were up 6% 
on the previous year and the book-to-bill 
ratio was just over one times.
Adjusted profit before tax for the Group was 
£9.9m (2009: £18.1m) on revenues down 
13% at £78.8m (2009: £90.1m).
Adjusted basic earnings per share were 
down 45% to 2.4p (2009: 4.4p). We are, 
however, proposing to maintain the final 
dividend at 0.65p per share (2009: 0.65p), 
giving an unchanged total dividend of 0.95p 
(2009: 0.95p). The dividend will be paid on 
26 October to shareholders on the register 
at 17 September 2010.
Balance sheet and cash
The Group has a strong balance sheet, with 
net cash resources and significant undrawn 
bank facilities. Net cash as at 30 April 2010 was 
£29.8m (30 April 2009: net cash of £27 .3m).
As previously announced, the Board took 
action towards the end of the year to cap 
the currency swap liability that had built  
up since we acquired the Network Testing 
business in 2006. Full details are given in  
the Financial review. The important point  
is that the maximum liability is now certain, 
at £21.6m, with some potential for this to 
decrease if the euro weakens significantly 
against sterling over the next 18 months. 
The level of net cash, reported above, is 
before taking account of the liability on  
the Group’s currency swap.
At the end of a particularly testing year, 
Travel was stronger and better positioned  
as a result of the progress it made with  
@comRes, and with its key customers in the 
UK and Germany.
Strategy
Our strategy is to position Anite as a global 
leader in Wireless test solutions, and to take 
advantage of the future opportunities that 
will emerge from the development and 
roll-out of LTE technology.
The Board believes that Wireless is a 
long-term growth market, which has high 
barriers to entry and limited competition  
in those areas in which Anite operates.  
This makes it possible to achieve good margins 
and returns on the investments needed to 
maintain our technological leadership.
In Travel, our strategy is to optimise the 
business’s long-term value. To achieve this, 
we will continue to strengthen and improve 
its market position through the successful 
development of @comRes. 
Results
The backdrop against which Anite’s results 
were delivered in 2009/10 provided many 
challenges. In addition to the well-documented 
recessionary pressures around the world,  
our specific markets also faced a technology 
change, as customers reduced spending  
on legacy technologies in anticipation of their 
need to invest in the launch of the 4G market. 
In recognition of the pressures this placed on 
revenue and profitability, Anite’s Wireless 
division rightly pressed ahead with 
development plans to ensure that it is well 
placed for the beginning of the 4G cycle.  
The resulting record investment made in the 
year also had an impact on profitability. At the 
same time, the Travel division was faced with a 
reduction in the scale of its business as a result 
of the customer consolidation and losses that 
occurred in the previous financial year.

Review
 Chief Executive’s review  
Anite is well positioned
for growth in the LTE market
Christopher Humphrey
Chief Executive
In the Travel division, as indicated in last 
year’s report, Norwich Union’s decision not 
to renew its contract for us to manage some 
of its IT services, together with the loss of 
customers as a result of them being acquired 
or going into liquidation, meant that revenue 
and profit were lower than in the previous 
year. In recognition of this, we reduced the 
cost base to align with the lower revenue. 
Revenue and profit were further affected 
when, in December 2009, the Globespan 
group went into administration. Despite the 
impact of these events on the business, we 
continued to develop our relationship with 
Europe’s largest travel operator, TUI, and 
expect to realise the benefit of that 
relationship over the next few years.
Our markets
Anite is structured into two market-facing 
divisions: Wireless and Travel. The Wireless 
division consists of two businesses. Handset 
Testing provides specialist systems, hardware 
and software to enable chipset and mobile 
phone manufacturers to design new mobile 
phone and data card devices efficiently, 
to begin selling products for testing  
LTE – the technology for the next-
generation of mobile phones – and, 
during the second six months of the year 
that, combined with some recovery in 
customers’ budgets, resulted in improved 
second-half revenue for both Handset 
Testing and Network Testing.
Over the years we have worked in 
partnership with a number of hardware 
suppliers, most recently Agilent, for 2G 
technology. Three years ago, we decided 
to collaborate with Agilent on the LTE 
hardware platform they were developing. 
Following delays in its development, 
however, we decided to end this partnership 
and to provide our own hardware, which 
we had been developing to test and 
demonstrate our LTE software while the 
main hardware platform was being finalised. 
This proprietary Anite hardware solution has 
now been developed into a final production 
model. It is being sold to, and is being 
well received by, key handset and chipset 
customers throughout the world. 
I am happy to report to you that despite 
a very demanding year the business is in 
good shape. We have continued to invest 
in our new products and, as a result, are 
well positioned to supply our markets as 
they start to improve.
Overview
The restricted financial environment 
had a significant affect on our Wireless 
customers’ spending in the first half of 
last year, but in the second half, the slight 
easing of economic conditions, combined 
with the availability of early stage 4G (LTE) 
hardware systems towards the end of the 
year, resulted in performance beginning 
to improve.
We continued to invest in new products 
throughout the financial year. In the 
Travel division, we continued to develop 
our @comRes software, and in the 
Wireless division we continued to invest 
in developing new products for Handset 
Testing. Our change in LTE hardware 
strategy enabled the Handsets business   6     Anite_Annual report and accounts 2010
Review
Our automated solutions for development 
testing and conformance testing, which 
have a long lifespan and are easy to use, help 
manufacturers to reduce costs and show 
a clear return on investment, by enabling 
them to identify and resolve problems early 
in the development process. We are unique 
in allowing licences to be shared across R&D 
sites, and our common hardware platform 
enables solutions also to be used across 
departments. Our software reduces costs, 
and improves quality and time-to-market, 
by simulating true network conditions in the 
lab. In addition, because the large network

Handset Testing
New handsets and chipsets have to go 
through a series of compliance tests while 
they are being developed and before they 
can be launched onto the market. The 
Handset Testing business provides customers 
with the technology to test handsets’ 
viability by simulating the network and 
their conformance with industry standards, 
and their ability to interoperate with other 
devices across a wide range of networks.
and to bring them to the market quickly. 
Network Testing provides technology 
to enable Mobile Network Operators 
(MNOs), which build and operate mobile 
phone networks, to test the efficiency and 
effectiveness of their systems, and to carry 
out live testing with different makes of 
handsets to ensure a consistently high-
quality service for mobile phone users.

our range of testing products extends back 
to the first-generation digital technology 
(2G). New mobile devices do not operate 
on a single technology and, consequently, 
devices must be able to switch seamlessly 
between all available technologies to 
maintain a connection. The need for legacy 
and new-generation technology to be 
present in one phone makes it very difficult 
for new entrants to the market to be able  
to provide a comprehensive product range.
In the past two to three years, the use of 
mobile phones and wireless-connected 
devices, including smartphones, data 
market each year, and the constant changes 
in mobile phone technology which, in turn, 
are driven by the continued growth in 
subscribers. In the 37 years since Motorola 
invented the first portable cellular phone, 
mobile phones have progressed from being 
the proverbial brick with an aerial, which 
could simply make and receive calls, to 
today’s tiny multi-function devices, while 
the number of subscribers has grown to 
approximately 4.6 billion – more than 60% 
of the world’s population. 
There have been multiple phone 
technologies launched in that time and 
devices perform on their networks, a number 
of them specify that manufacturers must 
validate their devices on an Anite tester. 
At the start of the design process, customers 
expect us to be technically innovative and 
responsive to their needs; while a large 
proportion buys our standard products,  
for major customers we are also able to 
offer a degree of customisation.
The principal drivers of the business are the 
evolution of new phone technology, the 
number of new handset models, data cards 
and “dongles” which are brought onto the 
Conformance toolset

that they comply with 
industry standards 
and deliver the service

Review
the US and, during the year, we developed 
solutions for China’s own version of LTE, 
TD-LTE. This, we believe, will give us an 
advantage in the development of that 
testing market. Since the inception of LTE 
we have consistently led the conformance 
testing market and we currently lead the 
market in the development of conformance 
test cases. The conformance test market is 
driven by certification schemes administered 
by the standard setters (for example, GCF). 
The LTE certified scheme is expected to go 
live in early 2011 and around that time we 
expect the conformance testing market to 
begin to gather momentum. The industry 
has, so far, defined around 200 conformance 
tests for LTE, 100 of which we have already 
implemented and had validated by the 
standards setters – more than double  
that of our nearest competitor.
Network Testing
Our Network Testing business provides 
products for mobile network operators 
(MNOs) and network manufacturers to 
measure the coverage and quality of mobile 
phone networks. We provide a range of tools 
that can be used to check the performance 
of networks at different stages of their 
life cycles. Our tools can not only be used 
to measure the quality of radio frequency 
metrics, but also enable our customers  
to see how end users perceive the quality  
of the mobile phone networks using quality  
of service and end user metrics. 
During the year, we continued to increase 
sales coverage and now operate in more than 
90 countries, usually with local partners who 
also offer technical support to customers, 
and support all major network standards, 
including LTE. 
Our measurement tools are designed to meet 
the needs of all our end-customers, whatever 
their internal processes and however they 
choose to do their testing. They provide a 
a period of economic recession, has put 
pressure on the speed of the network roll-
out. Industry giants such as AT&T, China 
Mobile, Verizon and Vodafone are, however, 
now committed to being in the early wave 
of this investment and are requiring handset 
manufacturers – the majority of which are 
our customers – to prove the technology 
on their products; and that is where our 
handset testing solutions are increasingly 
used. Over the 12 months following the roll-
out of networks, 4G data devices (initially 
cards and dongles) will be sold, and will be 
followed by 4G phones and other devices. 
These data cards and phones all need similar 
amounts of testing.
Handset Testing strategy
We continue in our objective to position  
the Handset Testing business as a world 
leader in its field. To achieve that, we aim  
to complete our LTE solution, and to secure 
market penetration of all three testing 
phases – development, conformance and 
interoperability; to develop the range of 
products and tools we offer customers; 
and to increase sales to network 
operators, worldwide.
LTE is no exception to the rule that demand 
for more, and more powerful, applications 
drives advances in technology hardware;  
LTE is a complex standard and is particularly 
challenging. This is, of course, of benefit to 
us – new technology demands new handsets 
which need to be tested – but the evolution 
of the smartphone and other mobile devices 
is exerting severe pressure on the capacity  
of the world’s major mobile phone 
networks. There is, therefore, a compelling 
need for this technology. This is in direct 
contrast to 3G technology where no such 
powerful catalyst existed.
The lead of the US and China in LTE 
technology will also be of benefit to us 
since some of our biggest customers are in 
dongles, netbook and tablet computers – 
such as Apple’s iPad – has accelerated.  
The applications on these devices are data-
intensive, but the licensed spectra (network 
capacity) are fixed. These factors, combined 
with network operators’ desire to reduce 
costs – because traffic is increasing faster 
than revenue – has driven the need for a 
new, more efficient technology. 
LTE – which we have supported since its 
inception – is now accepted as being the 
most effective 4G technology to deliver 
the data capacity that is needed. It uses 
the spectrum extremely efficiently: more 
network users can be accommodated 
on the same cell space and it “pushes” 
data through the spectrum more quickly 
in efficient packets. Where 3G made it 
technically possible to access data, 4G  
will make it practically possible.
I wrote about the advent of 4G, essentially 
mobile broadband, in last year’s report. This 
has taken time to develop and, in today’s 
global market, the US and China have been 
particularly ambitious in its adoption. 
Within 4G there are two competing 
technologies, WiMAX and LTE. In 2007, we 
instigated our internal development process 
for LTE but, at the same time, recognised the 
need for us to be able to offer solutions for 
both technologies. With our own resources 
focused fully on LTE, we believed it was 
more appropriate to acquire a WiMAX 
capability, which we did in January 2007, to 
improve our offer in that area. As it became 
clearer, however, that LTE would be the 
winning standard, in April 2010 we decided 
to stop offering WiMAX and to close that 
part of our business.

interaction of neighbouring cells and the 
efficiency with which devices “hand-off” from 
one cell to another as the device moves in a

of the day and night, and in all weather 
conditions. Nemo Autonomous can be installed 
in taxis or buses to provide a cost-effective, 
unmanned continuous stream of information. 
We carry out quarterly product upgrades and 
introduce new products when we see a need. 
During the year we launched the Nemo Multi 
Handy and also the Nemo Handy-W device, 
which uses the Windows Mobile operating 
system whereas previous devices had been 
based around Nokia’s proprietary operating 
systems. These new devices add to Network 
Testing’s range and testing capabilities.
The software embedded in our products 
enables organisations to manage and 
analyse vast amounts of data, quickly and 
efficiently, either on our Nemo Analyze 
post-processing analyser, or on third-party 
post-processing analysis tools.
As the world’s mobile network coverage 
increases, with roll-out occurring in most 
developed and developing countries, we 
will continue to expand geographical sales 
coverage and to help MNOs establish, and 
then upgrade, their networks.
Network Testing strategy
Our objective is to continue to be the first 
to offer new technology, to provide excellent 
after-sales service and technical support, and to 
maintain strong relationships with customers, 
either direct or through local partners.
There is potential for considerable growth  
in many of the countries in which we 
operate. For example, India – which has a 
population of nearly 1.2 billion – has recently 
concluded the auction of its 3G licences  
and is an increasingly important market.
We are developing our LTE product but, 
since testing can begin only when the 
networks are in place, we do not expect any 
significant benefit to accrue from that until 
2012/2013. Our strategy is to continue to 
benefit from the roll-out of new networks 
by the MNOs and to leverage the LTE 
technology roll-out as it occurs.

The Travel business is the UK’s market-
leading supplier of software to help leisure 
travel companies run their businesses 
efficiently. The technology offers customers 
the ability to sell an increasingly diverse 
set of holiday products through a range 
of sales channels (including call centres, 
travel agents, and the web), to price by 
currency and market, to manage their 
inventory dynamically, to connect with 
other industry providers effectively and to 
improve productivity and customer service. 
In addition, we offer managed services  
on a hosted or remotely-managed basis. 
These products have a long life-cycle:  
many existing users of our legacy ATOP 
product have been with us for more than  
15 years.
In recent years, major leisure travel 
companies have become even larger as 
they have acquired smaller operators. 
Paradoxically, their IT systems – which have 
the potential to transform profitability by 
offering economies in buying and selling, 
and by centralising back-office, as well as 
some sales functions – have tended to lag 
behind. In addition, there has been added 
competition to traditional tour operators 
from internet travel companies, such as 
Expedia and lastminute.com.

run their businesses 
more profitably. 
Our technology

diverse set of holiday 
products through a 
range of channels – 
including call centres,

What products and 
services do you offer?
@comRes provides 
multi-channel 
distribution for leisure 
travel companies. It 
offers the key functions 
of reservations, 
content and customer 
relationship 
management, and 
operational finance.
@com eBusiness Suite  
is an integrated set of 
business applications, 
built around the core 
functions of @comRes. 
Think of it as a Travel-
ERP solution which 
includes supplier 
contracting, dynamic 
supplier connectivity, 
sales, inventory 
management, 
customer 
markets and holiday types, and to be 
confident that the system will scale up in  
such a way as to cope with an increasing 
work load as the business continues  
to grow.
As a stand-alone system, @comRes offers 
the four key functions, of reservations, 
content and customer relationship 
management, and operational finance.  
It is also the core around which our @com 
eBusiness Suite is built; this is a single 
integrated solution, which customers  
can buy and implement in modules.
In an economic environment where price 
and capacity are key to success, our flexible 
software enables leisure travel companies 
to reduce costs while, at the same time 
managing a wider range of products. 
Although demand for the traditional 
package holiday remains strong, the ability 
to manage flexible and dynamic packages 
from the same IT platform is a major 
competitive advantage.
Travel strategy
In the drive to become the dominant 
software supplier to the European 
leisure travel market, we will continue to 
capitalise on our existing strong customer 
relationships – in the past year we have 
begun to work with TUI UK – and to invest 
in @comRes’s ability to handle fixed and 
flexible packaging, and specialist operations, 
from a single system.
We will also continue with the process of 
creating UK and central European versions 
of @com to make it more accessible to 
mainstream travel companies. We will create 
long-term plans for customers currently 
using our legacy systems to migrate to  
@comRes. In addition, we will seek new mid-
sized customers and partners throughout 
Europe and North America, and investigate 
opportunities in emerging economies.
We are in the process of changing our 
revenue model to one in which we license 
our system to customers on an annual basis. 
While this is likely to be a long-term project, 
it will have benefits on both sides: it will 
reduce the initial capital cost for customers 
and will augment our recurring revenue.
While the recession is likely to accelerate 
consolidation by increasing pressure on 
smaller travel operators, we are confident 
that the scalability inherent in our  
@comRes software and @com eBusiness 
Suite, combined with our reputation for 
implementing software that works, places 
us in an ideal position to grow steadily in 
the UK and overseas.
The current year will continue to be 
challenging for the Travel business, 
particularly in the first half. The progress  
our @com product is making with 
established and new customers is, however, 
an indication of our present unique  
market position. Implementation for larger 
customers can take several years but,  
once completed, will benefit them for many 
years to come. We intend to show that we 
have re-established the trading position  
of this business and that it is set for  
further growth. Anite_Annual report and accounts 2010     11

Outlook
The past financial year was a challenging 
one for the Group, but we saw an 
improvement in the second half with both 
the Wireless and Travel businesses making 
good progress. Our new LTE product has 
been well received by customers.
Predictions as to the growth of the LTE 
market are difficult to make at this early 
stage, but the signs are positive and we are 
better positioned to take advantage of LTE 
than we were with 3G.

Oy Aurinkomatkat-Suntours Ltd is  
Finland’s largest tour operator. Part of 
Finnair, one of the world’s oldest operating 
airlines, each year Aurinkomatkat flies 
around 40% (350,000) of Finnish holiday 
travellers to 900 hotels, at 150 destinations, 
in 40 countries.
Before choosing Anite and @com, 
Aurinkomatkat had searched for five 
years to find a suitable replacement for 
its 25-year-old tour operating system. It 
quickly saw the value of going beyond the 
core @com reservation system and has 
now integrated our entire @com eBusiness 
Suite. This enables it to manage its principal 
business functions – reservations, content 
management, customer relationship 
management and operational finance –  
on a single system and to achieve: 
 
> profitability – through a significantly 
lower-cost IT platform which incorporates  
a complete set of integrated applications;
> flexibility – the @com eBusiness Suite 
enables Aurinkomatkat to combine the 
attributes of traditional, flexible and dynamic 
business processes;
> security – a robust technology platform that 
takes IT performance off management’ s agenda;
> scalability – proven high-volume linear 
scalability while retaining consistent 
response times.
“The @com eBusiness Suite goes a long way 
beyond the boundaries of the traditional 
‘reservation system’ to help Aurinkomatkat 
remain at the forefront of Finland’s holiday 
industry.”

Management, Aurinkomatkat
We expect the continuing investments in 
our products to start to pay back during 
this year. The effect of this and normal 
seasonality factors mean we expect trading 
to be biased to the second half, although 
not as markedly as in 2009/10. Anite began 
the year in good shape: we are trading well 
and in line with our expectations.

At this early stage in the LTE market, it is 
important for us to be able to bring our 
software swiftly to market to help our 
customers with the technically complex task 
of turning the new technology into viable 
products. R&D investment, which increased 
to £11.1m, up 28% on the previous year 
(2009: £8.7m), was a further significant 
factor in reducing profit. It included 
investment in TD-LTE, the variant that will 
be adopted in the market in China.
Following the increasing market acceptance 
of LTE as the industry standard for 4G, the 
Board reviewed the potential of WiMAX 
technology as the alternative competing 
standard and concluded that it will be 
a minor part of the market. It decided, 
therefore, to close Anite’s business in this 
area and, as a result, a £7.1m exceptional 
cost – comprising £6.7m non-cash 
impairment and a £0.4m exceptional 
closure cost provision – has been made in 
the accounts for the year ended 30 April 
2010. The WiMAX business made a loss of 
£0.1m on revenue of £1.1m during the year.
Network Testing 
For the full year, adjusted results for the 
Network Testing business show that orders 
were steady at £21.1m (2009: £21.2m) while 
revenue declined by 6% to £20.0m (2009: 
£21.3m). Net revenue (revenue less cost  
of third-party hardware/software) fell 2% 
to 71% (2009: 73%), reflecting the tougher 
market conditions, and adjusted operating 
profit fell by 35% to £4.5m (2009 £6.9m). 
The network testing market suffered in 
the early part of the year as a result of the 
market downturn. This caused customers 
to reduce their budgets, and resulted in 
revenue and profit in the first half of the 
year falling below those of the previous year. 
There were signs of improvement in the 
second half of the year as customers began to 
release budgets, and the number and size of 
sales opportunities improved. Significant sales 
were made to a number of Tier 1 customers, 
By the year end we had sold initial LTE 
systems to a number of leading Tier 1 
customers worldwide. As a result, trading  
in the second half of the year improved,  
with orders and revenue ahead of the  
same period in the previous year. LTE 
accounted for around 12% of Handset 
Testing’s revenue for the year as a whole, 
and 21% of its Q4 revenue.
The impact of weaker sterling, compared 
with the previous year, and its effect on 
translating overseas subsidiaries’ revenue 
on a constant-currency basis, resulted 
in a revenue benefit of £0.5m, with an 
immaterial impact on profit. The effect, 
however, of transactional currency 
movements – transacting for sales in 
currencies different from our base currency 
– and year-end currency balances, resulted 
in an overall exchange loss of £0.5m (2009: 
£1.6m gain) – a £2.1m negative impact on 
profits year-on-year. 
While revenue in Europe increased by 21% 
to £11.1m, revenue elsewhere declined: in 
the Americas by 6%, to £16.1m, and in Asia 
by 25%, to £8.6m, again as a reflection of 
challenging market conditions. Net revenue 
margin (revenue less third-party hardware 
cost) held up well and improved to 82%  
of revenue (2009: 80%). This is because  
the phase of the 2G/3G cycle that we are  
in has a greater proportion of software.  
We expect this trend to reverse in the 
current year as LTE sales increase; as is 
typical in the development testing market, 
they will include a greater proportion  
of hardware. 
At the end of the year, as a result of the 
actions we had taken to reduce costs to 
align with the lower level of business, 
headcount had reduced to 173 (2009: 189). 
During the year, however, we strengthened 
the management team when we appointed 
a new Global Sales Director, and a Customer 
Services and Fulfilment Director to manage 
the production of the Anite 9000.
the overall results for the group are a 
reflection of a number of factors: the 
challenging market conditions we faced 
during the year; continuing investment, 
particularly in our 4g lte product range; 
and the reduction in the underlying base  
of our travel division. In the final quarter  
of the year, there were encouraging signs  
of an improvement in orders and profits,  
and the closing order book showed a  
year-on-year increase.
Anite’s operations comprise two divisions, 
Wireless and Travel. The Wireless division 
is made up of two separately-managed 
businesses, Handset Testing and Network 
Testing. 
Wireless performance
Handset Testing
The adjusted results for the Handset Testing 
business for the year show that orders were 
maintained at £32.2m (2009: £32.5m), 
revenue decreased by 5% to £35.8m (2009: 
£37.7m), and adjusted operating profit fell 
by 51% to £3.5m (2009: £7.1m). 
In the first half of the year economic 
conditions caused a decline in demand for 
older technology. This, combined with the 
planned increase in development spending 
on 4G, resulted in a fall in revenue and 
profit compared with the first half of the 
previous year.
At the half year, we announced the 
termination of our contract with Agilent 
for the supply of an LTE hardware platform 
and, following this change in strategy, 
commercialised our own hardware platform 
– the Anite 9000 Mobile Test Accelerator. 
Even at this early stage in the market, this 
has been well received by our customers.

including Nokia Siemens Networks,

market continues, however, to be extremely 
competitive and order book visibility is 
generally very short.
The effect of currency movements in 
translating the overseas subsidiaries’ results 
back to sterling was a translation benefit 
of £1.0m on revenue and £0.2m on profits. 
The impact of transactional currency 
movements from the dollar/euro as a result 
of the division’s trade in America and the 
Far East, resulted in a £0. 1m exchange loss 
(2009: £0.5m gain) giving an adverse £0.6m 
transactional impact on profits year-on-year. 
While Network Testing’s revenue in EMEA 
increased by 15%, to £9.2m, and in the 
Americas by 8%, to £2.8m, in Asia it 
declined by 25%, to £8.0m.
Investment in R&D was maintained at £2. 1m 
(2009: £2.1m) as we continued to improve 
our products. In the period, we launched 
significant upgrades to our existing Nemo 
Outdoor and Analyze platforms, developed 
two new products – Multi-Handy and the 
Handy-W (a Windows Mobile-based product) 
– and new versions for LTE measurement. 
Strict cost control was maintained during 
the year, although a £0.7m provision against 
outstanding receivables, contracted on 
extended credit terms, had an impact on 
the business. As a result of the business 
strengthening its sales and marketing 
department, headcount increased to 83 
(2009: 80) by the end of the year. 
Travel
Full-year adjusted results for the division 
show that orders increased by 21% to 
£29.0m (2009: £23.9m), but revenue fell by 
26% to £23.0m (2009: £31.1m). Adjusted 
operating profit was 41% lower, at £5.6m 
(2009: £9.5m).
Travel’s order intake tends to be focused 
on a few significant long-term orders and 
In the year, £10.8m (47%) of revenue came 
from the @comRes product compared with 
£8.1m (26%) in the previous year, and 98% 
(2009: 98%) of total revenue from Europe. 
Passenger bookings on @comRes systems 
are now running at more than four million  
a year, demonstrating the scalability of 
the product. Licence revenue for the year 
was £2.7m (2009: £1.5m); the increase  
is a reflection of the increased value of  
the @comRes product as it develops and 
matures. £2.0m of the licence revenue was 
generated in the second half of the year.
The fall in the division’s revenue 
necessitated significant cost reductions 
to ensure that the cost base matched the 
revenue potential. Headcount at the end 
of the year had been reduced to 176 (2009: 
194), principally as a result of the decline in 
the managed services business. In addition, 
Globespan going into administration at the 
beginning of December 2009 had a negative 
impact on the division of £0.4m. 
These actions meant that operating margins 
fell from 31% in 2009 to 24% in 2010; if, 
however, the impact of the exceptional 
MyTravel settlement were excluded from 
last year’s results, 2009’s operating margins 
would be a more meaningful 25%. The 
underlying fall was, therefore, much smaller.
Other Group costs
The divisional performances, above, are 
stated before unallocated corporate 
costs, which include an element of head 
office staff costs, Directors’ remuneration, 
professional fees and office costs, and other 
non-operational costs. During the period, 
unallocated Group costs reduced to £1.7m 
(2009: £3.5m). Corporate costs were cut 
following the sale of the Public Sector 
business and the consequential reduction 
in the size and complexity of the Group. 
Savings included reduced central headcount, 
lower net operational property costs, £0.1m 
(2009: £0.8m), reduced professional fees 
and lower annual bonuses.
is characterised by a lengthy sales cycle. 
The improved order intake in the year is a 
reflection of the increase in business coming 
from the @comRes product: good progress 
was made with key UK and international 
customers, including with Europe’s largest 
tour operator, TUI Group. By using  
@comRes, TUI is able to sell traditional 
package holidays more efficiently and cost 
effectively on a single system, through its 
multiple operations in Germany, Austria, 
Poland and Switzerland, and to eliminate 
unnecessary administrative costs. In the 
second half of the year we took an initial 
order from TUI UK for @comRes, evidence 
of the strengthening of our relationship with 
the TUI Group.
During the year, Aurinkomatkat-Suntours,  
a subsidiary of the airline Finnair, completed 
the implementation of Anite’s @com 
eBusiness Suite; a contract for @comRes 
was signed with REWE, Germany’s second-
largest tour operator; a number of legacy 
ATOP software customers were migrated 
to @comRes; and progress was made with 
turning @comRes into a standard product,  
a process which is expected to be completed 
during the current year.
As expected, the one-off customer events 
reported in last year’s annual report had 
an effect on this year’s results. These were 
the loss of the Norwich Union contract, a 
non-travel managed service customer; the 
one-off settlement of £2.3m received after 
MyTravel’s acquisition by Thomas Cook; and 
other customer consolidation, including 
the administration of the XL Group, that 
occurred in the previous financial year. The 
lost revenue and effect on profit from these was 
approximately £10.0m and £5.2m respectively. 
Translational currency effects in Travel  
are negligible as results from overseas 
subsidiaries are immaterial. The 
transactional effect of euro-denominated 
business and assets improved profits by 
£0.1m (2009: £0.2m) a net adverse effect  
of £0.1m year-on-year.

specific divisional measures such as 
cash generation, working capital, capital 
expenditure, product development and 
major project performances are used.
The Group changes and refines the KPIs 
regularly depending on the major issues 
that are identified in the businesses.
Adjusted operating profit
-40%
Adjusted operating profit measures the 
operating performance of the business 
before taking into account share-based 
payments, impairment and amortisation 
of acquired intangible assets, impairment 
of goodwill, restructuring costs, other 
gains and losses and recycled hedge losses. 
Management believes this gives a better 
comparable measure of the true operating 
performance of continuing operations.
The reduction in adjusted operating profit 
primarily arises from the lower revenue 
in demanding trading conditions and the 
rebasing of our Travel business, together 
with the increased R&D investment made  
in new Wireless products.
Revenue
-13%
Revenue represents the amounts derived 
from the provision of goods and services  
in the year.
The decline in revenue reflects the 
challenging economic conditions in the 
year and the rebasing of our Travel business 
following the loss of a large non-travel 
managed service customer in the previous 
year, and general consolidation in that 
market. Further details are given in the 
Review of operations.
Headcount
-8%
Headcount measures the number of staff 
employed directly by the Group at the end of 
each year and is an important measure to ensure 
the business is not overstaffed in relation to 
its revenue. The Group maintains a regular 
review of headcount in each business in order 
to keep costs under control.
Headcount was reduced across the Group 
to contain costs in a challenging economic 
environment – there were reductions of  
13 in the Wireless division, 18 in Travel and  
9 in the centre.
Order intake
+6%
Order intake represents the value of orders 
received from customers in the year. It 
is a measure of in-year performance and 
supports future years’ revenue performance.
The order intake in the year increased 
mainly as a result of a 21% increase in our 
Travel business order intake for multi-year 
orders from TUI and Center Parcs.
Research and development total spend
+29%
Research and development (R&D) spend 
represents the total cash invested in R&D in 
the year, before the effect of capitalisation 
and amortisation under IAS 38, and shows 
the total amounts the Group invests each 
year on new, and on enhancing its existing, 
software products.
The increase in R&D occurred in our Handset 
Testing business where, as anticipated, we 
increased our investment in the development 
of new leading-edge technology to meet our 
customers’ requirements for new 4G L TE systems.

The reconciling items are those that, in the 
opinion of the Board, are either one-off 
in nature or are non-cash related and are 
not, therefore, indicative of the Group’s 
underlying trading.
Currency effects
Movement in exchange rates in the year 
had an overall adverse effect on the results, 
compared with the significant positive 
effect in the previous year. Year-on-year, 
the average exchange rate for the US dollar 
strengthened 5% against sterling, from  
£1 = US$1.68 to £1 = US$1.60, and the 
average rate of the euro strengthened 
by 5%, from £1 = €1.19 to £1 = €1.13. The 
effect of these changes on the translation 
of results from overseas subsidiaries was 
to improve revenue by £1.5m and adjusted 
operating profit by £0.2m. 
The closing exchange rates at the year end, 
which affect the conversion of foreign-
exchange denominated balance sheet items 
– such as cash, and trade debtors and creditors 
These include fuller disclosure of operating 
segments, on adoption of IFRS 8, based on 
the way management operates the business. 
This has resulted in the separate disclosure 
of the Handset Testing and Network Testing 
businesses’ results in note 2.2. We have also 
adopted the amendment to IAS 1, which 
requires a statement of comprehensive 
income to be reported separately from  
the income statement and statement  
of changes in equity. We have assessed 
other amendments to standards as being 
not applicable.
Financial results
Revenue from continuing operations was 
down 13% at £78.8m (2009: £90.1m) and 
adjusted profit before tax fell 45% to £9.9m 
(2009: £18.1m).
Reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA of 
£17.7m (2009: £25.8m), to the operating 
loss of £1.8m (2009: profit £9.4m), and 
adjusted operating profit of £11.9m (2009: 
£20.0m), to the reported loss before tax  
for the year of £4.0m (2009: profit 
the group’s results for the year ended  
30 April 2010 were characterised by solid 
performances from our two divisions, in a 
year of investment in which the economic 
environment was generally unhelpful.
The following analysis is for our continuing 
operations, which comprise the Handset 
Testing and Network Testing businesses in 
our Wireless division, and the Travel division. 
There were no acquisitions or disposals 
during the year although in the previous 
year we disposed of the Public Sector 
business. The results for Public Sector for the 
prior year are included in the comparative 
numbers as discontinued operations in the 
income statement for that year; further 
details are in note 5 to the accounts.
Principal accounting policies, 
assumptions, and key judgements
The principal accounting policies are 
unchanged. While there was no impact 
of changes in accounting standards on 
the results themselves, new requirements 
have had an impact on certain disclosures.  Anite_Annual report and accounts 2010     17

the closing exchange rate for the US dollar  
was £1 = US$1.526 (2009: £1 = US$1.472),  
a depreciation of 4% on the previous year.
The transactional effect of business units 
trading in currencies other than their local 
currency, and the revaluation of foreign 
currency balance sheet accounts into local 
currency, also has an effect on the Group. 
Where possible, these exposures are hedged, 
or minimised, by converting foreign currency 
balances back into local functional currencies. 
In the year, these transactions had an 
approximate net £0.5m adverse effect, 
compared with a net £2.1m positive effect  
in the previous year, resulting in £2.6m 
overall adverse impact on operating  
profit. The relative currency impact on 
divisional results is discussed in the Review 
of operations.
Revenue
Revenue from continuing operations 
decreased in the year by 13%, to £78.8m 
(2009: £90.1m), details of which are set out 
in the Review of operations. Geographically, 
revenues by destination were: UK 19% 
(2009: 28%); Europe 35% (2009: 25%); 
North America 24% (2009: 22%); and 
Asia 22% (2009: 25%). The shift from UK 
to Europe is mainly due to the increased 
proportion of business conducted by the 
Travel business in Germany in the year.
In revenue by type, the principal changes  
in the year are a result of the reduction of 
£4.8m in managed services, in the Travel 
division; the £2.3m settlement in 2009 of 
the MyTravel contract, also in the Travel 
division; and a reduction of £2.8m in 
third-party hardware and software costs, 
which occurred both in Travel (£1.2m), 
where there was a reduction in the sale of 
third-party hardware aligned with the lower 
managed services business, and in Handset 
Testing (£1.6m), resulting from the 
reduction in sales of hardware as a result  
of the specific heavily software-dependent 
phase of the technology cycle that the 
business is currently addressing.
Within the reduction in overall revenue, 
revenue from software and related services, 
at £60.0m (2009: £61.4m), was only 
marginally down on the previous year. 
Recurring revenues (software maintenance 
and managed services) were 34% of the 
total revenue compared with 35% in 2009.
Gross profit
Gross profit in the year fell to £49.1m 
(2009: £55.3m), slightly less than the 
corresponding reduction in revenue, with 
gross margin improving marginally to 62% 
(2009: 61%). This is partly a reflection of the 
change in product mix, referred to above, 
with a lower proportion of low-margin 
revenue associated with the sale of third-
party products, such as hardware. 18     Anite_Annual report and accounts 2010
Review
 Financial review  continued  
One-off and non-trading expenses excluded 
from adjusted profit calculations totalled 
£13.7m (2009: £10.6m). These included 
charges for share-based payments of 
£2.4m (2009: £1.8m), amortisation of 
acquired intangible assets of £4.2m (2009: 
£4.0m), and costs of £7.1m associated with 
the closure of Handset Testing’s WiMAX 
operation in April 2010. These costs included 
£5.1m impairment of goodwill, £1.1m 
impairment of acquired intangible assets, 
and a £0.9m exceptional restructuring 
cost. Only £0.4m of this last element had 
a cash impact. Further details on this and 
the £4.8m of restructuring costs in the 
comparative period are included in note 3  
to the accounts.
After these non-operational costs, the 
Group reported an overall operating loss of 
£1.8m (2009: operating profit of £9.4m).
Other gains and losses
A gain of £0.4m made in the year (2009: 
loss £1.1m) represents the net gain arising 
from revaluing to market prices those 
elements of the interest rate and cross-
currency swaps that are deemed to be 
ineffective as hedges to market prices, 
together with the change in the fair value  
of derivative assets and liabilities outstanding 
at the year end. Further details are given in 
notes 4 and 23. Other gains and losses are 
excluded from the calculation of adjusted 
profit before tax.
Group finance costs
The Group had an excess of £29.8m of  
cash over borrowings at 30 April 2010  
(30 April 2009: £27.3m), but incurred 
a net finance charge of £2.6m (2009: 
£1.9m). This was principally because the 
borrowings within the capital structure 
Operating expenses
Operating expenses in the period increased 
to £50.9m (2009: £45.9m). A detailed 
breakdown is given in note 2.5. 
Of total expenses, underlying operating 
expenses were £37.2m (2009: £35.3m), 
with one-off and non-cash items totalling 
£13.7m (2009: £10.6m).
The principal driver for the increase in 
underlying operating expenses was costs 
incurred in research and development 
(R&D), which amounted to £13.2m 
compared with £10.8m in the previous year. 
This expenditure was all incurred in the two 
Wireless businesses. In Handset Testing, 
investment in R&D went up from £8.7m  
in 2009, to £11.1m in 2010, largely as  
a result of developing our suite of LTE 
products, including specific expenditure  
on TD-LTE, the Chinese variant of LTE;  
new Interoperability Testing products for 
network operators; and evolution of the 
Anite 9000 platform. During the year we 
expensed £2.6m of the £4m of incremental 
LTE R&D investment that we had identified 
in the previous year. Of the balance, we 
expect to incur £0.8m in the current 
financial year. R&D costs in the year under 
review included amortisation of previously 
capitalised costs of £1.9m (2009: £1.9m).  
A further £1.3m of R&D expenditure (2009: 
£1.1m) was capitalised during the year and 
appears in the balance sheet under other 
intangible assets.
After the underlying operating expenses, 
adjusted operating profit was £11.9m  
(2009: £20.0m), a reduction of 40%. 
Adjusted EBITDA was down 31% at £17.7m 
(2009: £25.8m).
were fixed at the relatively high long-term 
rates available when the facilities were put 
in place in 2006, but surplus cash earns 
interest only at current low rates. This 
position will normalise in November 2011 
when the current facilities and interest 
arrangements expire. The net finance charge 
includes £0.6m (2009: £nil) in respect of 
the recycling of a fair-value loss on a cash 
flow hedge, previously included directly 
in equity and now reclassified through the 
profit and loss back into equity (see note 6). 
This charge is excluded from adjusted profit 
before tax calculations.
Taxation
The tax charge for the year on continuing 
operations was £0.4m (2009: £1.4m).  
The tax rate on the statutory operating 
loss was a negative 10.9% (2009: 22.7%), 
primarily as a result of adjustments to the 
provisions made for deferred tax in previous 
years. The underlying adjusted tax rate on 
adjusted profit before tax is 27% (2009: 
27%). Tax paid in the year was £1.7m  
(2009: £3.4m). 
Shareholder returns
After taking account of the factors described 
above, adjusted basic earnings per share 
were 2.4p (2009: 4.4p), a reduction of 45%; 
adjusted diluted earnings per share were 
similarly down 45% to 2.3p (2009: 4.2p). 
The overall loss per share was 1.5p (2009: 
earnings per share for continuing operations 
of 1.5p).
The Board has proposed a final dividend 
of 0.65p per share (2009: 0.65p) making 
a total for the year of 0.95p (2009: 0.95p) 
which is covered 2.5 times by adjusted  
basic earnings.

Balance sheet: goodwill and other 
intangible assets
At 30 April 2010, goodwill was £57.3m 
(2009: £64.4m). In addition to a £2.0m 
reduction as a result of movements in 
foreign exchange rates, the carrying 
value of goodwill underwent an annual 
impairment testing, using the assumptions 
described in note 12. During the year the 
WiMAX business was closed and, as a 
result, the Board fully impaired the £5.1m 
of previously-valued goodwill related 
to WiMAX. In addition, an amount of 
£1.1m held for WiMAX-related acquired 
intangible assets (note 10) was also fully 
impaired, which together with the normal 
amortisation of acquired intangible assets 
of £4.2m (2009: £4.0m) were the major 
factors in the decline in the value of other 
intangible assets, from £26.6m to £19.2m.
Cash flow
Net cash flow generated from operating 
activities was £11.0m (2009: £23.9m). 
This represented a conversion of 111% of 
adjusted profit before tax (2009: 132%). 
Within this, working capital was adversely 
affected by a £2.2m increase in inventories, 
mainly as a result of the initial provisioning 
of stocks and components for the new 
Anite 9000 LTE system for Handset Testing, 
first production batches of which were 
manufactured and sold in the final quarter 
of the year. The increase in inventories was 
partially offset by a net £0.6m release of 
other working capital in the period.
Capital expenditure in the period was 
£2.5m (2009: £3.7m). Significant purchases 
included £1.1m on our Testbed/Anite 
9000 development equipment. £1.3m 
was incurred on capitalised development 
expenditure (2009: £1.1m), which 
represented the cost of writing conformance 
test cases for Handset Testing’s LTE product.
As explained in the commentary, below, 
on derivative financial liabilities, the Group 
incurred a £1.0m cash outflow in the year  
as part of the capping of its swap position.
After these movements, and cash paid 
out to shareholders through dividends of 
£2.8m (2009: £12.9m including £9.9m 
special dividend), net cash increased by 
£2.5m (2009: net cash increase of £42.7m 
including net proceeds from the disposal 
of the Public Sector business). The net cash 
balance at 30 April 2010 was, as a result, 
£29.8m (30 April 2009: £27.3m).
Derivative financial liabilities
When Anite purchased Nemo (Network 
Testing) in November 2006, it entered into 
cross-currency swaps designed to hedge 
against movements in foreign exchange 
rates, and to protect the value of both the 
investment and the reserves of the Group. 
As a result of significant movements in 
interest rates and £/€ exchange rates 
since that date, the sterling value of the 
underlying euro-denominated assets had 
increased, but had been matched by a 
rise in the value of the derivative financial 
liabilities. The hedges are due to expire on  
31 October 2011.
During the second half of the year the  
Board decided to close out the position  
on the swap in order to provide certainty 
of the size of the liability when the swap 
expires. During the year, the Group entered 
into a series of forward contracts to fix the 
amount payable on 31 October 2011 at a 
maximum cash cost of £21.6m (note 23).  
At the same time, the Group purchased a 
series of options at a total cost of £1.0m, 
paid during the year, to provide some 
potential reduction in the maximum 
amount payable should the euro decline 
significantly against sterling over the same 
period. The maximum liability of £21.6m 
compares with the net cash balance at 
30 April 2010 of £29.8m.
The total liability on all derivative financial 
instruments at 30 April 2010, including the 
cross-currency swap, was £23.6m (2009: 
£24.5m). All derivative financial instruments 
will mature by 31 October 2011.
Borrowings and facilities
The outstanding balance on the Group’s 
term loan facility at 30 April 2010 was 
£15.0m (2009: £20.0m). This is covered by 
£44.8m of cash at 30 April 2010 (30 April 
2009: £47.3m). The facility expires on  
30 November 2011.
The Group also has further borrowing 
facilities available, including a syndicated 
revolving facility of £20.0m (2009: £20.0m) 
and a net overdraft facility of £5.0m  
(2009: £5.0m). Both were undrawn at  
30 April 2010.
In view of the current strong cash position, 
the availability of banking facilities, the 
maturity profile of debt obligations and 
forecast cash position over the next 18 
months, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, Anite continues to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing the 
consolidated financial statements.

Management and governance
The Directors present their report on the affairs of the Group, together with the audited financial statements, for the year ended 30 April 2010.
Principal activities
The Group is a leading worldwide provider of IT solutions, software, systems integration and managed services within its core markets of 
Wireless and Travel. Analyses of turnover, profit on ordinary activities and net assets are given in note 2 on pages 51 to 54.
Business review and future developments
The Company is required by the Companies Act to include a business review in this report. The information that fulfils the requirements 
of the business review can be found in the review of the year’s operations, key risks, trading outlook and future developments that are 
contained in the Chairman’s statement on page 3, the Chief Executive’s review on page 5, the review of operations on page 13, the financial 
review on page 16 and the corporate governance report on page 25 of this report.
Where the Annual Report contains forward-looking statements, these are made by the Directors in good faith based on the information 
available to them at the time of their approval of this report. Consequently, such statements should be treated with caution due to the 
inherent uncertainties, including both economic and business risk factors, underlying such forward-looking statements or information.
Results
The audited accounts of the Group for the year ended 30 April 2010 are set out on pages 40 to 93. The Group loss for the year after taxation 
was £3.4m (2009: profit after taxation of £36.3m).
Dividends
The Directors recommend a final dividend of 0.65p (2009: 0.65p) per ordinary share which, if approved by shareholders at the 2010 AGM,

Corporate social responsibility
Environmental policy The Company supports the protection of a sustainable environment. The Group’s activities do not produce 
harmful waste or emissions and the Group is a constituent of the FTSE4Good index of ethically sustainable companies. While our 
operations, by their nature, have minimal impact on the environment, we recognise our responsibilities in this respect.
Anite is therefore committed to:
> complying with the relevant environmental legislation, regulations and industry standards of the countries in which it conducts business;
> reducing the output of emissions that may have an adverse impact on the environment;
> minimising the consumption of energy and water used in its facilities;
>  reducing waste and, wherever practicable, re-using and recycling consumables (e.g. paper, toner cartridges and computer equipment) 
and disposing of non-recyclable items in an environmentally acceptable manner; and
> where practicable, purchasing environmentally sound goods and services.
In order to achieve these objectives, the Company is building awareness and promoting initiatives to encourage employees to become fully engaged.
Corporate governance
The corporate governance report is set out on pages 25 to 30.
Charitable contributions and voluntary initiatives
Contributions by the Group during the year for charitable purposes amounted to £10,350 (2009: £3,200). The Group does not make any

Financial instruments
Details of the financial risk management objectives and policies of the Group are set out in the corporate governance report on pages 25 to 30.
Employees
The energy, commitment and passion of our employees are vital to our business. The Company strives to create a working environment 
which encourages people to be individuals and develop their full potential within a framework of shared values and goals. To achieve 
this, Anite is committed to a policy which provides all employees and potential employees with equality of opportunity for selection and 
development regardless of age, gender, nationality, race, creed, disability or sexuality. 24     Anite_Annual report and accounts 2010
Management and governance
 Report of the Directors  continued 
In the event of employees becoming disabled, every effort is made to ensure that their employment with the Company continues and that 
appropriate training is arranged for them.
Employees are provided with information through myanite.com, the Group’s global intranet, road shows and other internal 
communications. The views and ideas of employees are sought through discussion, line management and focus groups.
The Company operates a range of employee share schemes for Executive Directors and a small number of senior executives, and they are 
more fully described in the remuneration report contained on pages 31 to 36. Since August 2005, the Company has offered employees an 
enhanced Share Incentive Plan which currently matches on a one-for-one basis the number of shares purchased monthly by employees. 
On 29 June 2009, the Board approved a new Anite UK Sharesave Plan 2009 (the “Plan”) which has also been approved by HM Revenue & 
Customs. The Plan is an all employees’ share scheme which provides for options to be granted over shares using new issue shares or treasury 
shares as well as market purchase shares in respect of future grants that are purchased in the market.
Significant contracts
On 8 December 2009, following an announcement that the Company had decided to commercialise its own LTE hardware platform, the 
Company announced that it was terminating the five-year development and marketing agreement with Agilent Technologies Inc. that had 
been entered into on 1 November 2007. Anite is continuing to work with Agilent on delivery of market-leading 2G and 3G solutions under 
separate existing arrangements. Anite does not expect any material one-off costs resulting from the termination of the partnership.
Change of control
All the Company’s employee share schemes contain provisions relating to a change of control of the Company following a takeover  
bid. Under these provisions, a change of control of the Company would normally be a vesting event, facilitating the exercise or transfer  
of awards, subject to any relevant performance conditions being satisfied or waived at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. 
Other than contracts in the normal course of business, the Company is not party to any other significant agreements that take effect, alter 
or terminate upon a change of control following a takeover bid other than with regard to the Company’s bank facility agreement, which 
provides that, on a change of control, the majority lenders have the ability to cancel and seek repayment of all outstanding loans.
Payment of suppliers
It is the Group’s policy to agree with all suppliers, where practicable, appropriate terms of trade and to operate within those terms. Trade creditors 
at 30 April 2010 represented on average 51 days’ credit (2009: 43 days) for the Group and 42 days’ credit for the Company (2009: 29 days).
Going concern
The Directors acknowledge the latest guidance on going concern. Despite the current volatility in the financial markets and uncertain economic 
outlook, the Directors believe that the Group has a robust business model, as evidenced by the trading of the business over the past six 
months, strong free cash flow generation and is compliant with all its banking covenants. In making their assessment of going concern, the 
Directors consider the budgets, including the Wireless research and development commitments, cash forecasts for the following 18 months 
together with the forecast covenant positions. In addition, the Directors take into account the current strong net cash position, the availability 
of banking facilities (as set out in note 20) and the maturity profile of debt obligations (detailed in note 24). After considering the above, the 
Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, Anite continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Disclosure of information to auditors
In the case of each of the persons who were Directors of the Company at the date when this report was approved:
> so far as each of the Directors is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are not aware; and
>  each of the Directors has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a Director in order to make himself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
This information is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provision of Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Re-election of auditors
The Board has considered and recommends the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as auditors. Deloitte LLP have expressed their willingness to 
continue in office as auditors, and a resolution proposing their re-appointment will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting (AGM)
The AGM of the Company will be held at 12pm on Thursday 16 September 2010 at 353 Buckingham Avenue, Slough, Berkshire SL1 4PF.  
The Notice setting out details of the business to be considered at the meeting is sent to shareholders with this Annual Report.

Management and governance
The Company is committed to the principles of good corporate governance contained in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance 
issued by the Financial Reporting Council in June 2006 (the “Code”). This report sets out the Company’s compliance with the Code.
Statement of compliance with the Combined Code
The Company has applied the principles set out in section 1 of the Code, throughout the accounting period including both the main and 
supporting principles, by complying with the Code as reported above. Further explanations of how principles and supporting principles have 
been applied are set out below, and in the remuneration report and the report of the Audit Committee.
The Board
The Board of Directors is the body responsible for corporate governance, for establishing policies and objectives and for the stewardship 
of the Group’s resources. It is the Group’s policy that the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are separate, with their roles and 
responsibilities clearly divided and recorded. The Chairman is responsible for leadership of the Board, ensuring its effectiveness and setting 
its agenda. He also ensures that communication with shareholders is effective and facilitates the contribution of the Non-Executive 
Directors. The Chief Executive is responsible for implementing the strategy agreed by the Board as a whole and for managing the Group. 
Currently, the Board is made up of the Non-Executive Chairman, the Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director and three Non-Executive 
Directors. David Hurst-Brown is the Senior Independent Director. The biographies of the Directors as at the date of this report are given on 
pages 20 to 21.
The Chairman was considered to be independent on his appointment to the Board. It is the opinion of the Board that the three Non-
Executive Directors are independent of management and have no business or other relationship which could interfere materially with the 
exercise of their judgement in relation to the business of the Company or the Group.
The Directors believe it is essential that the Company has an effective Board. The Board operates formally through regular Board meetings 
and there is also frequent communication between the Directors outside these meetings. The Board met 23 times during the year, including 
10 scheduled meetings and 13 ad hoc meetings convened to deal with specific matters requiring Board consideration or approval. Details of 
attendance at these meetings are given in the table on page 27. During the year the Board also received detailed strategy presentations from 
the divisional Managing Directors.
The Board is responsible to the Company’s shareholders for the management and control of the Group’s activities, its strategic objectives, 
governance, internal controls and the stewardship of its resources. The regular and timely provision of information to the Board is ensured 
through the monthly preparation and circulation to all Board members of the Chief Executive’s report which reports on operational matters; 
the Group Finance Director’s report which provides the monthly management accounts and other relevant financial information; and the 
Company Secretarial report which covers corporate governance, corporate social responsibility and matters concerning the Company’s shares, 
share schemes and shareholders. Other matters are tabled on a regular basis at Board meetings or are reported to the Board as appropriate.
The Board has a regular schedule of meetings together with further meetings when required. In addition, Directors meet as members of 
relevant committees. The Board has delegated the normal operational management of the Company to the Executive Directors, who have 
direct responsibility for all operations and activities. The Company currently has two Executive Directors supported by an Executive Team, 
which comprises the Managing Directors of the Handset Testing, Network Testing and Travel businesses.
The Board has agreed a formal schedule of matters reserved specifically for its decision which include:
>  strategy and objectives;
>  business risks;
>  business plans and budgets;
>  changes in capital and corporate structure;
>  accounting policies and financial reporting;
>  internal controls and business risk factors;
>  major contracts;
>  capital projects;
>  acquisitions and disposals;
>  communications with shareholders; and
>  Board membership.
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors meet without Executive Directors present at least annually.
During the year, the Board combined the roles of Group Finance Director and Company Secretary which it felt was appropriate given the  
size and complexity of the Group. All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Group Finance Director and Company Secretary, 
who is responsible for ensuring that Board procedures and applicable rules and regulations are observed. There is an agreed procedure for 
Directors to obtain independent professional advice, paid for by the Company.
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, one-third of the Board is required to retire by rotation each year and each Director 
must offer himself for re-election once every three years. In addition, any Director appointed during the year will stand for election at the 
next General Meeting, ensuring that each Board member faces re-election at regular intervals. Details of the Directors due to retire at the 
2010 Annual General Meeting are shown on page 22.

Management and governance
Committees of the Board
The Board’s Committees meet regularly to enable them to discharge their responsibilities. Each Committee has terms of reference which are 
reviewed regularly by the Board. Copies are available on request from the Company Secretary or on the Group’s website www.anite.com.
Following formal decision making the Board may, on occasion, delegate authority to a committee consisting of any two Directors to approve 
the detailed execution of an agreed course of action within strict parameters.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises Paul Taylor, Clay Brendish and David Hurst-Brown. It is chaired by Paul Taylor. The Committee’s role is to 
assist the Board in the effective discharge of its responsibilities for financial reporting and internal control.
The report of the Audit Committee on page 37 includes details of the Audit Committee and its work.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee comprises the Chairman, the three Independent Non-Executive Directors and the Chief Executive. It is chaired 
by David Hurst-Brown. The Committee may invite others, including external advisers, to attend its meetings as appropriate. The Nomination 
Committee met three times during the year. Details of attendance at each meeting are shown in the table on page 27. Paul Taylor was 
appointed as a Non-Executive Director of the Company on 5 October 2009. Richard Amos was appointed as Group Finance Director on  
2 November 2009. He subsequently took on the additional responsibilities as Company Secretary on 17 February 2010. Biographical details 
of Paul and Richard are contained on pages 20 and 21.
The principal role of the Nomination Committee is to advise and make recommendations to the Board with regard to the size, structure and 
composition of the Board, the appointment of new Directors and the re-appointment of existing Directors. The Committee follows formal, 
rigorous and transparent procedures when appointing new Directors which include the preparation of a job description, the use of external 
advisers to facilitate the search and the evaluation of candidates according to objective criteria. All shortlisted candidates are interviewed by 
at least two members of the Committee.
Remuneration Committee

Terms and conditions of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors are normally appointed for a term of three years. The terms and conditions of the appointment of the Non-
Executive Directors are available for inspection by any person at Ancells Business Park, Harvest Crescent, Fleet, Hampshire GU51 2UZ or the 
Company’s Registered Office during normal business hours and at the Annual General Meeting of the Company.
Board performance evaluation and training
The Board, as part of its commitment to ensure its effectiveness and evaluate its performance, undertook an evaluation of its performance 
and that of its Directors during the year. This evaluation consisted of a questionnaire being completed by all Board members. In addition, 
questionnaires were completed by members of the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee in connection with a formal 
evaluation of each Committee’s assessment of its performance and effectiveness.
The Non-Executive Directors have met alone to appraise the Chairman’s performance.
The evaluation of Board performance will continue to be conducted annually and the Company may engage external help from time to time 
to ensure that the process is robust.
Induction and development of Directors
All new Directors receive a comprehensive induction to the Company.
Individual Directors are expected to take responsibility for identifying their training needs and to take steps to ensure that they are adequately 
informed about the Company and their responsibilities as a Director. In addition, the Company has a continuing professional approach to assist 
the Directors in discharging their responsibilities effectively. This is achieved through briefings on business issues, as well as legal, accounting 
and changes in corporate governance. Directors also have the ability to attend external seminars on topics that are of interest.
Non-Executive Directors meet regularly with Executive Directors and members of the Executive Team and also receive regular business 
updates via scheduled presentations.
Key performance indicators (KPIs)
The Group uses a range of performance measures to measure and manage the businesses within the Group. In addition, the divisions have 
established their own performance indicators that are specific to their individual businesses.
The Group KPIs monitor order intake, revenue, margins, research and development spend, adjusted operating profit and headcount.  
In addition to these Group KPIs, other measures indicating specific divisional measures such as cash generation, working capital, capital 
expenditure, product development and major project performances are used.
The Group changes and refines the KPIs regularly dependent on the major issues that are identified in the businesses.
Internal control and risk
The Directors have overall responsibility for ensuring that the Group maintains a sound system of internal control to provide them with 
reasonable assurance that all information used within the business and for external publication is adequate including financial, operational 
and compliance control and risk management and for ensuring that assets are safeguarded and therefore that shareholders’ investment 
is protected. There are limitations in any system of internal control and, accordingly, even the most effective system can provide only 
reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Group continues to enhance its project management procedures to ensure that good practice is applied consistently across the Group. 28     Anite_Annual report and accounts 2010
Management and governance
In line with past practice, the Board has reviewed the internal control system in place during the year and until the date of the approval of 
this report to ensure that it remains effective. Where significant weaknesses are identified as a result of the reviews, new procedures are put 
in place to strengthen controls.
The Board has in place risk assessment processes across the Group’s divisions and procedures have been established to implement best practice. 
There is an ongoing process for identifying, managing and reviewing any changes in the risks faced by the businesses. This process has been in 
place throughout the year under review and continues. It operates under the direction of the Board and is reviewed by the Audit Committee.
The key procedures that the Board has established and which are designed to provide effective internal control for the Group are:
>  the Board sets out the Group authority procedures which are adopted by all the subsidiary companies;
>  the issue of a Group accounting and procedures manual which sets out the Group’s accounting practices, revenue recognition rules, 
accounting under IFRS and bid approval processes;
>  the Board continues to review the progress of major contracts;
>  the Director of Projects and Programmes oversees project management standards and procedures across the Group and the education  
of all divisional project managers in best practice for the management of bids and the execution and status reporting of projects;
>  the application of a rigorous annual budgeting process following a detailed divisional and Group strategy review. All budgets are subject 
to approval at Board level;
>  the Executive Team is responsible for reviewing the operational results, communicating and applying Group-wide policies and 
procedures, and strategy on operational matters which is communicated both to the Board and to the operating units;
>  the formal monthly operational review by Executive Directors together with the divisional management teams to assess the financial 
and operating performance and discuss the ongoing development of each business unit and the comparison of detailed monthly 
management reports against budgets, forecasts and prior years. In addition, the Chief Executive and Group Financial Director prepare 
monthly reports for the Board on key developments, performance and issues in the business;
>  the maintenance of local operating boards and divisional management teams enabling the Board to delegate appropriate levels of 
authority to a small number of subsidiary company directors and managers, all of whom are directly accountable to the Board;
>  the identification and mitigation of major business risks is the responsibility of operating company management. Each operating 
company maintains internal controls and procedures appropriate to its structure and business environment while complying with  
Group policies, standards and guidelines. The Managing Director and Finance Director of each business unit are required to complete 
a self-assessment checklist half yearly. This provides assurance that the business unit has complied with internal controls, financial 
controls and reporting requirements of the Group and has brought to the attention of Group management any instances of fraud or 
other matters relating to their business;
>  insurance cover is maintained for all the major risk areas of the Group based on the scale of the risk and the availability of cover in the 
external market;
>  the use of external professional advisers to carry out due diligence reviews of potential acquisitions;
>  the operation of a small internal review function to carry out internal control reviews of the operating divisions on a rolling basis, 
reporting to the Audit Committee;
> the periodic detailed objective review of each business and its future direction by management and the Audit Committee.
The Board, with the advice and recommendations of the Audit Committee, will continue to review the effectiveness of all internal systems 
of control through independent reports where appropriate and by internal formal monthly review meetings in all main operating companies 
and divisions to test the validity of the internal reporting process.
Internal review function
The Board has established a Group internal review function which reports to the Audit Committee. The function is not an independent audit 
function, but is, nevertheless, an important part of the Group’s overall system of internal control.
Risk management
Anite has undergone significant change over the past few years. Anite is now an international software and solutions company focused 
on the provision of test and operational systems in the wireless market and reservations and e-commerce solutions to the leisure and 
travel industry. These markets provide significant challenges as well as rewards, and management has progressively improved the Group’s 
approach to risk management.
The combination of robust and well-defined central direction, strong divisional management and effective processes and controls enable  
the Group to identify and deal with key risks at the earliest opportunity.
The Group operates rigorous processes and controls to ensure that for each division there is a detailed annual operating plan and budget 
with a monthly operational review by senior management to ensure the businesses are making progress against those plans, taking the 
appropriate corrective actions throughout the course of the year should issues arise. The progress of each division is reported regularly  
to the main Board meetings.
The principal risk factors that may affect Anite Group’s business are outlined below. These are not all within the Group’s control; other 
factors beside those listed may also affect the Group.
 Corporate governance report  continued Anite_Annual report and accounts 2010     29
Business asset risk
The Group increasingly operates in global markets, and failure to manage its portfolio of businesses effectively could have a serious 
impact. The Group conducts regular reviews of its business portfolio; it may, however, still be exposed to risks such as increased taxation, 
regulations and threats to its market leadership.
Political and economic climate risk
The Group recognises that in some countries in which it operates, specific country risks exist that could have an effect on its business 
and such risks may include volatility of national currencies, volatility in the local economic conditions, unexpected changes in local laws, 
regulations or standards and changes in local customs and business practices.
Project delivery risk
The successes of the Group businesses are partially dependent on the successful completion of development projects within budget, cost 
and specifications. The delivery of these projects is subject to certain technical, commercial, legal, contractual and economic risks.
Strategic and operational risks
Within Wireless
>  The highly technical and fast-changing nature of the marketplace.
>  Ensuring the business realises growth in network testing.
>  The ability to identify and maintain effective relationships with key suppliers and strategic partners.
>  The need to keep products at the forefront of changes in technology.
Within Travel
>  The changing nature of the customer market resulting from increasing use of the internet.
>  The need to keep products at the forefront of changes in technology.
>  Delivery of projects and contracts to our clients within agreed budgets and timescales.
>  Ensuring the business is flexible enough to accommodate the changing structure of the travel industry.
>  Ensuring that the division has common robust systems and back-up processes in place to mitigate problems of external infrastructure 
failures that might have an impact on the division’s performance.
Human resource and organisation risks
Anite’s performance and its ability to mitigate significant risks within its control depend on its employees and management teams. Future 
success will depend to a large extent on the Group’s ability to attract, retain and motivate its people.
If the Group loses the services of key people or is unable to attract and retain employees with the right capabilities and experience, it would 
be likely to have an effect on the Group’s business and operations.
Financial risks
The Group has several financial risks, including costs, the nature of commercial contracts, interest rates, exchange rates, insurances and 
other financial risks. Some of these are covered in the Group treasury management section below.
The Group also recognises that the continued change in the Group’s portfolio and geographic spread requires new risk mitigation techniques 
which enable the Group to:
>  manage bank debt in compliance with banking covenants;
>  identify and mitigate the effect of currency, interest rate and cost changes;
>  mitigate the increase in the Group’s tax rate as sales and profits expand in higher tax areas.
Group treasury management
The Group’s financial instruments comprise borrowings, derivatives, cash and liquid resources and various items such as trade debtors and 
trade creditors that arise directly from, and finance, operations.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.  
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks, which are summarised below. These policies are reviewed on a regular  
basis. The Group’s head office finance function is responsible for ensuring that the policies approved by the Board are adopted throughout 
the Group.
Foreign currency risk
The Group is subject to a cross-border transactional currency exposure in respect of trading outside each operating company’s functional 
currency. Where possible, currency receivables and payables are matched, creating a natural hedge. A proportion of any surplus cross-border 
transactional exposure is hedged using appropriate derivative instruments. The proportion of forecast cash flows that will be hedged is 
reviewed regularly in the light of experience – see note 24(h) for further details. The policy is that any surplus foreign currency is converted 
into sterling at the earliest opportunity. 30     Anite_Annual report and accounts 2010
Management and governance
The Group has overseas subsidiaries which operate mainly in North America, Northern Europe and Asia Pacific and whose revenues and 
expenses are denominated in their local currencies. Up until 30 April 2010 the Group partly hedged its investments in overseas subsidiaries 
through financial instruments and natural hedges. In March 2010 the Board decided to cease hedging investments in overseas subsidiaries 
using financial instruments. As detailed in note 23, the Group executed a number of derivatives to manage its foreign exchange exposure 
with a view to providing investor certainty on its cross-currency swap liability and, following the purchase of a forward exchange contract 
on 22 April 2010, the Group ceased to apply hedge accounting to its net investment in overseas subsidiaries using derivative financial 
instruments. Further details are set out in note 24(f) on page 72.
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations and acquisitions through a mixture of retained reserves and bank borrowings. The Group seeks to minimise 
overall net interest expense and, where there are surplus funds, to obtain a fair market rate of return. The Group operates a cash-pooling 
arrangement for all its UK operating companies and endeavours to balance liquidity requirements with achieving a market rate of return on 
cash through the use of short-term money market deposits or other term deposits. Appropriate financial instruments are used to mitigate 
the impact of changes in interest payable in respect of significant borrowings. Further details are set out in note 24(e) on page 72.
Liquidity risk
The Group seeks to maintain a balance of available facilities to fund the Group’s liquidity requirements, further details of which are set out  
in note 24(k) on pages 74 and 75.
The Group has strong operating cash inflows and has focused efforts on managing its working capital.
Credit risk
The Group’s policy on credit risk is set out in note 24(j) on page 74.
Relations with shareholders
Communications
The Board considers effective communication with its investors, whether institutional, private or employee shareholders, to be  
extremely important.
The Company reports formally twice a year, with the half-year results announcement and the preliminary announcement of the full-year 
results. Shareholders are issued with an Interim Report and Accounts in December and with the full-year Report and Accounts in July.  
In addition, as required under Article 6 of the Transparency Directive, the Company issues an interim management statement during each 
half year. These reports are posted on www.anite.com.
The Company makes other announcements from time to time which can also be found on www.anite.com.
Members of the Board meet institutional investors on a regular basis providing an opportunity to discuss, in the context of publicly available 
information, the progress of the business. Institutional investors and analysts are also invited to attend briefings by the Company following 
the announcements of the annual and interim results.
During the year the Non-Executive Directors met a number of major shareholders individually.
The Chairman and the Senior Independent Director are available to shareholders on all matters relating to governance.
Annual General Meeting (AGM)
The Company’s AGM will be held on 16 September 2010 at the Company’s registered office in Slough. The notice of meeting is sent to 
shareholders at least 20 working days before the AGM. The Directors encourage the participation of private shareholders at the AGM and 
are available for questions both formally during the meeting and informally afterwards. The Chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and 
Nomination Committees are normally available to answer questions at the AGM.

Management and governance
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and associated legislation and meets the relevant requirements 
of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority. As required by the relevant legislation, a resolution to approve the report will be 
proposed at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Company at which the financial statements will be presented for approval.
The relevant legislation requires the independent auditors to report to the Company’s shareholders on certain specified matters and this 
report has, therefore, been split into separate sections for the unaudited and audited information.
Unaudited information
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is a committee of the Board and comprises the Non-Executive Directors who are independent of 
management and free from any business or other relationship which could interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.  
The Company Chairman (who was independent on appointment) is also a member.
During the year, membership of the Committee was as follows: David Hurst-Brown (Chairman of the Committee); Peter Bertram  
(resigned 8 December 2009), Clay Brendish, Nigel Clifford and Paul Taylor (appointed 5 October 2009). 
The Committee met five times during the year. Details of attendance at the meetings are shown in the table in the corporate governance 
report on page 27.
The principal function of the Committee is to make recommendations to the Board on the remuneration policy for Executive Directors. It is 
also responsible for setting the individual remuneration packages for the Chairman (in his absence), the Executive Directors and the Chief 
Executive’s direct reports, and for monitoring and approving the operation of all share-based incentive arrangements. The Committee also 
determines the terms and conditions of employment of the Executive Directors.
The Committee operates within agreed terms of reference which are posted on the Company’s website.
Advice and assistance
The Committee uses Hewitt New Bridge Street as its professional advisers on executive remuneration and employee share schemes.  
Neither Hewitt New Bridge Street nor its parent company, Hewitt Associates, provide any other services to the Company.
The Finance Director provides the Committee with information and assistance but does not generally attend meetings. The Chief Executive 
does regularly attend meetings to provide his insights on business objectives, the individual performance of his direct reports and pay and 
conditions throughout the Group. No Executive Director or senior manager is, however, present when their own remuneration is being 
specifically discussed.
Remuneration policy
Main principles
The Company’s objective is to attract, retain and incentivise high-calibre executives who can drive the business forward and increase 
shareholder value. To meet this objective, the Company follows three key principles:
>  total rewards are designed to be competitive, with the remuneration package of each Executive Director and their direct reports 
benchmarked regularly against the market;
>  incentive-based rewards are seen as an important part of each Executive Director’s total remuneration and are designed to drive and 
reward exceptional performance; and
>  long-term incentive arrangements are designed to align the interests of the Executive Directors and senior managers with those of the 
shareholders and to support the Company’s business strategy.
The Committee also ensures that, when determining the Executive Directors’ remuneration packages, due account is taken of pay and 
employment elsewhere in the Group. In this regard, the Committee ensures (via regular interaction with the Company’s HR function and  
the Chief Executive’s attendance at certain meetings) that it is kept fully abreast of all relevant Group-wide remuneration-related issues. 
There were no increases in base salary levels awarded to the Executive Directors for the year commencing 1 May 2010 compared with 
broadly inflationary increases for the workforce at large.
The Committee will ensure that the incentive structures for Executive Directors and senior managers will not raise environmental, social or 
governance (ESG) risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour. More generally, with regard to overall remuneration structures, 
there is no restriction on the Committee which prevents it from taking into account ESG matters, nor do these remuneration structures 
encourage inappropriate operational risk taking.
Reward structure
The Executive Directors’ total remuneration packages consist of:
>  base salary;
>  annual performance bonus;
>  pension contributions;
>  other benefits and allowances; and
>  long-term incentive arrangements.
 Remuneration report  32     Anite_Annual report and accounts 2010
Management and governance
Base salary
Base salary is reviewed annually and is set with reference to salary levels for similar roles in other comparable companies in the software 
and computer services sector and the market generally. The factors for comparability include market sector, size and business complexity.
As stated above, there were no increases to the base salaries of the Executive Directors for the year commencing 1 May 2010.
Annual performance bonus
The Company operates an Annual Bonus Plan (the Plan) for Executive Directors. Under the terms of the Plan for year ended 30 April 2011, 
a bonus of up to 125% of salary can be earned (year ended 30 April 2010: 100%). For the year under review, bonuses were determined 
by performance against (i) a sliding scale of challenging Group profit targets (calculated excluding fair value write-downs, amortisation 
of acquired business, gains or losses on business disposals and deduction of share-based payments) (ii) pre-agreed stretching personal 
objectives, and (iii) delivery of key strategic business objectives.
In reviewing the performance of the whole year, the Committee made no annual bonus payment to Christopher Humphrey as minimum 
profit targets were not achieved. In the case of Richard Amos, the Committee has awarded a bonus of £23,125 reflecting his performance 
against stretching personal objectives. His award has been pro-rated to reflect his employment for six months of the financial year.
For the financial year 2010/11 the Plan will be based on the achievement of profit growth targets. Achievement of budgeted profitability 
will entitle the participant to a bonus of 25% of base salary, with stretching targets above this required to be met for the maximum 100% 
of base salary that is applicable to this element of the bonus to be paid. In addition, up to a further 25% of base salary is payable for the 
achievement of personal objectives although, for such payments to be made, a minimum level of profit growth must be achieved. This 
change in policy, which enhances the performance-related element of the Executive Directors’ packages, is regarded as appropriate due to 
the stage of the Group’s evolution and the importance of returning the Group to a growth plan. Reflecting the higher available maximum 
payment, the percentage of base salary attributable to budgeted performance has been decreased from 75% in 2009 to 50% in 2010/11, 
with a 50% of salary bonus payable only for full achievement of the challenging personal objectives.
Pension contributions
Christopher Humphrey makes his own pension arrangements and the Group makes no payment in this respect. Richard Amos belongs to the 
Anite Stakeholder Pension Plan and the Company contributes 5% of his base salary on the basis that he contributes a minimum of 3%.
Other benefits and allowances
Executive Directors are entitled to a car allowance, fuel, medical insurance, death-in-service and permanent health insurance, together with 
reasonable business expenses.
Long-term incentive arrangements
The Company operates the following two long-term share-based incentive plans for Executive Directors:
>  the Performance Share Plan (PSP); and
>  the Share Matching Plan (SMP).
Under the PSP an individual may receive an award of shares worth up to 100% of their salary per annum (although in exceptional 
circumstances an award of up to 200% of their salary may be made). 
The Executive Directors and a small number of the most senior executives are also able to participate in the SMP. As originally structured, 
participants were allowed to lodge in the SMP shares worth up to 30% per annum of base salary, which were then matched on a two-for-
one (gross) basis.
In 2007, shareholders approved a change to the investment level under the SMP. Pursuant to this change, while the effective average annual 
level of co-investment in the SMP remained unchanged at 30% per annum, executives were provided with an opportunity over the three 
financial years from 1 May 2007 to 30 April 2010 to invest a higher amount annually (up to 90% of base salary) in the SMP. Any investment 
is, however, subject to the effective current overall aggregate limit of 90% of salary over this three-year period. The original two-for-one 
gross matching ratio was retained. A proposal is being made to this year’s AGM to, in essence, repeat the approval of the higher 90% annual 
limit, again subject to the overall three-year limit. Further details of the proposal are set out in the Notice of AGM.
Awards granted under the PSP and SMP are subject to three-year performance conditions. 
The PSP and SMP awards made in 2007, 2008 and 2009 are subject to the following performance conditions:
>  half of awards are subject to a Total Shareholder Return (TSR) target. This is measured relative to the FTSE All-Share Software and 
Computer Services Sector, with 25% of this portion of awards vesting at the median and full vesting at the upper quartile. Straight-line 
vesting applies between these points; and
>  half of awards are assessed by reference to Anite’s Earnings Per Share (EPS) performance. For compound annual EPS growth of at least 
RPI plus 4% per annum, 25% of awards subject to this part of the condition will vest and, for full vesting, compound annual EPS growth 
must be at least RPI plus 12% per annum. Straight-line vesting applies between these points.
 Remuneration report  continued Anite_Annual report and accounts 2010     33
The EPS figure used for PSP and SMP measurement in 2007 was 5.2p, being basic EPS before amortisation of acquired intangible assets, 
gains and losses on the disposal of operations, the effect of net capitalisation/net amortisation on research and development costs, results 
from discontinued/disposed operations and share-based payments.
The TSR and EPS performance against the 2007 targets was in both cases below the threshold performance level, so these awards will lapse 
at the end of the three-year vesting period, on the third anniversary of the grant.
The EPS figure for the measurement for PSP awards made in 2008 was 3.3p being profit from continuing businesses before disposed 
businesses, other gains and losses, share-based payments, amortisation of acquired intangible assets and restructuring costs. 
The EPS figure for the measurement for PSP awards made in 2009 was 4.4p being profit from continuing businesses before disposed 
businesses, other gains and losses, share-based payments, amortisation of acquired intangible assets and restructuring costs. 
In addition to the TSR targets, before any awards vest, the Committee must also have satisfied itself that the Company’s underlying  
financial performance over the performance period warrants the level of vesting determined by reference to the TSR performance condition 
(this underpin does not apply to the EPS element). The extent to which the performance condition is satisfied will be calculated by external 
consultants to ensure the appropriate level of third-party verification.
The Committee will continue regularly to review the operation of the Company’s share incentive arrangements to ensure that they take 
due account of market practice and the particular circumstances of the Company. In this regard, the Committee has determined that the 
following performance conditions should apply to PSP and SMP awards made in the forthcoming year:
>  half of an award will continue to be based on the Company’s relative TSR compared with the FTSE All Share Software and Computer 
Services Sector, as is currently the case; and
>  half of an award will be based on the adjusted Profit Before Interest and Tax performance of the Wireless division (PBIT target).  
The PBIT target will primarily measure the aggregate PBIT of the Wireless division (which comprises the Handset Testing and Network 
Testing businesses) over a three-year period, but will also include an element which will reward specifically in the event of the Wireless 
division exceeding its best ever year of PBIT. The split of the PBIT target will therefore be:
 1.  75% (i.e. 37.5% of the total grant) based on the sum of the PBIT of the Wireless division in each of the three financial years of the 
performance period will count towards the vesting percentage. The following vesting schedule will apply to this part of the award:
Total PBIT of Wireless division for 2011, 2012 and 2013 Proportion of the 75% of the PBIT target which vests
Less than £42.5 million 0%
£42.5 million 25% (i.e. 18.75% of the PBIT awards)
Between £42.5 million and £50 million Pro rata from 25% to 100% (i.e. 18.75%  
 to 75% of the PBIT awards)
£50 million or above 100% (i.e. 75% of the PBIT awards)
 2.  25% (i.e. 12.5% of the total grant) will be paid if, in any one year of the performance period, the PBIT of the Wireless division is in excess 
of £23.4 million (which was the sum of the record years of PBIT the Handset Testing and Network Testing businesses achieved in 
2007 and 2009 respectively). For the purposes of making this assessment, a constant currency will be used (note that constant 
currency will not apply to the aggregate target).
  Note that measures (1) and (2) above will be assessed independently of each other. In addition, these are both independent of the TSR 
target which will continue to apply to half of all awards.
  In the event that acquisitions or disposals are made during the three-year period, the Committee will, with appropriate financial advice, 
make adjustments to the PBIT target. Furthermore, the PBIT target will be measured on a consistent basis with respect to intercompany 
charges and exceptional items.
  The Committee will also carry out a qualitative assessment of the performance of the Group as a whole when deciding whether to 
release the shares under the PBIT element of the PSP and SMP. This will ensure that there has been no event outside the Wireless division 
which would make a vesting inappropriate.
To provide a further alignment of interest with shareholders, the Executive Directors and others participating in the SMP are required to retain 
in shares an amount equal in value to 50% of the after-tax gain made until they have built up a shareholding equal to 100% of base salary.
The Executive Directors are also eligible to participate in the Company’s Sharesave Plan 2009 and the Share Incentive Plan which are 
available to all employees.
The use of new issue or treasury shares to satisfy awards made under the share plans is subject to a 15% dilution limit in any ten-year 
period. The current potential dilution is below this level. The Committee, aware of shareholders’ views in connection with this matter, 
continues to take active steps to control the dilutive effect of the Company’s share incentives and is currently working under an informal 
dilution limit of 10%. The actual dilution is currently 7.0%. 34     Anite_Annual report and accounts 2010

Other share plans
Recruitment award to Richard Amos
In addition to the long-term incentive plans detailed above, the Committee awarded Richard Amos a one-off Restricted Share Award on 
his commencement of employment. The Award of 150,000 ordinary shares was granted on 10 December 2009 pursuant to the exemption 
from the need for prior shareholder approval contained in Listing Rule 9.4.2 R(2). The Committee confirms that the Award was felt to be 
necessary to facilitate the recruitment of Mr Amos.
The Award will normally vest on the second anniversary of the date of grant, subject to Mr Amos remaining employed by the Group at that 
time. No consideration was paid by Mr Amos for the Award.
In the event of a change of control of the Company, the Award will vest within the three-month period (or such other period as the Board 
may determine) following such event.
Management Incentive Plan
In 2007, the Company introduced a Management Incentive Plan (MIP) for key employees. The MIP is not available to Executive Directors and 
all awards are settled using market purchase shares or a cash equivalent. Further details of the MIP are contained in note 9 on page 58.
Service contracts
The Committee’s policy is that all Executive Directors’ service contracts will be rolling contracts of one year’s duration. Information regarding 
the service contracts of Executive Directors’ who served during the year is summarised in the table below.
Executive Director    Date of contract Notice period
Christopher Humphrey  3 February 2003 12 months
Richard Amos  2 November 2009 12 months
 
Executive Directors are not permitted to hold external Non-Executive Directorships or offices without the approval of the Board. No Executive 
Director received any fees in respect of any external Non-Executive Directorships held during the year.
The table below sets out the rights the Company has to pay Executive Directors in lieu of notice together with the contractual compensation 
payable if the Company terminates the contract (other than for cause) without notice.

1 Contractual benefits for Christopher Humphrey alone include the annual performance bonus he would have received had he continued to be employed from the date of   
 termination until the expiry of the notice period. 
2  Payments cease, in effect, if the Executive Director commences employment with a new employer during the payment period.
Other than in the case of dismissal for gross misconduct, the provisions of Christopher Humphrey’s service contract will be honoured in full. 
The Company is aware of the provisions in the Combined Code which state that compensation payments should reflect a departing Director’s 
obligation to mitigate his loss. However, the Company has adopted the above described approach to determining the compensation that is 
payable in the event that Christopher Humphrey’s service contract is terminated as it believes that it is in shareholders’ interests that the 
maximum obligations of each party in such circumstances are transparent and agreed in advance to provide certainty.
If the Company terminates Christopher Humphrey’s employment without cause, the Committee will be asked to exercise any discretion 
it has under the terms of any share incentive plans in his favour. If the Remuneration Committee determines not to follow this 
recommendation, he shall be entitled to damages.
These terms do not apply to Richard Amos. Indeed, the provisions in Richard Amos’s contract are in line with the Committee’s standard 
policy for new Executive Director appointments. These are that, in the event of termination without cause, he would be entitled to 12 
months’ salary only, paid in monthly instalments and with mitigation. There are no obligations on the Remuneration Committee to exercise 
its discretion in respect of the terms of the share incentive plans.
Non-Executive Directors
Clay Brendish has a three-year term of office with six months’ notice of termination required by either party. David Hurst-Brown, Nigel 
Clifford and Paul Taylor each have a three-year term of office with no notice period or provision for compensation for loss of office.
Further details of the Non-Executive Directors’ terms of employment can be found on page 27.
The Board reviews the independent Non-Executive Directors’ fees annually, in the course of which it compares fees paid to Non-Executive Directors 
of comparable companies. Fees recognise the additional responsibilities undertaken by the Non-Executive Directors in chairing the Board and 
its Committees. In addition to their fees, the Non-Executive Directors are entitled to reimbursement of reasonable business expenses.
 Remuneration report  continued Anite_Annual report and accounts 2010     35
The Chairman’s fees are set by the Remuneration Committee. He is not present at any discussion of his own remuneration. There will be no 
increases in Non-Executive Directors’ fees for the year commencing 1 May 2010.

Management and governance
Membership
The Audit Committee is a committee of the Board which comprises the Non-Executive Directors who are independent of management and 
free from any business or other relationship which could interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.
During the year, membership of the Committee was as follows: Paul Taylor (Chairman) was appointed on 8 December 2009 (following the 
resignation of Peter Bertram); Clay Brendish; and David Hurst-Brown.
Both Paul Taylor and David Hurst-Brown are considered by the Board to be “independent” as defined by Provision A.3.1 of the Combined 
Code. Clay Brendish was considered to have met the independence criteria on his appointment as Chairman of the Company on  
4 October 2005.
The Board considers that Paul Taylor has recent and relevant financial experience.
The Group provides an induction programme for new Audit Committee members.
The Committee invites others, including the external auditors, the Group Finance Director, and the Chief Executive, to attend its meetings  
as appropriate. The Group Financial Controller is the Secretary to the Committee.
Meetings
During the period under review the Committee met four times. Details of attendance at each meeting are shown in the table in the 
corporate governance report on page 27.
The Committee meets with the external auditors without any Executive Directors present at least twice annually and more often if this  
is considered appropriate.
Role, responsibilities and terms of reference
The Committee’s role is to assist the Board in the effective discharge of its responsibilities for financial reporting and internal review.
The Committee’s responsibilities include:
>  reviewing the annual and interim financial statements and results announcements of the Company and any other formal announcements 
relating to the Company’s financial performance;
>  reviewing the Company’s accounting policies;
>  monitoring and reviewing the Company’s systems of internal control and risk management;
>  monitoring and reviewing the Company’s “whistleblowing” procedures;
>  monitoring and reviewing the requirement for an internal audit function;
>  considering the appointment of the Company’s external auditors, overseeing the process for their selection and making recommendations 
to the Board in relation to their appointment; and
>  overseeing the relationship with the external auditor, including approval of their remuneration, agreeing the scope of the audit 
engagement, assessing their independence, monitoring the provision of non-audit services and considering their reports on the Company’s 
financial statements and systems of internal control and risk management.
The Committee operates within agreed terms of reference which can be found on the Company’s website.
Internal audit
The Committee agreed in July 2006 to create an internal review function, headed by a member of the Group finance team who, under the 
control of the Audit Committee, carries out a plan of detailed reviews throughout the operating companies. Where additional resource is 
required, this is sourced either from an external professional firm or by selecting divisional staff who carry out peer reviews in divisions other 
than their own. This internal review function does not represent an independent internal audit function as defined by professional internal 
audit standards, but has been a significant enhancement in the Group’s internal control framework. The Committee considers that the 
current internal review function is suitable given the size and complexity of the business.
Independence of external auditors
Deloitte LLP have been the Group’s auditors since September 2002. The Audit Committee considers that the relationship with the auditors 
is working well and remains satisfied with their effectiveness. Accordingly, it has not considered it necessary to date to require the firm to 
tender for the audit work. The external auditors are required to rotate the audit partner responsible for the Group and subsidiary audits 
every five years and the current lead audit partner has been in place since October 2008. There are no contractual obligations restricting  
the Group’s choice of external auditor. The Committee also keeps under review the value for money of the audit.

Financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required to 
prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have also chosen to prepare the parent company financial statements under IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, International 
Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
>  properly select and apply accounting policies;
>  present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; 
>  provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand  
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and 
>  make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
>  the financial statements, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and 
>  the management report, which is incorporated into the Directors’ report, includes a fair review of the development and performance  
of the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with  
a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Financial statements
 Independent auditors’ report to the members of Anite plc 
We have audited the Group financial statements of Anite plc for the year ended 30 April 2010 which comprise the Consolidated Income 
Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and the related notes 1 to 31. The financial reporting framework that has been applied 
in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.  
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them  
in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the Group financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Group financial statements:
>  give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 30 April 2010 and of its loss for the year then ended;
>  have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
>  have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the Group financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
>  certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
>  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
>  the Directors’ statement contained within the Report of the Directors in relation to going concern; and
>  the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the June 2008 
Combined Code specified for our review.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Anite plc for the year ended 30 April 2010 and on the 
information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.

Financial statements
1 Statement of accounting policies
a) General information
Anite plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. The consolidated financial statements of the 
Company for the year ended 30 April 2010 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”). The principal 
activities of the Company and its subsidiaries are described in note 15. The financial statements were authorised for issue by the Directors  
on 5 July 2010. The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which the Group operates. 
b) Basis of preparation
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as 
adopted by the European Union and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretations and those parts  
of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. Therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 
of EU IAS regulations.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial 
instruments.
The Directors acknowledge the latest guidance on going concern. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going 
concern basis as set out on page 24 in the Report of the Directors.
i) Critical accounting assumptions and judgements
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting assumptions. It also requires 
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas requiring a higher degree of 
judgement, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are discussed in the relevant 
accounting policies under the following headings:
1 Goodwill (note 1(e)); 
2 Intangible assets (note 1(f)(ii and iii)); 
3 Revenue recognition (note 1(k)); 
4 Taxation (note 1(l)); 
5 Employee benefits – share-based compensation (note 1(m)); and 
6 Provisions (note 1(p)).
ii) IFRIC interpretations and amendments/new IFRS
The IFRIC interpretations and amendments to published standards that are effective in 2010 and those that are not yet effective are 
discussed in section 1(s) below.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
c) Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company, all of which 
are made up to 30 April each year. The results of companies acquired or sold during the year are consolidated for the periods from or to  
the date on which control passed. Control is achieved where the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial  
and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that 
presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account. Acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method. The results  
of subsidiaries disposed in the year are included in the consolidated income statement up to the effective date of disposal.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. 
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any deficit in 
the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired (i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited to the income 
statement in the period of acquisition.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those 
used by the Group. All inter-company transactions and balances between Group enterprises are eliminated on consolidation.
d) Foreign currency
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity are recorded at the rates of exchange at the dates of the 
transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates of 
exchange prevailing at that date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are 
translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
The exchange differences arising on retranslation are taken to the income statement, except for exchange differences arising on non-
monetary assets and liabilities where the changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity.

1 Statement of accounting policies continued
d) Foreign currency continued
The results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange during the period and their balance sheets at the rates 
ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on translation of the opening net assets and results of overseas operations  
and on foreign currency borrowings, to the extent that they hedge the Group’s investment in such operations, are recognised directly in  
the hedging and translation reserve account (“other reserves”).
Any differences that have arisen since 1 May 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are included in the retained earnings account. Such 
translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
The Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS as sterling-
denominated assets and liabilities.
e) Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable 
assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income 
statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal or closure of a previously acquired business, the attributable amount of goodwill previously written off to reserves is included  
in determining the profit or loss on disposal or closure.
Goodwill arising prior to the transition to IFRS has been recognised and measured in accordance with UK GAAP, but is no longer amortised.
Accounting assumptions and judgements
The determination of whether or not goodwill has been impaired requires an estimate to be made of the “value in use” of the cash-
generating units (CGU) to which goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation includes estimates about the future financial 
performance of the cash-generating units, including management’s estimates of long-term operating margins and long-term growth rates. 
The carrying amount of goodwill and the key assumptions used in the calculation of value in use of CGUs to which goodwill is attributed are 
disclosed in note 12.
f) Intangible assets
i) Software licences
Software licences are initially measured at cost. Cost includes the purchase price of the assets and the directly attributable costs of bringing 
the asset into its intended use. After initial recognition, the intangible asset is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation less any 
accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is charged evenly over the assets’ estimated useful life.
ii) Separately identifiable intangible assets arising on business combinations
Separately identifiable intangible assets such as customer relations, technology and in process R&D are recognised only when the assets 
meet the following conditions:
a) meet the separately identifiable criteria below; 
b) are controlled by the acquiring company; 
c) provide a probable source of future economic benefits; and 
d) the fair value can be measured reliably.
The criteria to be separately identifiable are met when the intangible asset:
i) is capable of being separated from the acquired business; and 
ii)  arises from contractual or legal rights, regardless of whether those rights are transferable or separable from the acquired company or 
other rights and obligations.
The amortisation period ranges from five to ten years and is based on equal annual instalments over the assets’ estimated useful life.
Accounting assumptions and judgements
The assessment of the future economic benefits generated by these separately identifiable intangible assets and the determination of their 
amortisation profiles involves a significant degree of judgement based on management estimation of future potential revenue and profit 
and the useful life of the assets. Reviews are performed regularly to ensure the recoverability of these intangible assets. 46     Anite_Annual report and accounts 2010

f) Intangible assets continued
iii) Research and development expenditure
Expenditure on research activities as defined in IFRS is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Expenditure on internally-generated intangible assets arising from the Group’s development activities is recognised only when both the 
identification and recognition criteria as defined in IAS38 for an intangible asset and the following six criteria are met:
1 the technical feasibility of completing the asset so that it will be available for use has been achieved; 
2 the Group has the intention to complete the asset and use or sell it; 
3 the Group has the ability to use or sell the asset; 
4 it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits; 
5 adequate technical, financial and other resources are available to complete the development and to use or sell the asset; and 
6 the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
If these conditions are not met, such development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
The qualifying expenditure capitalised represents costs directly attributable to the development of the asset. This expenditure is capitalised 
from the point at which the above criteria are met up to the point at which the product is in use. Internally-generated intangible assets 
including capitalised development costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives which management estimate to be no 
more than three years.
Accounting assumptions and judgements
The assessment that the internally-generated assets will generate future economic benefits relies on the management’s estimation of future cash 
flow streams of these assets. The technical feasibility of the assets involves a degree of management’s judgement as to when this is achieved.
Management’s assessment regarding the useful lives of capitalised development costs is based upon the typical product life cycle for similar 
assets in the market adjusted by the risks associated with each capitalised development project.
g) Property, plant and equipment and depreciation
Land and buildings, office equipment and fixtures and fittings, computer equipment and vehicles are stated at cost, net of accumulated 
depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets and freehold properties at rates calculated to write off the cost over the estimated 
useful lives, on a straight-line basis, as follows:
Freehold properties 2% per annum of cost excluding land 
Short leasehold properties Length of lease  
Office equipment and fixtures and fittings 10% to 50% per annum of cost  
Vehicles 25% per annum of cost 
Computer equipment 33% per annum of cost
Costs relating to short leasehold properties, office equipment and fixtures and fittings and vehicles are included in the “plant, fixtures, 
equipment and motor vehicles” category (see note 14).
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
h) Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any 
indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated 
in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from 
other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Any tangible or intangible 
asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows 
are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the 
asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless 
the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease. Anite_Annual report and accounts 2010     47
1 Statement of accounting policies continued
h) Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill continued
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised 
estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss 
is recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment 
loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
i) Other investments
Other investments are stated at cost less provision for any impairment.
j) Inventories and work in progress
Inventories and short-term work in progress are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs include materials and, where 
relevant, direct labour and appropriate overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories and work in progress to their present 
location and condition. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be 
incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
k) Revenue recognition
Revenue from the sale of software relates mainly to perpetual licences, which provide the customer with the right to use the Group’s 
products. Where any associated services are not essential to the functionality of the software, then the software revenue is recognised when 
the following conditions are met:
> persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists; 
> the Company’s fee is fixed or determinable; and 
> collection is probable.
Revenue is recognised on delivery with a retention to be recognised on acceptance or otherwise as performance is defined in the relevant 
customer contract.
Revenue generated from fixed price contracts, including relevant licence fees where service essential to the functionality of the software 
is being performed, is recognised on a percentage of completion basis over the life of the contract. Provision is made for any expected 
losses on contracts yet to be completed. Amounts recoverable on fixed price contracts, which are included in debtors, are stated at the net 
sales value of the work done less amounts received as progress payments on account. Excess progress payments are included in creditors 
as payments on account. Cumulative costs incurred, net of amounts transferred to cost of sales, less provisions for contingencies and 
anticipated future losses on contracts, are included as fixed price contract balances in work in progress.
Contracts which meet the definition of a construction contract are disclosed separately as “amount due from construction customers” 
in “trade and other receivables” or “amount due to construction customers” in “trade and other payables”, as required under IAS 11 
“Construction Contracts”. See note 22 for more details.
Revenue generated from time and material contracts is recognised in line with when the work is performed.
Maintenance revenue is generally recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of the related agreement, taking into account any free 
maintenance periods.
Managed services revenue is recognised over the life of the contract. Costs incurred on a contract from third parties, which are directly 
related to the contract, are capitalised and recognised over the life of the contract. Contract profitability is regularly reviewed and, if 
necessary, provision for any forecast loss arising is made. Sales, operational and administrative costs are written off as incurred.
All finance income is recognised in the income statement in the period in which it arises.
Accounting assumptions and judgements
The revenue and profit of fixed price contracts is recognised on a percentage of completion basis when the outcome of a contract can be 
estimated reliably. Management exercises judgement in determining whether a contract’s outcome can be estimated reliably. Management 
also makes estimates of the total cost of professional services or, in some instances, total contract costs which are used in determining 
the value of amounts recoverable on contracts and any related provisions required for onerous contracts. Estimates are continually revised 
based on changes in the facts relating to each contract.
The carrying value of amounts recoverable on contracts is disclosed in note 22.
Management has exercised a degree of judgement in formulating a set of criteria used for determining when revenue that involves several 
deliverable elements should be recognised on a bundled or unbundled basis. 48     Anite_Annual report and accounts 2010
 Notes to the accounts  continued 
Financial statements
1 Statement of accounting policies continued
l) Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never 
taxable or deductible. The liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance  
sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be 
utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other 
than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in 
joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which 
case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Accounting assumptions and judgements
In recognising income tax assets and liabilities, management makes estimates of the likely outcome of decisions by tax authorities on 
transactions and events whose treatment for tax purposes is uncertain. Where the final outcome of such matters is different, or expected 
to be different, from previous assessments made by management, a change to the carrying value of income tax assets and liabilities will be 
recorded in the period in which such a determination is made. The carrying values of current tax and deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
disclosed separately in the consolidated balance sheet.
m) Employee benefits
i) Retirement benefit costs
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made to state-managed 
retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the Group’s obligations under the schemes 
are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme. The Group has no defined benefit schemes.
ii) Share-based compensation
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 “Share-based Payments”. In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been 
applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group operates several equity-settled share-based payment plans for its employees. The fair value of shares determined at the grant 
date of the equity-settled share-based payment is recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
The Group operates an Inland Revenue approved employee share option scheme (“SAYE scheme”), which allows employees the ability to 
purchase the Group’s ordinary shares at a discount to the current market value. The Group records an expense based on its best estimate  
of the fair value of the discount related to shares expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. 
The Group has granted executive options, which include approved option plans and long-term incentive plans. The grant price is normally 
equal to the average quoted market price of the Group shares on the date of grant. The vesting period is generally three to ten years. If the 
options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the options expire. Furthermore, options are forfeited if the 
employee leaves the Group before the options vest, unless the employee meets certain “good leaver” conditions.
Accounting assumptions and judgements
The fair value of the SAYE scheme and executive option scheme is measured by using the Black-Scholes and a stochastic model, namely the 
Monte-Carlo pricing model, respectively. The total amount of this fair value to be expensed rateably over the vesting period is determined 
by reference to the fair value of the options at the grant date, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (such as profit 
targets). Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable 
or the number of shares that the employee will ultimately receive. This estimate is revised at each balance sheet date and the difference is 
charged or credited to the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity. Anite_Annual report and accounts 2010     49
1 Statement of accounting policies continued
m) Employee benefits continued
Accounting assumptions and judgements continued
Market vesting conditions such as TSR targets are factored into the fair value of the option and therefore, no subsequent adjustments will  
be made if performance conditions are not met.
The proceeds received on exercise of the options, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to equity.
For more details on the assumptions made in the valuation, see note 9.
n) Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
i) Trade and other debtors
Trade and other debtors do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts.
ii) Investments
Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade-date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms 
require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at cost, including 
transaction costs.
Investments are classified as either held-for-trading or available-for-sale and are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value.
Where securities are held for trading purposes, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in net profit or loss for the period.
For available-for-sale investments, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity until the security is 
disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the net 
profit or loss for the period.
iii) Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
iv) Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including 
premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis to the income statement using 
the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period  
in which they arise.
v) Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
vi) Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
o) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Group 
does not enter into speculative derivative contracts and all such instruments, if used by the Group, are for hedging purposes to alter the risk 
profile of an existing underlying exposure to the Group in line with the Group’s risk management policies.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on 
the use of financial derivatives.
Cash flow hedge
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised 
directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. If the cash flow hedge of a firm 
commitment or forecast transaction results in the recognition of an asset or a liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, 
the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the 
asset or liability. For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the 
income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit or loss. 50     Anite_Annual report and accounts 2010
 Notes to the accounts  continued 
Financial statements
1 Statement of accounting policies continued
o) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting continued
Fair value hedge
For an effective hedge of an exposure to changes in the fair value, the hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the 
risk being hedged with the corresponding entry in profit or loss. Gains or losses from re-measuring the derivative, or for non-derivatives the 
foreign currency component of its carrying amount, are recognised in profit or loss.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement 
as they arise.
Discontinued hedge accounting
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecast 
transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred 
to net profit or loss for the period.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for in a similar way to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in the hedging and translation reserve account (“other reserves”);  
the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss under the heading of “other gains and losses”.
Gains or losses deferred in the foreign currency translation reserve are recognised immediately in profit or loss on disposal of the foreign operation.
Embedded derivatives
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and 
characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains  
or losses reported in the income statement.
p) Provisions
Provisions for warranties, onerous contracts, vacant properties with outstanding leases to settle, restructuring costs and legal claims are recognised 
when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events. This is where, in management’s view, it is more likely than 
not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated. Restructuring provisions 
comprise unexpired future lease payments, employee termination payments and removal costs. Provisions for restructuring costs are 
recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has been communicated to affected parties.
Deferred consideration provision is management’s best estimate of the contingent consideration payable to vendors, which may be subject 
to change as this is dependent on the fulfilment of certain performance targets of the businesses acquired.
Property provisions are established on a property-by-property basis to meet the estimated liabilities, including dilapidations. The provision 
covers all ongoing unavoidable costs net of rental income. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Accounting assumptions and judgements
The Group is subject to claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. Each claim is evaluated by management, together with their 
legal advisers, and a decision made on whether financial settlement is probable, in which case appropriate provisions are made.
q) Operating profit from continuing operations
Operating profit from continuing operations is stated after charging restructuring costs, but before finance income or charges and before 
other gains or losses.
r) Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease 
payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance 
lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of 
interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly against income unless they are directly attributable to 
qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Group’s general policy on borrowing costs (see above).
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Anite_Annual report and accounts 2010     51

s) Adoption of IFRIC interpretations, new and amendments to IFRS
i) Applicable for the Group’s accounting periods beginning on or after 1 May 2009
The IFRIC interpretations, amendments to existing standards and new standards that are mandatory and relevant for the Group’s accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1 May 2009 have been adopted. Adoption of these standards has not had any effect on the financial 
performance or position of the Group as the changes relate to additional disclosure points only. The changes include the adoption of:
>  IFRS 8: “Operating Segments” whereby the operating segments are identified on the basis of internal reports about components of 
the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Board of Directors in order to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their 
performance; and
>  IAS 1 (revised): “Presentation of Financial Statements” whereby a statement of comprehensive income is presented as a primary 
statement, separate from the income statement and the statement of changes in equity.
In both instances, the disclosures of prior period amounts have been restated.
At the date of approval of these financial statements, the following standards, interpretations and amendments thereto were issued that are 
mandatory for the Group’s accounting periods beginning on or after 1 May 2009. Management assessed the relevance of these amendments 
and interpretations and concluded that they are neither relevant nor material to the Group or resulted in additional disclosures.
Amendments to existing standards
>  Annual improvements to IFRSs (revised May 2008) – amendments that result in accounting changes for presentation, recognition or 
measurement purposes.
>  IFRS 2, Share-based Payment – vesting conditions and cancellations.
>  IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures – enhancing disclosures about fair value and liquidity risk.
>  IAS 23, Borrowing Costs – comprehensive revision to prohibit immediate expensing.
>  IAS 27, Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements – cost of an investment on first-time adoption.
>  IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation – puttable instruments and obligations arising on liquidation.
>  IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition Presentation – embedded derivatives when reclassifying financial instruments.
ii) Applicable for the Group’s accounting periods beginning on or after 1 May 2010
At the date of approval of these financial statements, the following standards, interpretations and amendments thereto were issued that 
are mandatory for the Group’s accounting periods beginning on or after 1 May 2010. The Group has not adopted early any of these new 
pronouncements that may be relevant to the Group.

2.2 Operating segments – primary basis
The Group is organised into four operating segments: Handset Testing, Network Testing, Travel and Group. With the exception of Group, 
which performs the head office function, each operating segment derives its revenue from the development, installation and support of 
software products relating to its relevant industry sector. 
Operating segment information under the primary reporting format is as disclosed in the tables below:

3 Restructuring costs
The restructuring costs incurred in the current period relate to the closure of the WiMAX line of business within the Wireless division.  
These costs include the impact of asset write-downs of the development costs and equipment and other costs of restructuring and redundancy. 
The related costs of impairing the goodwill and acquired intangible assets are disclosed separately within administrative expenses (note 2.5).
The restructuring costs incurred in the prior period relate to the disposal of Anite Public Sector and the release of a previously held provision 
relating to the exit from the own-platform development. The property provision was made following the disposal of Anite Public Sector due 
to the head office property at 353 Buckingham Avenue, Slough, being underutilised due to the relocation of Anite Public Sector staff and the 
uncertainty over the Group’s ability to sublet the top floor which remains vacant at 30 April 2010.

2 The unwinding of discount on provisions (note 26) relates to property and deferred consideration provisions. 
3  The recycling of fair value loss on cash flow hedges arises due to the repayments of the term loan reducing the interest payments, causing some of the interest cash flows to be 
classed as no longer probable. In accordance with IAS 39, an equivalent proportion of the fair value losses under the interest rate swap arrangement, previously taken to equity, 
are released to profit or loss.

Expected dividend yield 3.6% 0%-3.5% 0% 0%-3.19%
†  Expected life for other share-based payments is 100% of the options that are exercised after three years if a gain of 10% is available. If this gain is not available, options are held 
until such a gain can be achieved. Any remaining options are exercised at maturity providing that they are “in the money”. For LTIP (profit element only) – 5% p.a. leavers in the 
first three years was assumed. Under the PSP, SMP and MIP awards, the expected life is equal to the vesting period of three years. However, for MIP, depending on performance, 
annual vesting is possible.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Company’s share price over the following periods (expected 
life) up to grant date: other share-based schemes – three years and SAYE three and five years for three- and five-year contracts respectively.
The period of exceptional volatility for the period from 30 September 1999 to 24 July 2002 was removed from the volatility calculations.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise 
restrictions and behavioural considerations. 60     Anite_Annual report and accounts 2010

The Group earns its profits in the UK and overseas. The tax rate used for tax on profit on ordinary activities is 28%, being the standard rate 
for UK corporation tax, as the Group’s head office is in the UK.
Some components of the Group’s overseas profits are likely to be taxed at an effective rate that is higher than the UK rate. Other components, 
due to the availability of losses brought forward in certain countries, are likely to be taxed at a lower rate. 62     Anite_Annual report and accounts 2010

Goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. During the 
year, the closure of the WiMAX line of business within the Wireless division indicated that there were grounds for a permanent impairment  
in the value of goodwill held and as a result an amount of £5,092,000 was charged to impairment.
Impairment tests
The cash generating unit (CGU) is typically the combination of a group of assets acquired which cannot be separately identified, within each primary 
segment of the Group. The carrying amounts, basis of determination and key assumptions for the goodwill impairment calculations are as follows:
  Wireless Nemo Wireless other Travel other
Carrying amount of goodwill £000 51,123 –  6,200
Basis on which the CGU’s recoverable amount has been determined  Value in use Value in use Value in use
Key assumptions:
Discount rate % 10.6 10.6 10.0
Includes a risk factor of % 0.6 0.6 – 
Long-term growth rate % 0.0 0.0 0.0
Period over which cash flows are projected years 5 5 5
The discount rate is based on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for the Group as adjusted for risk. The WACC is derived by taking 
the average of the results from calculations using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and dividend growth model, using data from 
leading market data providers.
The risk adjustments relate to management’s view of the sensitivity to technology risk within the Wireless segment and are based on past experience.
The long-term growth rate has been set at zero for each CGU. Management is sensitive to the technology risk within the software industry 
and does not deem it appropriate to forecast growth for products more than five years into the future.
The period over which the cash flows are projected is set at five years. The cash flow projections are based on the budgets, strategic plans, knowledge 
of the market, performance of the sector and management’s view of the recoverable amount based on observable market prices for the CGU.
Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions
Wireless Nemo – Management has based its determination of the unit’s recoverable amount on the key assumptions listed above.  
At 30 April 2010, the recoverable amount of Wireless Nemo exceeded its carrying amount by £2.6m. A 1% perpetual reduction in the 
operating margin would reduce its recoverable amount by £0.8m. 64     Anite_Annual report and accounts 2010

The Group’s policy is to ensure that all credit trade customers are subject to credit verification procedures and where appropriate, parent 
guarantee and letters of credit, especially for overseas customers, are used so that the Group is exposed to a minimum level of bad debts. Anite_Annual report and accounts 2010     67
17 Trade and other receivables continued
The credit risk for trade receivables by business segments for 2010 and 2009 is as follows:
In Travel, the top four customers represent 10% (2009: 8%) of the Group’s trade receivables. 
In Wireless, the top four customers represent 25% (2009: 27%) of the Group’s trade receivables.
Overall, the Group has no customer that accounted for 8% or more of the accounts receivable at 30 April 2010 (2009: 9%) and, therefore, 
there is no significant concentration of credit risk since the risk is spread over a large number of unrelated counterparties. Transactions with 
a single external customer within the Travel segment amounted to £9.1m, 11.5% of the Group’s revenue (2009: less than 10%).
The average credit period for trade receivables is 78 days (2009: 79 days). In the United Kingdom trade receivables are typically on 30 days’ 
credit terms whilst, in certain cases, a schedule of payments or extended payments have been agreed. In other geographical areas, especially 
Europe, trade receivables can be based on longer credit terms of up to 90 days before the debt falls due for payment. Interest may be charged 
on any outstanding balance that is 30 days overdue. At 30 April 2010 and 2009, the trade receivables were non-interest bearing.
The Group has provided for all debts that, individually, are deemed doubtful at their estimated irrecoverable amount. With the exception 
of debts for which the revenue has yet to be recognised or where the monies are received prior to the reporting date, the Group applies a 
collective assessment of impairment for debts with similar credit risk characteristics. These characteristics are determined on the basis of 
the Group’s historical loss experience within the industry and provide, in varying percentages, for debts that are overdue the agreed payment 
terms. The reason for the policy is because overdue receivables carry an increased risk of not being recoverable. The table below shows the 
movements in the provision for impairment of trade receivables:

More than three months overdue   1,197 610
   20,353 19,834
The neither past due nor impaired and those that are past due but not impaired balances are due from customers with good credit ratings. 
There is no known reason why these amounts will not be recovered in due course. Of the debts past due but not impaired, revenue has not 
been recognised on 3% (2009: 14%) of those debts greater than three months overdue.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.
The trade receivables do not include any advances or retentions at 30 April 2010 (2009: £nil). 68     Anite_Annual report and accounts 2010

issue costs being amortised over the period of the loan.
The loan was taken out on 30 November 2006 under a borrowing facility (see note 24(k) for more details) maturing on 30 November 2011. 
This loan is secured by a fixed and floating charge on the Group’s assets.
This loan carries a weighted average floating interest rate of 1.52% (2009: 5.52%) and exposes the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.  
This interest rate risk was partly hedged by the Group using derivative financial instruments (note 23).
The bank loans are initially measured at fair value and net of transaction costs. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis. The average effective interest rate for this loan was 
1.56% (2009: 5.87%)

Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses

Foreign currency options
The Group has purchased options to sell euro at a rate of £1 = €1.30 on 27 October 2011. The total principal amount paid was £1.0m and the 
mark to market value at 30 April 2010 is £828,000. A charge of £172,000 has been recognised in the income statement and is disclosed as 
other gains and losses under the heading “Change in the fair value of derivative assets outstanding at year end”.
Cash flow hedges – interest rate swaps
The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its bank borrowings.
At 30 April 2010, the interest rate swaps with notional principal amounts totalling £20m (2009: £20m) have fixed interest rate payments  
at an average rate of 5.535% and have floating interest receipts at LIBOR rate for periods up until 31 October 2011. 
The fair value of the interest rate swaps as shown above are based on market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date. 
Interest rate swaps to the value of £643,000 are designated and effective as cash flow hedges and the fair value thereof has been deferred 
in equity. Interest rate swaps to the value of £641,000 are designated but are no longer effective under IAS 39. During the period, losses of 
£655,000 previously held in reserves, have been recycled from reserves to the income statement and are disclosed as finance charges (note 
6) under the heading “recycling of fair value loss on cash flow hedges”. A gain of £187 ,000 (2009: £nil) arising due to ineffectiveness has been 
credited to the income statement and is disclosed as other gains and losses under the heading “hedge ineffectiveness on cash flow hedges”. Anite_Annual report and accounts 2010     71
23 Derivative financial instruments continued
Net investment hedges – cross currency swaps
The Group has overseas subsidiaries which operate mainly in North America, Northern Europe and Asia Pacific and whose revenues and 
expenses are denominated in their local currencies. The Group has historically hedged its net investment in overseas subsidiaries through 
natural hedges, forward exchange contracts and utilisation of cross currency swaps, however following the purchase of a forward exchange 
contract on 27 April 2010, the Group ceased to apply hedge accounting to its net investment in overseas subsidiaries using derivative 
financial instruments.
During the year, the Group entered into forward exchange contracts that, when combined with the cross currency swaps, reduced the 
principal amount under the combined instrument to €nil. At each purchase of a forward contract, the amount of the principal designated  
as the hedged item was reduced by an equal amount so that at the balance sheet date the principal value of the hedged item is also £nil.  
The combined hedging instruments of the cross-currency swap and forward exchange contracts were used to hedge the euro-denominated 
net investment of Wireless Nemo and at the balance sheet date indicated a mark to market liability of £22,115,000 (2009: £22,827,000)  
of which £524,000 relates to future quarterly interest payments and £21,591,000 relates to the net exchange of principals.
The fixed interest rates on the cross currency swap elements range from 4.64% to 5.19% (2009: 4.64% to 5.19%) and the floating interest 
rates are based on LIBOR (sterling) and EURIBOR (euro). During the year, the Group entered into forward exchange contracts to eliminate 
the impact of exchange rate movements on the net interest payable/receivable. At the balance sheet date, these forward contracts 
indicated a mark to market liability of £170,000.
The fair value change on the cross currency swap, which is approximately 99% effective against the hedged item, is recognised in the 
hedging and translation reserve. A gain of £651,000 (2009: loss £1,057,000) relating to ineffectiveness was recognised in the income 
statement during the year and is disclosed as other gains and losses under the heading “hedge ineffectiveness on net investment hedge”.
24 Financial risk management
a) Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital structure to ensure that the entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while 
maximising the returns to the shareholders through the optimisation of the net debt and equity balance.
The Group is currently in a net cash position therefore the capital employed is equivalent to the shareholders’ funds of £78.0m (2009: £83.9m).
The Group has a credit facility agreement under which the Group is subject to certain financial covenants relating to leverage, cash flow 
and interest cover and also the requirement that the maximum pre-agreed level of overdrafts and ancillary facilities granted to the Group 
companies that are guarantors of the credit facility are not exceeded. The Group has complied with these covenants and requirements. 
b) Significant accounting policies
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses 
are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, liability and equity are disclosed in note 1.

d) Financial risk management
The Group’s financial assets and liabilities mainly comprise bank borrowings, cash and liquid resources, derivative financial instruments, 
deferred consideration for acquisitions and various items, such as trade receivables and payables, that arise directly from its operations.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are market risk (primarily exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign currency 
risks), liquidity risk and credit risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
e) Market risk – interest rate
The Group finances its operations and acquisitions through a mixture of reserves, bank borrowings and new equity and this policy is 
reviewed from time to time. The Group borrows in the desired currencies at floating rates of interest and manages the interest rate risk 
by selectively using interest rate swaps. Any surplus cash is converted into sterling and is invested in short-term money market and bank 
deposits at the prevailing rates of interest in order to achieve the market rate of return. 
The financial assets and liabilities that are interest-bearing and expose the Group to interest rate risk are as follows.
i) Cash and equivalents (note 18). The weighted average floating interest rate for these financial assets which were based on sterling 
market rates, fixed for periods up to three months was 0.6% (2009: 3.0%).
ii) Bank borrowings (note 20). The weighted average floating interest rate for bank borrowings was 1.52% (2009: 5.52%). This is linked 
to LIBOR plus a margin for bank loans. The margin varies between 0.60% and 1.05% dependent on the ratio of net debt to EBITDA, reviewed 
annually. During the year, the margin remained constant at 0.60% (2009: 0.60%).
The contractual interest rate on the overdrawn balance is based on 1% per annum over the bank’s base rate for its sterling accounts and 1% 
per annum over the bank’s relevant short-term offered rate for any other currency accounts.
iii) Interest rate swaps. These derivatives are used to manage the Group’s exposure to interest rate risk on its bank borrowings above. 
See note 23 for details of the interest rate.
iv) Cross currency swaps. These derivatives were used to hedge the net investment of an overseas subsidiary. See note 23 for details  
of the interest rate.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined, based on the exposure to interest rates for both financial assets and liabilities, both 
including derivative instruments, as listed above at the balance sheet date and adjustments have been made particularly where some of the 
significant derivatives only existed for part of the year.
With all other variables held constant, the table below demonstrates the sensitivity to a 0.5% change in interest rates applied to the major 
currencies of net variable rate assets/liabilities. 0.5% is the sensitivity rate that represents management’s assessment of the reasonably 
possible change in interest rates in the next 12 months.

The fair value of financial assets and liabilities is not materially different from the book value recorded at 30 April 2010 and 2009.
f) Market risk – foreign currency
The Group has overseas subsidiaries and branches which operate mainly in North America, Northern Europe and Asia Pacific and whose 
revenues and expenses are denominated in their local currencies. Until 27 April 2010, the Group partly hedged its investment in overseas 
subsidiaries through financial instruments and natural hedges. Details of the effect of changes to this policy are shown in note 23. Anite_Annual report and accounts 2010     73
24 Financial risk management continued
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The Group has a Euro denominated investment in Wireless-Nemo that, until 27 April 2010, was designated as being in a net investment 
hedge. At 30 April 2009, the principal amount designated was equal to the principal amount of the hedging instrument, which was a 
combination of a cross currency swap and a forward exchange contract. At the balance sheet date the designated principal was £nil (2009: 
£88.4m). As a result of reducing the principal amount of the hedged item to zero, any foreign exchange movements will create a gain or loss 
on the value of the investment. With all other variables held constant, the effect of a 10% depreciation and appreciation of the euro against 
sterling applied to the investment will be either a gain of £7.3m (2009: not applicable) or a loss of £8.0m (2009: not applicable) in the 
hedging and translation reserve, respectively.
During the year, the Group purchased options to sell a total of €80,500,000 at a rate of €1.30 = £1 exercisable on 27 October 2011. At the 
exchange rates ruling on the balance sheet date, the effect of a 1% depreciation and appreciation of the euro against sterling would have nil 
effect on the Group’s reported results. However, should the strike price be achieved prior to 27 October 2011, a 1% depreciation of the euro 
against sterling would create a gain to the Group of £613,000.
The sensitivity analysis below is based on a 10% appreciation/depreciation of the euro and US dollar against sterling, applied to the net 
monetary assets or liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operating unit involved.
 £-denominated US$-denominated €-denominated

In management’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis is based on the monetary assets and liabilities at reporting date and therefore, does not 
reflect the exposure during the year. 
g) Other price risks
The Group is not exposed to other price risks apart from interest rate and foreign exchange risk, as disclosed above.
h) Forward foreign exchange contracts
Anite’s strategy is to hedge a proportion of the forecast future cash flows for a period of three to five months, creating a cash flow 
movement to offset the translational movement. The proportion of forecast cash flows that will be hedged is reviewed periodically in the 
light of experience.
Excluding the forward exchange contracts that form part of the net investment hedge, at 30 April 2010 (2009: £75,000), the Group had the 
following outstanding contracts:

i) Interest rate and cross currency swap contracts
See note 23 for details of the interest rate and cross currency swaps.
j) Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the Group.
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is as follows:
   2010 2009
  Note £000 £000
Cash and cash equivalents  18 44,803 47,177
Derivative financial instruments  23 856 75
Trade receivables  17 20,353 19,834
   66,012 67,086
The credit risk on cash and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties to these assets are highly rated financial 
institutions. In addition, the Group has further mitigated this risk by spreading cash deposits over a range of financial institutions, with no 
more than £5m being deposited with any one counterparty.
The Group’s policy to mitigate potential credit risks and the concentration of credit risks of trade receivables are detailed in note 17 – trade 
and other receivables.
k) Liquidity risk
The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance and continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank overdrafts and bank 
syndicated facilities.
The Group’s UK overdraft facility was renewed during the year at £5m (net) (2009: £5m (net)). The net amount drawn down under these 
facilities at 30 April 2010 and 2009 was £nil. 
In October 2006, the Group entered into a five-year syndicated facility which was underwritten in full by Lloyds TSB Bank Plc. This facility 
consists of a term loan of £50m repayable at £5m per annum until 30 November 2010, with the balance due on 30 November 2011, and 
a revolving credit facility of £40m. On 31 October 2008, the Group made a one-off voluntary repayment under the term loan of £25m, 
reducing the amount outstanding under the facility to £20m. On the same date, the Group’s revolving credit facility was reduced to £20m. 
The amount of undrawn facilities at 30 April 2010 was £20m (2009: £20m) and total undrawn facilities including the overdraft facility were 
£25m (2009: £25m). The revolving credit facility incurs commitment fees at market rates.
This facility is available to be drawn to support the general corporate purposes for the Group including working capital requirements. Anite_Annual report and accounts 2010     75

Deferred tax assets in respect of losses carried forward in certain companies have not been recognised because at present it is not envisaged 
that there will be sufficient taxable profits in those companies from which future reversal of these reliefs can be deducted. The unutilised 
reliefs may be carried forward for various periods.
Deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised for the withholding tax and other taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings 
of certain overseas subsidiaries. No provision is required since the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of these 
differences and either it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future or no tax is payable on the reversal.

 Independent auditors’ report to the members of Anite plc 
We have audited the parent company financial statements of Anite plc for the year ended 30 April 2010 which comprise the Balance Sheet, 
the Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Statement of Changes in Equity, the Cash Flow Statement and the related notes 1 to 17.  
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.  
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them  
in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the parent company 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the parent company financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the parent company financial statements:
>  give a true and fair view of the state of the parent company’s affairs as at 30 April 2010;
>  have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
>  have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
>  the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
>  the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
parent company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
>  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
>  the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns; or
>  certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
>  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

d) Financial risk management
The Company’s financial assets and liabilities mainly comprise cash and liquid resources and various items, such as trade receivables and 
payables, that arise directly from its operations.
The main risks arising from the Company’s financial instruments are market risk (primarily exposure to changes in the interest rate and 
foreign currency risks), liquidity risk and credit risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are 
summarised below.
e) Market risk – interest rate
The Group finances its operations and acquisitions through a mixture of reserves, bank borrowings and new equity and this policy is 
reviewed from time to time. The Group borrows in the desired currencies at floating rates of interest and manages the interest rate risk 
by selectively using interest rate swaps. Any surplus cash is converted into sterling and is invested in short-term money market and bank 
deposits at the prevailing rates of interest in order to achieve the market rate of return. 
The financial assets and liabilities that are interest-bearing and expose the Company to interest rate risk are as follows:
i) Cash and cash equivalents (note 8). The weighted average floating interest rate for these financial assets which were based on 
sterling market rates, fixed for periods up to three months was 0.6% (2009: 3.0%).
ii) Interest bearing intercompany debtors and creditors. The weighted average of these interest rates (net) is 1.77% (2009: 6.7%). 
These rates are linked to LIBOR plus margin. The margin is 0.85% as stipulated in the loan agreement.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analyses below have been determined, based on the exposure to interest rates for both financial assets and liabilities, both 
including derivative instruments, as listed above at balance sheet date.
The table below demonstrates the sensitivity to a 0.5% change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, applied to the major 
currencies of net variable rate assets/liabilities. 0.5% is the sensitivity rate that represents management’s assessment of the reasonably 
possible change in interest rates in the next 12 months.

f) Market risk – foreign currency
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The table below shows the Company’s currency exposures in the profit and loss account arising from the monetary assets and monetary 
liabilities of the Company that are not denominated in sterling, its functional currency. The sensitivity analysis below is based on a 10% 
appreciation/depreciation of euro against sterling, applied to the net monetary assets or liabilities denominated in this currency at reporting 
date. The sensitivity analysis includes amounts owed by the Group undertakings.
  €-denominated
   2010 2009
   £000 £000

Profit before tax – gain/(loss)
10% depreciation   4,572 4,558
10% appreciation   (5,584) (5,603)
In management’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis is based on the monetary assets and liabilities at the reporting date and it therefore does 
not fully reflect the exposure during the year.
g) Other price risks
The Company is not exposed to other price risks apart from interest rate and foreign exchange risk.
h) Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the Company.
The Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk is as follows:
   2010 2009
  Note £000 £000
Cash and cash equivalents  8 26,564 42,313
Trade receivables  6 34 129
Amounts owed by Group undertakings   36,736 38,961
   63,334 81,403
The credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited because the counterparties to these assets are highly rated financial institutions.  
In addition, the Company has further mitigated this risk by spending cash deposits over a range of financial institutions with no more than 
£5.0m being deposited with any one counterparty.
The amounts presented in the table above are net of allowances for doubtful recoverability and foreseeable losses.
The table below shows the movements in the provision for impairment of amounts owed by Group undertakings:

The ageing of the individually impaired amounts owed by Group undertakings is as follows:

Nine to twelve months overdue   – 23
More than twelve months overdue   17,017 12,453
    17,017 17,511
The ageing of the trade receivables and amounts owed by Group undertakings (excluding those that have been impaired) is as follows:
  Amounts owed by 
 Trade receivables Group undertakings
  2010 2009 2010 2009

 8 1 36,185 38,636
Balance at 30 April  34 129 36,736 38,961
The credit quality of those debts owed by Group undertakings that are past due but not impaired has been assessed at the reporting date 
and has not significantly changed. There is no reason why these amounts will not be recovered in due course.
i) Liquidity risk
The Company’s objective is to maintain a balance and continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank overdrafts and bank 
syndicated facilities. Working capital requirements are mainly funded through dividend income from its subsidiary undertakings.
The Group’s UK overdraft facility was renewed during the year at £5m (net) (2009: £5m (net)). The amount drawn down under these 
facilities at 30 April 2010 and 2009 was £nil.
The Company is a guarantor of the Group’s overdraft and syndicated revolving credit facilities of £40m (2009: £45m) of which £25m (2009: 
£25m) was undrawn at 30 April 2010. The Company is also a party to an unlimited omnibus set-off arrangement to secure the liability of the 
Company and certain Group companies with Lloyds TSB Bank Plc.

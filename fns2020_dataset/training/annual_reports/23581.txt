Chairman’s statement
Introduction
The Group achieved strong, resilient ﬁ nancial results in 2013, 
a year marked by changes, challenges and opportunities. 
A number of milestones were passed; the Group listed on the 
London Stock Exchange and declared its ﬁ rst dividends for 
shareholders. Furthermore, I am proud that the business my 
team and I have built over the past 14 years has progressed 
from a start-up into an innovative business within the FTSE 250. 
Together with a strong, diverse Board and an experienced 
management team, I look forward to realising further the 
potential of the Group.
Motor market developments
Following Motor market rate reductions experienced during most 
of 2012, rates were relatively benign in Q4 2012 and Q1 2013 
and appeared to stabilise. This gave us the conﬁ dence to deliver 
strong policy and premium growth. This pricing stability was, 
however, short lived. Starting in the latter period of Q2 2013, 
Motor insurance customers saw yet more signiﬁ cant price 
reductions. This was most likely caused by insurers taking 
pre-emptive action in anticipation of potential future indemnity 
beneﬁ ts from the Government’s civil justice reforms to tackle 
the UK whiplash epidemic and the Legal Aid, Sentencing and 
Punishment of O ﬀ enders Act 2012, which we collectively refer 
to as the “LASPO Reforms”. 
The full e ﬀ ects of these welcome reforms will take some time to 
come to fruition and, whilst early signs are promising, they are not 
yet clear enough or large enough to justify the signiﬁ cant market 
rating shi   in 2012 and 2013. I believe, however, the esure and 
Sheilas’ Wheels brands are both very well placed to beneﬁ t from 
any future improvements.
The UK Motor insurance market remains cyclical and, in my 
experience, history shows that what the market needs is not 
necessarily what guides individual insurer’s decisions. As a result, 
clear movements in the cycle tend to come when a critical mass 
of companies see their combined operating ratios deteriorate and 
their surplus reserves run dry in the same period. I don’t believe 
the market is quite there yet. For now, however, focusing on 
the Group, given our careful monitoring of risks and prudent 
approach to reserving, I believe we are currently well placed to 
capitalise when conditions change.
Home performance
Our Home book is a key factor in the diversiﬁ cation of our 
income and proﬁ t streams. We started 2013 with over half a 
million customers and added more during the year. Over the 
long term, Home insurance is typically more proﬁ table than 
Motor but more vulnerable to signiﬁ cant, unpredictable 
weather events. Our low risk focus helped our Home 
underwriting performance to remain strong despite both 
the adverse weather in Q4 2013 and the competitive 
pricing conditions.
The esure IPO
esure Group plc listed on the London Stock Exchange on 
27 March 2013. This milestone provided the Group with a 
solid platform to take the Business to the next level within one 
of the World’s most competitive general insurance markets.
At IPO, we paid back all remaining debt from our capital structure 
removing the associated costs of servicing this debt. Our Listing 
also increased the proﬁ le of the esure and Sheilas’ Wheels brands 
and provided an opportunity to introduce share ownership and 
retention schemes for the majority of our sta ﬀ .

Strong management team
The Group’s management team – under the stewardship of 
CEO, Stuart Vann, and CFO, Darren Ogden – demonstrated 
an exemplary collaborative work ethic throughout a year 
of transition. I am proud of their determination to drive 
the Business forward in what have been challenging 
market conditions. 
Financial strength and dividend
The Group has a strong, debt-free ﬁ nancial position, supported 
by a conservative investment portfolio and a prudent 
reserving policy.
The Board has proposed a ﬁ nal dividend of 13.3 pence per 
share. The full year dividend of 15.8 pence per share represents 
an annualised pro forma payout ratio of 85%. The full year 
annualised pro forma dividend comprises a base dividend 
of 50% and a special dividend of 35% of post tax proﬁ ts. 
The annualised pro forma payout ratio has been grossed up 
to reﬂ ect the fact the Group has not been Listed for a full year 
and as such the dividend pence per share represents 5/6ths 
of the full year dividend that would have been paid had the 
Group been Listed for the full year. 
The full year dividend comprises a base dividend of 9.3 pence 
per share and a special dividend of 6.5 pence per share. The 
special dividend has been set with reference to the Group’s 
capital resource requirements, prospective premium growth 
expectations and a prudent margin for contingencies. It is the 
combination of these factors that the Board has examined 
when setting the ﬁ nal dividend that we have announced today.
 
Summary
The Group’s ﬁ nancial results have been delivered against a 
backdrop of tough market conditions and we are well-placed for 
the future. It would not have been possible to achieve the year’s 
signiﬁ cant milestones without the hard work of the management 
team and all our committed sta ﬀ , to whom the Board and I would 
like to express our thanks. Personally, I would also like to thank 
esure and Sheilas’ Wheels customers and to conﬁ rm the Group’s 
commitment to act with integrity and fairness at all times to 
safeguard the trust they place in us.

Introduction – business model and strategy
At esure Group, our objective is to build and safeguard value 
for our stakeholders; to develop strong relationships with 
customers, suppliers and sta ﬀ ; and to promote and protect 
the reputation of our Business. This objective is delivered 
through a customer-focused business model and promoted 
via a strategy of disciplined underwriting, targeted growth 
and continued diversiﬁ cation of our income streams. This 
strategy is bolstered by a number of hallmark strengths 
including prudent reserving, e ﬃ  cient business processes 
and innovative development.
Our strategy is enacted by a team that is guided by Chairman, 
Peter Wood, a strong Board and an experienced management 
team led by CEO, Stuart Vann, and CFO, Darren Ogden. 
Business model
In simple terms, the Group provides Motor and Home 
insurance products and services to mainland UK customers 
through two core brands – esure and Sheilas’ Wheels. There is, 
of course, more to it than that; and our business model has 
been developed over the past 14 years.
Customer focus
Our customers are at the heart of our business model and 
everything we do. We attract and retain them with excellent 
products sold e ﬀ ectively and compliantly through strong 
brands at competitive prices. We then seek to service our 
customers with integrity and fairness throughout their 
relationship with the Group. 
Technical risk focus
We have built up discrete books of business that perform 
well, thanks to the tight risk control and rigorous technical 
pricing we employ. Data is collated, modelled and analysed 
at a very granular level to provide powerful insights into the 
risks we underwrite.
Strong brands
Our brands provide colour, meaning and depth to our Business. 
esure and Sheilas’ Wheels embody our promise to our 
customers and remain central to our continued success.  esure Group Annual Report 2013

Diversiﬁ ed income streams
Diversiﬁ cation of income beyond our Motor book helps to 
mitigate the e ﬀ ects of Motor market cyclicality. Our Home 
insurance business reached a critical mass of over half a 
million customers in 2012 and has grown further in 2013. 
We also o ﬀ er a range of optional additional insurance products 
to both Motor and Home customers to enhance their cover. 
Other income streams include the Group’s income from its 
conservative investment portfolio and the share of proﬁ ts 
from the Group’s 50% investment in the price comparison 
website Gocompare. 
Multi-channel distribution 
Throughout our history, the Group has o ﬀ ered convenient 
ways for our customers and potential customers to interact 
with us. Policies are currently o ﬀ ered directly via our websites, 
over the telephone, via price comparison websites and most 
recently via social media. 
Our culture
The Group works hard to encourage and promote the highest 
standards of professionalism and customer service which 
is embedded into our culture for the beneﬁ t of all of 
our customers.
We recognise that it is our people who make the Group a 
success and we strive to provide a rewarding place to work. 
We invest time in training our sta ﬀ  and encouraging them to 
support and serve our customers accordingly.
Our strategy
We aim to deliver sustainable value for our stakeholders 
via our strategy, that is designed to take advantage of the 
strengths inherent in our business model:
Focus on 
underwriting 
performance
Continued 
diversiﬁ cation 
of income 
streams
Targeted 
growth
Picking up these elements in more detail: 
Focus on underwriting performance
We price products for technical risk which, combined with our 
e ﬃ  ciency in running the business, translates as ‘competitive 
pricing’ within our target markets intended to deliver a positive 
contribution to the Group. 
Our underwriting discipline is founded on:
• The active monitoring and management of underwriting 
risk exposure;
• Continued development and enrichment; and
• Tight risk control at policy inception and renewal, including:
•  anti-fraud measures in our sales, policy management and 
claims functions;
•  active management of segment exposure; and
•  e ﬃ  cient claims management.
Our underwriting performance is a key driver of the Group’s 
capital requirements, and its control is therefore a key 
foundation for delivering value. This underpins the Group’s 
two other key strategic objectives.
Targeted growth
The UK private Motor insurance market covers 24 million 
vehicles and receives annual net written premiums of over 
£8 billion. The domestic Home insurance market covers over 
19 million homes for buildings insurance and over 16 million 
homes for contents insurance. These markets provide plenty 
of room for the Group to grow from its current position. 
The Group seeks to acquire and retain customers via excellent 
customer service, keen pricing and its strong brands.
The Group pursues targeted growth within market 
segments where we see the opportunity for positive 
underwriting performance. 
Growth needs the right infrastructure and the Group has made 
signiﬁ cant investments in its IT platforms, Claims System and 
business premises in recent years. As a result, the Group was 
comfortably able to accommodate in-force policy growth 
in 2013.
Continued diversiﬁ cation of income streams
The Group places a strong emphasis on diversifying its income 
streams beyond its core Motor insurance business in order 
to mitigate the e ﬀ ects of the Motor market’s cyclicality. This 
element of the strategy is discussed further as part of the 
Chief Executive Oﬃ  cer’s statement on pages 10-12.
Summary
The Group’s strong ﬁ nancial position underpins its business 
model and strategy and the Board believes the Group is well 
placed to create and sustain value for all our stakeholders.

2013 Performance overview
Last year was a landmark in esure Group’s history that included 
a strong and resilient ﬁ nancial and operational performance 
within a competitive and changing market landscape. We 
delivered pro forma earnings per share of 22.4 pence, up by 
5.8% on 2012. Despite signiﬁ cant market rating pressures, the 
Group’s combined operating ratio improved from 92.8% in 
2012 to 89.7% in 2013. Both of these metrics – and many 
others you will read in this document – reﬂ ect the resilience of 
our business model and strategy. We have adapted nimbly to 
changing market conditions while forging strong relationships 
with our customers. 
The Group’s technical approach to risk selection and pricing 
is the bedrock of our ability to underwrite Motor and Home 
insurance business at the right price for our customers. We 
review key metrics with daily, weekly and monthly analysis to 
identify market developments and opportunities which we can 
act upon quickly.
Motor underwriting
In 2013, despite all the market challenges, the Group 
maintained a disciplined underwriting approach while 
beneﬁ ting from two speciﬁ c opportunities: the ﬁ rst full year 
of gender-neutral pricing, and segment re-entry following 
the Group’s withdrawal four years ago.

Sheilas’ Wheels 
Our Sheilas’ Wheels brand launched in 2005 and grew rapidly 
to become the largest female-focused car insurance brand in 
the UK. This growth was predicated on two key factors – brand 
strength and diﬀ erential pricing by gender. Historical data 
shows that women have less expensive claims than men on 
average. So while the European Court of Justice’s decision to 
outlaw gender pricing has, in our opinion, not been fair for 
all women drivers in the short-term, the Group was able to 
implement the transition for the beneﬁ t of our Sheilas’ Wheels 
customers, and therefore, our Business.
Equalised prices were forecast to favour men more than 
women across the market; however, the female dominant 
Sheilas’ Wheels brand became more competitive for many 
existing customers. 
Following a targeted burst of younger female driver growth 
prior to the gender law taking e ﬀ ect on 21 December 2012, 
we have been able to o ﬀ er keen prices and retain more of 
our existing customers. Our very pink brand has a natural 
attraction within a largely commoditised market place to the 
advantage of our Sheilas’ Wheels customers and our Business.
Segment re-entry and LASPO Reforms
To understand why the Group’s strategy in 2013 was 
particularly e ﬀ ective, it is helpful to understand the 
Group’s recent history. In response to our early sight of 
disproportionately high levels of whiplash claims, we took 
the tough decision in 2009 to withdraw completely from 
some previously proﬁ table segments. In the process, we 
temporarily reduced our in-force policies to protect the 
quality of our book.
Since 2009, the market has signiﬁ cantly re-rated these 
segments, with rates now higher than four years ago. In the 
interim, the Group has improved its data-led underwriting, 
bolstered its internal processes and introduced a new Claims 
System, all with the aim of optimally managing segments 
where personal injury frequency may be an issue. In addition, 
from April 2013, the ﬁ rst LASPO Reforms were introduced, 
putting greater market controls in place. 
I believe these factors presented, and continue to present, 
a unique opportunity given our prior withdrawal. In advance 
of the LASPO Reforms and as they started to take e ﬀ ect, we 
decided to return cautiously to those segments. There have 
been some encouraging early signs that the re-entry segments 
are delivering a positive contribution; however, the LASPO 
Reforms will take time to have their full e ﬀ ect. 
Home underwriting
Our Home underwriting business had a successful year and 
delivered an excellent underwriting result in 2013, despite a 
competitive rating environment and the adverse weather in 
Q4 2013. The adverse weather continued in the early part 
of Q1 2014 and we have taken all steps necessary to assist 
customers who have been a ﬀ ected.
The Group’s Home insurance growth has been delivered 
predominantly through price comparison websites, which 
o ﬀ er homeowners easy ways to compare rates across many 
providers. By encouraging more people to shop around in this 
market, where traditional and mortgage-linked providers are 
still major players, I believe the Group’s competitive Home 
pricing and product quality makes us well-placed to beneﬁ t 
in the future.

Diversiﬁ ed income streams
esure Group is now a signiﬁ cant player in the UK Motor 
insurance market with room to grow, even within its core 
markets. As part of our diversiﬁ cation strategy, as well as 
having built a signiﬁ cant book of Home business, we o ﬀ er a 
range of additional insurance products, derive income from 
our investment portfolio and receive a share of proﬁ ts from 
our 50% investment in price comparison website Gocompare. 
Together, this gives us a diverse range of income streams. 
During 2013, we also launched an enhancement to our 
Motor additional insurance products with a keenly priced 
combination of four products under the name ‘Just in Case’. 
The attractive price – that includes personal accident beneﬁ t, 
misfuelling cover, lost key cover and car hire – enables us to 
reach more customers with a range of enhanced cover at a 
substantial discount to market prices. I am pleased with the 
customer response to date.
Our customers
As the CEO of one of the leading Motor and Home insurers, 
my focus on a quality business starts and ends with a focus 
on our customers. Our job is ﬁ rst to attract and then, work to 
retain customers. We do this by o ﬀ ering excellent products 
at competitive prices. Each of our sta ﬀ  then works to serve 
those customers fairly and professionally throughout their 
relationship with the Group.
In 2013, an increasing number of our Motor and Home 
customers chose to renew their policies with esure and 
Sheilas’ Wheels, a testament to the service we provide and 
competitive prices we o ﬀ er. High retention, in itself, helps 
support growth within the competitive markets in which we 
operate and nine out of ten customers would recommend us 
to a friend.
Our staﬀ  
Following the IPO, over two thirds of our employees were 
granted shares in esure Group plc and even more beneﬁ t 
from our proﬁ t share scheme. We always look for ways to 
ensure that the interests of sta ﬀ , customers and shareholders 
can be further aligned in the provision of quality products, 
outstanding service and e ﬃ  cient working practices.
Summary
We have moved our business forward signiﬁ cantly in 2013 and 
delivered strong, resilient ﬁ nancial results through hard work 
and our customer-focused strategy.
I encourage all my sta ﬀ  to continually look for new ways to 
improve and adapt for the beneﬁ t of our customers, who are 
at the heart of everything we do. Our marketplace changes 
rapidly, and each year brings new challenges. By remaining 
nimble, focused and adaptable we will continue to rise to 
those challenges for the beneﬁ t of all our sta ﬀ , customers 
and shareholders alike.
2014 Weather update
Claims from the severe weather events in the ﬁ rst quarter of 
2014 are likely to cost the Group £3 million to £4 million more 
than expected. The Group continues to manage the claims in 
a fast and e ﬃ  cient manner to meet the needs of customers 
during their di ﬃ  cult times.
Outlook
The rating environment for both the Motor and Home markets 
remains highly competitive. The Group expects gross written 
premiums in 2014 to be similar to 2013, but may choose 
tactically to reduce or increase premium depending on market 
conditions. As a result, we are targeting a combined operating 
ratio broadly similar to 2013, before adjusting for the impact 
of exceptional Q1 weather and assuming normal weather for 
the remainder of the year. With our nimble and adaptable 
approach, underpinned by our disciplined underwriting, robust 
reserving and strong ﬁ nancial position, we are well placed 
to manage the cycle and poised for proﬁ table growth when 
market conditions permit.

Operating review
Gross written premiums and in-force policies
Gross written premiums increased by 4.0% to £535.8m in 
2013, with Motor up 4.1% and Home up 3.8%. In-force 
policies increased by 9.9% in 2013 to 1.933 million, with 
both Motor and Home up, 10.4% and 8.7% respectively. 
Financial position 
The Group has a strong ﬁ nancial position with no debt, robust 
reserves, a conservative investment portfolio and capital 
signiﬁ cantly in excess of the minimum regulatory requirement.
Proﬁ tability
The Group’s proﬁ t a  er tax increased by 5.8% to £93.2m, 
with pro forma earnings per share of 22.4 pence. The Group’s 
reported trading proﬁ t declined 5.4%. However, adjusting for 
exceptional items in 2012, as outlined in the ﬁ nancial review 
section on page 18, the Group increased its normalised trading 
proﬁ t by 3.1% to £130.6m (2012: £126.7m). The combined 
operating ratio improved 3.1ppts to 89.7% through a 
combination of focused and disciplined underwriting, 
continued favourable development of prior accident year 
reserves and the Group’s e ﬃ  cient cost base. 
Dividend
The Board has proposed a ﬁ nal dividend of 13.3 pence 
per share. The full year dividend of 15.8 pence per share 
represents an annualised pro forma payout ratio of 85%. 
The full year annualised pro forma dividend comprises a base 
dividend of 50% and a special dividend of 35% of post tax 
proﬁ ts. The annualised pro forma payout ratio has been 
grossed up to reﬂ ect the fact the Group has not been Listed 
for a full year and as such the dividend pence per share 
represents 5/6ths of the full year dividend that would have 
been paid had the Group been Listed for the full year. 
The full year dividend comprises a base dividend of 9.3 pence 
per share and a special dividend of 6.5 pence per share. The 
special dividend has been set with reference to the Group’s 
capital resource requirements, prospective premium growth 
expectations and a prudent margin for contingencies.
Our customers
Our customers are at the centre of our business model and 
we strive to meet their individual needs by providing quality 
products and services which are competitively priced, easy 
to understand and deliver to expectation.
The Group aspires to achieve the highest level of customer 
service and satisfaction at all contact points from new business 
sales through to its fast and e ﬃ  cient claims settlement 
systems and processes.
During the adverse weather conditions of December 2013, 
the Group received almost double its normal call volumes into 
the Claims department. The Group activated its surge plan, 
deploying employees with the appropriate skillset from, not 
only Claims, but also other functions, to meet the needs of its 
customers during that diﬃ  cult time.

Introduction
Our largest underwriting business is the provision of Motor 
insurance policies. We take a conservative approach to risk 
selection and target lower risk drivers. Extensive management 
information is examined and tracked by the Group’s 
management team and this analysis underpins a highly 
focused and disciplined approach to underwriting, pricing 
and decision making. 
Market
Gender Directive 
As a result of developments in EU law, 2013 was the ﬁ rst 
full year of gender-neutral pricing across the UK insurance 
industry. 
LASPO Reforms
The LASPO Reforms were implemented with the aim of 
reducing claims costs and came in to force in 2013 in two 
main tranches. 
Tranche 1: Certain civil justice reforms came into force in the 
UK from April 2013, including: (i) a prohibition on the payment 
and receipt of referral fees in personal injury cases; (ii) a 
reduction in the ﬁ xed costs permitted to be recovered by 
solicitors for conducting claims under the Ministry of Justice’s 
pre-action protocol for low-value personal injury claims in 
road tra ﬃ  c accidents (‘Pre Action Protocol’) (£1,200 to £500); 
(iii) the withdrawal of the ability for successful claimants to 
recover a  er-the-event insurance premiums and success fees 
under conditional fee arrangements; (iv) an increase of 10% to 
the level of general damages.
Tranche 2: Further reforms were implemented in July 2013, 
including: Stage 1 ﬁ xed costs permitted to be recovered by 
solicitors for conducting claims under the Ministry of Justice’s 
‘Pre-Action Protocol’. These are now payable a  er receiving the 
Stage 2 Settlement Pack; and the extension of the Ministry of 
Justice Claims Portal limit from £10,000 to £25,000 for road 
traﬃ  c accidents occurring a  er 31 July 2013. 
Rating
According to public data, UK Motor market rates in 2013 were 
down between 8.8% and 14.1% year-on-year and the rates 
ﬂ uctuated throughout the year. Rates were relatively benign 
in Q4 2012 and Q1 2013, however from the later part of 
Q2 2013 onwards there were signiﬁ cant Motor market 
rate reductions. 
Performance
The Group achieved gross written premiums of £446.5m, 
an increase of 4.1%, in highly competitive market conditions. 
The in-force policy growth of 10.4% was delivered through 
continued focus on the core underwriting book and two 
speciﬁ c opportunities: (i) Segment re-entry aided by the LASPO 
Reforms and (ii) The ﬁ rst full year of gender-neutral pricing.

In response to early identiﬁ cation of the personal injury 
phenomenon, in 2009 the Group withdrew from certain 
previously proﬁ table segments of the UK motor market. 
Since this time, the market has re-rated these segments and 
the Group has improved its data-led underwriting, internal 
processes and introduced a new Claims System. In 2013, the 
LASPO Reforms, as referred to in the industry update, came 
into force. The combination of these factors helped facilitate 
the Group to successfully re-enter into certain segments of 
the market that it had previously exited. 
In addition, Sheilas’ Wheels, which is predominantly 
female, beneﬁ ted from increased retention rates a  er 
the implementation of gender-neutral pricing. 
Trading proﬁ t for Motor grew 34.4% to £41.0m, as a result of 
the Group’s good risk selection and disciplined underwriting 
approach. The strong performance was aided by a combination 
of the Group’s new Claims System, that has provided both 
indemnity and e ﬃ  ciency cost beneﬁ ts, continued favourable 
development of prior accident years and no exceptional 
weather events in Motor in 2013, compared to the £4.0m 
cost of exceptional weather in 2012. All these factors have 
contributed to the combined operating ratio improving 
2.5ppts to 89.9%. 
The Group provided its Motor customers with the opportunity 
to enhance their core Motor policy cover via optional 
additional insurance products.
At the beginning of 2013, the Group o ﬀ ered seven additional 
insurance products to its Motor policyholders.
In August 2013, the Group consolidated four Motor additional 
insurance products into one convenient, discounted, easy to 
understand product called ‘Just in Case’. This new product 
comprises car hire beneﬁ t, enhanced personal injury cover, 
keycover and misfuelling cover at a signiﬁ cant discount to 
the individual constituents, which are also available on an 
individual basis.

Introduction
The Group has grown its Home insurance customer base 
strongly in recent years and, in 2013, Home delivered a good 
contribution to the Group’s performance. As with Motor, our 
risk selection is conservative and backed by similarly extensive 
management information to aid our disciplined underwriting 
and decision making. Our results reﬂ ect the quality of this 
approach. 
Market
Weather
Compared to 2012, the weather in 2013 was more typical of 
a normal year, albeit with some signiﬁ cant and high proﬁ le 
weather events in the fourth quarter. In both October and 
December, some parts of the UK experienced over twice 
the ‘normal’ amount of rainfall and December was also the 
windiest on record since 1969, contributing to the largest tidal 
surge since January 1953, which hit mainly the east coast of 
England. The Group is participating in the development of the 
Flood Re industry initiative, led by the Association of British 
Insurers. Flood Re should provide a new approach to o ﬀ ering 
aﬀ ordable home cover to those living in ﬂ ood risk areas. 
Rating 
According to public data, the UK Home Market rates in 2013 
were down between 5% and 10% year-on-year for a buildings 
and contents policy.

Financial review continued
The Group continues to apply a prudent approach to reserving, 
as demonstrated by the favourable development of prior 
accident years. The small deterioration in the Motor current 
year adjusted net loss ratio largely reﬂ ects the market rating 
environment in 2013, which is partly o ﬀ set by strategic actions 
of the Group. The Home current year adjusted net loss ratio 
has beneﬁ ted from a lower claims frequency compared to 
2012, despite the competitive rating environment.

2  Policy administration fees comprise income received as a result of 
administration charges, e.g. as a result of mid-term alterations to policy 
details by the policyholder and cancellation charges. Other income includes 
introduction fees where the Group does not have a continuing relationship 
with the customer.
3  Claims income comprises income generated by the Group from legal panel 
membership fees and fees generated from the appointment of ﬁ rms used 
during the claims process, including medical and car hire suppliers.
4  Total income from the Group’s non-underwritten additional services 
reporting segment. 
5  Underwritten additional insurance products is calculated by deducting the 
Group’s claims costs associated with its underwritten additional insurance 
products from the gross written premiums relating to these products in a 
particular period.
6  Pet, Pest and Travel additional insurance products have been reclassiﬁ ed 
from policy administration fees and other income to non-underwritten 
additional insurance products in 2013.
The Group’s total income from additional services is broadly 
ﬂ at compared to 2012, despite the implementation of the 
Legal Aid, Sentencing of and Punishment of O ﬀ enders Act 
2012, which aﬀ ected the Group’s receipt of legal panel 
membership fees.
Non-underwritten additional insurance products income has 
remained level with 2012 as a result of the tactical pricing of 
the Home additional insurance products to aid Home gross 
written premiums growth. This strategic action reduces 
the level of income from non-underwritten additional 
insurance products.
The Group has grown its additional services revenues in 
underwritten additional insurance products, instalment income 
and policy administration fees which are primarily linked to 
the Group’s in-force policy growth.

intangible assets has reduced 17.3% to £4.3m. 
Taxation
The Group’s tax expense was £25.2m compared with 
£27.4m in 2012. The decrease in the Group’s tax expense was 
largely due to a reduction in the UK Corporation Tax rate from 
24.0% to 23.0% with e ﬀ ect from 1 April 2013; and a prior 
year tax beneﬁ t relating to the treatment of costs incurred 
in 2012 in respect of the Group’s Admission.
The Group incurred an e ﬀ ective tax rate of 21.3% (2012: 
23.7%).
Pro forma earnings per share 
Pro forma earnings per share increased 5.8% to 22.4 pence 
per share. This is in line with the growth in proﬁ t a  er tax.
Dividend per share
The Board has proposed a ﬁ nal dividend of 13.3 pence 
per share. The full year dividend of 15.8 pence per share 
represents an annualised pro forma payout ratio of 85%. 
The full year annualised pro forma dividend comprises a base 
dividend of 50% and a special dividend of 35% of post tax 
proﬁ ts. The annualised pro forma payout ratio has been 
grossed up to reﬂ ect the fact the Group has not been Listed 
for a full year and as such the dividend pence per share 
represents 5/6ths of the full year dividend that would have 
been paid had the Group been Listed for the full year. 
The full year dividend comprises a base dividend of 9.3 pence 
per share and a special dividend of 6.5 pence per share. 
The special dividend has been set with reference to the 
Group’s capital resource requirements, prospective premium 
growth expectations and a prudent margin for contingencies.
The ex-dividend date is 9 April 2014, the record date is 
11 April 2014 and the payment date is 23 May 2014.
Return on capital employed
The Group has delivered a high return on capital employed of 
37.7% (2012: 37.0%) reﬂ ecting its strong, resilient ﬁ nancial 
result and e ﬃ  cient capital base.
Financial Position
The Group has a strong ﬁ nancial position with no debt, robust 
reserves, a conservative investment portfolio and capital 
signiﬁ cantly in excess of the minimum regulatory requirement.
Investments and cash
The Group deploys a conservative investment strategy with the 
primary objective of capital preservation.

Financial review continued
Reserving
The Group holds claims reserves, to cover the future cost of 
settling claims that have occurred prior to and at the balance 
sheet date, whether already known to the Group or not yet 
reported, net of associated reinsurance recoveries.
The ultimate costs and expenses of the claims for which 
these reserves are held are subject to a number of material 
uncertainties. As time passes between the reporting of a claim 
and the ﬁ nal settlement of the claim, circumstances can 
change that may require established reserves to be adjusted 
either upwards or downwards. Factors such as changes in the 
legal environment, results of litigation, propensity of personal 
injury claims, changes in medical and care costs, and costs of 
vehicle and home repairs can all substantially impact overall 
costs and expenses of claims, and cause a material divergence 
from the bases and assumptions on which the reserves were 
calculated. These factors can cause actual developments to 
vary materially from the projections and assumptions on which 
the Group’s technical reserves were calculated.
Given this uncertainty, the Group looks to maintain a 
consistent and prudent reserving philosophy and the Group 
has always established its Claims Outstanding Reserves and 
Incurred But Not Reported (“IBNR”) Reserves at a prudent level 
in excess of the ‘best estimate’ level determined through 
standard actuarial techniques. 
This prudent approach to reserving has meant that the Group 
has historically experienced favourable development in its 
claims reserves over time as claims have ultimately settled 
at a lower cost than initially calculated for the purposes of 
its booked Claims Outstanding Reserves and IBNR Reserves. 
This prudent approach can be evidenced by the gross and 
net claims development triangles that are shown in Note 19 
to the ﬁ nancial statements. The triangles illustrate, that for 
all accident years, the latest booked loss ratio is lower than 
the initial booked loss ratio. In 2013, the total release from 
prior accident year reserves was £82.4m (2012: £68.9m) 
representing 16.8% of net earned premiums (2012: 14.3%). 
The amount of the Group’s Claims Outstanding Reserves 
and IBNR Reserves, net of outward reinsurance, salvage and 
subrogation, together with the related reserve in respect of 
the requirement for claims handling expenses, is comfortably 
in excess of the actuarial best estimate.
Reinsurance 
The Group purchases reinsurance as a risk transfer mechanism 
to mitigate risks that are outside the Group’s appetite for 
individual claim or event exposure and to reduce the volatility 
caused by large individual and accumulation losses. By doing 
so, the Group protects its capital and the underwriting result of 
both Motor and Home.
Currently the Group has in place non-proportional excess 
of loss reinsurance programmes for its Motor and Home 
underwriting activities. The purpose of these programmes is to 
provide cover for both individual large losses, for Motor and 
Home, and accumulation losses arising from natural and other 
catastrophe events for Home. Motor reinsurance treaties are in 
place covering all years in which the Group has underwritten 
Motor policies. At the present time the Group has no quota 
share reinsurance or co-insurance arrangements in place.
The Group’s reinsurance programmes are reviewed on an 
annual basis and capital modelling is used to identify the most 
appropriate structure and risk retention proﬁ le, taking into 
account the Group’s business objective of minimising volatility 
and, the prevailing cost and the availability of reinsurance in 
the market.

investments of £38.0m and raised £50.0m in proceeds from 
Admission in 2013. These signiﬁ cant cash inﬂ ows, in addition

Capital
Capital management
The Group maintains a capital structure consistent with the 
Group’s risk proﬁ le and the regulatory and market 
requirements of its business.
The Group’s objectives in managing capital are:
• To match the proﬁ le of its assets and liabilities, taking 
account of the risks inherent in the business;
• To maintain ﬁ nancial strength to support business growth;
• To satisfy the requirements of its policyholders and 
regulators; and
• To retain ﬁ nancial ﬂ exibility by maintaining strong liquidity 
and access to a range of capital markets.
The Group manages, as capital, all items that are eligible to be 
treated as capital for regulatory purposes. This includes equity, 
allowing for regulatory adjustments and mark to model based 
valuation of the Group’s interest in Gocompare. Following the 
repayment of the Perpetual Subordinated Loan Notes in March 
2013, none of the Group’s capital is in the form of debt.  esure Group Annual Report 2013

Economic capital
In addition to Group capital requirements established under 
the IGD, the solo insurance company, esure Insurance Limited, 
is also subject to Individual Capital Guidance (“ICG”) set by the 
Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”). The guidance is set 
by the PRA on a periodic basis following the submission of 
a risk-based Individual Capital Assessment (“ICA”). The ICA, 
and thus ICG, are typically greater than the IGD and it is with 
reference to these that the Group determines its economic 
capital requirements. 
This approach indicates that the economic capital requirement 
for the Group, inclusive of an appropriate bu ﬀ er, is currently 
broadly equivalent to 40% of net written premiums.

* The adjusted 2012 position assumes that the capital transactions

on 31 December 2012. 
The Group undertook a number of capital actions, in 
anticipation of Admission to the London Stock Exchange, 
to restructure the capital base and thereby improve 
capital e ﬃ  ciency.
On 21 February 2013, the capital of the Company was reduced 
by the cancellation of 4,000,000,000 Non-Voting Old Ordinary 
Shares of £0.01 each and £40.0m cash was paid out of existing 
ﬁ nancial resources.
On 25 February 2013, each A, B and C Ordinary Share was 
subdivided into 12 shares of the same class. Immediately 
prior to Admission, these 399,600,000 shares of 
1
⁄ 12 pence, 
were converted into a single class of ordinary shares. 
On Admission, the Group repurchased the remaining 
4,485,014,000 Non-Voting Old Ordinary Shares of £0.01 
each at par (amounting, in total, to £44.85m) and the 1,000 
Redeemable Priority Return Shares of £0.01 each. A capital 
redemption reserve was created for the £44.85m share 
repurchase.
The Group also issued 17,241,380 new shares with a nominal 
value of 
1
⁄ 12 pence each on 27 March 2013 for £50.0 million, 
with associated transaction costs of £6.0m debited directly 
to share premium. The £50.0m of proceeds were used 
to repay the Perpetual Subordinated Loan Notes following 
Admission and the Group continues to remain debt free.
Solvency II
Solvency II is scheduled for implementation on 1 January 
2016, following the agreement on Omnibus II. However, there 
are remaining uncertainties around some speciﬁ c details and 
the phasing of the implementation. The Group is focused on 
developing its business processes to reﬂ ect and further embed 
the known Solvency II requirements. These include evolution 
of the governance and framework for risk management 
and development of the internal and external reporting 
requirements – in particular, the FLAOR (Forward Looking 
Assessment of Own Risks) based on the ORSA principles (Own 
Risk and Solvency Assessment). The Group is also enhancing 
its Internal Economic Capital Model to support its business 
and strategic decisions, including assessment of the regulatory 
and business capital requirements. In addition, the Group will 
continue to calculate its likely capital requirements using the 
Solvency II standard formula approach.

Risk management and principal risks
Risk
management
The Board is responsible for prudent oversight of the Group’s 
business and ﬁ nancial operations, ensuring that they are 
conducted in accordance with sound business principles 
and with applicable law and regulation. This encompasses 
a responsibility to articulate and monitor adherence to 
quantiﬁ able and measurable statements of the Board’s 
appetite for exposure to all risk types. The Board also has 
oversight to ensure that measures are in place to provide 
independent and objective assurance on the e ﬀ ective 
identiﬁ cation and management of risk and on the e ﬀ ectiveness 
of the controls in place to mitigate those risks.
In order to set boundaries to the acceptance of risk exposures, 
the Board has set out the following Strategic Risk Objectives 
that underpin our risk appetite and how the Group operates:
Shareholders Earnings Our goal is to manage volatility within a cyclical market for our shareholders 
through targeted growth opportunities, continuous adaptation in our 
underwriting and a focus on expense management.
Customers Capital and Liquidity We ensure there are appropriate ﬁ nancial resources in place to deliver on 
our corporate and policyholder obligations.
Reputation Our brands represent our promise to our customers and are central to our 
continued success.
Conduct How we treat our customers is at the core of everything we do and, through 
our strategy, culture and service delivery, we aim to deliver fair outcomes 
for them.
Culture People Our people are what makes us a success and we aim to continue to invest in 
our employees and make the Group a rewarding place to work.
The Board has set a robust risk management strategy and 
framework as an integral element in its pursuit of business 
objectives and in the fulﬁ lment of its obligations to all 
stakeholders – policyholders, shareholders, regulators, 
customers and sta ﬀ .
The Group’s risk management framework is proportionate to 
the risks that we face and organised around the core elements 
of Risk Strategy and Appetite, Risk Governance, and the 
associated Risk Reporting.
The Group’s risk management framework is dynamic and 
continues to be enhanced and developed to ensure it meets 
the needs of the Group.
“ Our strategic risk objectives are 
focused on delivering long-term 
returns for our shareholders and 
ensuring that our customers 
have a positive experience 
with esure Group – we see these 
as complementary objectives.”

Risk Strategy and Appetite
The Group’s Risk Appetite incorporates a range of quantitative 
and qualitative measures of risk supporting our Strategic Risk 
Objectives, against which the actual or planned exposures and 
uncertainties can be monitored. This monitoring is reﬂ ected 
in regular reporting to the Executive Risk Committee and the 
Board Risk Committee.
The Risk Appetite forms a fundamental part of the way we 
think about and assess risk, setting out the types and level of 
risk that we are looking to accept or avoid in the pursuit of our 
strategy. These are considered within our strategic decisions 
and business planning but also form a critical element in the 
way that we think about risk within the Business. This ensures 
that our sta ﬀ  understand how their day-to-day decisions 
support the Risk Appetite and Strategic Risk Objectives 
through our business risk dashboard. This feedback loop 
ensures that our Risk Appetite is cascaded and embedded 
within the Group.
Risk reporting
The risk management framework is designed to ensure that 
the Risk Committee receive timely and appropriate reporting 
on our exposure to existing and emerging risks in each of the 
core risk categories – insurance, market, counterparty credit, 
operational, regulatory and liquidity. Strategic risks and 
the reputational consequences of these risk exposures 
are considered within this risk reporting.
Such reporting is supported by: 
• Updates to the Group’s risk registers covering current and 
emerging risks; 
• Reports on events that have resulted in actual or potential 
ﬁ nancial or reputational losses to the Group or its customers; 
and 
• The results of stress, scenario and sensitivity testing and the 
ﬁ ndings, recommendations and management actions arising 
from reviews conducted by the compliance and internal 
audit functions.

A key strength of the Group’s risk management strategy is the 
integration of risk assessment and evaluation into the Group’s 
business planning and capital management processes.
Risk governance
The Board ensures that measures are in place to provide 
independent and objective assurance on the identiﬁ cation and 
management of risk and on the e ﬀ ectiveness of the processes 
and controls in place to mitigate those risks. To achieve this 
objective, and in accordance with recognised good practice, 
the Group operates a ‘three lines of defence’ governance 
framework. This is set out below:
The Group’s risk governance is underpinned by a risk 
management function headed by the Chief Risk O ﬃ  cer, a 
member of the Executive team reporting to the CEO, but 
with independence assured through direct and independent 
access to the Chairmen of the Audit Committee and the 
Risk Committee.
The Risk Strategy, Appetite and framework are articulated in a 
suite of policies covering material risks that we face. Each of 
these policies is subject to annual review and approval.

Principal risks
The Directors consider that the material risks and 
uncertainties facing the Group are as follows:
Insurance Risk
Risk
Underwriting risk from pricing 
strategy – the risk of an 
inappropriate pricing strategy could 
lead to business being written at 
uneconomic rates and result in 
lower than expected proﬁ tability. 
This includes the risk of an inaccurate 
pricing approach following the 
gender pricing changes, the 
LASPO Reforms and the rating 
and competitive landscape.
Impact
If these changes, and the Group’s general pricing 
strategy, are not managed correctly, it could result 
in an unintended change in the Group’s risk proﬁ le, 
market share and loss ratio.
Mitigation and management
The Group continues to monitor developments through 
regular sensitivity testing of the key variables a ﬀ ecting 
loss performance, including loss ratios, risk mix, pricing, 
quote conversion and renewal retention ratios, claims 
costs, claims frequency and the adequacy of reserves.
Action regarding these risks is taken in an integrated 
approach between the executive team, underwriting, 
claims and risk management.
There is strong and regular monitoring in place to 
understand and react to the changing market rating 
environment, ensuring that we are well placed to 
beneﬁ t from these movements.
Risk
Underwriting risk from claims 
costs – the risk that a material 
increase in claims costs could 
negatively impact the Group’s 
ﬁ nancial performance. This includes 
risks arising from adverse claims 
litigation outcomes, increases in 
frequency of Periodic Payment 
Orders (“PPOs”) and potential 
changes to the Ogden discount rate.
Impact
An unplanned deterioration in the loss ratio, arising 
from inﬂ ation in claims costs beyond planned and 
achievable increases in premiums.
Mitigation and management
Loss ratio risk is managed through a robust claims 
management process and regular monitoring and 
sensitivity testing of the key variables a ﬀ ecting loss 
performance, including; risk mix, pricing relative to the 
market, quote conversion and renewal retention ratios, 
claims costs, claims frequency and the adequacy 
of reserves.
Risk
Reserving risk – the risk that 
insuﬃ  cient funds have been set 
aside to settle and handle claims 
as the amounts fall due.
Impact
Adverse development in prior year reserves resulting 
in deterioration of ﬁ nancial performance.
Mitigation and management
We have a prudent approach to reserving risk – the 
Group’s actuarial function analyses and projects 
historical claims development data and uses a number 
of actuarial techniques to both test and forecast claims 
provisions. In addition, the Group also provides data 
to independent external actuaries who assess the 
adequacy of the Group’s claims provisions.
Apart from historical analyses, the Group also takes 
into account changes in risk proﬁ le and underwriting 
policy conditions, changes in legislation or regulation 
and changes in other external factors (including 
assumptions on PPOs) and potential changes to 
the Ogden discount rate.
Financial Risk
Risk
Financial risk – the risk that 
inaccurate ﬁ nancial estimates or 
judgements, could misrepresent 
our ﬁ nancial position and change 
key strategic decisions.
Impact
The preparation of ﬁ nancial information requires 
management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions. Actual results may di ﬀ er from these 
estimates, which could impact key business decisions.
Mitigation and management
The Group reviews ﬁ nancial estimates and underlying 
assumptions on an ongoing basis taking into account 
changes in underwriting conditions, changes in 
legislation or regulation, and market movements. 
In addition, independent external actuaries assess the 
adequacy of the Group’s technical provisions. 
Ultimately, the oversight of the Group’s ﬁ nancial 
estimates and judgements resides with the 
Audit Committee. esure Group Annual Report 2013
28
Market Risk
Risk
Market risk from investment 
activity – the risk that a negative 
ﬁ nancial impact arises from holdings 
in interest rate, currency and 
equity products, all of which are 
exposed to general and speciﬁ c 
market movements.
Impact
Changes in UK interest rates or investment markets 
impact the return on and market valuation of the 
Group’s investment portfolio.
Mitigation and management
Our investment strategy does not expose the Group 
to material currency risk or the risks arising from 
active trading of derivatives. Market risk is managed 
through regular monitoring – including the drivers 
of investment return and value at risk measures, 
counterparty exposures and interest rate sensitivities.
Risk 
Default risk from investment 
counterparty – the risk that an 
investment counterparty will not be 
able to pay amounts in full when 
due in accordance with the term of 
the contract, causing the Group to 
incur a ﬁ nancial loss.
Impact
Defaults from investment counterparties impact both 
the income from, and market valuation of, the Group’s 
investment portfolio.
Mitigation and management
The Group manages the level of investment 
counterparty credit risk it accepts by placing limits 
on its exposure to a single counterparty or groups of 
counterparties, and on geographical counterparties 
and geographical segments. Such risks are subject to 
regular review within the Investment Committee.
At 31 December 2013, the Group had no direct 
exposure to peripheral Eurozone countries 
sovereign debt.
Counterparty Credit Risk
Risk
Credit risk from reinsurance 
counterparty – The largest 
counterparty credit risk we are 
exposed to relates to reinsurers; 
this risk arises if they are not able 
to pay amounts in full when due in 
accordance with the terms of the 
contract, causing the Group to 
incur a ﬁ nancial loss.
Impact
Reinsurance counterparty defaults reduce the 
protection provided through our prudent reinsurance 
structure; this will have a direct impact on the 
reinsurance asset and earnings in the year of default. 
In addition, the reduction in the level of reinsurance 
due to the default may increase the volatility in 
earnings in subsequent years.
Mitigation and management
The creditworthiness of reinsurers is managed on an 
annual basis by reviewing their ﬁ nancial strength prior 
to ﬁ nalisation of any contract. In addition, management 
assesses the creditworthiness of all reinsurers by 
reviewing credit grades provided by rating agencies 
and other publicly available information. An analysis 
of reinsurers by Standard & Poor’s (S&P) and AM Best 
ratings is produced and reviewed on a monthly basis.
Conduct Risk
Risk
Regulatory or legal intervention or 
changes – the risk that other legal 
or regulatory reforms impacting 
premium rates, ASR and claims costs 
across the market, could negatively 
impact the Group’s ﬁ nancial position.
Impact
There are a number of ongoing and future reviews 
from the FCA regarding the general insurance retail 
sector. There is speciﬁ c focus on the sales and renewal 
process, incentives for sales sta ﬀ  and the sale of 
additional insurance products that complement the 
core products being sold. These reviews could have an 
impact on the revenue streams that we currently have 
in place or future revenue streams. 
The outcome of an investigation by the Competition 
Commission into certain aspects of the UK private 
Motor insurance market, may lead to market reforms 
that aﬀ ect the way the Group sells or prices Motor 
insurance products or manages the payment or 
receipt of fees generated from the appointment of 
service providers used during the claims process.
Mitigation and management
The Group continues to monitor legal and regulatory 
developments in the UK and Europe, through our close 
relationship with our regulators and other o ﬃ  cial 
bodies (e.g. FCA, PRA and the Competition Commission) 
and the use of proactive risk management tools and 
processes to mitigate our exposure to regulatory risk.
There is continued focus on the evolution of additional 
insurance products and how we sell these products 
with the customer in mind. The roll out of the ‘Just In 
Case’ product shows our innovation within this area .

Liquidity Risk
Risk
Liquidity risk – the risk that the 
Group, although solvent, does not 
have available su ﬃ  cient ﬁ nancial 
resources to enable it to meet its 
obligations as they fall due or can 
only secure them at excessive cost.
Impact 
A reduction in liquidity could have an impact on 
our ability to meet our ﬁ nancial commitments as 
they fall due or restrict our ability to pay dividends 
to shareholders.
Mitigation and management
The Group continues to monitor its liquidity risk by 
considering the Group’s operating cash ﬂ ows; stressed 
for catastrophe scenarios, dividend payouts, liquidity 
strains and investment strategy to mitigate this risk. 
In addition, the Group considers the matching of the 
Investment Portfolio with its insurance liabilities to 
mitigate and manage this risk.
In addition to monitoring cash ﬂ ows, the matching of 
the duration of assets and liabilities is also monitored 
within the Investment Committee.
Oversight of the Group’s investment strategy and 
the associated liquidity risk is undertaken by the 
Investment Committee.

there is an increase in losses 
through crime.
Impact
Increased exposure to actual or attempted ﬁ nancial 
crime activity could result in ﬁ nancial loss, reputational 
impact or regulatory intervention.
Mitigation and management
A range of preventative, monitoring and detective 
controls are in place to combat such fraudulent activity 
at the key points of entry – policy inception and claims.
The monitoring and mitigation of ﬁ nancial crime 
is managed by the Group’s ﬁ nancial crime team 
supported by the rest of the Business.
Risk
Data Security – the risk of 
compromise to the integrity, 
conﬁ dentiality or availability 
of customer or sta ﬀ  personal 
information, or of commercially 
sensitive information.
Impact
This could have a detrimental impact on our customers 
or staﬀ , on the reputation of the Group, or on our 
proﬁ tability and share price. There is also the potential 
for regulatory intervention or ﬁ nes resulting from such 
a compromise.
Mitigation and management
The Group has robust systems in place to mitigate 
such risks, including; perimeter ﬁ rewalls and intrusion 
detection systems, anti-virus protection, laptop 
encryption, logical and physical access restrictions, 
rigorous vetting of new and existing sta ﬀ  and a clear 
desk policy. These controls are rigorously enforced 
within the Group.
Risk
Systems failure – the risk that the 
current systems fail to deliver the 
expected performance.
Impact 
The failure or degradation of our key platforms 
(including websites from which the majority of new 
business is sourced), compromise of corporate data 
or, in particular, the personal data with which we are 
entrusted and material performance failures by key 
infrastructure suppliers.
Mitigation and management
The Group has systems monitoring and incidence 
management processes in place to mitigate this risk. 
A key element to the prevention of this risk is a robust 
change management programme which is subject 
to rigorous project management disciplines from 
programme development through to deployment.
The Group has a Reportable Events process which 
reports and manages any systems failure, which is 
reported to the Board Risk Committee. esure Group Annual Report 2013

Corporate 
responsibility 
In 2013, we became a proud 
sponsor of Macmillan Cancer 
Support.
Corporate responsibility
The Group is a major UK insurer with nearly 2 million 
customers who are served by a workforce of around 1,600 
people based in three o ﬃ  ces, in Glasgow, Manchester 
and Reigate. We are committed to corporate and social 
responsibility in four key areas:
• Our people;
• Community and issues engagement;
• Charitable involvement; and
• Our impact on the environment.
Our people
We value and reward our sta ﬀ . They are our primary asset. 
Our service to our customers rests in their hands and is 
improved when they are engaged and motivated. This starts 
with our recruitment approach and the environment, rewards, 
training, policies and the engagement we o ﬀ er to make 
esure Group a great place to work. 
Our approach to equality and diversity, set out on Page 60 
of this report in the Employees section, is central to our 
Business. All staﬀ  inductions include equality and diversity 
training with each new starter signing our Equality and 
Diversity policy (100% compliance in 2013). We seek the 
same standards from our human resource suppliers and 
outsourced service providers. Every employee also receives 
refresher training and accreditation when signing our Code of 
Conduct annually. 
We recognise and reward our employees with a wide range of 
beneﬁ ts and initiatives that include: a performance and Group 
award scheme for management, a Proﬁ t Share scheme for all 
other eligible staﬀ , a Sharesave scheme, Childcare Vouchers, 
subsidised Cafes, interest-free season ticket loans, ﬂ exible 
working practices, long service awards for sta ﬀ  and dress-
down days for charities. 
Communication is also at the heart of our engagement. 
Stuart Vann, our CEO, along with other members of the 
executive team, carry out face-to-face sta ﬀ  brieﬁ ngs and 
‘Q&A’ sessions at least twice a year, plus other Q&A lunches 
in-between. The Group maintains an intranet news system to 
keep sta ﬀ  informed, providing access to all its policies and 
key documentation.  esure Group Annual Report 2013

Governance
Financial Statements
Human rights 
The Group resides and o ﬀ ers its products only within 
mainland UK. We are subject to both the European 
Convention on Human Rights and the UK Human Rights 
Act 1998. We respect all human rights and enact these 
particularly in relation to fair treatment, the avoidance of 
discrimination and privacy for our customers, suppliers 
and staﬀ . We aim to ensure that employees comply with 
all relevant UK legislation and regulations; and this is 
underpinned by the policies in place and managed by 
our Human Resources function. 
Community and issues engagement
The Group encourages sta ﬀ  to nominate local causes as 
beneﬁ ciaries of sta ﬀ  fundraising and engagement activities. 
This local engagement dovetails with our work with charities 
such as BRAKE and Road Peace, and organisations such as 
the Parliamentary Advisory Committee for Transport Safety 
and Thatcham so that we can engage directly with those 
promoting values congruent with our Business. 
Linking with our charitable involvement below, one of our key 
areas of community and issue engagement is our support for 
the ‘Safe Drive, Stay Alive’ campaign, launched by Surrey Fire 
and Rescue to educate and engage novice and new drivers in 
schools based around our Reigate o ﬃ  ce. We were founding 
sponsors of this initiative eight years ago and are proud of 
its achievements, which have now been replicated in other 
regions around Britain. 
Charitable involvement
During 2013, our primary charitable giving and engagement 
involved our new partnership with Macmillan Cancer Support. 
We became the proud, founding sponsor of their ‘Night In’ 
fundraising initiative that persuades donors to turn an 
expensive night out into an equally engaging and fun night 
in, and then donate the di ﬀ erence in cost to a cause that 
provides crucial help to tens of thousands of people a ﬀ ected 
by cancer each year.
Through our Sheilas’ Wheels brand, we worked closely 
with Macmillan to make this event a notable new initiative 
in the annual calendar of charitable events. ‘Night In’ has 
congruence with our brand and it generated strong support 
among the Group’s sta ﬀ . We raised money to supplement 
our giving and also encouraged our customers to join with 
Macmillan to raise funds. Cancer a ﬀ ects one in two people 
in Britain during their lives and Macmillan Cancer Support 
is there to provide services following diagnosis when many 
people feel lost and confused.
In 2014, we are delighted to have secured the chance to 
continue this relationship. 
In addition, we support local charities and initiatives that 
can positively impact the lives of those who live in our 
communities. Fundraising initiatives in all of our o ﬃ  ces 
focus on causes that are nominated by our sta ﬀ  so that 
their e ﬀ orts are realised locally. 
 
Our impact on the environment
General insurance is an environmentally-light ﬁ nancial 
services product; but extended areas of our Business and 
fulﬁ lment can adversely a ﬀ ect the environment; and we seek 
to limit these. We work to minimise the environmental impact 
of our buildings, sourcing all electricity from renewable 
sources, and invest in our systems – such as auto-shutdown 
facilities and our new, e ﬃ  cient thin-client desktop 
environment - to ensure these buildings run e ﬃ  ciently. 
We are working towards paper reduction in our o ﬃ  ces and 
for our customers. At work, we have increased the use of 
electronic documentation and teleconferencing. Every ﬂ oor 
of each esure Group building features recycling bins and our 
o ﬃ  ce waste is separated into recycling streams. 
The absolute carbon footprint of the Group in terms of 
emissions was 3,574 tCO
2
e. Our chosen metric is tonnes of 
CO
2 
emissions per £m of turnover; and in 2013, we were 
measured with a creditable 6.23 tCO
2
 per million pounds. 
We will continue to monitor environmental metrics by o ﬃ  ce 
and activity, recording and reporting on these each year, 
while complying with environmental legislation and 
relevant environmental, energy and pollution reduction 
or prevention regulations.
One of the largest environmental impacts of the Group is 
the despatch of insurance documents to our customers. 
We embarked on a major programme of IT work in 2013 
to progressively migrate our provision of paper policies, 
booklets and schedules to e-channels, so that we print and 
post signiﬁ cantly less. 
We beat our targets for customer migration during the year 
by over 15%, saving 130 tonnes of printed materials. This 
use of emailed documents reduced our postage costs with 
commensurate reductions in the associated environmental 
impact of postal delivery. This initiative will expand further 
in 2014.
Through our approved repairers we undertake many 
thousands of repairs each year for customers. We have 
mandated compliance with PAS125 for all our approved 
repairers providing quality guarantees for our customers, 
but also setting safety standards for the qualiﬁ ed sta ﬀ  who 
conduct repairs.
Summary
Overall, we are proud of our achievements. There is more 
we can do in each aspect of our Corporate and Social 
Responsibility. Now, as a plc, we will work towards 
improvements in every aspect of our business, employment, 
charitable giving, community involvement and environmental 
impact reduction and report our progress each year. 
This section, together with the reports set out on pages 1 
to 29 of the Annual Report constitute the Strategic Report.

Chairman’s letter
Dear Shareholder
On 27 March 2013, the Group passed a signiﬁ cant milestone 
in its 14 year history with a successful listing on the London 
Stock Exchange. Becoming a public limited company was a 
natural step for a company of our size, inﬂ uence and ambition. 
Furthermore, it enabled the Group to enter the market free of 
debt and well-placed to deliver for its shareholders. 
I would therefore like to welcome you to our ﬁ rst corporate 
governance report as a public limited company and stress our 
commitment to the high standards of corporate governance 
that underpin our sound framework for the control and 
management of our Business. 
As a major UK general insurer, the Group has, since 2000, 
been regulated, most recently by the Financial Conduct 
Authority (“FCA”) and the Prudential Regulation Authority 
(“PRA”). We are, therefore, familiar and comfortable with the 
corporate governance practices and principles expected of 
a listed company as many have been long established in 
the Business. 
The Group also complies fully with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and the corporate governance requirements 
of the Companies Act 2006 and Financial Services and 
Markets Act 2000 (“FSMA”) (and regulations made thereunder) 
applicable to it as a result of its insurance and insurance 
mediation businesses.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all my colleagues, 
suppliers, partners and stakeholders on behalf of the Board 
for their commitment and hard work throughout the year. 
Our people are central to our ongoing success. We continue 
to invest in their training and development, and in their 
environment and well-being to make the Group a great 
place to work.
As part of our succession planning, and as previously 
announced, Andrew Whitehouse stepped down as an 
Executive Director of the Company in February 2013. 
Andrew remained a member of the Executive Committee 
until his retirement from the Group in November 2013. 
David Calder and Charles Schrager von Altishofen resigned 
as Non-Executive Directors upon our Admission on 27 March 
2013. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of 
them for their support over the years.
In order to facilitate the transition of the Board post IPO, it 
remains important to retain both Peter Ward and Anthony 
Hobson as Non-Executive Directors owing to their extensive 
experience and detailed knowledge of the Business.
I am very pleased to report that during 2013 we appointed 
three new Directors. On 10 June, Mike Evans was appointed 
as a Non-Executive Director; he is a member of the Audit, 
Remuneration and Risk Committees. On 31 July, we appointed 
Shirley Garrood as a Non-Executive Director; she is a member 
of the Audit, Remuneration and Investment Committees; and 
on 9 December we appointed María Dolores Dancausa as 
a Non-Executive Director. As you will see from our Annual 
Report, these additions give the Board impressive breadth 
and depth.

Our governance structure
Following the appointments of Shirley Garrood and María 
Dolores Dancausa, the percentage of women on the Board 
has increased to 40% this year. This compares extremely 
favourably with our peers in the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 
indices of companies. We remain committed to advocating 
diversity and equality at the top of our organisation while 
continuing to make appointments based on objective criteria 
to ensure we appoint the best individuals with diverse 
experience and backgrounds for the role. We will continue 
to ensure such considerations remain a focus when making 
any new appointments to the Board in future.
Peter Wood
Chairman
We are ﬁ rmly committed to high standards of corporate 
governance and maintaining a sound framework for the 
control and management of the Business. The Group has 
been subject to the UK Corporate Governance Code from 
its date of Admission on 27 March 2013. However, in 
anticipation of Listing, the Board adopted a number of 
measures with regard to its governance arrangements in 
order to be in a position to comply with the principles and 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code from 
that date. Throughout the period from 27 March 2013 to 
31 December 2013, the Group has been in compliance 
with the principles and provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.

Leadership
The Board is responsible for leading and controlling the Group 
and has overall authority for the management and conduct of 
the Group’s business, strategy and development. The Board 
is also responsible for ensuring the maintenance of a sound 
system of internal control and risk management (including: 
ﬁ nancial, operational and compliance controls, and for 
reviewing the overall eﬀ ectiveness of systems in place), and 
for the approval of any changes to the capital, corporate and 
management structure of the Group.
To assist the Board in carrying out its functions and to ensure 
there is independent oversight of internal control and risk 
management, the Board has delegated certain responsibilities 
to Board committees, which, except for the Investment 
Committee and the Nomination Committee, are comprised 
of Independent Non-Executive Directors. The Nomination 
Committee is comprised of a majority of Independent 
Non-Executive Directors. The Chairman of each Board 
committee reports to the Board on the matters discussed 
at Board committee meetings. Each Board committee has 
agreed Terms of Reference approved by the Board.
The full schedule of matters reserved for the Board’s 
decision along with the Terms of Reference of the 
Board’s key committees is available to view online at 
www.esuregroup.com/investors 
Board Meetings
The Board holds regular scheduled meetings throughout the 
year. A er Listing on 27 March 2013, four scheduled Board 
meetings were held. Prior to Listing, six Board meetings were 
held. In future, there will be seven scheduled Board meetings 
held each year, plus an annual strategy meeting. 
When necessary, we hold additional Board meetings, and in 
2013, we held two additional meetings primarily to discuss our 
IPO. If unable to attend a meeting, Directors are encouraged to 
give their views and comments on matters to be discussed to 
the Chairman in advance. Meeting attendance by each of the 
Directors is shown opposite.
At each meeting, the CEO and CFO reported on operational 
and ﬁ nancial performance. Reports were also provided on 
the activities of the Board’s Audit, Nomination, Investment, 
Risk and Remuneration Committees by the Chairman of 
each committee.

Diversity
esure Group is strongly committed to the merits of diversity at 
Board level and throughout the Business. We are committed 
to carrying out candidate searches across the widest possible 
pool of talent against a set of objective criteria based on merit; 
but with due regard to the beneﬁ ts of diversity, including 
gender. Currently 40% of the Board is female.
Our Executive Committee has two women on a committee 
of 11 members (19%). Of our senior managers, 27.7% are 
female; this increases to 39.3% for managers. Our overall 
percentage of female staﬀ  is 51.3%.
We shall continue to develop the potential of women 
throughout the corporate pipeline. Governance

Strategic Report
Financial Statements
The roles of the Chairman and the CEO are separate with 
responsibilities clearly divided.
The Chairman and the CEO meet regularly and keep in 
close contact as they are a critical link between the Board 
and senior management. They also liaise on strategic and 
other issues.
The Chairman is responsible for the leadership of the 
Board and ensuring its eﬀ ectiveness in all aspects of its 
role. He is also Chairman of the Nomination Committee.
The CEO is responsible for the performance and 
management of the Group’s Business. In addition to 
membership of the Board, the CEO leads the Executive 
Committee, the Group’s most senior operational body, 
charged with recommending and then implementing the 
Board’s strategy.
The Non-Executive Directors bring a very broad level of 
experience and independent judgement to the Board and 
make a valuable contribution to achieving our objectives. 
They provide a strong independent element on the Board 
and are well placed to challenge constructively and help 
develop proposals on strategy.
Dame Helen Alexander is the Deputy Chairman and also the 
Senior Independent Director.
Company Secretary
The Company Secretary provides administrative and 
logistical support to the Board. Advice and support are also 
given on governance, compliance and regulatory matters. 
The Company Secretary is available to advise all Directors 
and ensure that Board procedures are complied with. 
The Directors may also seek independent professional 
advice at the Company’s expense. No such advice was 
sought during the year.
Directors’ external activities and conﬂ icts of interest
Directors have a statutory duty to avoid situations in which 
they have or may have interests that conﬂ ict with those of the 
Company, unless that conﬂ ict is ﬁ rst authorised by the Board. 
This includes potential conﬂ icts that may arise when a Director 
takes up a position with another company. The Company’s 
Articles of Association allow the Board to authorise such 
potential conﬂ icts; and there is, in place, a procedure to deal 
with any actual or potential conﬂ ict of interest. The Board 
deals with each appointment on its individual merit and takes 
into consideration all the circumstances. Prior to taking on 
additional responsibilities or external appointments, Directors 
are obliged to obtain authorisation from the Chairman and it 
is their responsibility to ensure that they will be able to meet 
the time commitment expected of them in their role at esure 
Group. All potential conﬂ icts approved by the Board are 
recorded in an Interests Register, which is reviewed on an 
annual basis by the Board to ensure that the procedure is 
working eﬀ ectively. 
Executive Directors may take up only one FTSE 100 non-
executive directorship and are allowed to retain any fees 
they receive for such appointments. Stuart Vann and Darren 
Ogden do not hold any such directorships.
Executive Committee
The CEO and CFO are complemented by a strong and 
experienced senior management team comprising nine 
executives with an average of 20 years’ experience in the 
insurance industry.

The Board comprises ten members: the Chairman, two

The Chairman, Peter Wood, has served in this role since 2000 
and, on appointment, was not independent. Of the seven 
Non-Executive Directors:
• Dame Helen Alexander, Mike Evans, Shirley Garrood, Anne 
Richards and María Dolores Dancausa are considered by 
the Board to be independent for the purposes of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code; and
• Anthony Hobson and Peter Ward have served on the 
Board for more than nine years from the date of their 
respective ﬁ rst elections, but are considered by the 
Board to be independent for the purposes of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code notwithstanding the length 
of their service.
In reaching these conclusions regarding the independence 
of Anthony Hobson and Peter Ward, the Board has:
• Considered the requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and the nature of the relationships and 
circumstances outlined above which are relevant to the 
Board’s determination of independence; and
• Evaluated the historic contribution of these Directors to 
the Group in scrutinising the performance of management, 
monitoring the reporting of performance and constructively 
challenging and assisting the development of the Group’s 
proposals on strategy.
In addition to the assessment of independence pursuant to 
the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board also believes 
that the ongoing involvement of Anthony Hobson and Peter 
Ward as Non-Executive Directors (and their fulﬁ lling roles 
recommended for independent non-executives by the UK 
Corporate Governance Code) is in the best interests of the 
Group and shareholders bearing in mind their extensive 
experience of, and detailed knowledge of, the Business.
The Company therefore considers that it complies with the 
relevant requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
in relation to the balance of Executive and independent 
Non-Executive Directors on the Board and with the 
requirements for composition of the Group’s Audit Committee, 
Remuneration Committee and Nomination Committee.
Directors election and re-election
Shirley Garrood, Mike Evans and María Dolores Dancausa will 
stand for election at the Annual General Meeting, to be held 
on 13 May 2014. All other Directors are being proposed for 
re-election at the AGM. 
Biographical details of each of the Directors, together with 
details of their skills and experience, may be found on pages 
32 to 33. Following a performance evaluation of each Director 
and the Board as a whole, all Directors are considered by the 
Board to be fully eﬀ ective.
Executive Directors service contracts and Non-Executive 
Directors’ terms of appointment
The Chairman and each of the Executive Directors have a 
service contract with the Group. The service agreements of 
the Chairman and the Executive Directors can be terminated 
by not less than 12 months’ notice by the Chairman or the 
Executive Director (as appropriate) and 12 months’ notice 
by the Group. The Non-Executive Directors have a letter of 
appointment that sets out the terms and conditions of their 
Directorship, including the fees payable and the expected 
time commitment. Each Non-Executive Director is expected 
to commit suﬃ  cient time as is reasonably necessary for 
the proper performance of their duties. Additional time 
commitment is required to fulﬁ l the roles of Chairman or 
Board committee member. 
Succession planning and Board appointments
The Nomination Committee has continued to work on 
ensuring an appropriate mix amongst both the Executive 
and Non-Executive Directors.
On 25 February 2013, Andrew Whitehouse stepped down as 
a Director; as part of the succession planning he had already 
relinquished his role as Finance Director. On 27 March 2013, 
following the Company’s IPO, as Tosca Penta Investment LP’s 
representatives, David Calder and Charles Schrager Von 
Altishofen resigned as Non-Executive Directors. The Group 
appointed Mike Evans as a Non-Executive Director in June 
2013, Shirley Garrood in July 2013 and María Dolores 
Dancausa in December 2013. 
Board induction and professional development
On joining the Board, Directors take part in an induction 
programme to increase their knowledge and understanding 
of the Business. They are provided with information about the 
Group, the role of the Board and the matters reserved for its 
decision. Each Director is provided with the terms of reference 
and membership of the main Board committees as well as 
corporate governance policies and procedures. Meetings are 
arranged with each of the Executive Directors, members of the 
Executive Committee and senior managers across the Business 
as part of the induction programme.
The induction programme also includes training on:
• Directors’ duties and responsibilities;
• Board procedures and governance related issues;
• Conﬂ icts of interest; and
• Procedures for dealing in esure Group plc shares. Governance

performance evaluation in November 2013 comprising written 
questionnaires followed by one-to-one meetings with the 
Chairman. In addition, the Audit, Nomination, Investment, Risk 
and Remuneration Committees undertook an evaluation of 
their eﬀ ectiveness.
The resulting report was presented and discussed at the Board

shareholders during the year. All Non-Executive Directors, 
including the Senior Independent Director have an invitation 
to attend investor meetings if they wish. During the year Dame 
Helen Alexander, as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
and Senior Independent Director had meetings with several 
of the Group’s largest institutional shareholders to discuss 
remuneration issues and associated governance.
The Directors are provided with regular reports on 
shareholders’ and analysts’ views and of changes in the 
holdings of the principal shareholders.
esure Group has established procedures to ensure the timely 
release of inside information and the publication of ﬁ nancial

Audit Committee
Role of the Audit Committee 
The key responsibilities of the Audit Committee, as set out in 
its terms of reference, are to assist the Board in discharging its 
duties in respect of: 
• Receiving and reviewing reports from the Group’s external 
auditor’s, monitoring their eﬀ ectiveness and independence, 
and making recommendations to the Board in respect of 
their remuneration, appointment and dismissal;
• Monitoring and reviewing internal audit activities;
• Reviewing the Annual Report and Accounts of the Group;
• Overseeing the Group’s procedures for detecting fraud, 
preventing bribery and non-compliance; and
• Reviewing the eﬀ ectiveness of the Group’s system of 
internal ﬁ nancial controls and internal control systems. 
The Committee is authorised to investigate any activity 
within its terms of reference and to seek any information 
that it requires from any employee. It has the right to consult 
professional advisers and, if it is not satisﬁ ed with the advice 
received, seek further independent professional advice. 
The terms of reference and the eﬀ ectiveness of the 
Audit Committee are reviewed annually and any 
recommendations referred to the Board. The Committee 
is subject to an evaluation every year as part of the Board 
Performance Evaluation. 
The Audit Committee’s terms of reference can be viewed on 
our website at www.esuregroup.com/investors 
Composition
There are currently ﬁ ve serving members of the Audit 
Committee, all are independent Non-Executive Directors. 
The membership of the Committee and attendance at 
meetings in 2013 is set out opposite. The Board considers 
that all members of the Committee have recent and relevant 
ﬁ nancial experience and that the skills, qualiﬁ cations and 
commercial experience of its members are suﬃ  cient for it to 
be able to perform its duties. The UK Corporate Governance 
Code recommends at least one member to have recent and 
relevant ﬁ nancial experience.
Although not members of the Committee, the Chairman, CEO, 
CFO, Chief Risk Oﬃ  cer, Chief Operating Oﬃ  cer, and Company 
Secretary are invited to attend each meeting as well as senior 
representatives from both external and internal audit. Other 
members of senior management are invited to present reports 
as necessary to enable the Committee to discharge its duties.

reporting and other developments through presentations 
from the Group’s external auditor’s and senior management.

Meetings
The Committee meets at least four times a year, or more 
frequently if required.
All the Committee meetings that took place in 2013 were 
scheduled meetings and attended by all members.
Activities
External ﬁ nancial reporting
The Committee is responsible for monitoring, reviewing and 
challenging the integrity of the ﬁ nancial statements of the 
Group and any other formal announcement relating to its 
ﬁ nancial performance, reviewing signiﬁ cant ﬁ nancial reporting 
issues and judgements they contain. 
This includes compliance with legal, regulatory, statutory and 
accounting requirements giving due consideration to the 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code and the 
requirements of the UK Listing Authority’s Listing, Prospectus 
and Disclosure and Transparency Rules and any other 
applicable rules as appropriate. 
The Committee has considered, challenged and reviewed 
ﬁ nancial reporting for the Group including:
• Changes to the Group’s capital structure in preparation 
for IPO, including a capital reduction and repurchase and 
cancellation of Non-Voting Ordinary Shares and Priority 
Return Shares from existing capital resources; 
• Financial reporting and regulatory reporting relating to the 
IPO, including the Historic Financial Information included in 
the Price Range Prospectus;
• The interim ﬁ nancial statements and results announcement 
for the six months ended 30 June 2013, including 
accounting and disclosures relating to the new ﬁ nancial 
reporting standard “IFRS 13 – Fair Value measurement” 
and the Group’s new share-based employee 
remuneration schemes;
• The Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2013; 
• That the Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 
2013 was fair, balanced and understandable;
• The regulatory reports for the year ended 31 December 
2013, speciﬁ cally the PRA and IGD returns;
• Critical estimates and judgements;
• Principal risks and uncertainties; and
• Going concern assumption.
A er discussion with both management and the external 
auditor, the Committee determined that the key risk of 
misstatement for the Group’s ﬁ nancial statements related 
to technical provisions. This risk was discussed with 
management during the year and with the external auditor 
when the Committee reviewed and agreed the Group audit 
plan, when the external auditor reviewed the interim ﬁ nancial 
statements and also at the conclusion of the audit of the 
ﬁ nancial statements.
Technical provisions – claims outstanding and claims 
outstanding recoverable from reinsurers – see Note 19 in the 
ﬁ nancial statements
As an insurance entity, technical provisions form a signiﬁ cant 
part of the liabilities of the Group. The Group’s policy is to hold 
suﬃ  cient provisions including those to cover claims which 
have been incurred but not reported to meet all liabilities as 
they fall due. Apart from the provisions relating to Periodic 
Payment Orders, claims provisions are not discounted.
Management conﬁ rmed to the Committee that they remain 
satisﬁ ed that technical provisions included in the ﬁ nancial 
statements provide an appropriate margin over projected 
ultimate claims costs and none of the Committee’s other 
enquiries, nor the external auditor’s work, identiﬁ ed any 
errors or inconsistencies that were material in the context 
of the ﬁ nancial statements as a whole. 
Management also conﬁ rmed to the Committee that it had 
considered the appropriateness of the key assumptions used 
in the calculation of technical provisions by the independent 
external actuary. The Committee considered the qualiﬁ cations 
and experience of the external actuary by examining the 
qualiﬁ cations and experience of the appointed ﬁ rm and 
its representatives.
The external auditor explained to the Committee the work 
they had conducted during the year, including how their 
audit procedures were focused on those areas of technical 
provisions that involve the most judgement. On the basis 
of their audit work, the external auditor reported no 
inconsistencies or material misstatements in the context of 
the ﬁ nancial statements; and in the Committee’s view this 
supports the appropriateness of the Group’s reserving 
methodology and valuation. 
Internal audit 
The internal audit function is fulﬁ lled by a third-party 
organisation, Mazars LLP . The Committee’s responsibilities 
include:
• Review of the activities, resources, organisational structure 
and the operational eﬀ ectiveness of the internal audit 
activities, including ensuring adequate standing and 
freedom from restriction; esure Group Annual Report 2013
42
• Monitoring and reviewing internal audit activities, reports 
and ﬁ ndings including management responses;
• Approval of the annual internal audit plan to ensure 
adequate coverage and consideration of the Group’s 
key risks;
• An assessment of the performance of the internal auditor 
to ensure that the function remains eﬀ ective and ﬁ t for 
purpose; and
• Annual review and approval of the internal audit charter.
Key areas covered by the internal audit function in 2013 were:
• Claims reserves – review of: processes and controls around 
the setting of case reserves, adequacy and timeliness of 
relevant management information and settlement protocols;
• Sales incentives – design and implementation of the Group’s 
sales incentive schemes to ensure compliance with new 
FCA guidelines;
• Anti-money laundering, bribery and corruption – review of 
the Group’s processes, systems and controls in place to 
ensure compliance with applicable legislation and FCA 
requirements; and 
• Incident and change management procedures at the Group’s 
IT outsource partner – review the adequacy of the design 
and operating eﬀ ectiveness of the outsourcers procedures 
to ensure eﬀ ective risk management in line with the 
Group’s requirements.
External audit
The Committee oversees the Group’s relationship with the 
external auditor and formally reviews the relationship, policies 
and procedures to ensure independence.
During the year the Committee considered:
• The independence, objectivity and performance of KPMG 
Audit Plc; 
• The Committee welcomes KPMG’s policy of audit partner 
rotation every ﬁ ve years, which facilitates independence 
and objectivity within the external audit team. The current 
external audit engagement partner is Murray Raisbeck, who 
was appointed to lead the audit in 2010;
• The eﬀ ectiveness of the 2013 audit processes, including 
KPMG’s reports and updates which summarised their 
conclusions and contained feedback on the Group’s control 
environment; 
• KPMG’s proposed fee and audit plan; and
• KPMG’s notiﬁ cation that KPMG Audit Plc has instigated 
an orderly wind down of its business. The Committee has 
recommended to the Board that KPMG LLP be put forward 
to be appointed as auditor and a resolution concerning 
their appointment will be put to the forthcoming AGM of 
the Group.
The Committee meets separately at least once a year 
with the Group’s internal and external auditors without 
management present.
The Committee has considered and adopted a policy on the 
provision of non-audit services by the external auditor and 
procedures to protect the external auditor’s independence 
and objectivity.
The external auditor is prohibited from carrying out the 
following services: 
• Work relating to the preparation of accounting records and 
ﬁ nancial statements that will be subject to external audit;
• Internal audit services;
• Audit or management of IT systems and services where 
these form any part of the accounting system and where 
the external auditor places reliance upon them as part of 
the audit;
• Tax services where the calculations are or may be 
expected to be used for material entries in the ﬁ nancial 
statements; support in any litigation where this would 
involve the estimation of the likely outcome of a pending 
legal matter which could have a material eﬀ ect on the 
ﬁ nancial statements;
• Any form of management role; and
• Arrangements where fees are contingent to a future audit 
judgement and will or are likely to have a material impact 
on the ﬁ nancial statements. 
The appointment of the external auditor for the following work 
requires speciﬁ c approval: 
• Any work that may be thought to give rise to the threat of 
auditor independence will require prior approval; 
• Any service that is of a signiﬁ cant size, ‘outside of scope’ in 
nature or attaching special terms and conditions, will require 
prior approval from the Committee;
• Acquisition structuring and due diligence work with a fee 
in excess of £50,000;
• Corporation Tax compliance work with a fee in excess 
of £50,000;
• Tax planning with a fee in excess of £50,000; and
• Any service with a contingent fee arrangement. 
The Committee receives reports twice a year detailing the fees 
paid to the external auditor for the provision of non-audit 
services and where non-audit fees exceed one third of external 
audit fees, including amounts relating to Listing, non audit 
fees paid to the external auditor were £480,000, considerably 
higher than the Group audit fee.

Strategic Report
Financial Statements
IPO services are typically performed by auditors as they are 
mostly assurance related and the fee was not contingent or 
success based.
For the purposes of evaluating the independence of the 
external auditor, the Committee classiﬁ es the interim review 
fee as an external audit fee. Excluding the work performed in 
respect of the IPO, non-audit fees paid to KPMG were 43% 
of external audit fees in the year. Non-audit fees were 
principally related to tax advisory and compliance services. 
A full breakdown of non-audit fees paid during the year is 
disclosed within the notes to the ﬁ nancial statements on 
page 83.
No conﬂ icts of interest were found to exist between the work 
performed for the purpose of an external audit and non-audit 
services provided by KPMG. 
The Committee considers the requirements of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and the appropriateness of 
tendering the external audit contract as part of normal 
business practice. Based on its ongoing assessment, for 
example through the quality of the external auditor’s report 
to the Committee, and the audit partner’s interaction with 
the Committee, the Committee remains satisﬁ ed with the 
eﬃ  ciency and eﬀ ectiveness of the audit. The Committee 
therefore has not considered it necessary to require the audit 
to be put to tender.
Conclusion
As a result of its work during the year, the Committee has 
concluded that it has acted in accordance with its terms 
of reference.
The Chairman of the Committee will be at the Annual General 
Meeting to answer any questions about the activities of the 
Committee from shareholders.

Chairman, CEO and a number of other Directors before 
being appointed. The Board conﬁ rms that Zygos has no 
other connection with the Group.

objectives and ultimately delivers returns for our shareholders. 
I look forward to continued and regular engagement such 
as this. 
As was set out in the Company’s prospectus at the time of 
Listing, the balance between annual and long-term variable 
pay is currently weighted to the long-term. Flexibility has 
been incorporated into the maximum limits to allow for this 
weighting to be adapted, if appropriate, during the life of this 
remuneration policy. However, the Committee would engage 
with major shareholders before changing the annual bonus 
or performance share award limits from their current levels.
Payments for 2013 and 2014
The salaries for the Chairman and Executive Directors and the 
fee levels for the Non-Executive Directors were set on Listing 
and no changes are proposed to these for 2014. 
The annual bonus for 2013 was calculated in two parts, 
reﬂ ecting the diﬀ erent plans in place pre and post-Listing. 
The bonus for 2013 was based on trading proﬁ t performance 
and aggregate bonuses of 32% and 24% of salary have been 
awarded to the CEO and CFO respectively. There is no change 
to the maximum bonus opportunity for 2014 (which is 75% of 
salary for the CEO and 50% of salary for the CFO). However, 
personal and customer measures have been introduced which 
will account for 25% of the overall bonus opportunity for 
2014 (the remainder will continue to be based on trading 
proﬁ t performance). 
The Company operates a Performance Share Plan (“PSP”) as 
its long-term incentive vehicle. The ﬁ rst awards were granted 
under the plan on Admission and are subject to challenging 
Earnings per Share (“EPS”) and relative Total Shareholder 
Return (“TSR”) targets. The awards for 2014 will also be based 
on EPS and TSR. In 2014, the TSR condition, which accounts 
for one-third of the award, will be the same as that set for the 
2013 award. The EPS target for the 2014 awards will require 
EPS growth of 15% to 39% over the three-year performance 
period, before payment. The Remuneration Committee 
considers these targets to be challenging given the current 
market conditions, providing the opportunity for management 
to receive some reward if they do very well in diﬃ  cult 
conditions but with exceptional performance required for full 
vesting. These targets should not be interpreted as providing 
guidance on the Group’s performance over the relevant period.
The Executive Directors have agreed to retain any shares 
vesting under the PSP (net-of-tax) for a six-month period 
post-vesting and in 2014 the Remuneration Committee will 
review the holding requirement again. 
I believe that the remuneration received by our Executive 
Directors in respect of the ﬁ nancial year 2013 fairly rewards 
them for the business performance achieved, and also that 
their remuneration arrangements for the year ahead will 
appropriately incentivise and reward them to deliver our 
business strategy and returns for our shareholders.
I trust that this report provides a clear and helpful explanation 
of our remuneration policy and that we will receive your 
support at our AGM to be held on 13 May 2014. 
Yours sincerely

Directors’ remuneration report
Annual 
statement
As Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, I am pleased to 
introduce our report on Directors’ Remuneration for this, the 
ﬁ rst year of being listed. In accordance with the new directors’ 
remuneration reporting regulations, the report is divided into 
three sections:
1. This Annual Statement which summarises the major 
decisions taken in respect of the Directors’ remuneration; 
2. The Directors’ Remuneration Policy setting out the 
remuneration policy for the Company’s Directors; and
3. The Annual Report on Remuneration. This sets out how the 
Committee will implement the Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy for the ﬁ nancial year ending 31 December 2014 and 
also the remuneration payable in respect of the ﬁ nancial 
year ended 31 December 2013.
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy will be subject to a binding 
shareholder vote and this Annual Statement and the Annual 
Report on Remuneration will be put to an advisory shareholder 
vote at our forthcoming AGM on 13 May 2014.
Our remuneration policy
2013 has been a year of great change for the Group. 
In preparation for Listing, the Committee gave careful 
consideration to the revision of the Group’s remuneration 
policy to ensure that it was appropriate for the listed 
company environment and to drive our business strategy. 
I would like to take this opportunity to explain some of the 
key elements of our remuneration policy.
Through its overall remuneration policy, the Group seeks to 
attract and retain the best talent for the beneﬁ t of the Business 
and to align the interests of Executive Directors, senior 
management and employees with the long-term interests of 
shareholders and other stakeholders. To that end, the policy 
aims to provide appropriate reward for good performance 
without creating incentives that will encourage excessive 
risk taking.
The Committee is conscious that there should be no reward 
for failure. To this end annual bonus payments and the 
vesting of long-term incentive awards can be scaled back if 
the Committee believes that they represent an excessive 
proportion of the Group’s overall proﬁ t. The Committee can 
also scale back annual bonus payments in the event of, inter 
alia, risk or regulatory compliance issues and claw back annual 
bonus and long-term incentive awards paid in the event of 
ﬁ nancial misstatement, an error in the performance condition 
assessment or gross misconduct.
During the latter part of 2013 and early part of 2014, I met 
with a number of our largest institutional shareholders to 
discuss our remuneration policy and respond to any queries 
that they had. This provided an excellent opportunity to have a 
full and open dialogue with some of our investors, to explain 
our remuneration strategy and how the Committee believes 
this supports and drives the Group’s strategic business  Governance

Directors’ 
Remuneration 
Policy
This Directors’ Remuneration Policy (the ‘Policy’) will operate 
from 1 January 2014 and become formally eﬀ ective on 
13 May 2014, subject to approval from shareholders through 
a binding vote at the 2014 Annual General Meeting (“AGM”). 
Policy overview
The Group seeks to attract and retain the best talent for the 
beneﬁ t of the Business and to align the interests of Executive 
Directors, senior management and employees with the 
long-term interests of shareholders and other stakeholders. 
To that end, the Group’s remuneration policies aim to provide 
appropriate reward for good performance without creating 
incentives that will encourage excessive risk taking. In setting 
the Policy, the Remuneration Committee has regard to the 
provisions within the FCA’s Remuneration Code (even though 
the Group is not required to comply with that code) and to 
the anticipated requirements of Solvency II. In particular, the 
Committee considers carefully the link between remuneration 
and risk and there is cross-membership of the Risk Committee 
and the Remuneration Committee. As well as ﬁ nancial risk, 
this also ensures that there is an appropriate focus on 
Environment, Safety and Governance (“ESG”) issues.
Consideration of shareholder views
The Committee has discussed with major shareholders the 
Policy to be put to shareholders at the 2014 AGM. In the event 
that future changes to the Policy are proposed, the Committee 
would consult with its major shareholders in advance of 
changes being made. The Committee will also consider any 
shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM at the 
next scheduled meeting a er the AGM and any other feedback 
received at any other time as part of the review of Executive 
Directors’ remuneration.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in 
the Company
The Committee regularly reviews remuneration trends across 
the Group, including the diﬀ erential between the total 
remuneration at the highest and lowest levels of employees 
within the Group; and these were taken into account when 
setting the Policy. However, there has been no formal 
consultation with employees in determining the Policy. 
The table overleaf summarises the key elements of the Policy. esure Group Annual Report 2013

Directors’ remuneration report continued
Purpose and link to strategy Operation
Salary
To pay Executive Directors at a level 
commensurate with their contribution 
to the Group and appropriately 
based on skill, experience and 
performance achieved.
Set at a level that maintains an 
appropriate balance between ﬁ xed 
and variable pay ensuring good risk 
management and no undue emphasis 
on variable pay.
Takes account of individual performance, experience and responsibilities and pay as well as 
conditions in the workforce.
Set with reference broadly to mid-market levels and to remuneration generally within the Group 
and other appropriate comparator companies. 
Normally reviewed annually with changes eﬀ ective from 1 January.
Paid monthly in cash three weeks in arrears and one week in advance.
Annual bonus
Incentivises and rewards annual 
delivery of ﬁ nancial and non-ﬁ nancial 
objectives.
The Committee sets the performance measures, targets and the weighting between them annually to 
reﬂ ect the key priorities for the Business for the year ahead and may vary them from year-to-year. 
All or a majority of the annual bonus will be weighted to one or more ﬁ nancial measures set on a 
sliding scale basis. Non-ﬁ nancial metrics (up to a maximum of 25% of the total bonus) may be set 
by the Committee if it determines it appropriate.
The Committee has overriding discretion to scale back annual bonus payments in the event of, 
inter alia, risk or regulatory compliance issues and in the event that the level of bonus represents 
an excessive proportion of the Group’s overall proﬁ t.
The Committee may claw back bonuses already paid in the event of ﬁ nancial misstatement, an error 
in the performance condition assessment or gross misconduct.
Bonuses are paid in cash.
Performance Share Plan (“PSP”)
To encourage and reward delivery 
of the Group’s longer-term 
strategic objectives.
Aligns the interests of Executive 
Directors with the interests of 
shareholders through the use of shares.
EPS is a measure of the Company’s 
overall ﬁ nancial success and TSR 
provides an external assessment of the 
Company’s performance. It also aligns 
the rewards received by Executive 
Directors with the returns received 
by shareholders.
Awards are made annually. Awards vest subject to continued employment and satisfaction of 
applicable performance measured over three years.
Rewards can be made as contingent share awards or nil cost options.
Performance conditions are based on relative TSR and growth in EPS. The Committee may use 
alternative measures for future awards if it deems this appropriate. However not less than one-third 
of the total award will be determined by relative TSR.
The Committee has an overriding discretion to scale back vesting of the awards in the event that the 
level of vesting represents an excessive proportion of the Group’s overall proﬁ t.
The Committee may claw back awards paid in the event of ﬁ nancial misstatement, an error in the 
performance condition assessment or gross misconduct.
Dividend equivalents may be payable on vested shares in respect of dividends earned over the 
vesting period.
50% of any vested awards (net of tax) must be held until the minimum shareholding requirement 
is met (see below). 
Pension
Provided on a market-competitive basis, 
aids retention and follows the general 
reward structure.
Encourages and assists with responsible 
provision for retirement.
Pension contributions and/or a cash allowance (where the lifetime allowance or annual contribution 
limit is exceeded) of 16% of salary.
Beneﬁ ts
To provide market-competitive beneﬁ ts.
To ensure well-being of Executive 
Directors.
To aid retention of our best people.
Beneﬁ ts include but are not limited to:
• Family private health care;
• Death in service life assurance; and
• Participation in HMRC all-employee share plans.
Shareholding guidelines
Alignment of interests of Executive 
Directors and shareholders.
Executive Directors are required to build up shareholdings through the retention of vested PSP 
awards. 50% of any vested PSP awards (net of tax) must be retained until the share ownership 
guidelines has been achieved.
Chairman’s remuneration and 
Non-Executive Director fees
To remunerate the Chairman and 
Non-Executive Directors in an 
appropriate way.
Chairman
The salary and any contractual beneﬁ ts for the Chairman are determined by the Remuneration 
Committee.
Non-Executive Directors
Fees for Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Chairman and the Executive Directors.
The Chairman and Executive Directors are guided by market data for similar Non-Executive roles in 
other companies of a similar size and complexity as well as the experience and time commitment 
of its Non-Executive Directors. esure Group Annual Report 2013

Opportunity
Details of the current salaries for the CEO and CFO are set out in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration. There is no prescribed maximum 
annual increase. However, the Committee is guided by the general 
increase for the broader employee population.
Larger increases may be awarded where the Committee 
determines it appropriate to take into account a change in role 
and/or responsibilities, a signiﬁ cant change in the size, composition 
and/or complexity of the Group, the increased experience or 
performance in role of the Executive or where other exceptional 
circumstances exist.
The maximum bonus opportunity under the Policy has been set at 
125% of salary for the CEO and 100% of salary for the CFO.
Bonuses for 2014 will be a maximum of 75% of salary for the CEO 
and 50% of salary for the CFO.
No more than 25% of the maximum opportunity is payable for 
threshold performance.
The maximum award limit under the Policy is 200% of salary (face 
value at date of grant) being the maximum under the plan rules.
25% of the award vests for threshold performance with a sliding 
scale of targets to 100% vesting for maximum performance. 
Threshold vesting under the relative TSR measure is for median 
ranking or above.
Award levels for 2014 will be limited to 175% of salary for the 
CEO and 150% of salary for the CFO.
Maximum is 16% of salary.
There is no prescribed maximum value. The value is the cost to 
the Group. The cost of the beneﬁ ts provision is reviewed by the 
Committee on a periodic basis.
All employee share plans are subject to maximum limits as set 
by HMRC.
150% of base salary for all Executive Directors.
Details of the current salary of the Chairman and the fee levels 
for the Non-Executive Directors are set out in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration.
There is no prescribed maximum annual increase. Total fees will not 
exceed the amount speciﬁ ed in the Group’s Articles of Association 
of £2,000,000.
Notes to the Policy Table
(1)  A description of how the Committee intends to 
implement the Policy in 2014 is set out in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration page 54.
(2)  EPS is a key ﬁ nancial performance for the Group 
providing a good assessment of proﬁ tability, dividend 
cover and eﬃ  cient use of share capital to fund the 
Business. TSR is measured against other companies 
and therefore provides a good measure of relative stock 
market performance, with management only being 
rewarded for the delivery of superior stock market levels 
of return. A blend of these measures is considered to be 
a complementary mix of ﬁ nancial and stock market 
performance and focuses on sustainable increases 
to proﬁ tability and superior stock market returns. 
The Committee, in selecting performance measures 
and setting targets, ensures that there is a strong link 
between the strategies adopted for the Business and 
the targets set for each PSP award and annual bonus 
cycle. Performance targets will be set annually prior 
to awards being made with regard to the business 
strategy and economic and market environment at 
that time. The Committee has the discretion to vary 
the performance conditions and vesting periods set for 
an existing PSP award in exceptional circumstances 
provided an event has occurred which causes the 
Committee to consider that it would be appropriate 
to do so and provided that the altered performance 
condition is, in the reasonable opinion of the 
Committee, not materially less diﬃ  cult to satisfy than 
the unaltered condition would have been but for the 
event in question. The Committee shall act fairly and 
reasonably in making the alteration.
(3)  The PSP plan rules contain various discretions which 
may be exercised by the Committee in the operation 
of the plan. Those discretions were set out in the 
Prospectus for the Group’s Listing and are incorporated 
into the Policy by reference. 
(4)  Where appropriate the Committee aims for as much 
consistency as possible between the remuneration 
policy for Executive Directors and for employees across 
the Group as a whole. For example all employees 
(including Executive Directors) participate in similar 
pension and beneﬁ ts arrangements, and all participate 
in an annual bonus plan or proﬁ t sharing plan. The key 
diﬀ erence is that only senior employees participate in 
the PSP, which is considered appropriate as senior 
executives are more able to inﬂ uence the long term 
strategic (as opposed to operational) success of the 
Business, as evidenced by long-term EPS and TSR 
performance. The Company encourages and helps 
facilitate share ownership by all employees by oﬀ ering 
participation in the Company’s Save As You Earn Plan. 
 For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this Policy, 
authority is given to the Company to honour any 
commitments entered into with current or former 
Directors (such as, the payment of a pension or the 
vesting or exercise of past share awards) that have 
been disclosed in the prospectus for the Company’s 
Listing and/ or the Company’s Annual Report on 
Remuneration. Details of any payments to former 
Directors will be set out in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration as they arise.  esure Group Annual Report 2013

Illustrations of application of remuneration policy
The following chart provides an indication of the remuneration 
that each Executive Director might receive in accordance with 
the Policy to be implemented in 2014 in respect of minimum 
(ﬁ xed pay), on-target and maximum performance. 
The following assumptions have been made in compiling these 
illustrations of remuneration.
1. Fixed pay for all three scenarios is based on salary levels for 
2014, the cost of supplying the beneﬁ ts received for 2013 
and the current pension Policy applied to 2014 salary;
2. For illustrative purposes on-target performance under the 
annual bonus and PSP is shown at 50% of maximum; 
3. Consistent with the Policy to be applied in 2014, the 
maximum bonus opportunity is shown as 75% of salary 
for the CEO and 50% of salary for the CFO. The PSP grant 
level is 175% of salary for the CEO and 150% of salary for 
the CFO; and
4. No assumptions are made as to share price growth and 
dividend accrual, and these have been excluded from 
the analysis.

Approach to recruitment remuneration
The Committee will aim to set a new Executive Director’s 
remuneration package in line with the Policy approved by 
shareholders.
In arriving at a total package and in considering quantum 
for each element of the package, the Committee will take 
into account the skills and experience of a candidate, the 
market rate for a candidate of that experience, as well as the 
importance of securing the preferred candidate. Annual bonus 
potential will not exceed 125% of salary and long-term 
incentives will not exceed 200% of salary (not including any 
arrangements to replace forfeited deferred remuneration). 
Participation in the annual bonus plan will normally be 
pro-rated for the year of joining and diﬀ erent performance 
measures may be set from those applying to the other 
Executive Directors, if it is appropriate to do so to reﬂ ect 
the individual’s responsibilities and the point in the year 
in which they joined the Board. 
The Committee may make additional cash and/or share-based 
awards (on a one-oﬀ  basis) as it deems appropriate and if the 
circumstances so demand to replace deferred pay forfeited 
by an Executive Director on leaving a previous employer. 
The Committee has the discretion to make these awards under 
the PSP in excess of the 200% of salary limit or as permitted 
under the Rule 9.4.2 of the Listing Rules (which allows 
companies to make one-oﬀ  share awards in exceptional 
circumstances, including recruitment). Awards to replace 
deferred remuneration forfeited would, where possible, be 
consistent with the awards forfeited in terms of delivery 
mechanism (cash or shares), time horizons, attributed expected 
value and whether or not they were subject to performance 
conditions. Other payments may be made in relation to 
relocation expenses, recruitment from abroad, legal and 
other costs reasonably incurred by the individual in relation 
to their appointment or the relocation of an existing Executive 
Director. In the case of an internal appointment, any variable 
pay element awarded in respect of the prior role would be 
allowed to vest according to its original terms, or adjusted if 
appropriate to take into account the appointment.
For the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive 
Director, the fee would be set in accordance with the approved 
Policy in force at that time. The length of service and notice 
periods shall be set at the discretion of the Committee 
taking into account market practice, corporate governance 
considerations and the particular candidate at that time. 
Service contracts and policy on payment for loss of oﬃ  ce
The Company’s policy is that service contracts do not have 
a speciﬁ c duration but may be terminated with 12 months’ 
notice from the Company or the Executive Director. 
Under their letters of appointment Non-Executive Directors 
serve for an initial three-year period subject to annual 
reappointment at the AGM. Non-Executive Directors’ 
appointment is terminable by either party on three months’ 
written notice except where the Director is not reappointed 
by shareholders, in which case termination is with immediate 
eﬀ ect. The appointment letters for the Non-Executive Directors 
provide that no compensation is payable on termination, other 
than for accrued fees and expenses. 
The Directors’ service contracts and letters of appointment are 
available for inspection at the Group’s registered oﬃ  ce.
The obligations of the Group in respect of remuneration and 
payments for loss of oﬃ  ce are set out on the next page. 
Under their service contracts the Executive Directors are 
entitled to salary (reviewed annually), pension contributions 
and beneﬁ ts. The Chairman is entitled to salary (reviewed 
annually), private health cover and use of a driver (for business 
and a portion of personal travel) and these are payable for 
their notice period with an obligation to mitigate. 
The service agreements of the Chairman and the Executive 
Directors can be terminated by not less than 12 months’ notice 
by either party. The Company may put the Chairman and the 
Executive Directors on gardening leave during their notice 
period, and can elect to terminate employment by making a 
payment in lieu of notice equivalent to up to 12 months’ 
salary. This payment may be made as either a lump sum on 
termination or with an amount equivalent of up to six months’  Governance
esure Group Annual Report 2013

Financial Statements
salary payable in a lump sum on termination and six months’ 
salary payable in monthly instalments from the seventh month 
to the twel h month, subject to oﬀ set against any earnings 
elsewhere during that period in any new role. In addition, 
statutory entitlements or sums to settle or compromise claims 
in connection with a termination would be paid as necessary.
The Committee has a policy framework for payments for loss of 
oﬃ  ce by an Executive Director, both in relation to the service 
contract and incentive pay, which is summarised below. 
The recent performance of the Executive Director will be 
taken into account as a determining factor in the reason for 
the cessation and, therefore, the termination payment and 
exercise of the Committee’s discretion as are set out below. 
Category A Category B Category C
Voluntary resignation and 
termination for cause
Agreed terms Death or cessation by reason of 
disability, injury, or where the 
individual’s employing

Paid only until employment 
ceases.
Paid for the notice period, 
subject to mitigation.
Paid only until employment

Annual bonus. No entitlement. Treatment will normally fall 
between A and C, subject to 
the discretion of the Committee, 
the terms of any termination 
agreement and the reasons 
for the Executive Directors’ 
departure.
Cessation during the ﬁ nancial 
year or a er the ﬁ nancial year 
end, but before payment date, 
may result in bonus being 
payable (pro-rated for the 
proportion of the ﬁ nancial year 
worked unless the Committee 
determines otherwise).
PSP awards. Vested unexercised, and 
unvested long-term incentive 
awards lapse on cessation 
of employment.
Treatment will normally fall 
between A and C, subject to 
the discretion of the Committee, 
the terms of any termination 
agreement and the reasons 
for the Executive Directors’ 
departure.
Awards will normally vest 
at the usual time subject to 
performance conditions 
being met. 
In the event of death of a 
participant, awards will typically 
vest early. In other exceptional 
circumstances, awards may vest 
early subject to performance 
at the date of cessation 
of employment.
Awards are usually scaled back 
pro rata to reﬂ ect the shorter 
period of service (but with the 
Committee having discretion 
not to scale back or to reduce 
the scale back).
Other payments. None. Possible disbursements such as legal costs and 
outplacement services.
Note 1 – If the Committee determines, in the circumstances of a leaver, that a PSP award shall vest before the end of the full performance period then (where the 
performance condition does not speciﬁ cally provide for early measurement), the Committee has the discretion to determine, on such reasonable basis as it 
decides, whether the performance condition has been satisﬁ ed. 
Provisions on a takeover and other corporate events
In the circumstances of a takeover or other corporate event, 
outstanding PSP awards will vest at that time subject to 
satisfaction of the applicable performance conditions and 
scaled back to take account of the shorter period of service 
(but with the Committee having discretion not to scale back or 
to reduce the scale back if it considers it appropriate to do so). 
Where the performance condition under the PSP does not 
speciﬁ cally provide for early measurement, the Committee 
has the discretion to determine, on such reasonable basis 
as it decides, whether the performance condition has 
been satisﬁ ed.
In the event of a takeover or other corporate event the 
Committee shall determine the extent (if at all) that any 
applicable performance targets have been achieved under 
the annual bonus plan taking into account such factors as it 
considers appropriate given the curtailed performance period. 
External appointments of Executive Directors
The Executive Directors may accept outside appointments, 
with prior Board approval, provided these opportunities do 
not impact negatively on the individual’s ability to perform 
their duties at the Group and the Committee shall decide 
whether the Executive Director may retain the fee payable 
for such appointments.  esure Group Annual Report 2013

This report, together with the Annual Statement by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, will be put to an advisory 
shareholder vote at the 2014 AGM. The information that has been audited is separately identiﬁ ed as audited.
How the remuneration policy will be applied for the year ending 31 December 2014 
A summary of how the Policy will be applied during the forthcoming year is set out below.
Salaries for Executive Directors
The Executive Directors salaries were reviewed in November 2013. Salaries were set for the Listing in 2013 and the Committee 
has decided not to increase salaries for 2014.
The table shows the salaries as at 27 March 2013 as this was the date of Listing and the time at which the Executive Directors’ 
new remuneration packages became eﬀ ective:

1 January 2014
Salary as at 
27 March 2013 % increase
Chairman £730,000 £730,000 0%
Fees for the Non-Executive Directors 
The Non-Executive Directors’ fees have not been increased for 2014. A summary of current fees policy is as follows:
2014 2013 % increase
Deputy Chairman and Senior Independent Director * £125,000 £125,000 0%
Base fee £60,000 £60,000 0%
Committee Chairman £10,000 £10,000 0%
* The role of Deputy Chairman and Senior Independent Director is held by one person for which a single annual fee is payable encompassing all Board duties.
Annual bonus
The maximum bonus potential for the year ending 31 December 2014 will remain at 75% of salary for the CEO and 50% of 
salary for the CFO. The performance measures will be Group trading proﬁ t for 75% of the maximum bonus available and 
personal and customer performance measures for the remaining 25%. The forward-looking targets are considered to be 
commercially sensitive.
Performance Share Plan (“PSP”)

The TSR target and the maximum EPS growth target are the same as those set for the 2013 awards. The EPS range has been set 
taking into account current market conditions. The Committee is conﬁ dent that these targets are appropriately challenging given 
the market conditions. The Company has discussed the performance targets being set for the 2014 PSP awards with a number of 
its largest institutional shareholders.

Annual bonus for the year ending 31 December 2013 (audited)
The annual bonus payments shown in the total remuneration table were based on Group trading proﬁ t as measured over the 
2013 ﬁ nancial year. The annual bonus was calculated in two parts reﬂ ecting the diﬀ erent plans in place pre and post-Listing. 
The annual bonus payable in respect of the period from 1 April 2013 to 31 December 2013, under the post-Listing remuneration 
Policy, is set out below:

For the period from 1 January 2013 to 31 March 2013, trading proﬁ t targets were set relating to performance in the ﬁ rst quarter 
of the year. These were achieved in full resulting in a bonus payable for that three month period of £35,625 for the CEO and 
£23,250 for the CFO (being 30% of salary pro-rated for three months). 
The aggregate bonuses for 2013 were therefore £152,000 for the CEO and £73,780 for the CFO (32.0% and 23.8% of 
post-Listing salary respectively).
The scale of the trading proﬁ t targets has not been disclosed as it is deemed by the Committee to be commercially 
sensitive information.
The Remuneration Committee has discretion to scale back annual bonus payments in the event of, inter alia, risk or regulatory 
compliance issues and also in the event that the level of bonus represents, in the Committee’s view, an excessive proportion of 
the Group’s overall proﬁ tability. There were no events in 2013 which led the Committee to determine that a scale back of the 
annual bonus payment was appropriate. In addition, the Committee did not consider that the level of bonus represented an 
excessive proportion of the Group’s overall proﬁ tability such that it should be scaled back.  Governance

Outstanding PSP awards
2013 PSP award – Awards are subject to an Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) growth target for two-thirds of the award and a relative 
Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) target for one-third of the award. 
EPS target – 25% of this part of the award subject to the EPS growth target vests for EPS growth over a three-year period (from 
the 2012 EPS) of 21% and rising to 100% vesting for EPS growth of 39%. Vesting in between threshold and maximum vesting is 
on a straight-line basis.
TSR target – the Group’s TSR is ranked against the constituents of the FTSE 250 index at the date of grant (excluding investment 
trusts and the Company). 25% of this part of the award subject to the TSR target vests for median performance rising on a 
straight-line basis to 100% vesting for upper quartile ranking or above. TSR is measured over the period starting with the Listing 
date and ending on 31 December 2015. The TSR target uses as a starting point the IPO Oﬀ er Price for the Company and the 
opening net return index on the date of Listing for the comparator companies and ends with a three month average at the end 
of the performance period.
Sourcing of shares 
In compliance with the ABI guidelines, the rules of the PSP , the Group 2013 Sharesave Plan (the “Sharesave Plan”) and Share 
Incentive Plan (“SIP”) provide that, in any period of ten calendar years, not more than 10% of the Company’s issued ordinary 
share capital may be issued under the PSP , Sharesave Plan or SIP and any other employee share scheme adopted by the 
Company. In addition, the PSP provides that in any period of ten calendar years, not more than 5% of the Company’s issued 
ordinary share capital may be issued under the PSP and any other executive share plan adopted by the Company. esure Group Annual Report 2013

Corporate Governance Code. 
Peter Wood is invited to attend the meetings of the Committee 
as are all Non-Executive Directors, as members of the Board.

NBS was appointed by the Remuneration Committee in 2011. 
NBS meets with the Remuneration Committee Chairman at 
least once a year to discuss matters such as topical issues 
in remuneration which are of particular relevance to the 
Company, and how best it can work with the Company to 
meet the Committee’s needs. 
Aon Benﬁ eld (which is part of Aon but is a separate business 
division to Aon Hewitt) are the Group’s reinsurance brokers.
NBS is appointed as advisor to the Committee and its 
primary role is to provide independent and objective advice

The Committee has been advised that NBS operates as a 
distinct business within the Aon Group and that there is 
a robust separation between the business activities and 
management of NBS and all other parts of Aon Hewitt and 
the wider Aon Group. The Committee is satisﬁ ed that the 
advice that it receives is objective and independent. NBS is 
also a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants Group (‘RCG’) 
Code of Conduct which sets out guidelines for managing 
conﬂ icts of interest, and has conﬁ rmed to the Committee 
its compliance with the Code. 
The total fees paid to NBS in respect of its services to the 
Committee from the date of listing to 31 December 2013 
were £144,000. Fees are predominantly charged on a ‘time 
spent’ basis.

and prospective disabled employees. The training, career 
development and promotion of disabled people is, as far 
as possible, identical to that of other employees.
Employees are kept up to date with regular CEO brieﬁ ngs, 
quarterly business updates, team meetings and other internal 
communications. Employees’ views are gathered through 
our employee consultation group, department forums and 
employee surveys.

Global emissions
This report presents a narrative report for the 2013 
Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) Mandatory Reporting requirement 
of esure Group’s UK operations. 
Methodology: The footprint is calculated in accordance 
with the GHG Protocol and Carbon Trust (“CT”) guidance on 
calculating organisational footprints. Activity data has been 
converted into carbon emissions using published emissions 
factors. The data used has been provided by the Group and 
sense checked (but not formally veriﬁ ed) by Environmental 
Industries Commission (“EIC”).
Emissions sources: The footprint includes the “Scope 1” 
(fossil fuel and refrigerant leakage) and “Scope 2” (electricity) 
emissions associated with the oﬃ  ces in which the Group is 
based. For the purposes of the report only “Scope 1” (Direct) 
and “Scope 2” (Indirect) emissions sources are required.
Organisational boundary: The footprint includes data for 
the three oﬃ  ces in which the Group employs staﬀ  (Reigate, 
Manchester and Glasgow) as well as the two domestic 
apartments. Note that this does not include outsourced 
activities e.g. repair shops and third-party suppliers. 
Data quality: The quality of the data used for the footprint 
calculations has been rated as “good”, “average”, “poor” or 
“based on benchmarks”
1
. Around 99.8% of emissions in the 
footprint were based on “good” quality data, this is a weighted 
percentage according to contribution by the emissions source.

Share capital
Our share capital consists of one class of ordinary shares of 
1
/ 12p each. Each share ranks equally and carries the same rights 
to vote and receive dividends and other distributions declared. 
There are no restrictions on the transfer or holding of shares in 
the Company.
The rights attached to shares which are the subject of awards 
under any of our employee share plans are not available until 
any award or option is exercised and the shares are allotted 
or transferred to the relevant individual. The Trustee of our 
employee beneﬁ t trust is obliged to act in the best interests of 
the share plans’ beneﬁ ciaries. At General Meetings, the Trustee 
may exercise discretion and vote in respect of Trust shares 
although it may not always choose to do so. Where shares are 
beneﬁ cially held by an employee within a share plan they may 
direct the Trustee to vote on their behalf. 
Power of Directors to issue shares
The Directors require express authorisation from shareholders 
to allot new shares. This authority can be granted for a period 
of ﬁ ve years. However, we will follow best practice and seek 
shareholder approval annually. It will be proposed at the 
2014 AGM that the Directors be granted authority to allot 
new shares.
Purchase of own shares
The Directors require express authorisation from shareholders 
to purchase our own shares. Accordingly, at the 2014 AGM, the 
Directors will seek authority to make market purchases of up 
to a maximum of 10% of issued share capital. At the present 
time the Group has no plans to exercise this authority.
The Company did not repurchase any of its Ordinary Shares 
during 2013.
1 “Good” means that the calculation is based on actual data (such as bills, 
miles travelled or meter readings). “Average”means that the calculation is 
based on a fair estimate (such as a proportion of a whole year’s energy 
consumption). “Poor” is where the emissions calculation is based on data 
that only broadly correlates with emissions (like travel spend rather than 
distance). “Benchmark” means that we have ﬁ lled a data gap using an 
industry standard or a benchmark based on the Group’s other operations. esure Group Annual Report 2013

Change of control
There are no material agreements to which the Group is party 
that take eﬀ ect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of 
the Group following a takeover bid.
Auditor
KPMG Audit Plc has been our auditor for a number of years. 
The Audit Committee considers that the relationship with 
the auditor is working well and remains satisﬁ ed with their 
eﬀ ectiveness. The auditor is required to rotate the audit 
partner responsible for the Group and key subsidiaries audits. 
There are no contractual obligations restricting our choice 
of auditor.
KPMG Audit Plc has instigated an orderly wind down 
of business.
The Directors have recommended KPMG LLP be put forward 
to be appointed as auditor and a resolution concerning their 
appointment will be put forward at the forthcoming AGM.
Disclosure of information to auditor
Each Director at the date of the approval of this report 
conﬁ rms that:
• So far as he or she is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Group’s auditor is unaware.
• He or she has taken all the steps that he or she ought to 
have taken as a Director to make himself or herself aware 
of any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Group’s auditor is aware of that information.
Going concern
These consolidated ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared 
on a going concern basis. The ﬁ nancial performance and 
position of the Group, its cash ﬂ ows and its approach to capital 
management are set out in the ﬁ nancial review on pages 18 
to 23. The Group has a strong ﬁ nancial position with no debt, 
robust reserves, a conservative investment portfolio and 
capital signiﬁ cantly in excess of the minimum regulatory 
requirement. In addition, the Board has reviewed the Group’s 
projections for the next 12 months and beyond, including cash 
ﬂ ow forecasts and regulatory capital surpluses. The Directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for at least 
12 months.
Material contracts
Save as disclosed below, there are no material contracts (other 
than contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business) 
to which the Group is a party:
• An agreement between the Group and CapGemini for the 
outsourcing of IT services. The initial term of the agreement 
is for ﬁ ve years from 1 April 2010 to 31 March 2015 and 
continues therea er until terminated
• An Option and Shareholders’ Deed relating to 
Gocompare.com Holdings Limited (“Gocompare”). The Group 
is entitled to appoint up to 50% in number of the board of 
directors of Gocompare.
• The Relationship Agreement between the Company and 
Peter Wood remains in force until the Ordinary Shares cease 
to be admitted to the Oﬃ  cial List of the FCA and to trading 
on the London Stock Exchange; or the Potential Controlling 
Shareholders ceases to own, when taken together, 15% or 
more of the Ordinary Shares or the voting rights attaching 
to the Ordinary Shares unless at the time the Potential 
Controlling Shareholders shall cease to own, when taken 
together, 15% or more of the Ordinary Shares or the 
voting rights attaching to the Ordinary Shares, Peter Wood 
remains the Chairman of the Company, in which event the 
Relationship Agreement shall terminate six months a er 
Peter Wood ceases to be the Chairman of the Company.  Governance

Special rights
There are no persons holding securities that carry special 
rights with regard to the control of the Group.
Appointment, retirement and removal of Directors
The appointment and replacement of Directors is governed 
by the Company’s Articles of Association (“the Articles”), the 
UK Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”), the Companies 
Act 2006, the Relationship Agreement between the Chairman 
and the Company and related legislation. The Articles may only 
be amended by a special resolution of the shareholders.
Directors may be appointed by the Company by ordinary 
resolution or by the Board. A Director appointed by the Board 
holds oﬃ  ce only until the next following AGM of the Company 
and is then eligible for reappointment.
Under the Relationship Agreement between the Chairman and 
the Company, as long as the Chairman or any of his Connected 
Persons, when taken together, hold at least 15% of the Shares 
or Voting Rights attaching to the Shares, the Chairman will 
be entitled to appoint, remove and reappoint one person to 
be a Director, who may be either himself or another person 
nominated by him. 
The Articles require that at each AGM at least one-third 
(rounded down) of the Directors retire by rotation. The retiring 
Directors are eligible to stand for re-election. The Code 
recommends that all Directors of FTSE 350 companies should 
be subject to annual re-election, and all Directors will stand 
for election or re-election at the 2014 AGM.
In addition, to any power of removal conferred by the 
Companies Act, the Company may by special resolution 
remove any Director before the expiration of his or her 
period of oﬃ  ce.
Risk management and internal control
The Board is ultimately responsible for the eﬀ ectiveness of 
the Group’s system of risk management and internal control. 
To ensure that this is achieved and that the risk management 
and internal controls are embedded in the running of the 
business, the Group operates a three Lines of Defence 
structure which is regularly reported on to the Audit and Risk 
Committees. This framework mitigates the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives, unforeseen losses and material 
ﬁ nancial misstatement.
There are a number of controls in place within this framework 
to ensure that the Group has robust procedures for preparing 
consolidated accounts and for ﬁ nancial reporting. 
The Audit Committee regularly reviews the eﬀ ectiveness of 
the Group’s risk management and internal control systems. 
Its monitoring focuses on material risks and controls and is 
based principally on reporting upwards within the framework 
from business management, risk management and the internal 
audit function so that the Audit Committee may consider 
whether signiﬁ cant weaknesses exist. During the course of 
the reviews, the Audit Committee has not identiﬁ ed or been 
advised of any failings or weaknesses which it has determined 
to be signiﬁ cant.
To support Group policies and to facilitate the raising of 
concerns about possible improprieties in matters of ﬁ nancial 
reporting or any other matters, the Group provides a 
conﬁ dential telephone hotline, so that staﬀ  or third parties 
may report anonymously any perceived inaccurate or unethical 
working practices. 
The Audit and Risk Committees endeavour to ensure that the 
Group has in place the most appropriate and eﬀ ective controls, 
checks, systems, and risk management techniques.
Internal Audit
The Group’s Internal Audit function is fully outsourced. 
The activities and eﬀ ectiveness of Internal Audit are monitored 
and reviewed by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is 
responsible for ensuring that adequate access to information 
and resource is given to the Lead Internal Auditor and for 
approving the appointment and removal of the Lead Internal 
Auditor. The Lead Internal Auditor reports directly to the 
Chairman of the Audit Committee. Internal Audit reports are 
presented to the Audit Committee on the eﬀ ectiveness of the 
Group’s systems of internal controls and the adequacy of these 
systems to manage business risk and to safeguard the Group’s 
assets and resources. Internal Audit uses the Group’s risk 
registers to plan and inform their annual audit programme 
around the most signiﬁ cant risks to the Business to ensure 
that controls are in place and are designed and operating 
eﬀ ectively. The Audit Committee reviews and approves the 
Annual Internal Audit Plan.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the 
annual report and the ﬁ nancial statements 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group and parent company ﬁ nancial statements in 
accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and 
parent company ﬁ nancial statements for each ﬁ nancial year. 
Under that law they are required to prepare the Group 
ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the 
parent company ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with UK 
Accounting Standards.
Under company law, the Directors must not approve the 
ﬁ nancial statements unless they are satisﬁ ed that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of aﬀ airs of the Group and 
parent company and of their proﬁ t or loss for that period. In 
preparing each of the Group and parent company ﬁ nancial 
statements, the Directors are required to: 
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
• For the Group ﬁ nancial statements, state whether they 
have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU;
• For the parent company ﬁ nancial statements, state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the parent company ﬁ nancial statements; and
• Prepare the ﬁ nancial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
parent company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are suﬃ  cient to show and explain the parent 
company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the ﬁ nancial position of the parent company and 
enable them to ensure that its ﬁ nancial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility 
for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to 
safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect 
fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance 
Statement that complies with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and ﬁ nancial information included 
on the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of ﬁ nancial statements may 
diﬀ er from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the annual report and ﬁ nancial 
statements taken as a whole are fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business 
model and strategy.
The Directors conﬁ rm that to the best of their knowledge:
• The ﬁ nancial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁ nancial position and proﬁ t or 
loss of the company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and 
• The Strategic Report/Directors’ Report include a fair review 
of the development and performance of the business and 
the position of the issuer and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face.

Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1. Our opinion on the ﬁ nancial statements is unmodiﬁ ed 
We have audited the ﬁ nancial statements of esure Group plc 
for the year ended 31 December 2013 set out on pages 67 
to 112. In our opinion: 
• the ﬁ nancial statements give a true and fair view of the 
state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s aﬀ airs as 
at 31 December 2013 and of the Group’s proﬁ t for the year 
then ended; 
• the Group ﬁ nancial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union; 
• the parent company ﬁ nancial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with UK Accounting 
Standards; and 
• the ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, 
as regards the Group ﬁ nancial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation. 
2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the ﬁ nancial 
statements the risks of material misstatement that had 
the greatest eﬀ ect on our audit were as follows:
Technical Provisions – Claims outstanding (£659.1m) and 
claims outstanding recoverable from reinsurers (£208.5m)
Refer to page 41 (Audit Committee Report), page 77 (accounting 
policy) and pages 96 to 100 (ﬁ nancial disclosures)
The risk – As part of its business model the group incurs 
signiﬁ cant claims. There is typically a time lag between a 
claim being incurred and being settled. As a result, the Group 
has signiﬁ cant claims outstanding at any point in time, 
including the year-end, and there is inherent uncertainty as 
to the level at which these claims outstanding will be settled. 
At 31 December 2013 the Group had claims outstanding 
representing 66% of total liabilities, and claims outstanding 
recoverable from reinsurers, representing 16% of total assets. 
The valuation of claims outstanding is one of the key 
judgemental areas that our audit is concentrated on, due to the 
level of subjectivity inherent in the estimation of the eﬀ ect of 
uncertain or unknown future events and the resulting potential 
exposure to large losses, including those arising from periodic 
payment orders for Motor insurance (a structured settlement 
in the form of a regular series of payments over the remainder 
of a claimant’s life, see page 97) and extreme weather losses 
for Home insurance. The calculation of claims outstanding 
is complex and requires the use of actuarial techniques to 
estimate the reserve for claims incurred but not reported 
(“IBNR”). The Directors set the claims outstanding reserves 
at a level that they consider includes an appropriate margin 
over the actuarial best estimate, in order to take account of 
current uncertainties around factors that may inﬂ uence the 
value of reserves.
The valuation of claims outstanding recoverable from 
reinsurers is dependent on the valuation of the underlying 
claims outstanding and as a result is subject to the same 
estimation uncertainties as the claims outstanding. 
Reinsurance recoveries are also subject to credit risk 
associated with reinsurer credit default. There are no indicators 
of credit default issues on reported claims, however credit risk 
is relevant for the recoveries associated with the technical 
provisions that have a long duration.
Our response – Our audit procedures included, among others, 
testing governance and key controls around the reserving 
process, including controls over the setting of reserves for 
reported claims, and controls over the completeness and 
accuracy of the data used to perform the actuarial projections 
used to set the reserve for IBNR. 
Through reading of relevant documentation and discussion 
with both management and the external actuary, we have 
obtained an understanding of the reserving methodology 
and the key assumptions used (including the inﬂ ation rate 
used for the average cost of small bodily injury claims and 
the discount rate used for the periodic payment orders), and 
we have assessed these for appropriateness, and for their 
consistency with prior periods. We considered the movement 
in reserves relating to claims incurred in prior years to assess 
the appropriateness of management’s past assumptions 
and the methodology used to estimate claims outstanding. 
Where there are changes in the methodology or key 
assumptions we have assessed whether these are reasonable 
based on changes in the industry and the group’s historical 
claims experience, and have considered whether all changes 
we would expect to see have been made. 
We benchmarked the group’s methodology, key assumptions, 
and projected results (such as the ultimate loss ratios) against 
our cumulative knowledge of the sector. 
In respect of the margin that the Directors have set over the 
actuarial best estimate, we considered the consistency of 
the basis for the margin applied to the actuarial estimate 
year-on-year. This included an assessment of the potential 
uncertainties that have been reserved for within the margin. 
We also evaluated the competence, capabilities and 
objectivity of the external actuary, based on discussions 
with them, our experience with their previous work, our 
knowledge of the actuary’s qualiﬁ cations and the professional 
standards that their work is subject to, and by providing 
challenge to their analysis through the procedures described 
above. We used our own actuarial specialists to assist in 
performing the procedures described. 
We have also considered the adequacy of the Group’s 
disclosures about the degree of estimation and the sensitivity 
of recognised amounts to changes in assumptions, and 
assessed whether the disclosures comply with relevant 
accounting standards. 
We evaluated and tested key controls around reinsurers’ 
share of claims outstanding, including controls over approval 
of reinsurance contracts and calculation of reinsurance 
recoveries, and reinsurance credit controls. We used our 
actuarial specialists to assist in evaluating the appropriateness 
of reinsurance recoveries on IBNR by considering the historical 
ratios of paid and reported claims net of reinsurance 
recoveries to paid and reported claims gross of reinsurance 
recoveries. We have also obtained an understanding of 
the methodology applied to calculate the allowance for 
reinsurance bad debt which is included within claims 
outstanding, and we have assessed the methodology for 
appropriateness and consistency with prior periods.  esure Group Annual Report 2013

esure Group plc only continued
3. Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope 
of our audit
The materiality for the group ﬁ nancial statements as a whole 
was set at £8.3m. This has been determined with reference 
to a benchmark of Group proﬁ t before taxation (of which it 
represents 7%) which we consider to be one of the principal 
considerations for members of the Company in assessing the 
ﬁ nancial performance of the Group. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee to report to it all 
corrected and uncorrected misstatements we identiﬁ ed 
through our audit with a value in excess of £0.4m, in addition 
to other audit misstatements below that threshold that we 
believe warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Audits for group reporting purposes were performed for all key 
reporting components (material subsidiaries or joint ventures). 
The audits undertaken for group reporting purposes were 
undertaken by the group audit team for the majority of the 
key locations, with the exception of Gocompare.com Holdings 
Limited where the audit was undertaken by component 
auditors (a separate audit team in the UK that reported their 
ﬁ ndings to the group audit team). These Group procedures 
covered 100% of total Group revenue; 100% of Group proﬁ t 
before taxation; and 100% of total Group assets as audits 
were performed for all key components. 
Detailed audit instructions were sent to the component 
auditors. These instructions covered the signiﬁ cant audit 
areas that should be covered by this audit (which included 
the relevant risks of material misstatement detailed above) 
and set out the information required to be reported back to 
the group audit team. As Gocompare.com Holdings Limited is 
not an insurance company, Technical Provisions (as set out in 
section 2 above) is not a signiﬁ cant risk for the audit of that 
component of the Group. The group audit team also held 
meetings with the component auditors.
The audits undertaken for group reporting purposes were 
all performed to materiality levels set by, or agreed with, 
the group audit team. These materiality levels were set 
individually for each component and ranged from £0.1m 
to £5.7m.
4. Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006 is unmodiﬁ ed
In our opinion: 
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Report for the ﬁ nancial year for which the 
ﬁ nancial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
ﬁ nancial statements. 
5. We have nothing to report in respect of the matters on 
which we are required to report by exception 
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, 
based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we 
have identiﬁ ed other information in the annual report that 
contains a material inconsistency with either that knowledge 
or the ﬁ nancial statements, a material misstatement of fact, 
or that which is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report to you if: 
• we have identiﬁ ed material inconsistencies between the 
knowledge we acquired during our audit and the Directors’ 
statement that they consider that the Annual Report and 
ﬁ nancial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business 
model and strategy; or
• the Corporate Governance Report does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the Audit 
Committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or 
• the parent company ﬁ nancial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not 
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration speciﬁ ed by 
law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
• the Directors’ statement, set out on page 62, in relation to 
going concern; and
• the part of the Corporate governance report on pages 36 
to 47 relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine 
provisions of the 2010 UK Corporate Governance Code 
speciﬁ ed for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above 
responsibilities.
Scope of report and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities set out on page 64, the Directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the ﬁ nancial statements 
and for being satisﬁ ed that they give a true and fair view. 
A description of the scope of an audit of ﬁ nancial statements 
is provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at 
www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate. This report is made 
solely to the company’s members as a body and is subject 
to important explanations and disclaimers regarding 
our responsibilities, published on our website at

incorporated into this report as if set out in full and should be 
read to provide an understanding of the purpose of this report, 
the work we have undertaken and the basis of our opinions.

Notes to the ﬁ nancial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2013
1 General Information 
esure Group plc is a company incorporated in England and Wales. Its registered office is The Observatory, Reigate, Surrey RH2 0SG.  
The nature of the Group’s operations is the writing of general insurance for private cars and homes. The Company’s principal activity is 
that of a holding company.  
All of the Company’s subsidiaries are located in the United Kingdom, except for esure S.L., which is incorporated in Spain. 
2 Accounting policies 
Basis of preparation 
These financial statements present the esure Group plc group financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013, comprising 
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of financial position, consolidated statement of changes 
in equity, consolidated statement of cash flows and related notes, as well as the comparatives.  
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union.  
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The financial performance and position of the 
Group, its cash flows and its approach to capital management are set out in the financial review on pages 18 to 23. The Group has a 
strong financial position with no debt, robust reserves, a conservative investment portfolio and capital significantly in excess of the 
minimum regulatory requirement. In addition, the Board has reviewed the Group’s projections for the next 12 months and beyond, 
including cash flow forecasts and regulatory capital surpluses. The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least 12 months. 
These consolidated financial statements have been presented in Sterling and rounded to the nearest hundred thousand. Throughout 
these consolidated financial statements any amounts which are less than £0.05m are shown by 0.0, whereas a dash (–) represents that 
no balance exists. 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial assets and land and 
buildings that are measured at fair value at the reporting date. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below. 
Changes to accounting policies 
The Group has adopted the following new standards, including consequential amendments to other standards, with a date of initial 
application of 1 January 2013: 
• IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements (2011) 
• IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements  
• IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities  
• IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement 
IFRS 10, 11 and 12 are effective under EU law from 1 January 2014, with early adoption permitted, and have been early adopted by  
the Group. The nature and effects of the changes are explained below: 
Consolidation of subsidiaries 
IFRS 10 (2011) introduces a new control model that focuses on whether the Group has power over an investee, exposure or rights  
to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and ability to use its power to affect those returns. There were no changes  
to the control conclusion in respect of any investments held by the Group and there has been no impact on the recognised assets, 
liabilities and comprehensive income of the Group as a result of the change. 
Joint arrangements 
Under IFRS 11, the Group classifies its interests in joint arrangements as either joint operations (if the Group has rights to the  
assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to an arrangement) or joint ventures (if the Group has rights only to the net assets  
of an arrangement). When making this assessment, the Group considers the structure of the arrangements, the legal form of any 
separate vehicles, the contractual terms of the arrangement and other factors and circumstances. Previously, the structure of the 
arrangement was the sole focus of classification. There has been no change to the classification of the Group’s only joint arrangement. 
The investment continues to be recognised by applying the equity method and there has been no impact on the recognised assets, 
liabilities and comprehensive income of the Group as a result of the change. Refer to note 11 for additional details.  
Disclosure of interests in other entities  
In accordance with IFRS 12, the Group has expanded its disclosures about its interest in the joint arrangement.  
   esure Group Annual Report 2013

Notes to the ﬁ nancial statements continued
2 Accounting policies (continued) 
Fair value measurement  
IFRS 13 establishes a single framework for measuring fair value and making disclosures about fair value measurements when such 
measurements are required or permitted by other IFRSs. It unifies the definition of fair value as the price that would be received to  
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. It replaces 
and expands the disclosure required about fair value measurements in other IFRSs. As a result, the Group has included additional 
disclosures in this regard. The change has no significant impact on the measurement of the Group’s assets and liabilities and has  
had no impact on the value of the Group’s assets and liabilities recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position.  
There are a number of other new standards and amendments to standards with a date of initial application of 1 January 2013, the 
adoption of which has had no material effect on the Group’s accounting policies.  
At the date of approval of these financial statements there were no standards, amendments or interpretations in issue and endorsed  
by the EU which the Group had not adopted. The following amendment to an existing standard has been endorsed by the EU, but is not 
mandatory for the year ended 31 December 2013 and has not been early adopted by the Group: 
• Effective 1 January 2014: Amendments to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation – Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial 
liabilities. This amendment addresses inconsistencies in current practice when applying the offsetting criteria in IAS 32 for financial 
assets and liabilities. The adoption of the amendment is expected to have no material effect on the Group’s accounting policies.  
There are a number of standards, amendments and interpretations which have been issued by the IASB but which have not yet been 
endorsed by the EU thus the date and impact of applying these is uncertain. 
Basis of consolidation 
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to,  
variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. 
Subsidiary companies are consolidated using the acquisition method.  
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtained control, and continue to  
be consolidated until the date when such control ceases.  
In preparing these consolidated financial statements, any intra-group balances, unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses 
arising from intra-group trading are eliminated. Where accounting policies used in individual financial statements of a subsidiary 
company differ from Group policies, adjustments are made to bring these policies in line with Group policies. 
Joint ventures  
A joint venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control, whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the 
arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities. The Group’s interests in jointly controlled entities are 
accounted for using the equity method of accounting. The Group recognises the cost of the investments which, together with the 
Group’s share of the joint venture’s post-acquisition changes to shareholders’ funds, is included in the consolidated statement of 
financial position. The Group’s share of post-acquisition profit or loss and other comprehensive income is stated after appropriate 
adjustments to align the accounting policies of the joint venture with those of the Group. In addition, adjustments are made for the 
amortisation of separately identifiable intangible assets recognised on acquisition and to eliminate unrealised profits relating to 
commission charged to esure Group plc by the joint venture. Carrying values are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether 
there are any indications of impairment. If any such indications exist, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated and compared  
to the carrying value. Impairment losses are recognised through the income statement. Impairment may be reversed if conditions 
subsequently improve and credited through the income statement. 
Business combinations 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of  
the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of non-controlling interest in the acquiree,  
plus if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the pre-existing equity interest in the acquiree. For each 
business combination, the Group has an option to measure any non-controlling interests in the acquiree either at fair value or at  
the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. 
Goodwill is recognised at the date of acquisition as the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed. Where the excess is negative a gain is recognised in the income statement at the date of acquisition. 
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses, with the exception of insurance contracts and operating leases, the financial assets 
and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances 
and pertinent conditions at the acquisition date. All acquisition-related costs are expensed in the income statement when incurred.

Financial Statements
2 Accounting policies (continued) 
Revenue 
Gross written premiums  
Gross written premiums, being the total premiums receivable for the whole period of cover provided by contracts entered into  
during the accounting period, excluding taxes or duties based on premiums, are recognised on the date which the policy commences. 
Gross written premiums include any adjustments arising in the accounting period for premiums receivable in respect of business 
written in prior accounting periods.  
Unearned premiums 
The proportion of gross written premiums that are to be earned in the accounting period after the balance sheet date are deferred  
as a provision for unearned premiums. Premiums earned are computed separately for each insurance contract and are recognised  
as revenue using the daily pro rata method, which is consistent with the incidence of risk assumed over the coverage period of the 
related policy. 
Reinsurance premiums  
Reinsurance premiums are recognised and measured in a manner consistent with the related insured contracts issued by the Group 
and the specific terms of each reinsurance contract. Reinsurance premiums are expensed over the period that the reinsurance cover  
is provided based on the expected pattern of the reinsured risks. The unexpired portion of ceded reinsurance premiums is included  
in reinsurance assets. 
Unearned reinsurance premiums 
Unearned reinsurance premiums are those proportions of premiums written in a year that relate to periods of risk after the reporting 
date. Unearned reinsurance premiums are deferred over the term of the underlying direct insurance policies for risks-attaching 
contracts and over the term of the reinsurance contract for losses-occurring contracts. 
Fees for additional services  
Additional Services Revenues comprise sales of non-underwritten additional insurance products to Motor and Home insurance 
customers; policy administration fees; fees generated from the appointment of firms used during the claims process, including medical, 
car hire suppliers; and, prior to the implementation of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012, applicable legal 
panel membership fees. 
Revenue earned on the sale of additional services includes both brokerage fees and commission, where the Group has a continuing 
relationship with the customer, and introducer fees where the Group does not have a continuing relationship with the customer.  
Revenue relating to insurance broking is brought into account at the later of policy inception date or when the policy placement has 
been completed and confirmed. Where the Group has an obligation to provide future services to the customer an element of income 
relating to the policy is deferred to cover the cost of fulfilling the associated contractual obligation plus a reasonable profit margin. 
Deferred revenue is credited to the income statement over the period matching the Group’s obligations to provide those services. 
Where the Group has no contractual obligation to provide future services, the revenue is recognised immediately.  
In certain circumstances, where the revenue cannot be reliably measured at the contract or policy inception date, broking fees and 
commission are recognised on a periodic basis when the consideration becomes due. Rebates of commissions and fees relating to the 
return of premiums for additional insurance products and services are recognised when liability is possible.  
Administration fees are recognised in the period in which the related administration services are provided. Panel Membership fees are 
agreed with legal suppliers every six months and recognised on an accruals basis. Other referral fees from credit hire and repair are 
recognised at the later of the point of invoice or when the policy fees are due. 
Investment income and instalment interest  
Investment income (including interest received from policyholders who pay by instalment) on assets classified as loans and receivables 
is recognised in the income statement as it accrues and is calculated by using the effective interest rate method.  
The effective interest rate method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or liability and of allocating the 
interest income or interest expense over the expected life of the asset or liability. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly 
discounts estimated future cash flows to the instrument’s initial carrying amount. Calculation of the effective interest rate takes into 
account fees payable or receivable that are an integral part of the instrument’s yield, premiums or discounts on acquisition or issue, 
early redemption fees and transaction costs. All contractual terms of a financial instrument are considered when estimating future  
cash flows.  
Investment income also comprises interest and dividend income and net gains (both realised and unrealised) on financial assets 
classified at fair value through profit or loss, including derivative financial instruments. Dividends are recognised when the right to 
receive payment is established. For listed securities, this is the date the security is listed as ex-dividend.  
Investment income also includes rental income. Rental income represents income arising from operating leases and is recognised on  
a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Notes to the ﬁ nancial statements continued
2 Accounting policies (continued) 
Government grants 
Government grants are recognised where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attached conditions will 
be complied with. When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognised as income over the period necessary to match the grant 
on a systematic basis to the costs that it is intended to compensate. Where the grant relates to an asset, it is recognised as deferred 
income and released to the income statement in equal amounts over the expected useful life of the related asset. 
Claims and expenses recognition  
Gross claims incurred and claims handling expenses 
Gross claims include all claims incurred during the year, whether reported or not, less other recoveries, together with related internal 
and external handling costs that are directly related to the processing and settlement of claims, and any adjustment to claims 
outstanding from previous years.  
Reinsurance claims 
Reinsurance claims are recognised and measured in a manner consistent with the related insurance contracts issued by the Group and 
the specific terms of the reinsurance contract. 
Finance costs 
Finance costs comprise of interest paid which is recognised in the income statement as it accrues and is calculated by using the 
effective interest rate method. Accrued interest is included within the carrying value of the interest bearing financial liability. 
Taxation 
Current tax 
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax 
rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Current tax assets 
and liabilities also include adjustments in respect of tax expected to be payable or recoverable in respect of previous periods.  
Current tax relating to items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income is recognised in equity or other 
comprehensive income and not in the income statement. 
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is provided in full using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences arising between the 
carrying amount of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes, and the amounts used for taxation purposes. It is calculated at  
the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is recovered, using tax rates enacted  
or substantially enacted by the reporting date. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the 
asset can be utilised. 
Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside the income statement is also recognised outside the income statement, either in 
other comprehensive income or directly in equity as appropriate. 
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. 
Foreign currency translation 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to Sterling at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets  
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to Sterling at the exchange rate at the reporting date. Foreign currency 
differences are recognised in profit or loss in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.  
Intangible assets 
Goodwill 
Goodwill is recognised on business combinations and the acquisition of joint ventures at cost less accumulated impairment losses. 
Goodwill arising on business combinations is presented in intangible assets. For joint ventures, goodwill is not separately presented  
but is included in the carrying amount of the investment. Negative goodwill is recognised in the Group income statement at the date  
of acquisition. Positive goodwill is not amortised.  
Impairment of goodwill  
Goodwill arising on a business combination is tested annually for impairment. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount 
of the cash generating unit (or units) to which the goodwill is allocated exceeds its recoverable amount. A recognised impairment loss  
is not reversed. 
Goodwill attributed to an investment in a joint venture accounted under the equity method is not tested for impairment separately.  
The entire carrying amount of the investment is tested for impairment only if there is objective evidence of impairment. A recognised 
impairment loss may be reversed if conditions subsequently improve.

2 Accounting policies (continued) 
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets acquired are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Intangible assets 
are amortised over their useful lives. For intangible assets that are recognised as part of business combinations, the Group makes an 
assessment of the fair value of the identified intangible assets acquired in the business combination. Intangible assets other than  
those arising as part of business combinations are recognised as long as it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that 
are attributable to the asset will flow to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably. The Group holds no intangible assets with 
indefinite useful lives other than goodwill. The carrying value of intangible assets with finite useful lives is reviewed at every reporting 
date for evidence of impairment with the value being written down if any impairment exists. If conditions subsequently improve, the 
previously recognised impairment may be reversed and credited through the income statement.  
The economic lives and amortisation methods of acquired intangible assets, other than software, are as follows:  
Customer relationships  5 to 6 years, based on the pattern of consumption of the benefits 
Brands    8 to 10 years, on a straight-line basis  
Software 
Purchased software is recognised as an intangible asset, with the carrying value being reviewed at every reporting date for evidence of 
impairment and the value being written down if any impairment exists. If conditions subsequently improve, the previously recognised 
impairment may be reversed.  
The cost of purchased software is amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the intangible asset. This has been 
set between two and seven years. 
Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred. Costs associated with the 
development of software for internal use are capitalised only if the software is technically feasible for sale or use on completion and 
the Group has both the intent and sufficient resources to complete the development. Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if  
the cost of the asset can be reliably measured, will generate future economic benefits and there is an ability to use or sell the asset.  
The cost of internally generated software is amortised over the expected useful life of the intangible asset on a straight-line basis.  
The expected useful life is between three and five years. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment comprise land and buildings occupied by the Group and fixtures, fittings and equipment (including 
computer hardware). These assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives after taking into account residual values. 
Replacement or major inspection costs are capitalised when incurred if it is possible that future economic benefits associated  
with the item will flow to the entity and the costs can be measured reliably. 
Land and buildings are stated at their revalued amount, which is the fair value, less subsequent depreciation for buildings. All other 
assets are stated at cost less depreciation and accumulated impairment. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method  
to write off the cost less residual values of the assets over their economic lives with the exception of freehold land which is not 
depreciated. The economic lives are as follows: 
Fixtures, fittings and equipment between 3 and 8 years 
Freehold buildings   100 years  
The assets’ residual values, useful lives and method of depreciation are reviewed and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. 
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no further future economic benefits are expected 
from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the income statement in the year in which the asset is derecognised. 
Impairment and revaluation of property, plant and equipment 
Carrying values are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there are any indications of impairment. If any such 
indications exist, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated and compared to the carrying value. The recoverable amount is the  
higher of the fair value of the asset, less costs to sell and the asset’s value in use. Impairment losses are recognised through the  
income statement. Impairment may be reversed if conditions subsequently improve and credited through the income statement. 
Revaluations of land and buildings are undertaken annually, with more frequent revaluations occurring where an assessment is made 
that the carrying amount may differ materially from its fair value. Where a revaluation occurs, any accumulated depreciation at the time 
of the revaluation is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset. 
Increases in the carrying amount arising on the revaluation of Group occupied property are credited to revaluation reserves in other 
comprehensive income. 
Decreases that offset the previous increases of the same asset are charged against revaluation surplus directly in other comprehensive 
income; other decreases are charged to the income statement.

through profit or loss”, “loans and receivables” or “held for trading”. The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at 
initial recognition. The Group does not classify any financial assets as held to maturity or available-for-sale financial assets. 
The Group’s financial assets include cash and cash equivalents, insurance and other receivables and quoted and unquoted financial 
investments including derivatives. 
Initial recognition of financial assets  
The Group designates on initial recognition its financial assets held for investment purposes (financial investments) at fair value 
through the profit or loss (“FVTPL”) with the exception of derivatives, which are classified as held for trading. This is in accordance  
with the Group’s documented investment strategy and is consistent with investment risk being assessed on a portfolio basis. 
Information relating to investments is provided internally to the Group’s Directors and key managers on a fair value basis. All other 
financial assets are classified as loans and receivables. 
Purchases and sales of financial assets are accounted for at trade date. 
Subsequent measurement  
Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised through the income statement.  
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost less accumulated impairment losses using the effective interest rate method. 
Impairment of financial assets 
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether any financial assets held at amortised cost are impaired. Financial assets are 
impaired where there is evidence that one or more events occurring after the initial recognition of the asset may lead to a reduction  
in the estimated future cash flows arising from the asset. Impairment losses on financial assets classified as loans and receivables are 
calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset’s 
original effective interest rate. Impairment losses and any reversals of impairments are recognised through the income statement. 
Objective evidence of impairment may include default on cash flows from the asset and reporting financial difficulty of the issuer or 
counterparty. 
Derecognition of financial assets  
A financial asset is derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from that asset have expired or when the Group transfers 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial assets. 
Offsetting of financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the consolidated statement of financial position if, 
and only if, the Group has a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and it intends to settle on a net basis,  
or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. Income and expenses are not offset in the income statement unless 
required or permitted by any accounting standard or interpretation. 
Reinsurance 
The Group cedes insurance risk in the normal course of business for the purpose of limiting its potential losses from accepting 
insurance risk. Reinsurance assets represent amounts expected to be recovered from reinsurers in respect of claims incurred under  
the related insurance contracts and are estimated in a manner consistent with the outstanding claims provision or settled claims under 
the related insurance contracts.  
Reinsurance assets are reviewed for impairment at each reporting date or more frequently when an indication of impairment arises 
during the reporting period. Impairment occurs when there is objective evidence as a result of an event that occurred after initial 
recognition of the reinsurance asset that the Group may not receive all outstanding amounts due under the terms of the contract  
and the event has a reliably measurable impact on the amounts that the Group will receive from the reinsurer. Any impairment loss  
is recorded in the income statement. 
Insurance receivables  
Insurance receivables are recognised when due and are measured on initial recognition at the fair value of the consideration  
received or receivable. Subsequent to initial recognition, insurance receivables are measured at amortised cost less accumulated 
impairment losses, using the effective interest rate method. The carrying value of insurance receivables is reviewed for impairment 
whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, with the impairment loss recorded in  
the income statement. 
Insurance receivables are derecognised when the derecognition criteria for financial asset, as described in the financial asset 
accounting policy, have been met.

2 Accounting policies (continued) 
Deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”) 
Acquisition costs comprise all commission and other acquisition costs arising from the conclusion of insurance contracts. Deferred 
acquisition costs represent the proportion of acquisition costs incurred that corresponds to the unearned premiums provision at the 
reporting date, and are deferred to the extent that these costs are recoverable out of future premiums. All other acquisition costs are 
recognised as an expense when incurred. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, DAC assets are amortised over the period in which the related revenues are earned.  
DAC assets are derecognised when the obligations under the related insurance contracts are either transferred or settled. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, and other short-term deposits with original maturities 
of three months or less that are held to meet short-term cash commitments rather than for investment or other purposes. 
Insurance contract liabilities  
Provision for unearned premiums  
The provision for unearned premiums represents that portion of premiums received or receivable that relates to risks that have not  
yet expired at the reporting date. The provision is recognised when the contracts are entered into and premiums are charged, and is 
brought to account as premium income over the term of the contract in accordance with the pattern of insurance service provided 
under the contract. 
Liability adequacy test 
At each reporting date the Group reviews its unexpired risk and performs a liability adequacy test to determine whether the estimated 
cost of future claims and deferred acquisition costs exceeds the provision for unearned premiums. This calculation uses current 
estimates of future contractual cash flows after taking account of the investment return expected to arise on assets relating to the 
relevant technical provision. If these estimates show that the carrying amount of the unearned premium is inadequate, the deficiency  
is recognised in the income statement by setting up a provision for unexpired risk. 
Outstanding claims provision 
The provision for claims outstanding comprises provisions for the estimated cost of settling all claims incurred but not settled at the 
balance sheet date including related claims handling expenses, whether reported or not. Anticipated reinsurance recoveries and 
salvage and subrogation recoveries are disclosed separately as assets. 
Insurance payables 
Insurance payables are recognised when due and measured initially at the fair value of the consideration received. Subsequent to 
initial recognition, they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. 
Insurance broking debtors and creditors 
The Group recognises on its balance sheet amounts due to insurers from clients, and money held on behalf of insurers in relation to  
the insurance transactions that the Company handles on behalf of those parties. The cash at bank balances presented in these financial 
statements represent the aggregation of the money held for the benefit of the Company, clients and insurers. 
Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities falling within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as derivatives “held for trading”, or “other financial liabilities”.  
The Group determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition. 
The Group’s “other financial liabilities” include insurance and other payables and borrowings.  
Initial recognition  
All financial liabilities are measured initially at fair value less, in the case of other financial liabilities, directly attributable  
transaction costs. 
Subsequent measurement  
After initial recognition, other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. 
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised.  
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any fees or costs that are an integral part of effective interest rate, transaction costs 
and all other premiums and discounts. The amortisation is included in finance costs in the income statement.

Notes to the ﬁ nancial statements continued
2 Accounting policies (continued) 
Derecognition of financial liabilities 
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. When an existing 
financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are 
substantially modified, such an exchange or modification, is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of  
a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the income statement. 
Derivatives 
Derivatives are measured at fair value both initially and subsequent to initial recognition. All changes in fair value are recognised in  
the income statement. Derivatives are presented as assets when the fair values are positive and as liabilities when the fair values  
are negative.  
Hedge accounting 
The Group does not currently designate any derivatives as hedging instruments. 
Share capital 
Shares are classified as equity when there is no contractual obligation to transfer cash or other assets to holders of the  
financial instruments. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, and it is probable 
that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be 
made of the amount of the obligation. Where the Group expects some or all of the expenditure required to settle a provision to be 
reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense 
relating to a provision is presented in the income statement net of any reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of money is 
material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.  
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost. 
Employee benefits – pensions 
The Group contributes to a defined contribution scheme for its employees. The contributions payable to this scheme are charged to the 
income statement in the accounting period to which they relate. 
Leases  
Group as a lessor  
Leases where the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating 
leases. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and 
recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in the period in  
which they are earned. 
Group as a lessee – operating leases 
Leases which do not transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased items are 
classified as operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line  
basis over the lease term. Contingent rentals are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. 
Share-based payments 
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees are measured at the grant date at the fair value of the equity instruments 
(excluding the effect of non-market vesting conditions but including the effect of market vesting conditions). Fair value is not 
subsequently remeasured. 
The fair value of equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, with a corresponding 
increase in equity, based on the best estimate of the number of awards which will ultimately vest unconditionally with employees.  
The estimate of the number of awards expected to vest (excluding the effect of market vesting conditions) is revised at each reporting 
date, with any consequential changes to the charge recognised in the income statement. 
Where equity-settled share-based payments are modified, any incremental fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the 
revised vesting period.

3 Critical accounting judgements and estimates 
The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that 
affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, 
the results of which form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent 
from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates; however the consolidated financial statements presented are based 
on conditions that existed at the balance sheet date. 
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the 
revision affects both current and future periods. 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies 
Insurance contract liabilities  
Estimates have to be made both for the expected ultimate cost of claims reported at the reporting date and for the expected ultimate 
cost of claims incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) at the reporting date. It can take a significant period of time before ultimate claims cost 
can be established with certainty and for some types of claims, IBNR claims account for the majority of the liability in the statement of 
financial position. 
The ultimate cost of outstanding claims is estimated by carrying out standard actuarial projections in line with the Institute and Faculty 
of Actuaries Technical Actuarial Standards. These techniques use past claims information and development patterns of these claims to 
project the expected future claims cost both for notified and non-notified claims.  
Similar judgements, estimates and assumptions are employed in the assessment of adequacy of provisions for unearned premium and 
hence whether there is a requirement for an unexpired risk provision. 
Please refer to note 19 for additional details.

There are no other material components of income and expense or non-cash items. 
Trading profit, being earnings before interest, tax, non-trading expenses and amortisation of acquired intangible assets, is 
management’s measure of the overall profitability of the Group’s operating activities. The Group’s segmental trading profit, comprised 
of Motor underwriting, Home underwriting, investments and non-underwritten additional services is £130.6m (2012: £138.1m).  
The Group’s profit after tax is £93.2m (2012: £88.1m). 
The Group incurred non-trading costs of £2.8m in 2013 relating to activities associated with Admission and share-based payments in 
respect of the long service and one-off awards disclosed in note 26. The Group incurred non-trading costs of £5.2m in 2012, primarily 
relating to potential corporate transactions.  
Segmental profit drivers 
Motor and Home underwriting 
The performance of the Motor and Home underwriting segments is measured by reference to a number of Key Performance Indicators, 
including in-force policies and the combined operating ratio. 
Profitability of segmental underwriting activities is measured by reference to the net loss ratio, being net incurred claims as a 
percentage of earned premiums, net of reinsurance. For the year ended 31 December 2013, the Motor underwriting net loss ratio  
was 67.2% (2012: 70.0%) and the Home underwriting net loss ratio was 59.3% (2012: 64.5%). The total net loss ratio was 65.9% 
(2012: 69.2%). 
Overall profitability of the Group’s underwriting activities is measured by reference to the combined operating ratio, being the net 
expense ratio (net insurance expenses plus claims handling costs as a percentage of earned premiums, net of reinsurance) plus the net 
loss ratio. For the year ended 31 December 2013, the net expense ratio was 23.8% (2012: 23.6%) giving a combined operating ratio  
of 89.7% (2012: 92.8%). 
All Motor and Home underwriting income is generated in the UK.

4 Segmental information (continued) 
Additional services 
The performance of additional services (inclusive of underwritten additional insurance products that are reported within the Motor 
underwriting segment), is measured by reference to revenue per in-force policy (“IFP”) on a rolling 12 month basis. At 31 December 
2013, revenue per IFP was £56.0 (2012: £60.6).  
Since the implementation of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012, applicable legal panel membership fees 
are no longer received. For comparability, Motor additional services income has been measured by reference to additional services 
revenue, excluding Claims Income, per Motor IFP. At 31 December 2013, revenue per IFP under this metric was £64.3 (2012: £62.9). 
Statement of financial position 
The assets and liabilities of the Group are managed on an aggregated consolidated basis. They are not allocated to reportable segments 
and are reported on the same basis as disclosed in the consolidated statement of financial position on page 68. 
Reconciliation of segmental reporting to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
The Group’s segmental reporting presents amortisation of acquired intangible assets separately from other operating expenses.  
The Group’s share of joint venture profit is presented before tax and amortisation.

At 31 December 2013 the Group owns 50% (2012: 50%) of the ordinary share capital and has a 50% (2012: 50%) interest in 
Gocompare.com Holdings Limited (“Gocompare”), a company incorporated in England and Wales. The principal activity of the company 
is a holding company of an internet-based price comparison business. The Group has Gocompare board representation in order to 
protect its interest, however the investment is held by the Group on an arms length basis and the investment is not strategic to  
the Group.

Gocompare is part of a VAT Group of which each member is jointly and severally liable. The VAT Group’s liability at 31 December 2013 
was £1.4m (2012: £1.4m). The VAT Group is external to esure Group plc and esure Group plc is not liable in respect of the VAT Group. 
Goodwill and amortisation 
There were no indicators of impairment of the investment in the joint venture in the periods reported and as a result no impairment 
testing was performed on goodwill and intangible assets. 
Risks associated with the interest in the joint venture 
The two principal risks facing Gocompare are uncertainty regarding future regulatory changes and the highly competitive  
environment in which it operates, specifically the potential impact of continued rises in media costs impacting both profitability  
and customer volumes.  
Dividends received from the joint venture 
The Group received dividends from Gocompare during 2013 of £6.0m (2012: £5.5m).

Total tax recognised directly in equity  (0.0) –
The deferred tax recognised directly in equity relates to deferred tax arising on share-based payments where the amount of the 
estimated future tax deduction exceeds the amount of the related cumulative remuneration expense recognised. 
Factors affecting the tax charge for future periods 
It has been announced, and substantively enacted on 2 July 2013, that the Corporation Tax rate will be reduced to 21% with effect 
from 1 April 2014, and further reduced to 20% from 1 April 2015.  
As the changes have been substantively enacted as at the balance sheet date, the announced changes are reflected in the deferred tax 
liability recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2013. 
14 Dividends 
An interim dividend per share of 2.5p (£10.4m) was declared by the Board of Directors on 6 August 2013. No dividends were declared 
in the year ended 2012 by the Group. Subsequent to the year end, a dividend per share of 13.3p (£55.4m) was declared by the Board 
of Directors.

15 Earnings Per Share 
Basic 
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to the owners of the Group and the weighted average of 
Ordinary Shares in issue during the period, excluding Ordinary Shares held as employee trust shares. 
Diluted 
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to the owners of the Group by the weighted average of 
Ordinary Shares in issue during the period adjusted for any dilutive potential Ordinary Shares.  
The difference between the basic and diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period, being 135,848  
(2012: nil), relates to the dilutive potential of the share-based payment arrangements. Details of share awards are set out in note 26.  
During the year ended 31 December 2013, the Group undertook a number of capital transactions, in anticipation and upon Admission 
to trading on the London Stock Exchange.  
On 21 February 2013, the share capital of the Group was reduced by the cancellation of 4,000,000,000 Non-Voting Old Ordinary 
Shares of £0.01 each and £40 million cash was paid to Tosca Penta Investments LP out of existing financial resources. 
On 25 February 2013, each A, B and C Ordinary Share was subdivided into 12 shares of the same class. Immediately prior to Admission, 
these 399,600,000 shares of 
1
/
12
 pence, were converted into a single class of Ordinary Share.  
On Admission the Group repurchased from Tosca Penta Investments LP the remaining 4,485,014,000 Non-Voting Ordinary Shares of 
£0.01 each at par (amounting, in total, to £44.85 million) and the 1,000 Redeemable Priority Return Shares of £0.01 each. 
The Group issued 17,241,380 new Ordinary Shares with a nominal value of 
1
/
12
 pence each on 27 March 2013 for a total aggregate 
amount of £50 million. 
The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for comparative periods has been adjusted accordingly. Where there has been 
no change in existing resources, the calculation has been adjusted retrospectively to reflect these changes; where there has been a 
change in resources, the calculation has been adjusted from the date of that change in resources.

Owner-occupied properties are stated at their revalued amounts, as assessed by qualified external valuers annually, all with recent 
relevant experience. These values are assessed in accordance with the relevant parts of the current RICS Valuation Standards in the UK 
(“Red Book”). More frequent revaluations are performed by management to assess that the carrying amount does not materially differ 
from its fair value. 
This assessment, on the basis of existing use value and in accordance with UK Valuation Standard 1.3, is the estimated amount for 
which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm’s length transaction, 
after proper marketing wherein the parties had acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion, assuming that the buyer is 
granted vacant possession of all parts of the property required by the business and disregarding potential alternative uses and any 
other characteristics of the property that would cause its market value to differ from that needed to replace the remaining service 
potential at least cost. The valuation assessment adopts market-based evidence and is in line with guidance from the International 
Valuation Standards Committee and the requirements of IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment. 
Independent valuations were performed as at 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012. If land and buildings were held under the 
cost model, land and buildings would have a carrying value at 31 December 2013 of £12.1m (31 December 2012: £12.2m).

paid annually. 
The Perpetual Subordinated Loan Notes were listed on the Channel Islands’ Stock Exchange. 
On 28 March 2013 the Perpetual Subordinated Loan Notes were repaid by the Group following Admission of esure Group plc to the 
London Stock Exchange.

Notes to the ﬁ nancial statements continued
18 Financial assets and liabilities (continued) 
18.3 Financial risk management objectives 
The Group is exposed to a range of financial risks through its financial assets, financial liabilities, reinsurance assets and policyholder 
liabilities. In particular, the key financial risk is that the proceeds from financial assets are not sufficient to fund the obligations arising 
from insurance policies as they fall due. The most important components of this financial risk are market risk (including interest rate risk, 
equity price risk and currency risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.  
(a) Market risk 
These risks arise from open positions in interest rate, currency and equity products, all of which are exposed to general and specific 
market movements. The market risks that the Group primarily faces due to the nature of its investments and liabilities are interest rate 
risk and equity price risk.  
The Group manages market risk by virtue of its risk management framework, incorporating the Group’s Risk Appetite and setting an 
appropriate investment strategy. 
The majority of investments held are listed and traded on the UK and other recognised stock exchanges. The Group has a defined 
investment strategy and market risk policy which sets limits on the Group’s exposure by setting, where applicable, duration, issuer  
and concentration limits for each asset class.  
The Group’s Board appoints members to the Group’s Investment Committee who are responsible for recommending future investment 
strategy, guidelines and policies, in line with the Board-approved Risk Appetite, for the Board’s approval. Ultimately, the Board is 
responsible for setting the investment strategy, defining the risk appetite and appointing investment managers. The-day-to-day 
management of investments is delegated to the investment fund managers and monitored by the Investment Committee.  
Investment Committee meetings, chaired by a Non-Executive Director, are held at least quarterly. At these meetings, Non-Executive 
Directors, Executive Directors and senior managers meet to discuss investment performance, composition and strategy across the 
Group’s portfolio.  
(i) Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk arises primarily from investments in fixed interest securities. The Investment Committee balances the portfolio of 
investments to manage the exposure to interest rate risk. In addition, to the extent that claims inflation is correlated to interest rates, 
liabilities to policyholders are exposed to interest rate risk. 
The Group monitors interest rate risk on a monthly basis by calculating the mean duration of key elements of the investment portfolio 
and of the liabilities to policyholders under insurance contracts. The mean duration is an indicator of the sensitivity of the assets and 
liabilities to changes in current interest rates. The mean duration of the technical liabilities is determined by means of projecting 
expected cash flows using standard actuarial claims projection techniques. Asset allocation decisions made by the Investment 
Committee give due consideration to the duration and profile of liabilities to avoid any significant mismatch in the asset and liability 
profiles. In order to preserve capital and to reduce the risk of an investment loss due to interest rate movements, it is acceptable for  
the duration of the asset portfolio, to be shorter, but not longer than the average duration of the liabilities. The Group’s investment 
managers also have the ability to use Government bond futures as a mechanism to ensure portfolio duration remains within  
strict limits. 
The sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk illustrates how changes in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will 
fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates at the reporting date. For an increase of 100 basis points in interest yields the 
profit before tax for the period would decrease by £7.7m (2012: £7.1m). For a decrease of 25 basis points in interest yields the profit 
before tax for the period would increase by £1.9m (2012: £1.6m).  
(ii) Equity price risk 
The Group is exposed to equity securities price risk as a result of its holdings in investments with prices quoted on a stock exchange 
and classified as financial assets at FVTPL. Exposures to individual companies and to equity shares in aggregate are monitored in order 
to ensure compliance with the relevant regulatory limits for solvency purposes. 
If equity market indices had increased/decreased by 10%, the profit before tax for the year would increase/decrease by £2.7m  
(2012: £2.9m). 
(iii) Currency risk 
The Group has exposure to currency risk in respect of certain investments denominated in currencies other than Sterling. At the 
reporting date the most significant currencies to which the Group is exposed are Euros and US Dollars (USD). The Group seeks to 
mitigate currency risk by the use of forward contracts and other derivatives, with a maturity of less than three months from the 
reporting date, matching the estimated foreign currency denominated assets with liabilities denominated in the same currency.  
Strict agreements are in place with investment managers to ensure all non-Sterling debt securities and other fixed income securities  
are hedged to between 99.5% and 100.5% of the carrying value. 
One investment manager, who holds shares and other variable yield securities, is not required to hedge out all currency risk.  
The maximum permitted value of shares and other variable yield securities which may have unhedged currency risk exposure,  
per the investment manager’s mandate, is £8.7m (2012: £nil). At the reporting date the Group has direct exposure to both USD  
and Swiss francs (CHF) through shares with a value of less than £0.5m. If the Sterling rates with either of these foreign currencies  
had strengthened/weakened by 10%, the profit before tax for the year would increase/decrease by £0.0m (2012: £nil).

18.3 Financial risk management objectives (continued) 
(b) Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not be able to pay amounts in full when due in accordance with the term of the contract, 
causing the Group to incur a financial loss. 
Key areas where the Group is exposed to credit risk are: 
• Credit instruments held within the investment portfolio; 
• Other amounts due from investment counterparties; 
• Reinsurers’ share of insurance contract liabilities; 
• Amounts due from reinsurers in respect of claims already paid; 
• Amounts due from policyholders;  
• Subrogation and salvage recoveries; and  
• Amounts due from claims suppliers. 
Reinsurance is used to manage insurance risk. This does not, however, discharge the Group’s liability as primary insurer. If a reinsurer 
fails to pay a claim, the Group remains liable for the payment to the policyholder. 
The creditworthiness of reinsurers is considered on an annual basis by reviewing their financial strength prior to finalisation of any 
contract. In addition, management assesses the creditworthiness of all reinsurers by reviewing credit grades provided by rating 
agencies and other publicly available financial information. An analysis of the credit grade of the Group’s 10 largest exposures to 
reinsurers by Standard & Poor’s (S&P) and A.M. Best ratings is produced and reviewed on a monthly basis. The minimum credit  
rating that the Group requires for participation in its reinsurance programmes is Standard & Poor’s A- or the A.M. Best equivalent.  
The Group manages the levels of investment counterparty credit risk it accepts by placing limits on its exposure to a single 
counterparty, or groups of counterparties, and on geographical counterparties and geographical segments. Such risks are subject  
to regular review by the Investment Committee.  
Investments bearing credit risk, and cash and cash equivalents, are summarised below, together with an analysis by credit rating as  
at the reporting date:

BBB 62.6 58.1
Below BBB or not rated 51.5 36.7
Investments bearing credit risk and cash and cash equivalents  741.5 789.2
Shares and other variable-yield securities and units in unit trusts do not bear credit risk. Cash and cash equivalents are “A” rated.  
The analysis by credit rating illustrates a slight reduction in credit quality over the period under review, with a lower proportion of 
assets rated “AAA” in 2013 compared to 2012. This is, as stated in note 25, due to the repayment on Admission of £84.9m of capital 
instruments funded by a commensurate reduction in money market funds. The Group continues to hold the majority of its assets in 
strong investment grade instruments.  
Assets not subject to credit rating are primarily insurance receivables due from policyholders and other debtors. Owing to the high 
number of individual policyholders through which the Group has minimal individual exposure, the overall risk of default to the Group is 
considered to be insignificant. The Group regularly reviews the ageing and individual characteristics of the counterparties of insurance 
receivables and other debtors to manage credit risk and to ensure that impairments are made where necessary. No credit limits were 
exceeded during the year, and no significant financial assets are past due but not impaired at the reporting date.  
During the year ended 31 December 2013, £nil (2012: £2.0m) was charged to other operating expenses in the consolidated income 
statement in respect of a financial asset classified as an other debtor that was individually determined to be impaired following a claims 
supplier entering into administration. No provision account was used for the impairment and no reversal of the impairment has been 
made during 2013.

(c) Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group, although solvent, either does not have available sufficient financial resources to enable it to 
meet its obligations as they fall due, or can secure them only at excessive cost. The primary liquidity risk of the Group is the obligation 
to pay claims to policyholders as they fall due. Liquidity risk is minimal due to the nature of the business, which is such that material 
liabilities are driven by claims costs, which have a significant lead time from notification to payment.  
In order to mitigate liquidity risk, the maturity of the technical liabilities is determined by means of projecting expected cash flows 
using standard actuarial claims projection techniques. Asset allocation decisions made by the Investment Committee give due 
consideration to the maturity and profile of liabilities to ensure that the maturity of assets is equal to or shorter than the maturity  
of liabilities.  
The table below analyses the contractual maturity of the Group’s financial assets (excluding shares and other variable-yield securities 
and units in unit trusts), salvage and subrogation assets, financial liabilities and outstanding claims. 
The analysis of non derivative financial liabilities and assets is based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the 
contractual maturity date. The analysis of claims outstanding is based on the expected dates on which the claims will be settled.

(d) Capital management  
The Group maintains a capital structure consistent with the Group’s risk profile and the regulatory and market requirements of its 
business. The Group’s objectives in managing capital are: 
• To match the profile of its assets and liabilities, taking account of the risks inherent in the business; 
• To satisfy the requirements of its policyholders and regulators; 
• To maintain financial strength to support business growth; and 
• To retain financial flexibility by maintaining strong liquidity and access to a range of capital markets. 
The Group manages as capital all items that are eligible to be treated as capital for regulatory purposes. This includes equity, allowing 
for regulatory adjustments and mark to model based valuation of the Group’s interest in Gocompare. Following the repayment of the 
Perpetual Subordinated Loan Notes in March 2013 none of the Group’s capital is in the form of debt.

Exchange. Refer to note 25 for more detail. 
Economic capital 
In addition to Group capital requirements established under the IGD, the solo insurance company, esure Insurance Limited, is also 
subject to Individual Capital Guidance (“ICG”) set by the Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”). The guidance is set by the PRA on a 
periodic basis following the submission of a risk-based Individual Capital Assessment (“ICA”). The ICA, and thus ICG, are typically greater 
than the IGD and it is these that the Group use to determine its economic capital requirements.  
This approach indicates that the economic capital requirement for the Group, inclusive of an appropriate buffer, is currently broadly 
equivalent to 40% of net written premiums.  
(e) Fair value estimation 
In accordance with IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement financial instruments held at FVTPL have been categorised into a fair value 
measurement hierarchy as follows: 
Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities – (Level 1) 
Inputs to Level 1 fair values are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets. An active market is a market in which 
transactions for the asset occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. 
Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly 
(derived from prices) – (Level 2) 
Fair value measurements that are derived from inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, if all significant inputs required to 
fair value an instrument are observable, would result in the instrument being included in Level 2. The majority of assets classified as 
Level 2 are over-the-counter corporate bonds, where trades are less frequent owing to the nature of the assets. Inputs used in pricing 
the Group’s level 2 assets include: 
• Quoted prices for similar, i.e. not identical, assets in active markets; 
• Quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, the prices are not current, or price quotations vary among 
market makers, or in which little information is released publicly; 
• Inputs that are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data by correlation; and 
• For forward foreign exchange contracts, the use of observable forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date, with the resulting 
value discounted back to present value.

18.3 Financial risk management objectives (continued) 
The Group’s policy should there be a change to the valuation techniques or level of activity in the market in which that asset is traded,  
is to transfer the asset between levels effective from the beginning of the reporting period. As a result of the application of IFRS 13  
Fair Value Measurement, from 1 January 2013, the Group has revisited the fair value hierarchy and now classifies all corporate bonds  
as Level 2 assets with the exception of Government backed securities which are classified as Level 1 unless they are illiquid. As a  
result of the change, £14.0m has been transferred from Level 1 to Level 2 in the year. In addition, £3.0m of debt securities have been 
transferred from Level 1 to Level 2 in the year as a result of insufficient trade frequency for the assets to be classified as Level 1. 
Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) – (Level 3) 
Unobservable inputs have been used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for 
situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset at the measurement date (or market information for the inputs to 
any valuation models). As such, unobservable inputs reflect assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing 
the asset. 
If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3. The Group held 
Level 3 equity securities of £17.8m at 31 December 2012, representing an investment in a managed fund. Although the fair value  
was calculated using simple models and extrapolation techniques by reference to the observable market prices of the underlying 
assets, the fund was closed to new investment during 2011 and hence reclassified from level 2 to level 3 due to the illiquidity of the 
fund. During the year ended 31 December 2012, £4.7m was credited to the income statement in respect of Level 3 financial assets.  
At 31 December 2012, the majority of investments held by the fund classified at Level 3 were listed investments. Therefore, no 
sensitivity analysis was performed due to the nature of the investments. 
Following the Group’s decision to sell its holding in a managed fund, there are no Level 3 assets, other than land and buildings,  
as at 31 December 2013. The total sales proceeds for these financial assets was £21.7m. Cumulative unrealised losses of £3.0m  
were reversed on the sale of these Level 3 financial assets and realised gains of £1.0m were recorded in investment income.  
Under IFRS 13, land and buildings with a carrying value of £11.6m (2012: £11.4m) are now classified as Level 3 assets. Owner-occupied 
properties are stated at their revalued amounts, as assessed by qualified external valuers annually, all with recent relevant experience. 
These values are assessed in accordance with the relevant parts of the current RICS Valuation Standards in the UK (“Red Book”). The 
valuer’s opinion of fair value was primarily derived using comparable recent market transactions on arm’s length terms. More frequent 
revaluations are performed by management to assess that the carrying amount does not materially differ from its fair value.

19 Reinsurance assets and insurance contract liabilities 
19.1 Insurance Risk 
Insurance risk arises from the inherent uncertainties as to the occurrence, amount and timing of insured events that could lead to 
significant individual or aggregated claims in terms of quantity or value. These would include significant weather related events and 
personal injury claims. The Board is responsible for setting the overall underwriting strategy and defining the Risk Appetite, with 
monitoring delegated to the Pricing Committee. The Group uses excess of loss reinsurance contracts to mitigate insurance risk, 
essentially by reducing exposure to large individual claims or aggregated losses from single events.  
Underwriting and pricing risk 
The Group underwrites general insurance business for private cars and homes in mainland Britain and the associated additional 
insurance products. The book consists of a large number of individual policies spread across the whole geographic area which helps  
to minimise concentration risk especially in terms of weather-related risks. As well as pricing the Group has additional controls in  
place to segment the market and target those segments it wishes to underwrite. Further systems and controls are in place to mitigate 
application fraud risk. 
The Group has systems and management information in place to continually monitor underwriting performance and pricing adequacy 
through the Pricing Committee.  
Claims management risk 
The Group employs a variety of strategies to ensure the correct claims are paid in a timely manner and reserve provisions made on a 
case-by-case basis to reflect the Group’s future liabilities. 
These include: 
• A well resourced and expertly trained staff benefit from the latest image and workflow technology to control paper flow and 
procedures to enhance efficiency and effectiveness; 
• The Group manages its own network of motor repairers and dedicated teams offer an extensive range of services directly to ”not at 
fault” third parties to efficiently control credit hire cost and legal fees;  
• Comprehensive anti-fraud strategies are in place to check both fraudulent claims and new business applications; and 
• All claims teams operating from the UK and more specialised teams handle large liability and property damage claims in a dedicated 
technical unit. 
Reinsurance 
The Group purchases reinsurance as a risk transfer mechanism to mitigate risks that are outside the Group’s appetite for individual 
claim or event exposure and to reduce the volatility caused by large individual and accumulation losses. By doing so the Group protects 
its capital and the underwriting result of each line of business. 
Currently the Group has in place non-proportional excess of loss reinsurance programmes for its motor and home underwriting 
activities. These cover both individual large losses and accumulation losses arising from natural and other catastrophe events.  
Motor reinsurance treaties are in place covering all years in which the Group has underwritten motor policies. At the present time  
the Group has no quota share reinsurance or co-insurance arrangements in place. 
The Group’s reinsurance programmes are reviewed on an annual basis and capital modelling is used to identify the most appropriate 
structure and risk retention profile, taking into account the Group’s business objective of minimising volatility and the prevailing cost 
and availability of reinsurance in the market. 
Counterparty credit risk is a key consideration when the Group enters into reinsurance treaties. See note 18.3 (b) for more detail.  
Reserving risk 
Reserving risk is defined as the uncertainty regarding either the current level of reserves or the payment distribution over their lifetime. 
The Group analyses and projects historical claims development data and uses a number of actuarial techniques to both test and 
forecast claims provisions. In addition the Group also provides data to external actuaries who assess the adequacy of the Group’s 
claims provisions. 
Apart from historical analyses the Group also takes into account changes in risk profile and underwriting policy conditions, changes in 
legislation or regulation and changes in other external factors. 
The claims provision is sensitive to the number and cost of large motor claims which have been incurred but not reported and reserved. 
Typically the Group would expect a number of large claims from expired risks to be identified in the future, either from being newly 
reported or from existing claims increasing in magnitude. The claims provision allows for an expected level of such claims.

19 Reinsurance assets and insurance contract liabilities (continued) 
Claims subject to periodic payment orders (“PPOs”) are an area of uncertainty relating to the claims provision at 31 December 2013.  
For known PPOs and claims which have been identified as potential PPO awards, cash flow projections are carried out in order to 
estimate an ultimate cost on a gross and net of reinsurance basis. The cash flow projections were undertaken on a discounted basis.  
The total net claims provision recognised for PPOs and potential PPOs in the consolidated statement of financial position represents 
less than 5% of net claims outstanding at 31 December 2013. In the context of the Group’s approach to the mitigation and 
management of underwriting risk, its reinsurance programme (including its approach to mitigating counterparty credit risk) and  
the Group’s prudent approach to reserving for potential PPOs, the risk of an adverse development of the Group’s reserves for  
PPO claims is not considered to be significant. 
In addition, the Ministry of Justice has been reviewing the discount rate used in the calculation of damage awards in bodily injury and 
fatal claims for some time. At the date these financial statements were approved the discount rate used in these calculations remained 
at 2.5%. However, while individual case reserves have been established by applying this current discount rate, an allowance has been 
made within the total reserves to reflect an assumed reduction of one percentage point. The impact of this allowance is to increase the 
net claims provision recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position by less than £2.0m at 31 December 2013. In the 
context of the Group’s reinsurance programme and its approach to the mitigation of reinsurance counterparty credit risk, a reduction  
in the discount rate is unlikely to result in a material deterioration of the Group’s financial performance. 
The Group’s policy is to hold sufficient provisions, including those to cover claims which have been incurred but not reported (“IBNR”)  
to meet all liabilities as they fall due. Apart from that part of the provisions relating to PPOs, claims provisions are not discounted.  
The Directors remain satisfied that the outstanding claims reserves included in these financial statements provide an appropriate 
margin over projected ultimate claims costs.

Following the inclusion of an allowance within total reserves for an assumed reduction of one percentage point in the Ogden discount 
rate from 31 December 2012, the Group increased its estimate of gross claims outstanding and claims outstanding recoverable from 
reinsurers. During 2013, the Group continued to experience favourable development of prior accident year reserves resulting in a 
reduction in both gross claims outstanding and claims outstanding recoverable from reinsurers as at 31 December 2013.

Insurance receivables and other debtors are financial assets classified as loans and receivables. For more details see note 18, which 
includes the ageing of these loans and receivables.  
The Directors believe the carrying value of these financial assets approximates their fair value. During 2012, an impairment of £2.0m 
was made for an individually impaired financial asset recognised in other debtors. For more detail, see note 18.3 (b).  
All insurance receivables and other receivables are recoverable within one year, aside from £3.0m of salvage and subrogation assets 
which are recoverable in more than one year (2012: £1.2m).

Insurance and other payables include financial liabilities of £22.9m (2012: £22.8m) classified as other financial liabilities.  
Insurance payables and accrued expenses principally comprise amounts outstanding for suppliers and ongoing costs. The average 
credit period taken for invoiced trade purchases is 7.3 days (2012: 7.0 days). The Directors consider that the carrying amount of 
insurance and other payables approximates their fair value. All insurance and other payables are due within one year aside from 
Government grants. 
Included within deferred income is £0.5m in Government grants (2012: £0.6m). This is recognised as income over the period necessary 
to match the grant on a systematic basis to the costs that it is intended to compensate. Scottish Executive Grants have been received by 
the Group based on two factors: expenditure on fixed assets and the creation of new jobs. In order for the Group to avoid repayment  
of the grants received, the new jobs created in order to meet the grant conditions must remain in existence for a period of at least  
five years.

25 Share Capital and other reserves (continued) 
(b) As at 31 December 2013 
The authorised, allotted, called up and fully paid share capital of esure Group plc as at 31 December 2013 is 416,841,380 Ordinary 
Shares of 
1
/
12
 pence each. The shares have full voting and dividend rights. 
No shares are held in Treasury. The esure Employee Benefit Trust holds 1,646,828 Ordinary Shares and the Trustees have waived their 
rights to dividend payments.  
Changes during the year ended 31 December 2013 
On 21 February 2013, the share capital of esure Group plc was reduced by the cancellation of 4,000,000,000 Non-Voting Old Ordinary 
Shares of £0.01 each and £40 million in cash was paid in consideration by the esure Group plc to Tosca Penta Investments LP out of 
existing financial resources, the holder of the Non-Voting Old Ordinary Shares so cancelled. 
On 25 February 2013, each A Ordinary Share, B Ordinary Share and C Ordinary Share was subdivided into 12 shares of the same class 
(each having a nominal value of 
1
/
12
 pence). Immediately prior to the Admission of esure Group plc to the London Stock Exchange, the 
resulting A Ordinary Shares, B Ordinary Shares and C Ordinary Shares, in total amounting to 399,600,000 shares of 
1
/
12
 pence each, 
were converted into a single class of Ordinary Share in accordance with esure Group plc’s articles of association such that, following 
conversion, there were in aggregate 399,600,000 Ordinary Shares of 
1
/
12
 pence each.  
Pursuant to a share purchase agreement dated 25 February 2013, esure Group plc agreed on Admission to repurchase the remaining 
4,485,014,000 Non-Voting Old Ordinary Shares of £0.01 each at par (amounting, in total, to £44.85 million) and the 1,000 Redeemable 
Priority Return Shares of £0.01 each for an amount equal to the Priority Return (as defined and determined in accordance with the 
Company’s previous articles of association) out of existing financial resources. The Non-Voting Old Ordinary Shares and Redeemable 
Priority Return Shares repurchased were then cancelled. A capital redemption reserve was created for the £44.85 million share 
repurchase. The amount payable on Admission to Tosca Penta Investments LP in respect of the Priority Return was £0.6 million.  
As a result of the contractual obligations to deliver cash to satisfy the Priority Return on Admission, the Priority Return Shares were 
reclassified as a financial liability. The fair value at the date of the reclassification (being £0.6 million) was debited directly to retained 
earnings. esure Group plc also issued 17,241,380 Ordinary Shares with a nominal value of 
1
/
12
 pence each on 27 March 2013 for  
£50 million, with associated transaction costs of £6.0 million debited directly to share premium. 
26 Share-based payments 
The Group has set up a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans. An award will not be granted under the executive 
plans if it would cause the number of shares allocated in the ten calendar year period following flotation to exceed 5% of the Ordinary 
Share capital in issue at that time. Similarly, an award will not be granted under the employee plans if it would cause the number of 
shares allocated in the ten calendar year period following flotation to exceed 10% of the ordinary share capital in issue at that time. 
Holders of these awards (other than the three-year and five-year SAYE schemes) will receive dividend equivalents in respect of  
the dividends that would have been paid between grant date and vesting date for Ordinary Shares which vest under their awards, 
calculated on a basis and paid in a manner to be determined by the Remuneration Committee before the awards vest. Details of the 
share-based compensation plans and their financial effect are set out below. 
(a) Performance Share Plan 
The Performance Share Plan (“PSP”) is a discretionary executive share plan. 
The first awards made under PSP were: 
Darren Ogden 160,344 
Stuart Vann  286,637  
Senior Management 263,101 
Under the scheme, the shares vest at the end of a three-year period dependent upon continued employment by the Group and 
achieving predefined performance conditions associated with the Group’s earnings per share (“EPS”) and total shareholder  
return (“TSR”).  
The awards are subject to both non-market and market-based performance conditions. 
Two-thirds of each award will be based on EPS performance and one-third on TSR performance (with the two measures applying 
independently to different parts of each award). 
   Governance
esure Group Annual Report 2013
105
Strategic Report
Financial Statements
26 Share-based payments (continued) 
EPS performance 
The EPS performance measure involves a comparison of the pro forma EPS figure for the year ended 31 December 2012 (calculated  
as the profit after taxation for the year ended 31 December 2012 divided by the aggregate number Ordinary Shares in existence  
on Admission) and the EPS figure reported in the Group’s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ending  
31 December 2015.  
For the portion of the award subject to the EPS measure: 
(i) 25 per cent will vest if EPS for the year ending 31 December 2015 exceeds the EPS for the year ended 31 December 2012 
(calculated on the basis described above) by 21 per cent; 
(ii) 100 per cent will vest if EPS for that year for the year ending 31 December 2015 exceeds the EPS for the year ended 31 December 
2012 (calculated on the basis described above) by 39 per cent; and 
(iii) If EPS for the year ending 2015 falls between these targets, vesting will occur on a straight-line basis. 
TSR performance  
TSR performance will be measured by comparing the Group’s TSR from the date of Admission to 31 December 2015 to the TSR of the 
constituents of the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts and the Company) over the same period. For the first PSP awards,  
the opening TSR of the Company will be the Offer Price. For the portion of the award subject to the TSR measure: 
(i) 25 per cent will vest if the Group achieves median TSR performance against this comparator group; 
(ii) 100 per cent will vest if the Group’s TSR performance is at the upper quartile or above; and 
(iii) If TSR performance is between the median and the upper quartile, vesting will occur on a straight-line basis. 
In addition, the first PSP awards will be subject to an additional term, which will allow the Remuneration Committee to reduce the  
level of vesting of each award if it considers that the vesting level is not appropriate having regard to the growth in profitability  
over the performance period. This PSP award will vest at the later of 3 years service and satisfaction of the performance conditions  
(as determined by the Remuneration Committee). The following table provides summarised information regarding all PSP awards:

Vested during the period Nil 
Number outstanding at 31 December 2013 710,082

Valuation of PSP awards 
As one-third of the awards are subject to a share price related (TSR) performance condition, the fair value of the awards was estimated 
using a stochastic Monte-Carlo model.  
The remaining two-thirds of the awards are not subject to a share-price related performance condition (EPS) and the fair value of the 
awards was estimated using a Black-Scholes valuation model. 
The inputs into the models were: 
Share price at grant £2.96 
Exercise price nil 
Volatility % p.a. 23.0% 
Dividend yield % p.a. nil 
Risk-free rate % 0.27% 
Expected life  3 years

employee free of charge. These awards, comprised of “Long Service” awards and “One-off” awards, will be satisfied using shares  
held by the Group employee benefit trust.  
Long Service awards 
These awards were made to eligible employees who did not already own shares in the Group and had been employed by the Group  
for more than two years at the point of Admission. The award levels were determined by length of service.

Vesting conditions Continuing employment or leavers under certain circumstances 
The awards outstanding at 31 December 2013 have no performance criteria attached, other than the requirement that the employee 
remains in employment with the Group for three years and shall not be subject to clawback.  
The estimated fair value of the Long Service awards at grant date was £4,088,917. The estimated fair value of each award was based 
upon the share price of Ordinary Shares at grant date of £2.96. 
One-off awards 
These awards were made to a number of senior employees of the Group.

Notes to the parent company ﬁ nancial statements
Parent company accounting policies 
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation  
to the financial statements except as noted below. 
1 Basis of preparation of financial statements 
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable  
accounting standards. 
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. In considering the appropriateness of this assumption,  
the Board has reviewed the Company’s projections for the next twelve months and beyond, including cash flow forecasts. 
Consequently, the Directors believe that the Company has adequate resources to remain a going concern for the foreseeable future. 
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the profit and loss account of the parent company is not presented. 
The financial statements do not include a cash flow statement because the Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare  
such a statement under FRS 1 (revised). The cash flows of the Company are included in the consolidated Group cash flow statement  
of esure Group plc. 
The parent company audit fee is not disclosed in these financial statements as it is disclosed in the consolidated financial statements 
for esure Group plc at note 10. 
2 Investments 
Investments in Group undertakings are stated in the balance sheet at cost. The cost of investments in Group undertakings includes the 
cost of granting equity instruments to the employees of subsidiaries, in line with the requirements of FRS 20.  
3 Taxation 
The tax rate used for the calculations is the corporate tax rate of 23.25% (2012: 24.5%) payable by the corporate entities in the UK  
on taxable profits under tax law in that jurisdiction. The rates used are those that apply to the year the tax charge or credit is expected 
to materialise. 
The expense for the year can be reconciled to profit before tax as follows:

Shareholder security 
Shareholders may receive unsolicited and suspicious phone calls from “brokers” offering to buy their shares at a price far in excess of 
their market value. We believe this may be a scam, commonly referred to as a ‘boiler room’. The callers obtain your details from publicly 
available sources of information. 
Shareholders are cautioned to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount, or to sell your shares at a 
premium. Remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!

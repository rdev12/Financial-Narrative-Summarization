Chief Executive Officer’s review and Strategy Pages 08–11 Tyman plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 05
Strategic report Financial statements Corporate governance
Financial discipline
Underpinning our business model is a focus on financial 
disciplines that encompasses margin targets for each of 
our products, close scrutiny of the cost base, optimisation of 
working capital, and a rigorous approach to return on capital 
and its allocation, both internally in the form of capital 
investment and externally in the form of M&A.
Quality and service
The manufacturing decision for Tyman comes back to our 
desire to differentiate our product offering from that of our 
competitors by providing customers with the highest quality 
product at the relevant price point, delivered to specification 
on time and in full.
This focus on quality and service leads to deeper 
customer relations, puts us front of mind as new designs 
are contemplated by OEMs and allows us to demonstrate 
our industry leadership credentials.
Where we source or manufacture
We choose to manufacture certain products, such as complex 
balances, extrusions and seals, close to our customer base when 
flexibility, variety or complexity are key to the component 
manufacturing process and to the customer.
For products that are less complex, have a high labour content 
or more predictable demand levels, we may choose to source 
from lower cost and sometimes more remote locations, often 
using third party manufacturers to make or assemble components 
on our behalf. Examples of sourced products would include handles 
and standard locks.
As part of the manufacturing decision we aim to ensure that we 
have flexibility in how we make or source the product such that we 
have built in redundancy. This may be geographic in the case of our 
own manufacturing plants, or may involve certifying and approving 
more than one potential supplier of a sourced product. This flexibility 
allows us to respond quickly to changes in product demand levels 
and to move manufacture around depending on capacity levels.
Our footprint review projects across all our divisions, most notably 
in North America, will allow us to improve our manufacturing 
processes still further and give us even greater flexibility.
Substantially all of the components we supply to our customers – 
whether manufactured by us in our own plants or sourced externally 
– are engineering-led, value-added products made to our designs, 
protected where possible and practical by patents and intellectual 
property, and manufactured on our own proprietary tooling.
Where we sell
We aim to optimise the manufacturing decision such that we 
can leverage our scale and geographic footprint in order to supply 
our customer base, whether it is our largest North American customers 
or our smaller local customers, with innovative solutions that are 
aligned with our quality and service standards.
In what remains a very fragmented industry in most markets, 
we believe Tyman is unique in being able to offer the complete 
range of door and window components to customers and to 
have a truly international offering.
Who we sell to
Our customers include OEMs, fabricators, distributors, retailers, 
builders’ merchants, architects, house builders and ultimately 
the homeowner.
What we sell
We aim to offer our customers a complete range of engineered 
components ranging from hardware such as handles, locks, 
keeps and hinges to seals and extrusions. For each of our end 
customers, wherever they are located, we aim to provide a 
differentiated product offering that will in turn allow them 
to add value to their customer proposition.
We believe we are the only manufacturer of scale that can offer 
our customer base the full range of door and window components.

2015 was a year of profitable growth for Tyman against a backdrop 
of more difficult market conditions in most of our key geographies. 
Housing markets continued to recover in the US, but at a slower 
pace than in recent years, and Canadian markets were impacted 
by a slowing economy. In the UK, markets were broadly flat across 
the year and, although certain European markets showed some 
encouraging signs, overall growth remained relatively subdued.
For 2015 we have reported revenue of £353.4 million, slightly ahead of 
2014. Despite only modest growth in the top line the Group increased 
reported underlying operating profit by 11.6 per cent to £51.4 million.
On a constant currency, like for like basis, revenue increased by 
0.4 per cent and underlying operating profit increased by 6.0 per cent. 
We demonstrated strong margin progression, with gross margins 
improving by 109 bps and underlying operating margins by 142 bps. 
Our underlying earnings per share increased by 3.4 per cent to 
19.25 pence (2014: 18.61 pence) reflecting improved profitability, 
higher interest charges and an increased underlying effective tax rate.
Return on capital employed improved by 110 bps to 12.5 per cent 
as we continue to make progress towards our medium term target 
of a ROCE of 15 per cent.
Leverage at the year end of 1.35x was 0.21x lower than 12 months 
ago and below our core year-end target range of 1.50x to 2.00x. 
Our operating cash conversion was strong at 84.9 per cent and this 
was achieved despite further investments made in the balance sheet 
during the year, including gross capital expenditure at 1.50x depreciation.
This robust financial performance demonstrates the progress that 
the Group has made over the past six years, as well as the resilience 
of the self help model that we have developed.
Operating division overview
AmesburyTruth saw broadly flat volumes in the year, but the Division 
significantly improved its profitability due to good progress on pricing 
initiatives and delivery of synergies.
2015 saw the completion of the integration of the Amesbury and Truth 
businesses in North America. Synergies realised from the combination 
since the 2013 acquisition total US$8.5 million – some 70 per cent 
ahead of our original estimate. We are making good progress with 
the first phase of the North American footprint project announced 
in March 2015 and still expect that this project will generate at least 
US$10.0 million of incremental profit for AmesburyTruth by 2020.
ERA had a more challenging year with the UK RMI market not showing 
the recovery expected in the second half of the year; however, our 
new product introductions were well received and we are starting 
to regain share in distribution. In September 2015 ERA completed 
the disposal of EWS for consideration of approximately £7.5 million.
In 201 5, end markets were more promising for Schlegel International with 
European markets, other than Russia, generally firmer across the year. The 
consolidation of European pile weatherstrip manufacture at our 
Newton Aycliffe, UK, plant will give the Division a more appropriate 
manufacturing footprint and lead to improved service levels.
It was a year of profitable growth for Tyman 
against a backdrop of more difficult market 
conditions in most of our key geographies.

Annual Report and Accounts 2015 07
Strategic report Financial statements Corporate governance
We have also announced the completion of two acquisitions, 
Response Electronics in ERA and Giesse in Schlegel International. 
Response will help accelerate the development of wireless alarms, 
electronic access and smart home capabilities within the Group and 
enhance our routes to market. Giesse represents our first European 
hardware acquisition, which has been one of our strategic priorities 
for some time, and is expected to strengthen the Group’s existing 
business model and underpin our growth objectives.
Investment in Tyman’s future
The progress we have made to date in strengthening the balance 
sheet, divesting non-core businesses such as EWS and improving 
our business provides a solid platform for the Group to invest for the 
delivery of our next phase of growth. Along with the realignment 
of the North American footprint announced in March 2015 and the 
changes made in the last two years to our European operations, 
we have recently announced the consolidation of our UK footprint 
to a new site located in the West Midlands. 
These changes to our footprint are significant in that they will provide 
the Divisions with the modern manufacturing, sourcing and distribution 
facilities necessary to support our future growth. Alongside these 
investments we continue to invest in new product development and 
supply chain in each of the Divisions as well as in our management 
teams, which we continue to build across all our geographies.
M&A
Targeted acquisitions have and will continue to be an important part 
of Group strategy. Our strategy remains to build a balanced portfolio 
of engineered components that we can offer to the door and window 
markets internationally. This will enable us to replicate the successful 
business model that we have in the US across other markets and 
geographies.
The announcement of the acquisition of Giesse is an important 
development in the next growth phase of the Group providing us 
with a high quality engineered hardware product offering for the 
aluminium window and door market for the first time. 
Acquisitions bring with them management challenges and elevated 
risk along with opportunities. We manage these challenges and risks 
through our clear acquisition criteria, our due diligence process and a 
commitment to the full integration of every business we acquire over 
an appropriate period. Each acquisition is discussed and reviewed by 
the Board at regular intervals during the diligence process and 
following completion.
Corporate governance
As Chairman, my principal role is to lead the Board effectively 
and to ensure that the Board sets the tone for the Group’s corporate 
governance and risk management processes. An important factor in 
achieving this is ensuring that good corporate governance procedures 
are practised throughout the Group in each of the countries that 
we operate in. 
In order to enable shareholders to understand how this is achieved 
we have provided a corporate governance statement on pages 47 to 51 
of this report. This describes how the governance structure underpins 
the delivery of the Group’s business strategy. On pages 33 to 34 we 
have also outlined the principal risks that may prevent Tyman from 
achieving its objectives and the actions that we are taking to 
mitigate these potential risks.
The Board
Our approach as a Board is for the Non-executive Directors to be 
closely engaged with the business and supportive of the Executive 
Directors and management team, whilst embracing the principles 
of transparency and open debate. 
In May, as Non-executive Directors, Kirsten English and Mark Rollins 
joined the Board. Kirsten has joined the Audit, Nominations and 
Remuneration Committees of the Board and Mark has taken on the 
chairmanship of the Remuneration Committee, as well as becoming a 
member of the Audit and Nominations Committees. Both Kirsten 
and Mark bring to the Board diverse and relevant business and 
governance experience.
We have continued our practice of holding regular Board meetings in 
each of the Divisions and, during the year, visited Group sites at ERA 
in Willenhall and AmesburyTruth in Toronto. In November the Board 
attended the Group management conference hosted by ERA in London 
where we participated in a number of workshops and product 
demonstrations. Kirsten and Mark have also visited various 
Divisional sites as part of their induction programme. 
These visits and engagements allow Board members the opportunity 
to meet with a significant cross section of the Group’s Divisional 
management and employees at all levels as well to see at first 
hand the Group’s manufacturing and distribution processes.
Health and safety
Improving the general working conditions for our employees and 
ensuring that the Group operates to the highest standards of health 
and safety remains a key priority for the Board. Progress, as evidenced 
by declines in the number and nature of recorded incidents across 
the Group, has been slower than we would have hoped over the course 
of the past two years, despite considerable focus and engagement at 
all levels of the organisation. We will continue to devote the necessary 
time and resources required to improve our health and safety record.
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final dividend for 2015 of 6.09 pence 
per share (2014: 6.00 pence per share) which, together with the interim 
dividend of 2.66 pence per share, gives a 9.4 per cent increase in the 
total dividend for the year to 8.75 pence per share (2014: 8.00 pence 
per share).
Finally, while we are justifiably proud of the products we manufacture 
and the service we give to our customers, it is our employees who 
have delivered the progress that we have made. It is their efforts that 
have made the Group more flexible and more adaptable over the 
past six years and on behalf of the Board I would like to thank them.
Jamie Pike
Non-executive Chairman
8 March 2016
Targeted acquisitions 
have and will continue 
to be an important part 
of Group strategy.” Strategic report
2015 was a year of profitable growth for Tyman against a backdrop 
of more difficult market conditions in most of our key geographies. 
Despite subdued markets, a combination of pricing initiatives, 
business improvements, new product launches and synergy delivery 
again ensured that the Group generated strong profit dropthrough, 
margin management and cash conversion across the year as a whole.
2016 has started in line with our expectations across each of the 
Divisions. Although we expect that the majority of our markets will 
remain challenging, we will continue to deploy our self help strategy 
to enhance our operating efficiency and improve our cost base.
We will continue to develop and extend the Group’s product portfolio 
through a combination of internal R&D and targeted acquisitions. 
The improvements we have made to the Group over the past six years, 
combined with our strong financial position, mean that we remain 
well positioned to take advantage of opportunities as they arise.
We are pleased to have completed the acquisitions of Giesse and 
Response and, on behalf of the Board, I would like to welcome their 
respective management and employees to the Group.
Outlook
The current year has started in line with our expectations across 
each of the Divisions.
In the US, permit and start levels for single family homes strengthened 
somewhat over the second half of 2015 giving us confidence that 
2016 should see a further year of growth in the US new build market. 
Repairs and Remodelling (“R&R”) is also expected to show year on 
year improvement; however, this is expected to be at similar levels 
to those seen in 2015 rather than a return to 2014 growth rates. We 
expect that the Canadian market will continue to contract in 2016.
The subdued UK market conditions seen in 2015 are expected to 
persist into 2016 with continued growth in new build but uncertain 
growth prospects for RMI markets. ERA expects that it will be able 
to regain some market share during 2016 through growth in both 
the OEM and distribution channels.
Despite subdued markets the Group 
generated strong profit dropthrough, 
margin management and cash conversion 
across the year as a whole.
Chief Executive Officer’s review and Strategy
Summary
• 
Profitable growth despite subdued markets
• 
Opportunities expected from integration of Giesse
• 
Continued deployment of self help strategy in 2016 Tyman plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 09
Strategic report Financial statements Corporate governance
In 2016 we expect that European markets will remain similar to those 
seen in 2015 with certain markets showing modest growth off a low 
base. Progress will therefore depend on successful implementation of 
self help initiatives. Our streamlined manufacturing footprint should 
enable the businesses to be more responsive to customer demand; 
however, material profit improvement in the core Schlegel sealing 
business remains dependent on European volumes recovering towards 
historic levels which, given the macroeconomic environment, we see 
little sign of coming through in 2016.
We expect continued improvement in Australasian markets in 
2016; however, Brazil and China are likely to remain subdued for 
the foreseeable future.
The integration of Giesse into Schlegel International is expected to lead 
to opportunities for cross selling of product into the respective Schlegel 
and Giesse customer bases and the increased size of the Division should 
lead to improved operational efficiency. Giesse has traded in line with 
expectations in the year to date.

Strategic report
Chief Executive Officer’s review and Strategy continued
We will retain our focus on 
pricing discipline and margin 
management in 2016.”
2016 priorities
Our key priorities for 2016 are a continuation of the themes we 
developed in 2015 and include:
1.
The successful integration of Giesse and Response into the T yman Group, 
along with implementation of the synergy plans we have developed.
2.
Completion of the first phase of the AmesburyTruth footprint project 
together with the construction and fit out of ERA’s new West Midlands 
facility and the exit from Schlegel International’s facility in Barcelona.
Our aim is to ensure that each Division operates from safe, modern 
and flexible facilities that are able to manage the increasing demands 
of their respective customer bases. Our footprint needs to be appropriate 
for the medium term needs of the business, taking into account 
opportunities for near shoring of those products best made or 
sourced close to the point of consumption.
3.
Continuing to encourage strong communication, consistency of 
approach and standards of excellence across each of the Divisions. 
For our end customer, wherever they are located, this should mean 
the availability of a differentiated product offering at an appropriate 
price, delivered to specification, on time and in full. 
4.
Financial objectives for each of our Divisions for the year remain 
centred on sustained margin improvement and cash generation 
along with continued growth in the Group’s average return on 
capital. We will retain our focus on pricing discipline and margin 
management in 2016.
5.
Continued investment in and improvement of the businesses, in 
particular in the areas of new product development, people, supply 
chain and capital projects with a focus on automation and lean 
manufacturing to ensure we differentiate ourselves from our 
competitors and continue to grow market share.
6.
Supplementing our organic and self help initiatives through our 
active acquisition programme, prioritising European markets where 
we currently have a niche seals range and where Giesse gives the 
Group a comprehensive European hardware offering for the first 
time. Commercial markets in North America and emerging markets 
where market position can best be obtained through acquisition also 
remain areas of interest.

Annual Report and Accounts 2015 11
Strategic report Financial statements Corporate governance
Our aims
Increasing our revenue through consistent 
market share gain and pricing discipline.
Maximising margins by eliminating 
cost and waste from processes.
Focusing on capital allocation 
and cash generation.
A
 Market share gain
We aim to secure profitable market share increases annually through 
deeper penetration of the existing customer base, the development 
of new products and winning new customers. The breadth of our 
product offering and our ability to offer customers engineered 
solutions means that in each of our markets we believe there is 
opportunity for the Group to continue to increase its market share.
B
 Pricing discipline
We target minimum gross margin thresholds for each of our 
product lines, and in pricing consider the end to end cost of 
providing the necessary product and service to our customers. 
For our ultimate customer, wherever they are located, our aim 
is to provide a differentiated product offering at an appropriate 
price, delivered to specification, on time and in full.
C
 Maximising margins
We continually scrutinise our manufacturing and sourcing processes 
to ensure that we are providing products to the customer in the most 
efficient manner. Divisions operate rolling programmes of process 
improvement engineering designed to eliminate unnecessary cost 
from our processes and reduce scrap levels.
D
 Elimination of cost and waste
Divisions closely monitor the quality of products, both within the 
production process and once products have entered the installed 
base, in order to ensure that our commitment to quality endures 
beyond the point of sale.
E
 Focus on capital allocation
We adopt a rigorous appraisal process for all items of capital 
investment in order to ensure that all investments are supported 
by a robust business case. Divisional investment plans are required 
to provide an attractive return to the Group overall, while also 
ensuring that we continue to invest in making the Group’s facilities 
safe, leading edge and attractive working environments that are 
fit for purpose for an international manufacturing organisation.
F
 Focus on cash generation
All of our business units aim to utilise working capital efficiently 
and convert profits to cash while maintaining high levels of 
customer satisfaction through industry-leading levels of order 
fulfilment. Each Division is allocated specific cash targets which 
are monitored throughout the year and flexed according to demand 
levels. Divisions are encouraged to seek out opportunities to secure 
permanent reductions in working capital.
Our strategy is to create shareholder value through 
being a leading international supplier of components 
to the door and window industry. The group monitors and measures performance 
against its KPIs, which are in line with the strategic 
priorities of the Group.
KPI Purpose 2015 performance
Like for like revenue growth
Year on year revenue growth from 
continuing operations measured 
on a like for like basis.

C
 
The KPI measures the directional 
trend in revenue. The KPI is used 
to evaluate the ability of the Group 
to grow its customer base and 
improve its margins.
Revenue has increased 
marginally in the year by 
0.4 per cent on a constant 
currency like for like 
basis. Reported revenue 
increased by 0.7 per cent, 
with challenging conditions 
across the International 
Division and the loss of 
UK distribution business to 
competitors impacting growth.
Gross margin
Gross profit from continuing 
operations as a percentage of 
revenue from continuing operations.
Target
To maintain gross margin at greater 
than 30 per cent and incrementally 
increase it over time. 
Impact on strategy

D
Gross margin is a relative 
measure of each Pound of 
revenue remaining after all direct 
manufacturing costs have been 
incurred. The KPI is used to 
evaluate the profitability and 
financial health of the Group. 
Gross margin has improved 
109 bps, benefiting from 
pricing initiatives and the 
general raw material backdrop 
although offset in part by the 
weakness of Sterling. 
Underlying operating margin
Underlying operating profit 
from continuing operations as 
a percentage of revenue from

Underlying operating margins 
improved by 142 bps principally 
due to the favourable impact 
of pricing actions and material 
cost movements as well as 
productivity gains from the 
delivery of synergy benefits 
in the US.

Return on capital employed
Return on controllable capital employed
ROCE improved by 110 bps 
due to the combined effect 
of the 11.6 per cent increase 
in underlying operating profit 
and the fall in the average 
capital employed in the year. 
The write off of goodwill and 
intangibles arising on disposal 
of businesses and impairment 
contributed to the lower 
average capital employed 
at the year end. 
Return on controllable capital 
employed was broadly flat due 
to a marginal increase in the 
Group’s controllable capital 
employed – in part due to the 
disposal of EWS.

The KPI is used to determine the 
improvement in underlying EPS 
for our shareholders. 
Underlying earnings per 
share increased by 3.4 per cent 
to 19.25 pence. The increase 
reflects the improvements in 
underlying operating profit 
offset by the increased finance 
charge and the higher effective 
tax rate for the year.

All acquisitions target a run rate ROAI 
greater than 15 per cent in the first 
two years following acquisition. 
Impact on strategy
D
 
E
 
F
 
ROAI is used to evaluate 
the efficiency and returns 
achieved by the Group and its 
investments in recent material 
business acquisitions.
Synergy benefits together with 
general business improvements 
and a recovering market has 
meant that ROAI for the Truth 
acquisition has significantly 
exceeded our acquisitions 
returns threshold.
Despite difficult markets in 
Brazil, the Vedasil acquisition 
has given the Group a platform 
for growth in South America and 
has made a solid contribution to 
the Schlegel Division’s returns.
On time in full delivery rate
Proportion of customer orders that are 
delivered in full within the customer 
required time slot. 
Target
To maintain and steadily improve the 
on time delivery rate to achieve an on 
time in full delivery performance to 
customer request of over 95 per cent. 
Impact on strategy
D
 
Our OTIF delivery rate is used 
to evaluate the manufacturing 
productivity and how efficient 
the business is at meeting 
delivery deadlines. 
The on time delivery rate 
decreased to 87.1 per cent 
from 90.8 per cent in 2014. 
OTIF performance for the 
Group was impacted by 
factory moves in North 
America and Europe 
arising from footprint 
rationalisation programmes.
Lost time injuries
Lost time injury rate: the 
number of lost time incidents 
per 100,000 hours worked. 
Number of lost time injuries: 
the absolute number of lost time 
injuries over the last 12 months. 
Target
To reduce the number of injuries 
and lost work time hourly rates year 
on year. 
Impact on strategy
D
 
These KPIs evaluate the 
frequency and directional trend 
of reported injuries. The KPIs 
provide an indication of whether 
health and safety regulations 
and policies are being adhered 
to by the Group’s operating units.
Although the Group’s safety 
culture is progressing well, 
the increase in both KPIs was 
disappointing. The severity 
of incidents was minor and 
the majority were preventable. 
Reduction in these KPIs remains 
a key priority for the Board.
Employee turnover rate
Employees terminated voluntarily 
or involuntarily in the last 12 months 
as a percentage of the monthly 
average headcount in the year. 
Target
To reduce the employee turnover 
rate year on year. 
Impact on strategy
C
 
D
 
The employee turnover rate is 
used to evaluate the frequency 
of and the directional trend in 
employee turnover. The KPI 
provides an indication of the 
avoidable costs associated with 
terminations, including training, 
inefficiencies, etc. 
The rise in the employee 
turnover rate is principally 
due to redundancies 
associated with the footprint 
rationalisations in North 
America and Europe, as well 
as the consolidation of the 
Fab & Fix and ERA businesses 
in the UK.

Markets
The housing market in the US continued to recover through 2015 with 
seasonally adjusted residential private housing starts up 6.4 per cent in 
the year to 1,149,000 and completions (our most relevant in-year new 
build indicator) up 7.9 per cent to 1,013,000. Single family housing 
starts increased by 6.1 per cent and completions by 4.7 per cent in 
the year.
R&R overall continued to improve, although growth was at a much 
slower rate than seen in 2014. The NAHB Remodelling Market Index 
for 2015 increased by 5.3 per cent (2014 restated: 11.2 per cent); 
however, many of our customers expressed the view that window 
and door R&R fell behind the overall R&R market during the year. 
Accordingly we believe that growth in window and door R&R in 
2015 was closer to 2.0 per cent. In commercial we estimate that 
the US market grew by 10.2 per cent in the year.
Taking into account our customers’ views on R&R, we believe the 
market for our products in the US improved by around 3.7 per cent 
in 2015.
The Canadian market saw significant weakness in single family 
construction with starts decreasing by 9.8 per cent and completions 
by 7.0 per cent. Multi-family, where we have a much smaller presence, 
continued to grow with starts increasing by 12.0 per cent and 
completions by 17.2 per cent. Overall, we believe that the Canadian 
market for our products contracted by approximately 3.0 per cent 
across the year as a whole.
Combining the US and Canadian statistics would indicate the 
addressable North American market for AmesburyTruth grew by 
just over 2.0 per cent over the year.
Performance
AmesburyTruth’s revenue improved by 1.8 per cent on a 
constant currency like for like basis year on year to US$363.8 million 
(2014: US$363.7 million). Reported revenue translated into Sterling 
increased by 7.8 per cent to £238.0 million (2014: £220.7 million) 
benefiting from the strengthening of the US Dollar over the year.
Volumes were broadly flat for the Division year on year; however, 
we made good progress during the year with pricing initiatives. 
These included a general price increase across most product lines, the 
refinement of list prices for low volume and lower margin business 
and a review of freight, discounting and cost to serve arrangements.

• 
Continued recovery of housing market in the US
• 
Overall contraction in Canadian market
•

Appropriate pricing, margin management and price discipline will 
remain a focus for AmesburyTruth in 2016.
Like for like underlying operating profit increased by 11.2 per cent to 
US$66.6 million (2014: US$60.1 million) and underlying operating 
margin improved from 16.5 per cent to 18.3 per cent due to the 
dropthrough of incremental pricing and delivery of synergies.
Revenue generated in the US increased by approximately 3.8 per cent 
(2014: 7.3 per cent) in the year with a number of our larger customers 
having relatively strong years, despite the general market backdrop. 
Margin management and price discipline meant that we conceded 
some market share among smaller customers in the US during the 
year; however, encouragingly towards the end of the year a number 
of those customers started to return. We are conducting an evaluation 
of how we might restructure our route to market for our smaller 
customers such that we can improve our service levels still further. 
Consolidation among the customer base continued in 2015, which 
we expect will allow AmesburyTruth further opportunities to sell its 
differentiated product offering.
We had a more mixed year in terms of our three strategic priorities. 
We made further progress in door hardware with revenue increasing 
by 8.3 per cent (2014: 13.2 per cent) as we continue to take share 
through a mix of deeper penetration of existing accounts and new 
customer wins. Commercial, which tends to be more project based 
and where we remain a relatively small player, increased revenue 
by 1.0 per cent (2014: 23.6 per cent). Canadian revenue decreased 
by 9.5 per cent (2014: 13.0 per cent increase) reflecting the difficult 
market conditions in 2015, particularly in Western Canada and the 
significant depreciation in the value of the Canadian Dollar against 
the US Dollar across the year.
AmesburyTruth Training Academy
The AmesburyTruth Training Academy (“ATA”) opened its doors to 
its first class in February 2015 at our Owatonna, Minnesota, facility. 
All training courses are facilitated by AmesburyTruth’s corporate 
trainer and other ATA team members including supervisors and 
team leaders. 
Courses extend for a two-week period and cover both theoretical 
and practical areas of operations on the production floor. 
Employees first receive classroom training on subjects such as safety, 
reading and understanding blueprints, shop orders and control plans. 
Employees then move on to the hands-on training centre, with 
operating machinery that is set up to replicate those on the 
production floor. This approach ensures that errors are mitigated 
when employees are operating in the real-life environment.
Both new and existing manufacturing employees are eligible 
to attend the ATA and training is set in a supportive setting that 
facilitates learning. This is in line with the objective of ensuring 
employees leave the ATA better prepared to undertake their 
day-to-day responsibilities with confidence and join their 
co-workers as successful and productive employees. 
Feedback from both employees and their managers on the ATA 
programme have been positive. The ATA team continues to make 
changes to the programme, based on feedback from attendees, 
to ensure training remains relevant and comprehensive, and that 
the future success of employees and operations is continued. 
Since the launch of ATA, almost 150 employees have successfully 
completed the training course. AmesburyTruth has seen positive 
results from ATA in the form of improved employee retention, quality 
and production efficiencies and is intending to model the success 
of the Owatonna programme to other sites within the Division. Tyman plc

Strategic report
Operational review continued
North American footprint review and evaluation
In March 2015 we announced a five-year plan to reduce the number 
of sites that the Group operates within North America, while still 
ensuring that AmesburyTruth retains sufficient flexibility to service 
its customer base and take share in a growing market.
We continue to believe that this project will bring significant 
opportunities to drive efficiencies and improve how AmesburyTruth 
services its customer base, as well as to lead further improvements 
in the Division’s financial performance.
As part of the project we have announced the planned closure of 
the Canton, South Dakota plant which will complete by the end of 
this year. We have taken additional space at our Juarez, Mexico plant, 
more than doubling the size of the facility, and completed a number 
of plant and equipment moves. We have now identified the preferred 
locations of the four manufacturing centres of excellence and are 
engaged in discussions with landlords and local authorities concerning 
the most appropriate layout for each of the facilities. Phase one of 
the project remains on schedule to complete in the first quarter of 
2017 and we expect the overall project will complete by 2020.
Capital expenditure was broadly in line with the plan outlined in 
March 2015, however, P&L costs in the year were lower than expected 
due to phasing of the project. Over the year we have refined our 
estimates of the total costs of the project and their likely phasing. 
We still expect that the annualised cost benefits of the successful 
implementation of the footprint restructuring will be not less than 
US$10.0 million per annum, with incremental benefits from the 
restructuring starting to flow from 2017 and full benefits from 2020.
North American outlook
Permit and start levels for single family homes strengthened 
somewhat over the second half of 2015 giving us confidence that 
2016 should see a further year of growth in the US new build market. 
R&R is also expected to show year on year improvement; however, this 
is expected to be at similar levels to those seen in 2015 rather than 
a return to 2014 growth rates.
We expect that the Canadian market will continue to contract in 
2016 and, given the sustained depreciation in the Canadian Dollar, 
are exploring how best to serve our Canadian customer base.
2016 initiatives include the completion of the first phase of our 
North American footprint project and additional ERP implementations 
across a number of sites. We will continue to improve our facilities 
in order to make them safer operating environments and to invest 
in the training and development of our employees. We also continue 
to explore acquisition opportunities in North America, particularly 
in the commercial space.
Business developments
During 2015 the integration of the Amesbury and Truth businesses 
generated approximately US$8.5 million of cumulative cost and revenue 
synergies, some 70 per cent higher than the original synergy target 
announced at the time of the acquisition.
We completed a key ERP implementation in our hardware business 
encompassing three sites, including Juarez, Mexico, and two business 
lines. This has led to a significant improvement in the quality of data 
available to the business. Preparations are now underway for a further 
two facilities to join the ERP system during the course of 2016.
We closed the Ontario, California facility with core extrusion 
manufacturing being transferred to our extrusion centre of excellence 
in Cannon Falls, Minnesota. Coupler manufacturing was transferred 
to the Fremont, Nebraska facility with the remaining non-core revenue 
stream being sold to a local generalist extruder.
Four automation projects were delivered in 2015 with a total investment 
of approximately US$1.8 million, principally in the area of hinge 
assembly. Automation of less efficient manual processes remains a 
focus for the Group and a key element of the North American footprint 
project includes the review of existing manufacturing processes and 
whether they remain fit for purpose.
We have continued with initiatives to develop the next generation 
of products across certain key segments of our portfolio including foam 
door and window seals, window balances and casement operators 
and have a number of products that will come to market in 2016. 
We successfully converted production of our premium Q-Lon product to 
a more environmentally friendly formulation and are exploring whether 
this can be applied to Q-Lon manufacture in Schlegel International.
The AmesburyTruth training academy at Owatonna, Minnesota 
launched during the year and has had pleasing initial results with 
increased levels of shop floor employee retention and reduced 
requirement for temporary hires. We will introduce a modified 
version of the academy in our Juarez, Mexico facility during 2016.
A key focus for the Division since the acquisition of Truth in 2013 has 
been on improving overall levels of safety in the workplace and in 
particular the ergonomic environment that AmesburyTruth employees 
have to work in. While progress in safety improvements has been 
slower than we would have liked, the various initiatives in this area have 
led to a reduction in workers’ compensation claims for AmesburyTruth 
from US$1.2 million in 2012 to US$0.6 million in 2015.

Market
The UK market was more subdued in 2015 with RMI not sustaining 
the consistent growth that we had seen in 2013 and 2014. New build, 
which only comprises approximately 10 per cent of the market, 
continued to make progress during 2015.
The Construction Products Association estimates that UK Private Housing 
RMI overall grew by c. 2.0 per cent during the year (2014: 8.2 per cent) 
and estimates that new build activity in 201 5 increased by approximately 
10.0 per cent (2014: 10.0 per cent). Overall, we believe that the market 
for ERA’s products (excluding EWS) improved slightly in 2015 
although at a much slower rate than in 2014.
Performance
ERA had a mixed year with some growth and share gains being 
generated through the OEM customer base, but with a disappointing 
performance in distribution where we lost some share.
Reported revenue decreased overall by 9.7 per cent to £78.1 million 
(2014 restated: £86.5 million) and reported underlying operating 
profit decreased by 11.1 per cent to £11.6 million (2014 restated: 
£13.0 million).
Once the impact of the disposal of EWS is stripped out, the decline 
in revenue was 1.5 per cent and in underlying operating profit was 
8.7 per cent with the lower volumes through distribution in particular 
impacting profitability. The relative strength of Sterling also depressed 
underlying operating profit by approximately £1.5 million over the 
course of the year and more than offset any benefits derived by the 
Division from lower raw material costs in the Far East. In part this 
was recovered through pricing actions.
We saw strong growth in our Bifold hardware offering, which continues 
to take significant share in the market. Our new products, including the 
proprietary Invincible
TM
 cylinder lock and our refreshed range of PVC 
window hardware, also performed well and we successfully launched 
our first range of electromechanical products into the UK market.
Ventrolla, our sash window refurbishment business, had another strong 
year with revenue increasing some 6.8 per cent (2014: 14.4 per cent) 
and continues to make good progress in developing its domestic 
and commercial businesses.
Key highlights
• 
More subdued UK market conditions
• 
Strong growth of Bifold hardware offering
• 
New products launched in the year performed well
• 
Disappointing performance in distribution
• 
Continue to target market share growth from both 
OEM and distribution channels

Business developments
The rebranding of Grouphomesafe as ERA during 2015 was well 
received by the market and we have since extended the rebranding 
to encompass our UK window balance business. The ERA Division 
now comprises the ERA door, window and lock businesses, Response 
Electronics, Fab & Fix and Ventrolla.
We have made further investment in the ERA leadership team and 
made new external appointments in the year to a number of key 
roles including HR, operations, supply chain and sales. We have also 
reappraised our approach to the distribution sector and are starting 
to win back some listings.
We have continued to invest in our supply chain and have made 
good progress in establishing Tyman Sourcing Asia, which now has 
responsibility for all the Group’s Far Eastern sourcing activities. 
Improvements in forecasting within supply chain led to a two-thirds 
reduction in air freight charges incurred by the Division during the year.
During 2016 we intend to consolidate our three UK distribution 
sites onto a single location in the West Midlands. Plans are well 
advanced for the development of a mixed use site that will include 
our distribution warehousing, light manufacturing and assembly 
capabilities, a test centre, offices and a showroom. It is expected that 
the new site will be available for occupation in the first half of 2017. 
In 2015, in preparation for the consolidation, we restructured a 
number of back office functions across the Division and migrated 
Fab & Fix and ERA onto a common IT platform.
Ventrolla has also recently announced plans to relocate to a new 
facility in Harrogate that will allow the business to expand its joinery 
operation and enhance its customer proposition. Total capital 
expenditure associated with the two relocation projects is estimated 
at £4.0 million.
M&A activity in ERA
In September 201 5 we completed the disposal of EWS for consideration 
of approximately £7.5 million. In 2015, up until the date of disposal, 
EWS contributed revenue of £11.3 million (FY2014: £18.7 million) 
to the Group and underlying operating profit of £1.3 million 
(FY2014: £1.7 million).
On 3 March 2016, ERA acquired Response Electronics. Response 
is a specialist sales, marketing and distribution business focused 
on wireless alarms, electronic access and smart home products.
Response owns a number of consumer brands as well as UK 
distribution rights to a variety of high quality electromechanical 
products. In addition, Response offers e-commerce expertise and 
access to established relationships with national UK and online 
retailers that should help improve ERA’s distribution route to market. 
The acquisition of Response will also help accelerate the development 
of wireless alarms, electronic access and smart home capabilities 
within the Group.
ERA has paid an initial cash consideration of £0.9 million with 
a further capped payment to be made in 2019 determined on 
a multiple of the underlying EBITDA generated by Response in 
the year ending 31 December 2018.
In the 12 months ended 31 December 2015, Response recorded 
revenue of approximately £3.4 million.
UK outlook
The subdued UK market conditions seen in 2015 are expected to 
persist into 2016 with continued growth in new build but uncertain 
growth prospects for RMI markets. ERA expects that it will be able 
to regain some market share during 2016 through growth in both 
the OEM and distribution channels.
The Division’s online portal, ERA Everywhere, has now been launched 
and over the course of the year we will start to migrate our OEM 
customer base onto online ordering of product. Our new electronic 
lock offering is now in testing and will be launched to the market 
before the half year and we continue to target further market share 
gains with our Bifold hardware range. Tyman plc

ERA Approved Partner Scheme
During 2015, ERA launched a brand new initiative with the 
Master Locksmith Association (“MLA”) – the ERA Approved 
Partner Scheme. The scheme allows any homeowner across 
the UK to have a free home security survey completed by one 
of the MLA’s approved members. 
Why ERA and the MLA?
• 
ERA locking hardware is the first choice for most MLA locksmiths.
• 
ERA has been securing Britain’s homes since 1838.
• 
The MLA is the longest and largest established locksmiths 
association in the UK.
• 
The MLA promotes skills and ethics within the industry and 
governs the excellence and performance of its members.
• 
Every MLA member is vetted, inspected and qualified to visit 
your home.
ERA Window and Door Safety Restrictor
ERA’s stylishly designed Window and Door Safety Restrictor offers 
a universal solution for windows and doors where a restricted 
opening is required.
Ideally suited to homes with families, the locking restrictor is a 
compliant child resistant locking device for window and balcony 
doors in accordance with BS EN 16281:2013.
What is the ERA home security survey?
Homeowners are able to search on the ERA website for a local 
MLA approved locksmith. The chosen MLA locksmith will visit 
the homeowner’s home, carry out a free security survey and 
provide recommendations for work that needs to be carried 
out and the associated cost.
Benefits of the ERA Approved Partner Scheme
This ERA-generated lead and potential upgrade work may give 
rise to further reach and increased business for the MLA member. 
For ERA, working closely with the MLA allows the Division to:
• 
generate product loyalty from the MLA members;
• 
spread the ERA brand message to homeowners; and 
• 
increase sales through ERA’s distribution channels.
The restrictor has been tested to 50,000 cycles and is classified in 
accordance with BS EN 13126-1:2011 Grade 3 Impact Resistance. 
The aesthetically designed push-to-open cable lock comes with 
cut key locking for security and has been ergonomically developed 
for easy operation. To lock, insert the cable into the lock body and 
turn the key. To unlock, simply insert the key, remove and press the 
button to release the cable. Tyman plc

Markets and performance
Schlegel’s revenue decreased by 14.5 per cent to £37.4 million 
(2014 restated: £43.7 million); however, on a constant currency like 
for like basis the revenue decline was less marked at approximately 
4.6 per cent. Underlying operating profit and margin each showed

2 EMEA excluding the UK and Ireland.
Following the changes made to the operating segments, Schlegel 
International now includes the sealing revenue and operating profit 
generated in the UK and Ireland. In 2015 sealing revenue in the UK 
and Ireland was approximately £6.4 million (2014: £7.0 million) with 
the decline year on year principally due to the slowdown in RMI 
markets seen in 2015 and the impact of a notably strong 
comparative in Q4 2014.
Trading conditions in the rest of EMEA, other than Russia, were 
generally firmer than in 2014 and Scandinavia, Benelux, Poland and 
Spain in particular saw more promising levels of growth across the 
year as a whole. Our three largest Continental European markets 
of Germany, France and Italy each had stronger second halves 
to the year.
If the impact of the significant decline in Russia is removed, our EMEA 
revenue outside the UK and Ireland increased by approximately 
1.5 per cent in the year, the first increase in revenue in these markets 
overall for some years.
Key highlights
• 
European markets, other than Russia,

Markets and performance continued
The Brazilian economy was in recession in 2015 and construction 
markets were impacted by the economic slow down; however, 
our business in Brazil has a market leadership position and made 
a meaningful contribution to the Division’s performance. 
In Australia we continued to take share through the sale of Truth 
products and recorded a solid sales performance from our core pile 
weatherstrip offering. Singapore was broadly flat across the year 
as a whole.
Profitability in Schlegel International improved year on year, 
reflecting the generally more stable trading environment in Europe, 
continued growth in the sale of Truth and other hardware products 
through the Division and reduced overheads following the closure of 
the Industrial Products business. 2014 comparatives were depressed 
somewhat by higher than usual levels of bad debt provision, 
reflecting the difficult trading seen in that year.
Business developments
During September 2015 we announced the closure of our Barcelona, 
Spain manufacturing facility and have now consolidated the manufacture 
of pile weatherstrip product for Europe at our Newton Aycliffe site 
in the North East of England.
This consolidation will give the Division a more appropriate 
manufacturing footprint and lead to improved service levels. Total 
cash costs of closure and relocation are estimated at approximately 
¤8.0 million. The closure is expected to be completed in the second 
half of 2016 when the current lease in Barcelona expires.
The Division has continued to develop its product portfolio during 
the year, as it aims to offer a complete range of sealing solutions 
to the market. New product introductions in 2015 included the 
development and launch of a new extruded power pile product, 
further independent verification of the superior performance 
of our Q-Lon foam product, and the development of a foamed 
TPE glazing seal.
The lockable casement operator developed in partnership with 
AmesburyTruth was successfully launched in Australia in 2015.
Outlook
In 2016 we expect that European markets will remain similar to those 
seen in 2015 with certain markets showing modest growth off a low 
base. Progress will therefore depend on successful implementation of 
self help initiatives. Our streamlined manufacturing footprint should 
enable the businesses to be more responsive to customer demand; 
however, material profit improvement in the core Schlegel sealing 
business remains dependent on European volumes recovering 
towards historic levels which, given the macroeconomic environment, 
we see little sign of coming through in 2016.
We expect continued improvement in Australasian markets in 2016; 
however, Brazil and China are likely to remain subdued for the 
foreseeable future.
The integration of Giesse into Schlegel International is expected to 
lead to opportunities for cross selling of product into the respective 
Schlegel and Giesse customer bases and the increased size of the 
Division should lead to improved operational efficiency. Giesse has 
traded in line with expectations in the year to date.
2015 “Safety First” campaign 
Schlegel’s commitment to health and safety is based on the 
principle that, when the work is done, employees go home safe 
and well to their loved ones.
Extending this theme as a 2015 initiative, employees at our 
European operations were asked to reinforce this message 
through the use of the talent and imagination of their children.
Under the heading Safety First, the children were asked what 
Safety First means to them through illustrations across age 
categories of up to six, seven to 12 and 13 plus. Numerous entries 
were received and winners were selected by vote of attendees at 
the Schlegel European Sales Conference in March 2015. 
The winning illustrations were used as part of Schlegel’s rolling 
safety campaign in factories throughout the year and as part 
of the Division’s goal of making Schlegel a safer place to work.  Strategic report
year on year by £3.6 million and material cost movements were 
£0.8 million favourable. These more than offset general inflation 
increases of £2.5 million. Year on year productivity gains principally 
reflect delivery of synergy benefits in the US.
Underlying profit before taxation increased by 7.9 per cent to 
£44.9 million (2014: £41.6 million) and increased by 2.9 per cent on 
a constant currency like for like basis. Reported profit before taxation 
increased by 30.8 per cent to £15.6 million (2014: £11.9 million).
Despite a small decrease in volumes overall, 
we demonstrated good dropthrough during 
the year with underlying operating margins 
increasing by 142 bps to 14.6 per cent.
Financial review
Revenue and profit
Reported Group revenue increased by 0.7 per cent to £353.4 million 
(2014: £350.9 million). On a constant currency, like for like basis, Group 
revenue increased by approximately 0.4 per cent year on year.
Reported gross margin improved by 109 bps to 33.8 per cent 
(2014: 32.7 per cent), benefiting from pricing initiatives and the 
general raw material backdrop, although offset in part by the 
weakness of Sterling.
Underlying administrative expenses decreased slightly to £68.0 million 
(2014: £68.7 million), principally reflecting continued delivery of cost 
synergy benefits in AmesburyTruth along with tight cost control 
across the Group as a whole.
Underlying operating profit increased by 1 1.6 per cent to £51.4 million 
(2014: £46.1 million) and by 6.0 per cent on a constant currency

Amendments to operating segment analysis
Following the closure of the Group’s Barcelona, Spain facility, 
the Board reviewed the appropriateness of the disclosure 
of the Group’s operating segments. Following this review, 
the 2015 operating segmental analysis disclosure has been 
presented under the Group’s current organisational structure 
with the 2014 comparatives restated.
Under the revised segmental analysis, ERA comprises the Group’s 
UK and Ireland hardware business, together with Ventrolla. 
Schlegel International comprises all of the Group’s other businesses 
outside the US, Canada and Mexico, including the two UK seal 
manufacturing plants previously reported as part of ERA. Tyman 
Sourcing Asia is reported through the ERA Division. This 
change reflects the Group’s day-to-day operational and 
management structure in 201 5, with the Schlegel International 
management team being responsible for each of Tyman’s sealing 
businesses outside North America. No changes have been made 
to the AmesburyTruth segmental disclosure.
In addition, Tyman has implemented a revised methodology 
for the allocation of certain functional costs incurred centrally 
to the Group’s operating segments. Historically, all centrally 
incurred costs were allocated pro rata to each Division, broadly 
on the basis of their proportional contribution to Group revenue. 
Centrally incurred costs which are directly attributable to a 
Division have been allocated or recharged to that Division and 
all other centrally incurred costs and eliminations are disclosed 
in aggregate as a separate line item in the segmental analysis. Tyman plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 25
Strategic report Financial statements Corporate governance
Corporate costs
Corporate costs increased to £5.3 million (2014: £4.7 million) 
reflecting increased headcount, share-based payments and travel.
Materials and input costs
We track the pricing of key raw materials closely within 
the Divisions in order to ensure we are procuring at the 
best price for the quantities we consume and that we are 
in a position to secure price increases where necessary.
We focus on three key categories of raw material – steel, oil 
derivatives and zinc. Our largest raw material and component 
purchase is steel across a number of different types and grades. 
Oil derivatives are used in the manufacture of our seal, extrusion 
and injection-moulded products. Zinc is used in the manufacture 
of a number of hardware products, most notably Truth casement 
operators. In addition, we track closely the pricing of a representative 
basket of those products we source from the Far East into the 
UK which will be influenced by local labour and overhead rates, 
raw material price changes and the exchange rate.
The raw material cost price backdrop continued to be relatively benign 
in 2015, although certain product items saw significant variations across 
the year. UK Far East components saw a landed cost of products that 
was on average some 5.4 per cent higher than seen in the previous 
year and prices of European polypropylene spiked towards the half 
year before falling back in the final quarter of 2015.

£6.8 million and includes the write off of goodwill and intangible 
assets associated with EWS of £5.9 million.
Redundancy and restructuring comprises certain one-off redundancy 
and restructuring programmes undertaken by Divisions during the year, 
most notably the restructuring of the ERA Division in anticipation 
of the consolidation onto a single site in 2017.
Property disposals and provision releases of £0.7 million comprises 
£0.2 million of profit realised on the disposal of land and buildings in 
the UK together with £0.5 million of surplus onerous lease provisions 
released during the year. In 2014 gains of £0.4 million were realised 
following the disposal of surplus property in the US.
Exceptional items (excluding the EWS disposal) comprise £3.1 million 
of costs cash settled in 2015 (2014: £1.9 million) and £3.1 million of 
non-cash costs (2014: £3.7 million). Property provision releases and 
disposals include cash receipts of £0.2 million (2014: £1.0 million).
These items are regarded by the Group as exceptional as they are 
significant and non-recurring in nature.

Finance costs
In aggregate, net finance costs decreased slightly to £6.9 million 
(2014: £7.0 million). Interest payable on bank loans, private 
placement senior notes and overdrafts increased to £6.1 million 
(2014: £4.6 million) reflecting a full year of interest charges on 
the Group’s US private placement programme.
Capitalised borrowing costs written off through the income statement 
in the year totalled £0.4 million (2014: £2.5 million). Of the 2014 
amount, £1.3 million related to accelerated amortisation following 
early repayments of banking facilities in that year.
Income from short term bank deposits increased marginally and the 
revaluation of fair value hedges year on year moved from a £0.4 million 
credit at December 2014 to a £0.2 million debit at December 2015.
Underlying net finance costs increased by £1.5 million to £6.0 million 
(2014: £4.5 million).
Interest rates 
As expected, the Group’s average cost of funds and margin 
payable over the year as a whole increased by 1 10 bps to 4.0 per cent 
(2014: 2.9 per cent), principally due to the full-year impact of the 
US private placement programme.
At the year end the Group held interest rate contracts to swap around 
97.9 per cent of the Group’s outstanding debt under its revolving credit 
facility from floating rates to a weighted average fixed rate of 1.2 per cent 
with a range of maturities between 2016 and 2020.
As at 31 December 2015, the Group’s portfolio of swap contracts at 
fair value amounted to a liability of £0.1 million (2014: £0.3 million). 
Any changes in fair value until maturity, classified as an effective 
hedge, will be recognised directly in other comprehensive income, 
with only the ineffective portion taken through the income statement.
Taxation 
The Group reported an income tax charge on profit before taxation 
of £7.9 million (2014: £2.6 million). The 2014 comparative included 
a £1.7 million exceptional prior year adjustment, which did not 
repeat in 2015. Current tax on profit for the year increased slightly to 
£9.7 million (2014: £8.4 million) and credits arising from the origination 
and reversal of temporary deferred taxation differences reduced to 
£2.0 million (2014: £3.4 million).
The underlying income tax charge amounted to £12.5 million 
(2014: £10.4 million), which represents an effective underlying 
tax rate of 27.9 per cent (2014: 25.0 per cent).
During the year the Group paid £8.9 million (2014: £6.3 million) of 
corporate taxes, which equates to a cash tax rate of 19.7 per cent 
(2014: 15.0 per cent) on the Group’s underlying profit before taxation.
Several factors impact the Group’s taxation charge or credit, including:
The international nature of the Group’s operations. In 201 5, 76.8 per cent 
of the Group’s operating profits before central cost allocations were 
generated in North America, 20.4 per cent generated in the UK and 
2.8 per cent in Schlegel International’s overseas territories. The Group’s 
effective tax rate is therefore a function of the interaction of currency 
movements with different country, state and local taxation rates 
and allowances.
The Group has a proactive capital investment programme in each 
of its Divisions. These investments are amortised for tax purposes 
in accordance with the laws relating to capital allowances in each 
country, which may not match with the Group’s depreciation policy.
Group companies sometimes generate taxable losses. Where these 
losses can be relieved or carried forward to be relieved in future 
periods, the Group does so in accordance with the relevant laws, 
however this treatment is broadly dependent on sufficient eligible 
taxable profits being generated in the relevant jurisdiction.
Certain losses, most notably those related to the amortisation and 
impairment of intangible assets and the write off of goodwill arising 
on acquisition cannot be relieved against taxable profits. As the 
Group has developed through acquisition, these charges have a 
material impact on the Group’s statutory tax charge as a proportion 
of pre-tax profits.
Group share options and LTIPs will generate varying levels of tax 
relief to the Group dependent on the vesting outcomes of awards 
and the share price as at the date of vesting. In 2014 the effective 
underlying tax rate was reduced by approximately 170 bps due to 
the impact of the 2010 and 2011 LTIP awards, each vesting in 2014, 
and the significant share price appreciation over the lifetime of 
those awards. 
The Group does not at present make material use of special incentive 
arrangements that might impact the tax charge such as research 
and development tax credits or patent box structures however will 
keep this under review.
Taxation policy
The Group’s taxation policy is to manage the Group’s tax 
affairs in accordance with relevant laws and regulations in 
each jurisdiction in which we operate and to ensure that our 
approach to taxation is aligned with our commercial 
activities worldwide. 
The Group follows the terms of double taxation treaties 
and relevant OECD guidelines in dealing with issues such as 
transfer pricing, repatriation of profits and the establishment of 
a taxable presence in countries where it trades. The Group seeks 
to engage proactively with tax authorities in each of its key 
jurisdictions in order to ensure that the Group’s tax affairs are 
clearly communicated. 
As far as practical, the Group aims to keep its legal and 
commercial structures straightforward in order to reduce 
risk and minimise compliance costs. To assist with accurate 
reporting of taxation data and in order to fulfil our compliance 
and disclosure obligation we have invested in tax reporting 
systems and personnel throughout the Group.
The Group’s key transfer pricing arrangements comprise 
commercial agreements relating to trade between Group 
entities, intragroup financing and the recharging of 
shared-service administrative costs.
Where Group entities do trade with each other, transfer pricing 
arrangements are appropriate for the territories involved and 
are enacted on a consistent basis. Tyman plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 27
Strategic report Financial statements Corporate governance
Our ROAI measure 
is designed to provide 
a framework to target 
returns from acquisitions.”
Margin management
We regard margin management as an important element in ensuring 
that the Group delivers the profitability that its quality, service levels, 
investment and innovation merit. Our blended gross margin target 
takes into account the range of products that we sell - which vary in 
complexity and added value – and the different price points that 
attach to those products. Our operating margin target is to take each 
Division back to their peak cycle margins through improvements to our 
operating and manufacturing processes without needing our markets 
to return to peak cycle volumes.
Leverage target
We have set ourselves a year-end leverage target of between 1.50x 
to 2.00x net debt to EBITDA. We feel that this target range strikes 
a balance between retaining an appropriate amount of leverage 
for a cash generative group, allows Tyman the flexibility to take 
advantage of investment opportunities as they arise and gives the 
Group structural headroom on its facilities to be able to cope with 
unexpected short term downturns in demand.
Cash conversion
We want to convert the profits we generate into cash such that we 
can fund our investment plans, service our borrowings and finance 
our dividends. Cash conversion provides a clear indication of how 
successful we are at managing our working capital and capital 
investment programmes. 
For each of our businesses our starting point is that if we generate 
operating profit then we expect to convert that profit into cash in the 
near term. In any one year this may not be achievable due to the 
investment requirements of the individual business or Division but over 
a period of time each Division should be capable of cash conversion 
averaging close to 100 per cent.
Returns on capital employed 
ROCE measures the success of the Group in generating returns for 
stakeholders on the capital it has available for investment. Here we 
have a medium term target of 15 per cent - which is significantly 
above the Group’s cost of capital. Our target takes into account the 
opportunities we still have to improve our profitability, to streamline 
our working capital and to generate increased returns from our 
manufacturing processes through investment.
Returns on acquisition investment 
We regard M&A as a potential route to improve our business and our 
returns. Our ROAI target of 15 per cent after two years is aligned with 
our medium term ROCE target and is designed to provide a framework 
to target returns from acquisitions; taking into account not just the 
initial expense of acquisition but any investment we are required to 
make into the acquired business in the first two years of ownership. 
Two years should give us sufficient time to deliver a measured 
integration of a newly acquired business and to start to generate 
synergy benefits that may arise from the combination.

Annual Report and Accounts 2015 28
Strategic report
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share decreased by 17.8 per cent to 4.57 pence 
(2014: 5.56 pence) and diluted earnings per share decreased to 
4.55 pence (2014: 5.50 pence).
Underlying earnings per share increased by 3.4 per cent to 19.25 pence 
(2014: 18.61 pence) and underlying diluted earnings per share increased 
to 19.16 pence (2014: 18.40 pence). The increase reflects the 
improvement in underlying operating profit offset by the increased 
finance charge and the higher effective tax rate for the year.
Currency
Currency in the consolidated income statement
The principal foreign currencies that impact our results are the US Dollar, 
the Euro, the Australian Dollar, the Canadian Dollar and the Brazilian 
Real. Other than the US Dollar, each of these currencies was on average 
weaker versus Sterling in 2015 compared with the previous year.
Translational exposure
The net effect of currency translation caused revenue and underlying 
operating profit from ongoing operations to increase by £12.7 million 
and £2.6 million respectively compared with 2014 as shown below.
In 2015, we estimate that the relative weakness of Sterling against 
the US Dollar impacted ERA ’s reported profitability through transactional 
exposure by approximately £1.5 million (2014: benefit due to relative 
strength of Sterling of £1.3 million). The unhedged impact on ERA of 
a 1 cent movement in the Sterling/Dollar exchange rate is approximately 
£0.2 million. The Group’s other transactional exposures generally benefit 
from the existence of natural hedges or are de minimis in size.
Currency in the balance sheet
The Group aims to mitigate the translational impact of exchange 
rate movements by denominating a proportion of total borrowings in 
those currencies where there is a material contribution to underlying 
operating profit. The Group’s banking facilities allow it to draw funds 
in a number of different currencies.
Dividend
A final dividend of 6.09 pence per share (2014: 6.00 pence), 
equivalent to £10.2 million (2014: £10.1 million), will be proposed at 
the Annual General Meeting. The total dividend declared for the 2015 
financial year is therefore 8.75 pence per share (2014: 8.00 pence per 
share), an increase of 9.4 per cent over 2014 and which equates to 
dividend cover of 2.20x.
The ex-dividend date will be 21 April 2016 and the final dividend will be 
paid on 20 May 2016 to shareholders on the register on 22 April 2016.
In accordance with IFRS, only dividends paid during the year have been 
charged in the 2015 financial statements. In aggregate £14.6 million 
of dividend payments were made during the year (2014: £10.9 million). 
As at 31 December 2014 the Group’s total reserves available for 
distribution to shareholders were approximately £215.0 million. 
The total dividends paid during 2015 therefore utilised approximately 
6.8 per cent of the estimated reserves available for distribution at the 
start of the year.
Financial review continued
Transactional exposure
Divisions that purchase or sell products in currencies 
other than their functional currency will potentially incur 
transactional exposures. These exposures are principally 
Sterling/US Dollar or Renminbi for purchases by ERA 
from the Far East and Australian Dollar/US Dollar/
Renminbi for purchases by Schlegel International’s 
Australian business from the US and the Far East. 
The Group’s policy is to recover adverse transactional currency 
movements through price increases or surcharges. Divisions 
typically buy currency forward to cover expected future 
purchases for up to around six months. This aims to provide an 
element of certainty in the cost to the Group of landed goods 
and to allow sufficient time for any necessary price changes 
to be implemented.

Dividend policy
The Board regards dividend payments as an important 
component of shareholder returns that assist in reinforcing 
capital discipline and help ensure that the Group’s shares 
appeal to a wide range of potential investors. 
As a cash generative business, the Group aims to grow the 
total dividend year on year in line with earnings and has 
committed to a target dividend cover of between 2.00x to 
2.50x underlying earnings per share. The actual payout ratio 
in any one year may be above or below the target dividend 
cover; depending on circumstances. 
The Group operates in a cyclical industry and financial 
performance can be expected to vary from year to year. The 
cyclical nature of the Group’s markets means that in certain 
years the Board may feel it is appropriate and necessary to 
reduce the dividend.
The Group pays two dividends each year. The interim dividend, 
which is paid to shareholders in early September, and the final 
dividend which is paid to shareholders in late May, following 
the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting. The interim 
dividend will typically be set at around one third of that year’s 
total dividend. Tyman plc

Goodwill and acquired intangible assets
A goodwill impairment charge of £1.8 million was taken in the year 
following the decision to close the Barcelona, Spain pile weatherstrip 
plant. In 2014 a goodwill impairment charge of £3.4 million was taken 
in connection with the closure of the Belgian Industrial Products 
business based in Gistel, Belgium. Amortisation of intangible fixed 
assets during the year was £20.0 million (2014: £18.2 million).
In accordance with accounting standards, the Board has reviewed 
the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets across 
the Group by CGU in light of current trading, prospects and progress 
towards achieving the Divisions’ strategic plans. The Board concluded 
that the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets remained 
appropriate and that no further impairment had occurred.
The CGU with the lowest headroom is the Schlegel International CGU, 
which is a function of the current reduced levels of demand currently 
seen within that Division. However, following the amendments to the 
Group’s CGUs and firmer trading prospects seen within some of Schlegel’s 
key markets in 2015, the headroom within the Schlegel International 
CGU has increased in both absolute and relative terms year on year. 
The Board will continue to keep the Schlegel International value 
in use under close review.
Shares in issue
The total number of shares in issue at 31 December was 170.1 million 
with the basic weighted average number of shares in issue being 
168.2 million (2014: 167.8 million) and the fully diluted weighted 
average number of shares being 169.0 million (2014: 169.7 million).
At 31 December 2015 the Group had 0.5 million shares in treasury 
(2014: 0.6 million) and the Tyman Employee Benefit Trust held 1.3 million 
shares (2014: 1.6 million) to satisfy future obligations under the 
Group’s various share plans.
Working capital management
We retained our strong focus on management of working 
capital within each of the Divisions, with the aim of achieving 
an appropriate balance between commercial priorities 
and financial efficiency. 
Each Division is allocated specific cash targets which are 
monitored throughout the year and flexed according to demand 
levels and the Divisions are encouraged to seek out opportunities 
to secure permanent reductions in working capital.
Working capital
Trade working capital, net of provisions, on the balance sheet at the 
year end was £55.7 million (2014: £52.3 million). £1.0 million of this 
increase was due to exchange translation movements and £0.8 million 
was due to the disposal of EWS, which operated in a net negative 
trade working capital position.
The overall movement of trade working capital in 2015, excluding 
EWS, was a net cash outflow of £1.6 million (2014: £9.5 million) and 
net trade working capital as a percentage of revenue at the year end 
increased by 80 bps to 15.7 per cent (2014: 14.9 per cent).
Inventories on the balance sheet at the year end decreased 
slightly to £46.0 million (2014: £47.6 million) with £0.4 million of the 
decrease being due to EWS and despite £1.0 million of adverse 
exchange movements.
Trade receivables decreased to £29.5 million (2014: £31.5 million), 
with substantially all of the decrease being due to EWS. Bad debts 
written off in the year by the Group again amounted to only 
0.1 per cent of revenue (2014: 0.1 per cent).
Trade payables decreased to £19.8 million (2014: £26.8 million), with 
£3.5 million of the decrease being due to EWS and around £2.0 million 
being due to more typical shipping patterns excluding the Far East 
towards the end of the year compared with 2015.
Capital expenditure
Gross capital expenditure increased to £11.8 million (2014: £11.5 million) 
or 1.50x depreciation (2014: 1.43x) as we continued our programme 
of targeted capital investment across each of the Divisions. Intangible 
capital expenditure in the year comprised £2.9 million (2014: £2.1 million) 
principally as a result of our continuing investment in the 
AmesburyTruth ERP system.
Amendments to cash generating units
Until the 2014 year end, Amesbury and Truth were 
treated as separate CGUs for the purposes of impairment 
testing. From January 2015 these two CGUs have been 
combined and impairment testing for the North American 
business as at 31 December 2015 has been performed on 
the basis of a single AmesburyTruth CGU.
The ERA and Schlegel International CGUs have also been 
amended to reflect the current Group operating structure as it 
had become increasingly difficult to allocate revenue and cash 
flows relating to UK-based seal manufacturing plants. Accordingly 
impairment testing as at 31 December 2015 has been performed 
on the basis of the revenues and cash flows directly attributable 
to the respective ERA and Schlegel International CGUs, which 
now mirror the reported operating segments.
The Board, in its capacity as Chief Operating Decision-Maker, 
believes that these amendments to the Group’s CGUs provide 
a more accurate reflection of the revenues, cash flows and 
value in use attributable to the Group’s intangible assets 
and therefore constitute the most appropriate basis for 
the conduct of impairment testing. Tyman plc

At 31 December 2015 the Group had gross outstanding borrowings 
of £113.2 million (2014: £130.0 million), cash balances of £30.0 million 
(2014: £39.3 million) and committed but undrawn facilities of 
£135.1 million (2014: £114.7 million), as well as access to the 
uncommitted £60.0 million accordion facility.
Underlying net debt at the year end was £83.2 million (2014: £90.7 million), 
despite £5.0 million of adverse exchange movements during the year. 
Under IFRS, which reduces gross debt by the unamortised portion 
of finance arrangement fees, net debt at 31 December 2015 was 
£81.6 million (2014: £88.7 million).
The Group maintains sufficient cash balances and undrawn borrowing 
facilities to finance all investment and capital expenditure included 
in its strategic plan, while retaining sufficient flexibility to be able 
to react to changes in market conditions and complete bolt-on 
acquisitions without the need to raise external finance.

Covenant performance calculated is consistent with the Group’s banking 
covenant tests.
At the year end, the Group retained significant headroom on its banking 
covenants with headroom on both tests in excess of 50 per cent of 
2015 adjusted EBITDA.
The Group’s leverage position has continued to strengthen and at 
the year end was 1.35x (2014: 1.56x), some way ahead of our core 
year-end target range of 1.50x to 2.00x.
Interest cover decreased over the year by 2.03x to 10.19x (2014: 12.22x), 
reflecting the increased absolute amount of interest payable on the 
Group’s borrowing facilities following the US private placement in 
November 2014.
Pensions and post-retirement medical benefits
The Group’s gross pension and post-retirement medical benefit 
obligations under IAS 19 at 31 December 2015 were £25.4 million 
(2014: £24.9 million). The majority of the movement over the course 
of the year was due to a combination of exchange differences and 
losses on plan assets, offset in part by gains arising from actuarial 
increases to the discount rates applied to financial assumptions.
The principal schemes are located in North America where the 
pension schemes are closed to new entrants and post-retirement 
healthcare benefits are capped.
Cash contributions made to the schemes during the year were 
£0.9 million (2014: £1.0 million) and benefit payments to scheme 
members were £1.2 million (2014: £0.9 million).
Cash and cash conversion
The Group made significant investment in the balance sheet during 
the year, with capital expenditure running well ahead of depreciation 
and some net investment made into trade working capital.

£4.7 million (2014: £2.2 million) of exceptional costs cash settled in 
the year, £1.6 million of which were accrued in prior years.
Operating cash conversion of 84.9 per cent was significantly higher than 
in the previous year (2014: 71.8 per cent). Since 2011, the Group’s

Annual Report and Accounts 2015 31
Strategic report Financial statements Corporate governance
Underlying tax rates for the Group for 2016 are expected to be slightly 
higher than in 2015 at c. 30 to 31 per cent, reflecting the larger 
proportional contribution to Group taxable profits that we expect will 
be derived from higher tax jurisdictions. The final underlying tax rate 
for the year will principally depend on the Group’s geographical mix 
of taxable profits. Cash taxation rates are expected to be slightly 
below the Group’s underlying tax rate.
Core maintenance and investment capital expenditure for the 
year for the Group including Giesse and Response is expected to 
be approximately £15.0 – £17.0 million. Capital expenditure costs 
associated with the footprint projects in 2016 across the three 
Divisions are expected to total approximately £11.0 million.
Trade working capital trough to peak for the year is expected 
to be £15.0 – £20.0 million. Giesse and Response together will 
increase the Group’s trade working capital by £20.0 – £25.0 million.
LTIP purchases by the Employee Benefit Trust are expected to 
be £3.0 – £4.0 million and the share-based payments will be 
approximately £1.0 million.

Returns on acquisition investment
ROAI for the Truth and Vedasil acquisitions are as follows:
Original
acquisition Annualised
Date of investment ROAI ROAI since date
acquisition ’000 in 2015 of acquisition
Truth Jul 2013 US$206,437 21.9% 14.5%
Vedasil Feb 2014 BR26,639 14.2% 17.7%
Both Truth and Vedasil continued to make strong contributions to the 
Group in 2015. The synergy benefits derived from the combination 
of Truth with Amesbury, together with general business improvements 
and a recovering market, have meant that the ROAI for the Truth 
acquisition has significantly exceeded our acquisition returns threshold.
Despite the difficult markets in Brazil, the Vedasil acquisition has 
given the Group a platform for growth in South America and has 
made a solid contribution to the Schlegel Division’s returns.
Financial reporting
This financial information has been prepared under IFRS and in 
accordance with the Group’s accounting policies. There have been 
no changes to the Group’s accounting policies during the year 
ended 31 December 2015.
Summary 2016 guidance
2015 revenue and underlying operating profit for the Group, excluding 
EWS, Belgium and Ontario, was £341.0 million and £50.1 million, 
respectively. Giesse and Response will each contribute approximately 
ten months of trading to the Group in 2016.
Interest payable on borrowings for the full year under the existing 
facilities is expected to be £7.5 – £8.5 million – although the actual 
amount payable will be dependent on leverage. The non-cash 
amortisation of capitalised borrowing costs will reduce in 2016 
to c. £0.4 million.
Exceptional costs are expected to be £9.0 – £11.0 million reflecting 
the restructuring associated with footprint projects across all three 
Divisions and M&A integration and synergy costs associated with 
Response and Giesse. The majority of these costs will be cash settled 
in 2016. Tyman plc

Identifying and managing risk
The Group has policies and procedures in place to ensure that risks are properly identified, evaluated and managed at the appropriate level 
within the business. The identification of risks and opportunities, the development of action plans to manage the risks and maximise the 
opportunities, and the continual monitoring of progress against agreed plans are integral parts of the business process, and core activities 
throughout the Group.
Responsibilities for and structure of risk management
Board Overall responsibility for risk management. Defines the Group’s risk appetite and culture. Reviews principal 
risks and uncertainties and provides direction and tone of risk management.
Audit Committee Assurance of the internal control and risk management systems.
Risk Management Committee Regular review of risk registers and implementation of mitigation plans. 
Executive and divisional 
management
Day-to-day operational management and management of risk. Design and implementation of the necessary 
systems of risk assessment and internal control.
Divisional management maintains a comprehensive risk register which 
assesses all pertinent risks for each division, including operational, 
financial, compliance and strategic risks. Divisional registers are 
reviewed on a regular basis by the functional heads within each 
division. As a result of these reviews, the assessment of each risk 
is monitored and where necessary updated using a scoring system 
which seeks to assess the likelihood, the financial effect and what 
controls are in place to mitigate the effects of the relevant risks. 
The Risk Management Committee formally reviews each Division’s 
risk register twice a year.
A shorter register of principal risks is specifically reserved for review 
by the Board. This is mainly, but not exclusively, comprised of risks, 
after mitigation, above a certain threshold.
The Board has overall responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness 
of the risk management and internal control systems in the Group. 
The Audit Committee report on pages 52 to 56 describes the process 
for achieving this. 
Principal risks
The Directors confirm they have carried out a robust assessment 
of the principal risks facing the company, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. 
The table on pages 33 and 34 sets out the principal risks and uncertainties 
facing the T yman Group at the date of this Report and how they are being 
managed or mitigated. The principal risks do not comprise all the risks that 
the Group may face and they are not listed in any order of priority. 
In accordance with the provisions of the 2014 version of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, the Board has taken into consideration 
the principal risks in the context of determining whether to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting and when assessing the prospects 
of the Company for the purpose of preparing the Viability statement. 
The Going concern statement can be found on page 50 and Viability 
statement can be found on page 35 of the Strategic report.
Main developments in risk
The main developments in our principal risk over the last year has been 
an increase in the footprint rationalisation risk as the implementation 
of these projects advances further. We are progressing further into 
the implementation of the AmesburyTruth footprint plan, aiming to 
complete the first phase in the first quarter of 2017. In addition we are 
also planning to complete the exit from the Schlegel site in Barcelona 
and undertake the construction and fit out of ERA’s new West Midlands 
facility. These projects will be a main focus for management in 2016, 
with progress closely monitored.

Description
Impact 
on strategy Mitigation Trend
Market conditions
Demand in the building products sector is dependent 
on levels of activity in new construction and property 
repair, maintenance, improvement and remodelling 
markets. This demand can be unpredictable and 
the Group has a low visibility of future orders from 
its customers. Subdued market demand in the US 
and UK coupled with continuing fluctuations in 
European markets in 2015 have combined to 
produce an overall neutral impact on this risk. 
A
B
In recent cyclical downturns management has proved effective 
in responding to such events and continues to have similar measures 
ready to deploy, such as:
• 
maintaining appropriate headroom and tenor in its available 
borrowing facilities;
• 
the geographic spread of our business; 
• 
our ability to flex our cost base; 
• 
pricing and gross margin management;
• 
planning, budgeting and forecasting processes; and
• 
offering industry-leading customer service. 
Competitors
The Group may face significant competition 
in its markets, including competition from 
global competitors with large capital resources. 
Competition in the industry is based on: range 
and quality of products offered, geographical 
reach, product development, reputation and 
client relationships. Aggressive pricing from 
our competitors could cause a reduction 
in our revenues and margins.
A
B
C
Some of our markets are relatively concentrated with two or three 
key players, while others are highly fragmented and offer significant 
opportunities for consolidation and penetration. The Group continues 
to differentiate itself by its wide range of products, its focus on setting 
industry-leading standards for delivery on time and in full, its technical 
support and its geographical spread, strategic focus and reputation. 
We aim to minimise the impact of aggressive pricing by competitors 
through a low cost manufacturing strategy supported by our 
programmes of continual process improvements and building long term 
relationships with our customers based on value, quality, service and 
added value technical support.
Loss of major customers
The success of the Group will, to some extent, 
be dependent on the continuation of satisfactory 
commercial relationships with its major customers.
A
B
C
The Group aims to build long term relationships with its customers 
based on value, quality and range of products, industry-leading 
service and value-added technical support. The Group develops 
strategic customer plans which include high level engagement 
through business review meetings to quickly identify service issues 
and product development opportunities. The top five customers 
account for 26 per cent of total Group sales.
Raw material costs and supply chain failures
The raw materials used in the Group’s businesses 
include commodities that experience price 
volatility (such as oil derivatives, steel and zinc). 
The Group’s ability to meet customer demands 
depends on obtaining timely supplies of high 
quality components and raw materials on 
competitive terms. Failure by any of the Group’s 
suppliers could significantly limit the Group’s sales 
and increase its costs. The raw material cost 
backdrop has been relatively benign in 2015.
A
C
D
The Group continues to invest in and improve its sourcing and 
procurement capability. The Group manages the risks associated with 
raw material costs and supply chain failure through strong long term 
relationships with suppliers, risk assessment and audit of key suppliers, 
review of make or buy policies, economies of purchasing, multiple 
suppliers, adequate safety stock and inventory management. The Group 
maintains product quality by ongoing testing up to and beyond the 
industry standards. In addition, the Group will mitigate this risk 
by increasing selling prices or applying surcharges to recover 
unavoidable input cost increases. Tyman plc

Footprint rationalisation
The Group has a number of footprint 
rationalisation projects underway within each 
of the Divisions. In AmesburyTruth, the US 
footprint rationalisation project aims to create 
four manufacturing centres of excellence 
supported by a number of satellite manufacturing 
and distribution facilities over the next five years. 
Schlegel pile seal production is being consolidated 
in Aycliffe in the UK and the site in Barcelona will be 
closed. ERA plan to consolidate three distribution 
sites into one site in the West Midlands. 
The benefits of rationalisation are expected to 
include more efficient manufacturing processes, 
shorter development times for bringing new 
products to market, a reduction in internal freight 
costs, a more efficient deployment of personnel 
and a reduction in divisional overheads. There is 
a risk that changes will be disruptive, that these 
projects may cost more than originally planned 
and may not deliver the expected benefits.
C
D
E
The Group mitigates this risk by extensive upfront analysis, planning 
and risk assessment, with multi-disciplined project teams, supported 
by dedicated professional project management resources.
Key executives and personnel
The Group’s future success is substantially dependent 
on the continued services and performance of its 
Executive Directors and senior management and 
its ability to continue to attract and retain highly 
skilled and qualified personnel.
C
D
F
The Remuneration Committee and the Tyman Nominations 
Committee mitigate the risk of losing key personnel through 
robust succession planning, strong recruitment processes, 
long term management incentives and retention initiatives.
Funding and financial risks
The Group operates internationally and is therefore 
exposed to transactional and translational foreign 
exchange risk against Sterling. In 2015, 85 per cent 
of the Group’s underlying operating profit was derived 
from North American operations. The Group is also 
exposed to interest rate risks, liquidity risks and credit 
risks. The continued focus on cash generation in 
2015 has helped reduce our funding risk. 
C
E
F
The Group denominates some of its debt in foreign currency to match 
some of its exposure to the translational balance sheet risks associated 
with overseas subsidiaries. Ancillary bank facilities are available to 
manage some of the foreign exchange transactional risks and interest 
rate exposure through the use of derivative financial instruments. 
The Group maintains adequate cash balances and credit facilities 
with sufficient headroom and tenure to mitigate credit availability 
risk. Further information on these risks is given in note 18 to the 
Group’s financial statements. The recently announced acquisition 
of Giesse helps to dilute the concentration of earnings derived from 
North America.

Viability statement
Strategy and appetite for risk
Tyman’s vision is to be a leading international supplier of engineered 
components to the door and window industry. Our strategy, details 
of which are set out on page 11, aims to create shareholder value 
through offering our customers the complete range of door and 
window components across hardware, seals and extrusions. 
Our business model, details of which are set out on pages 4 and 5, 
is flexible and adaptable and aims to ensure that we service our 
customers in the most appropriate manner and can provide them 
with a differentiated product offering at an appropriate price 
supported by high standards of quality and service.
Both our business model and our strategy are central to 
understanding the future prospects for the Group. This strategy has 
been in place for several years and is subject to ongoing monitoring 
and development by the Board.
Decisions relating to major investment projects, including all M&A 
transactions, are made by the Board. The Board is prepared to adopt 
an appropriate amount of risk and would characterise the Group’s 
risk appetite as moderate. However, the Board continues to take a 
conservative approach to the assessment of the future benefits 
of integration and rationalisation projects.
Assessment process
The Group’s prospects are assessed through the Group’s strategic 
planning process. This includes a review of three-year rolling plans by 
the Executive Directors with the Tyman Management Committee 
and all the functional leaders within each division. The Board 
participates in the process by means of an annual strategic away 
day. The output of this is a prioritised list of projects and financial 
projections for the next three years compiled from estimates of the 
most likely performance after taking account of our principal risks 
(see pages 33 and 34). A central review of debt covenant compliance 
and debt headroom is also completed. At the end of the year when 
the annual budget process is completed for the first year of the 
three-year strategic plan, the strategic plan financial projections 
are refreshed. The strategic plan reviewed in 2015 covers the 
three-year period ended 31 December 2018.
Key assumptions 
The key assumptions underpinning the 2015 to 2018 strategic plan 
include:
• 
 average market growth forecasts in line with market consensus; 
• 
 no loss of any significant customers;
• 
 conservative forecast of market share growth and the impact 
of new product development;
• 
 conservative forecast of the benefits from existing major 
rationalisation projects;
• 
 no impact from future acquisitions are included; however, a version 
of the plan taking account of the acquisitions announced between 
the end of the 2015 financial year and the date of this report has 
been prepared and reviewed; and
• 
 no assumptions around refinancing were necessary as the 
maturity of existing current committed funding extends beyond 
the time range of the current strategic plan.
Assessment of viability
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 2014 revision of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code, the Directors have assessed the 
viability of the Group over a three-year period, taking into account 
the Group’s current position and the potential impact of the principal 
risks and the mitigating actions reviewed by the Board and 
documented on pages 33 to 34 of the Annual Report. 
The Directors have determined that a three-year period to 
31 December 2018 is an appropriate period over which to provide 
its viability statement, as this is the timeframe currently adopted 
by the Board as its strategic planning horizon and the performance 
measurement period for the Tyman Long Term Incentive Plan 
under the remuneration policy. In addition demand in our business 
is ultimately driven by consumer confidence and discretionary 
spending which is difficult to project accurately beyond a three-year 
time horizon. 
The strategic plan reflects the Directors’ best estimate of the future 
prospects of the business. In addition the plan has been flexed by 
overlaying the potential financial impact of a number of scenarios 
over and above those included in the plan. These scenarios are based 
on aspects of some of the key principal risks namely market conditions, 
competitors and loss of major customers.
The scenarios tested against severe and prolonged reductions in 
revenue and earnings, which were in excess of the reduced levels 
experienced during the last downturn in 2007 to 2009. The results 
take into account the availability and likely effectiveness of the 
mitigating actions, including the flexing of working capital, capital 
expenditure and our cost base, as well as the Group’s ability to change 
its capital structure if necessary through refinancing existing debt 
facilities and/or raising equity finance. Each of these actions would 
be potentially available to the Group to take in order to avoid or 
reduce the impact or occurrence of the identified underlying risks. 
These scenarios represent ‘severe but plausible’ circumstances that 
the Group could experience. The results of this stress testing showed 
that the Group would be able to withstand the impact of these 
scenarios by making adjustments to its operating plans within 
the normal course of business.
Viability statement
Based on their assessment of prospects and viability above, the 
Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as 
they fall due over the period to 31 December 2018. Tyman plc

Diversity and equal opportunities
All employees have the right to work in an environment 
that supports diversity and fosters a culture of dignity 
and respect. 
The Group is committed to supporting employment policies 
and practices that make provision for equal opportunities 
and non-discrimination, and that comply with relevant local 
legislation and accepted employment practice codes.
Our employment policies and practices ensure that an individual’s 
skills, experience and talent are the sole determinants in recruitment 
and career development rather than age, beliefs, disability, ethnic 
origin, gender, marital status, religion and sexual orientation. 
Across the Group, management-level employees have participated 
in local diversity and equality workshops. Any open management 
opportunities are advertised internally to provide employees with 
a fair prospect for advancement. 
Gender diversity
As at 31 December 2015, the Group had female representation 
of 29 per cent (2014: 17 per cent) at the Board level and 22 per cent 
(2014: 23 per cent) in senior management positions. 
Across the total workforce, 40 per cent of the profile was female, 
an improvement of 200 bps on 2014.
Training, development and retention
Operational efficiencies are enhanced by developing 
the skills, competencies and motivation of all employees. 
The Board recognises that the long term growth and enduring 
success of the Group depends on its ability to attract and retain 
talented and skilled employees.
Each Division has comprehensive employment policies in place 
which are designed to attract, retain, appraise and motivate high 
calibre employees. 
As a Group, Tyman supports the continuing professional 
development of all its employees. Where appropriate, skills 
development training is provided to employees to enable them to 
perform their duties and to facilitate career progression opportunities. 
During the year, the Group invested in a range of development activities. 
In North America: 
• 
the continuation of the Tuition Reimbursement Program. In 2015, 
ten employees pursued university or higher education qualifications, 
in the fields of information technology, tool making, business 
management and accounting under this programme;
• 
the establishment of the AmesburyTruth Training Academy, 
a training programme for new hires at manufacturing sites with 
the specific goal of improving new hire performance, employee 
retention and operational performance. The curriculum covers 
various subjects and includes practical hands-on experience; and 
• 
the Amesbury Truth Internship Program welcomed six interns in 
2015, hosted by the finance and engineering departments across 
AmesburyTruth.
The Group understands the critical role 
that environmental, ethical, legal and social 
dimensions play in its long term sustainability.

successfully completed the programme; and 
• 
workshops, covering topics such as absence and performance 
management, were held in March 2015 and attended by all

which senior employees are invited to participate in the long term 
future of the Group through share ownership. The conditional 
annual awards of shares under the LTIP are at the discretion 
of the Remuneration Committee.
In 2015 the Group introduced a Group-wide employee share save 
scheme. The scheme offers participating employees the opportunity 
to become shareholders of the Group, which will encourage employee 
interest and engagement in the broader performance of Tyman.
Human rights
We are committed to respecting human rights across 
all our operations.
The Group is considered to be in compliance with appropriate 
legislation in the jurisdictions in which it operates.
Human rights is not considered to be a material risk for the Group 
owing to the fact that the Group’s activities are substantially carried 
out in developed countries that have strong legislation governing 
human rights. 
Whilst the Group does not have a specific human rights policy at 
present, careful consideration will be made as to whether a specific 
human rights policy is required in the future.

2015 performance
The lost time injury rate and the number of lost time 
injuries are the KPIs used to evaluate the Group’s health 
and safety performance. 
As in prior years, 2015 saw a strong focus on improving health and safety 
in the workplace. This focus included the roll-out of extensive training 
and safety programmes across all divisions, site audits, as well as 
implementing required personal protective equipment at most sites. 
Despite this, the increase in the number of lost time injuries in 2015 
to 47 (2014: 45) was disappointing. The severity of incidents were 
minor and the majority were preventable.
The focus on near-miss reporting as well as the reporting of minor 
incidents (for which there was no LTI) continued in 2015. The purpose 
of this is to identify any potentially hazardous practices or processes 
which could cause physical harm. In the 2015 year, a total of 6,357 
near-miss incidents and 115 minor incidents were reported.

Product integrity
Accountability and management
The Group seeks to be honest and fair in its relationships 
with customers and suppliers and to source and supply goods 
and services in an efficient manner, in accordance with 
specifications, without compromising quality and performance.
By providing customers with standards of goods and service that 
have been agreed and by paying suppliers and subcontractors on 
agreed terms, the Group aims to:
• 
maintain and grow market share through customer satisfaction;
• 
achieve cost efficiencies through effective supply chain 
management; and 
• 
source and supply goods and services that are reliable, safe to 
use for their intended purpose and meet industry standards.
Relationships with suppliers
Each Division is responsible for negotiating the terms 
and conditions of trade with suppliers. 
In North America, a significant portion of product sourcing is done 
through domestic suppliers, which are frequently audited and 
benchmarked to ensure that the AmesburyTruth Division receives 
the best quality, service and pricing on items procured.
A substantial portion of UK, and a significant portion of North American, 
product sourcing is conducted through the combined activity of the 
Group’s Chinese operating unit, Tyman Sourcing Asia. 
Through Tyman Sourcing Asia, the Group conducts annual quality 
assessments of its Asian supplier chain. These quality assessments 
are conducted by suitably qualified employees and involve the 
scoring of strategic suppliers’ procedures and efficiencies in respect 
of procurement, employee welfare, manufacturing, quality control, 
health and safety and social and environmental accountability. 
Appropriate actions are taken to address any underperformers 
identified from the annual assessment process. 
Quality management standards
It is Group policy to maintain accreditation to the quality 
management standard ISO 9001. 
Operating units are encouraged to gain and maintain accreditation 
to any specific standards required by the markets served.
ISO 9001 certification will ensure that operations maintain and 
adopt efficient quality management systems that save time and cost, 
improve efficiency and, ultimately, improve customer relationships.
Ethics, anti-corruption and compliance
Accountability and management
The Group is committed to conducting its business with 
integrity. High standards of professional and ethical 
conduct are expected throughout its operations. 
This will ensure compliance with the laws and regulations in 
jurisdictions in which the Group operates, protect the business from 
unforeseen liabilities and maintain a relationship of trust between 
the business and its stakeholders.
Employees and persons acting on behalf of the Group are expected 
to implement the Group’s policies and procedures such that:
• 
the legitimate interests of the Group are advanced, having regard 
to the Group’s values and standards;
• 
they engage in ethical conduct, including the avoidance and 
reporting of any conflicts of interest;
• 
the misuse of confidential information for personal gain 
is prevented; 
• 
all applicable laws and regulations in jurisdictions in which the 
Group operates are upheld, including the prevention of bribery, 
corruption and fraud; 
• 
there is a zero-tolerance culture towards discrimination 
or harassment; 
• 
all employees work in an environment that is healthy and safe; 
• 
all customers are treated fairly, openly and honestly; 
• 
business relationships with suppliers are maintained to high 
standards of integrity; and
• 
preferred suppliers are those who operate with the same 
values and standards as those of the Group.
The Group requires that formal and confidential whistleblowing 
procedures are in place and advertised at all its operating locations.
Employees are encouraged to report any suspected incidence of 
non-compliance in accordance with local whistleblowing procedures.

Waste to landfill and recycling
Many operations across the Group continue to minimise the amount 
of waste sent to landfill by selling, for recycling, waste that cannot 
be used internally.
Our Australian operations introduced a waste collection system 
whereby waste produced from the production of polypropylene 
material was reused by a local recycling plant. This has minimised the 
operation’s waste to landfill by 30 per cent.
Our Cannon Falls, Minnesota, operation achieved the “Very Small 
Quantity Hazardous Waste Generator” status from the Minnesota 
Pollution Control Agency.
Greenhouse gas emissions
The Group applies the World Resources Institute/ 
World Business Council for Sustainable Development 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard (Revised Edition) as the basis for 
reporting its emissions. 
Emissions reporting includes the facilities over which it has 
operational control. This is the internationally recognised standard 
for corporate carbon reporting.
Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions data has been collected from all 
material locations operated or controlled by the Group. Emission 
sources falling outside the Group’s operational control and other 
Scope 3 emissions have not been collated and reported. Emissions 
data for businesses acquired during the year has only been included 
from the date of acquisition.
The Group has used revenue as its intensity ratio as this is the 
most appropriate and relevant factor associated with our activities and 
should provide an appropriate basis on which to compare trends over time.
Green House Gas emissions generated by the Group’s operations present 
considerable risks to both the Group and the environment, including:
• 
the agricultural impact of the Group’s dependence on extraction 
and use of raw materials; 
• 
the potential disruption of the Group’s operations and those 
of its customers and suppliers; and
• 
changes in the nature or distribution of consumer demand.
These risks can be mitigated through the Group’s conscious efforts 
to minimise its release of GHG through its environmental initiatives.

Environment 
Accountability and management
The Board recognises its responsibilities as 
a manufacturing concern to continue to reduce 
the environmental impact of its activities.
The Group aims to develop and supply products to help customers 
meet their own environmental objectives and the demands of their 
customers and of government.
The most significant areas of environmental impact associated 
with the Group’s operations relate to manufacturing processes 
and the consequential environmental impact.
The Group encourages the continual improvement in the design, 
implementation and monitoring of environmentally efficient 
manufacturing processes.
This includes monitoring the developments in alternative material 
sources which may reduce the environmental impact of products.
Through internal development and investment, operations across 
the Group are encouraged to:
• 
minimise energy consumption;
• 
reduce waste generation through reuse and recycling;
• 
make use of recycled materials where possible;
• 
reduce transportation and their logistics-related carbon footprint; and
• 
reduce harmful emissions.

Corporate governance
Corporate governance – Chairman’s introduction
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Corporate 
governance report for the year ended 31 December 2015. On the 
following pages of the Annual Report we set out our governance 
policies and how these have been put into practice during the year. 
I believe this demonstrates the effective leadership of the Board 
and the commitment throughout the Group to promoting the 
highest standards of corporate governance.
This report, together with the Directors’ report, the Audit Committee 
report, the Directors’ remuneration policy report, the Directors’ 
remuneration implementation report and the Nominations 
Committee report, reviews the operation of the Company by 
reference to the UK Corporate Governance Code 2014. The Board 
believes that promoting the highest standards of corporate 
governance and maintaining an efficient, challenging and diverse 
Board is essential to enable the business to deliver its strategy. 
The Board continues to evolve and strengthen its corporate 
governance framework. 
I am pleased to confirm that Tyman plc complies with the Code. 
The latest edition of the Code published by the Financial Reporting 
Council contained a number of changes including an increased focus 
on how risk is governed and managed, with new provisions on the 
robust assessment of solvency and liquidity, continuing monitoring 
of systems and a statement on business viability. Details of our going 
concern and viability statement may be found in the Strategic report 
on pages 50 and 35 respectively.
In line with our succession planning strategy and with the help of 
the Nominations Committee, we continued to develop our Board 
with the announcement in February 2015 that Mark Rollins and 
Kirsten English would be joining the Board with effect from 1 April 2015. 
Les Tench retired from the Board in May 2015, following our AGM. 
Please see pages 42 and 43 for more information on the Board.
In accordance with the Code, we completed an internal evaluation 
of the Board, its Committees and each individual Director during the 
year. Details of the review and the findings are included in this report. 
I confirm that following the evaluation, all of the Directors continue 
to perform effectively and to demonstrate commitment to their 
roles. Accordingly, all Directors will offer themselves for re-election 
at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 13 May 2016.

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
The roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer are 
clearly defined and approved by the Board. The Chairman is 
responsible for the leadership and effective running of the Board 
and its decision-making processes, for setting the highest standards 
of corporate governance, for setting its agenda and for the style 
and tone of Board discussions. The Chairman’s role includes:
• 
leading the Board in determining the strategy and the overall 
objectives of the Group, while ensuring that the Board determines 
the nature and extent of the principal risks associated with 
implementing this strategy;
• 
creating the conditions to maximise overall Board and individual 
Director effectiveness;
• 
ensuring effective communication with shareholders and 
safeguarding their interests;
• 
ensuring that Directors keep their skills, knowledge and familiarity 
with the Group up to date while ensuring they receive accurate, 
timely and clear information; and
• 
regularly considering succession planning and the composition 
of the Board.
The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the day-to-day 
management of the Group, provides leadership for the executive 
team and develops and implements the Group’s strategic objectives. 
He is assisted by the Tyman Management Committee. The Chief 
Executive Officer does not have any external directorships.
The CFO
The CFO is responsible for the financial reporting and management 
of the Group. In addition to the finance, audit, tax and treasury 
functions, he is also jointly responsible with the Chief Executive 
Officer for the Group’s M&A strategy, and investor relations. The 
CFO does not have any external directorships.
The Senior Independent Director
Mr Towers was the Senior independent Director throughout the year 
under review and up to the date of this report. The Senior Independent 
Director is available for shareholders to voice any concerns which 
may not be appropriate for discussion through the normal channels 
of Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or CFO. The Senior Independent 
Director also leads the Chairman’s appraisal, serves as an intermediary 
for the other Directors with the Chairman as necessary and acts as a 
sounding board for the Chairman as required.
Non-executive Directors
At the date of this report Independent non-executive directors 
comprise 67 per cent of the Board, excluding the Chairman. The 
Board believes that the Non-executive Directors possess strong 
independent character and judgement and bring a wide range 
of business experience in some areas related to and in other 
areas complementary to the activities of the Group. The Board 
has considered whether Mr Towers’s directorship of RPC Group plc, 
where Mr Pike serves as Chairman, compromises the independence 
of Mr Towers in any way and has concluded that he discharges his 
duties with independence of both character and judgement which 
are in no respect adversely affected by the common directorship. 
The Board considered that all the Non-executive Directors met the 
criteria for independence set out in provision B.1.1 of the Code and 
there were no other relationships or circumstances which were likely 
to affect, or could appear to affect, the Directors’ judgement.
Directors’ insurance cover
The Company maintains, at its expense, a directors’ and officers’ 
liability insurance policy to afford an indemnity in certain circumstances 
for the benefit of Group personnel including, as recommended by 
the Code, the directors. This insurance policy does not provide cover 
where the Director or officer has acted fraudulently or dishonestly. Tyman plc

During March 2015 a Board review was undertaken and co-ordinated 
by the Company Secretary, which continued to utilise Independent 
Audit’s Thinking Board questionnaire platform. The review covered 
key areas of Board performance including:
• 
the Board’s role and responsibilities;
• 
composition, skills and dynamics;
• 
strategy and risk;
• 
the focus of the Board’s work;
• 
meetings;
• 
information and decision-making; and
• 
internal and external communications.
The review concluded that the Board displays a good mix of skills 
and that the Board dynamics are very good. The Non-executive 
Directors display a good balance of challenge to and support for 
the Executive Directors and this has created a constructive and 
open working relationship. 
The evaluation highlighted some areas for the Board to devote more 
time to, namely understanding the competitive environment, developing 
longer term strategic objectives and the Group’s risk framework and 
processes. The Board agreed that these recommendations could 
enhance its performance and has responded by holding a strategic 
away day in July 2015, it has increased presentations on the 
competitive environment from divisional management and it has 
arranged more external input into the Board’s assessment of the 
Group’s risk systems. 
Drawing on the Board review, the Chairman undertook a review of 
the performance of each of the Directors. The Senior Independent 
Director undertook a review of the performance of the Chairman after 
taking into account the views of all the Directors. The results of these 
individual reviews and any improvements or personal objectives were 
discussed with the relevant Directors on a one-to-one basis.
The Board evaluation for 2016 is now underway and is being 
co-ordinated by the Company Secretary, continuing to utilise 
Independent Audit’s Thinking Board questionnaire platform. 
The Board intends to engage an external facilitator again in 2017, 
with reviews in the intervening years conducted internally.
Relations with shareholders
We maintain an active engagement with our key financial audiences 
including institutional shareholders and sell side analysts as well as 
potential shareholders. During the year the Executive Directors had 
regular presentations to, and meetings with, institutional investors 
and analysts to discuss the Company’s past performance and strategy. 
The Board is provided with brokers’ reports, surveys on shareholders’ 
views and regular feedback from shareholder meetings. The Chairman 
and Non-executive Directors have the opportunity to attend meetings 
with major shareholders and expect to attend meetings at their request.
The Board uses the Annual General Meeting to communicate with 
private and institutional investors and welcomes their participation. 
Details of resolutions to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting 
can be found in the Directors’ report. The Company has set up 
a website, www.tymanplc.com, which shareholders, investors and 
other interested parties may access. The website permits users to 
download copies of published financial reports, presentations, 
press releases and stock exchange announcements.
Board Committees
The Board has an Audit Committee, a Remuneration Committee and 
a Nominations Committee, each comprised of all four Non-executive 
Directors. The Chairman is also a member of the Remuneration and 
Nominations Committees. The existence of the Committees ensures 
that time is allocated on a formal basis to consider relevant issues. 
Terms of reference for the Board and each of the Board Committees 
are available for inspection on the Group website.
Internal control and risk management
The Directors acknowledge that they are responsible for the Group’s 
internal control and risk management systems and for reviewing 
their effectiveness. Details of this review process are set out in the 
Audit Committee report on page 56.
Going concern
The Group’s strategic plan covers the period to 31 December 2018 
and the Group’s banking and private placement facilities are committed 
beyond the period of the strategic plan and contain significant 
covenant headroom. The Group’s published year-end leverage target 
of 1.50x to 2.00x is designed to ensure that the Group has structural 
headroom on its financial covenants as it comes into each financial 
year such that it could withstand a material downturn in its end 
markets and any normalisation of interest rates. 
In order to satisfy themselves that the Group has adequate 
resources for the future, the Board reviewed the Group’s committed 
funding and liquidity positions, its ability to generate cash from trading 
activities and its ability to raise external funding in the future. The 
operational performance, as described in the Financial review on 
pages 24 to 31, the future plans for the Group and the risks facing 
the Group, described on pages 10, 33 and 34, were also reviewed. 
In addition, note 18 to the consolidated financial statements includes 
the Group’s policies and processes for managing capital, liquidity 
and credit risks as well as details of its financial instruments and 
hedging strategies. Tyman plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 51
Corporate governance Financial statements Strategic report
In performing their reviews, the Board acknowledged the current 
level of growth prospects in global markets and has considered various 
sensitivity analyses when assessing the forecast funding and 
headroom requirements of the Group.
The Directors are therefore confident, on the basis of current 
financial projections and the banking facilities available, and after 
considering sensitivities, that the Company and the Group have 
sufficient resources for its operational needs, which will enable the 
Group to remain in compliance with its financial covenants in its 
bank facilities for at least the next 12 months. Accordingly the 
Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis.
Directors’ responsibilities statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, 
the Directors’ remuneration report and the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared the 
Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU and the Parent Company financial statements in accordance 
with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK Accounting 
Standards and applicable laws). Under company law the Directors 
must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. 
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• 
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• 
make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; and
• 
state whether IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable UK 
Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the Group and Parent 
Company financial statements respectively.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ 
remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the Company’s website (www.tymanplc.com). Legislation in the 
UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on 
pages 42 and 43, confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
• 
the financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU with respect to the Group and 
UK GAAP with respect to the Company, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group 
and the Company; and
• 
the Directors’ report, together with the Operational review, 
Financial review, Risk management and Principal risks and 
uncertainties contained in the Strategic report presents a fair 
review of the development and performance of the business and 
the position of the Group, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.

Chairman’s letter
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present to you the Committee’s report 
for the financial year ended 31 December 2015. 
I would like to welcome two new Committee members, 
Kirsten English and Mark Rollins, who both joined in April 2015. 
Their experience will help the Committee to continue to assess 
effectively the external and internal audits of the Group and 
to challenge the performance of the governance systems and 
the internal controls and risk management systems.
The new requirements in governance and reporting contained 
in the revised UK Corporate Governance Code, issued by the 
FRC in September 2014, applied for the first time this year. 
Consequently during the year the Committee has reviewed 
and advised the Board on the assurance process and the risk 
management framework to ensure that it remains appropriate 
and does provide a robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the Group.
In addition to the going concern report, the Committee has 
also helped the Board prepare the viability statement and 
consider the appropriateness of the three-year period over 
which the viability statement will apply.
The Committee reviewed the Annual Report to ensure it 
was fair, balanced and understandable and provided the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
performance, business model and strategy.
Further details of the Committee’s activities during the year 
are set out on page 53.

Role and responsibilities continued
1 Financial reporting and significant judgements
The Committee is responsible for monitoring the integrity of the 
financial statements including significant judgements. This includes 
review through the year of the following areas:
• 
the appropriateness of Group accounting principles, practices 
and policies and changes to, and compliance with, accounting 
standards on an ongoing basis;
• 
prior to recommending to the Board their publication, the 
Committee reviewed the half-year results for the six months ended 
30 June 2015 with the external auditor and compared the results 
with management accounts and budgets, focusing on key areas 
of judgement;
• 
at the half and full year ends, reviewing the Group’s committed 
funding and liquidity positions, cash flow projections and trading 
performance in order to recommend to the Board that the Group 
and Tyman plc continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements;
• 
the review, prior to advising the Board, of the prospects of 
the Company over the three-year period chosen for the viability 
statement, after taking account of the Company’s current position 
and principal risks; and
• 
the review, prior to advising the Board, on whether the 
Committee believes the Annual Report and Accounts for the 
year ended 31 December 2015, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business 
model and strategy.  
In undertaking this review, the following critical accounting 
policies and judgements were discussed with management 
and the external auditor:
Carrying value of goodwill and intangibles
As set out in note 10 to the Group financial statements, at 
31 December 2015, the Group had goodwill of £253.7 million with 
intangible assets amounting in total to £86.8 million. In order to satisfy 
itself that these balances were appropriately stated, the Committee 
considered the impairment reviews carried out by management. 
These reviews involve the discounting of the forecasted cash flows of 
each cash generating unit, using appropriate discount rates relative to 
the Company’s cost of capital. These assumptions are then subjected 
to sensitivity analysis. The auditor provided the Committee with their 
review of the impairment review process and, following discussion, 
the Committee was satisfied that the assumptions used were 
appropriate and that there was sufficient headroom on all 
calculations thus obviating the need for any impairment.
The CGU with the lowest headroom remains the Schlegel 
International CGU, which is a function of the current levels of 
demand currently seen within that Division. In the event that 
there is a further material contraction in demand for Schlegel 
International’s products that leads to an expectation of a future 
permanent reduction in EBITDA levels, then a further impairment 
might be required. The Board will keep this under review.
Exceptional items 
During the year ended 31 December 2015 the Group 
incurred £7.6 million of non-recurring and exceptional items 
(see note 6 of the financial statements) which primarily relate 
to the AmesburyTruth footprint rationalisation programme, 
closure of Schlegel pile seal production in Spain and the ERA 
restructuring programme partly offset by the profit on the sale 
of surplus property in the UK. The Committee considered the 
accounting treatment and disclosure of these costs in the financial 
statements through a detailed review of management’s plans for 
the related programmes, and also sought the views of the external 
auditor as to the appropriateness and consistency of the accounting 
treatment and disclosures. On the basis of this review the Committee 
concluded that the accounting treatment and disclosure of these 
items were appropriate.
Provisions
The Group has provisions of £11.5 million at 31 December 2015 
as outlined in note 19 to the Group financial statements which, 
by their nature, are uncertain and highly judgemental in nature. 
The Committee considered the nature of the provisions, the potential 
outcomes, any developments relating to specific claims, and the prior 
history of lease obligations, provisions and warranty claims in order to 
assess whether the provisions recorded are appropriate and suitably 
conservative. The Committee discussed with management and with 
the auditor the key elements of judgement to assure themselves as 
to the adequacy and appropriateness of the provisions. Following 
this discussion, the Committee was satisfied that the judgements 
exercised were appropriate and that the provisions were fairly 
stated in the annual accounts.
Carrying value of inventory
As set out in note 12 to the Group financial statements, as at 
31 December 2015, the Group had gross inventories of £51.4 million 
and provisions for slow-moving and obsolete inventories of £5.4 million. 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, 
with due allowance for excess, obsolete or slow-moving items. Group 
management exercises judgement in assessing net realisable value 
and provisions for slow-moving and obsolete inventory which is 
based on current assessments of future demand, market conditions 
and new product development initiatives. The auditor provided the 
Committee with their review of inventories and following discussion, 
the Committee was satisfied that the inventory valuation was consistent 
with our accounting policy and previous practice and that the resultant 
valuation was reasonable.
Carrying value of trade receivables
As set out in note 13 to the Group financial statements, at 
31 December 2015, the Group had gross trade receivables of 
£31.5 million and provisions for bad debts of £2.0 million. Trade 
receivables are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction 
costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the 
effective interest rate method, less appropriate allowances for 
estimated irrecoverable amounts. Provision against trade receivables 
is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be 
able to collect all amounts due to it in accordance with the original 
terms of those receivables. The amount of the write down is determined 
as the difference between the carrying amount and present value of 
estimated future cash flows. Group management exercises judgement 
in assessing the amount of any write downs required which is based 
on current assessments of the creditworthiness of current customers. 
The auditor provided the Committee with their review of trade 
receivables and, following discussion, the Committee was satisfied 
that the book value of trade receivables was consistent with our 
accounting policy and previous practice and that the resultant 
valuation was reasonable.
Following discussions with the auditor, and the deliberations set 
out above, we were satisfied that the financial statements dealt 
appropriately with each of the areas of significant judgement. The 
auditor also reported to the Committee on any misstatements that 
they had found in the course of their work and confirmed that no 
material amounts remained unadjusted.

Annual Report and Accounts 2015 55
Corporate governance Financial statements Strategic report
In accordance with the Code, the Committee reviewed the 
Annual Report and was able to confirm to the Board that, in 
our view, the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, was 
fair, balanced and understandable and provided the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, 
business model and strategy.
2 External audit
Appointment of external auditor
The Committee has reviewed the EU legislation to reform the 
statutory audit market, which came into force in April 2014 and 
is expected to apply to Tyman from mid-June 2016. The proposal 
includes the requirement to rotate auditors every 10 years and to cap 
the non-audit fees paid to auditors at 70 per cent of the three-year 
average audit fees at Group level. The FRC in the UK will determine how 
stringently this legislation shall be applied and the Committee will 
continue to keep prospective amendments under review to ensure 
the Company continues to comply with prevailing legislation and 
best practice.
PwC were appointed for the first time as the Group’s auditors in 2012, 
following a competitive tender process. The 2015 year-end audit is 
the fourth full-year audit that PwC has conducted. The Committee 
is satisfied with PwC’s performance, independence and effectiveness 
and their fees are regularly compared with peer companies by the 
Committee. Accordingly, the Committee has recommended to the 
Board that PwC should be reappointed as the Group’s auditors at 
the AGM. In determining whether to recommend the reappointment 
of PwC as auditors without a formal tender process, the Committee 
took into account the relatively recent full tender process undertaken 
by the Group that resulted in a new external audit firm being 
appointed in 2012. There are no contractual restrictions on the 
Group with regard to PwC’s appointment.
External audit effectiveness
The effectiveness of the external audit process is dependent on 
appropriate audit risk identification at the start of the audit cycle. 
In November 2015 the Committee reviewed a detailed audit plan 
from PwC, identifying their assessment of these key risks. For the 
2015 financial year the primary risks identified were in relation to 
the carrying value of goodwill and intangibles and the carrying value 
of provisions. The Committee reviews the work performed by the 
auditors to test management’s assumptions and estimates around 
these primary risk areas and assesses the effectiveness of the audit 
process in addressing these matters. 
The Committee’s review of the performance of PwC included 
consideration of the views and opinions of the Executive Directors 
and senior management on PwC’s effectiveness in a number of 
areas including independence and objectivity, audit strategy, 
planning and effective execution, conduct and communication, 
audit findings and feedback, and expertise and supporting the 
work of the Committee.
For the 2015 financial year, the Committee was satisfied that 
there had been appropriate focus and challenge on the primary 
areas of audit risk and assessed the quality of the audit process 
to be good and that the auditor objectivity and independence 
are properly safeguarded.
The Chairman of the Committee also meets with the external 
lead audit partner outside the formal Committee process during 
the year to provide additional opportunity for open dialogue and 
feedback from the auditor without management being present. 
Matters typically discussed include the auditor’s assessment of 
business risks and management activity thereon, the transparency 
and openness of interactions with management, confirmation 
that there has been no restriction in scope placed on them by 
management, the independence of their audit and how they have 
exercised professional scepticism.
The Group Audit Partner, currently Simon O’Brien, is required 
to rotate after a maximum of five years, key audit partners after 
a maximum of seven years, and all other partners and senior 
team members after a maximum of 10 years. Simon O’Brien 
has completed four full audits and the Committee discusses 
audit partner rotation with PwC on a regular basis.
Non-audit services
The Audit Committee reviews any non-audit services provided by 
the auditors. In accordance with best practices and FRC guidelines, 
the Company policy in relation to non-audit services is kept under 
regular review, outlines which non-audit services are pre-approved, 
which services require prior approval of the Audit Committee and 
which services the auditor is excluded from. 
The prohibited non-audit services include bookkeeping and 
accounting, internal audit, design or implementation of financial 
information systems, payroll, actuarial, legal and recruitment 
services. Permitted non-audit services requiring pre-authorisation 
include due diligence, tax planning, advice on IT projects and advice 
on corporate and reporting structures. The Committee is satisfied 
that the provision of such services does not in any way prejudice 
the objectivity and independence of the auditors.
Professional firms other than the auditors also provide tax 
compliance work and tax advice. Fees for permitted non-audit 
services can be pre-authorised by the CFO for fees up to £100,000 
and by the CFO, after consultation with the Chair of the Committee, 
for fees up to £400,000. Where fees for permitted non-audit services 
exceed £400,000 or where the aggregate of such fees in a financial 
year exceeds 100 per cent of estimated Group audit fees for that 
financial year, the Committee will review and approve these 
non-audit services in advance.
Non-audit fees and services are reported to the Committee 
regularly. During 2015 total non-audit fees paid to PwC were 
171 per cent (2014: 23 per cent) of the annual Group audit fee, 
as outlined in note 4 to the Group financial statements. These 
fees were significantly higher than prior year and were mainly 
due to due diligence work performed by PwC in connection with 
the acquisition of Giesse which was approved by the Committee 
in advance on the basis that PwC was the best placed adviser 
to provide these services.
External audit independence
PwC, as auditor, report to the Committee on their compliance with 
the fundamental principles of objectivity, integrity and professional 
behaviour, including independence. PwC use a global independence 
system which provides real time identification of independence issues. 
They have confirmed to the Committee that they have not identified 
any threats to independence that would impact on their ability to 
perform their audit work.
The Committee reviews the policy on auditor independence and 
non-audit services annually and takes into consideration the nature, 
scope and appropriateness of non-audit services annually supplied 
by the external auditor.
The Committee continued to be satisfied with the external auditor’s 
independence and objectivity. Tyman plc

3 Internal audit
During 2015 a specialist team from BDO provided internal audit 
services to the Group to complete an internal audit programme, 
visiting nine operating units in the Group. The Committee reviews 
reports from BDO detailing their audit findings together with 
divisional management responses and action plans. Progress on 
completing these action plans is reviewed by the Committee at 
every meeting. 
In November 2015, the Committee conducted the annual review 
of the effectiveness of the Group’s internal audit function, including 
its terms of reference, its audit plans, its general performance and its 
relationship with the external auditors. The Committee was satisfied 
with the overall effectiveness of the internal audit function. The 
internal audit programme for 2016 was reviewed and approved by 
the Committee. The programme is structured to ensure that every 
operating unit will have an internal audit visit at least once every 
three years, with the largest operating units being audited at 
least once every two years.
4 Review the effectiveness of the risk management 
and internal control systems in the Group
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of 
internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. The internal control 
systems are designed to meet the particular needs of the Group and to 
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives. Such systems can only provide reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Throughout the year and up to the date of approval of this Annual Report 
and Accounts there has been in place an established, ongoing process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the 
Group which has been regularly reviewed by the Audit Committee and the 
Board, and is in accordance with the Internal Control: Revised Guidance 
for Directors on the Combined Code. The Group’s assessment of its 
principal risks and uncertainties is set out on pages 33 and 34.
The key features of the Group’s process for reviewing the 
effectiveness of internal controls are set out below:
• 
There is a clearly defined management structure operating 
within a framework of policies and procedures covering authority 
levels, responsibilities and accountabilities.
• 
A three-year strategic plan is prepared for the Board’s consideration 
each year. This is appraised in light of the strategic and other relevant 
risks and uncertainties faced by the Group, the resources available 
and its objectives.
• 
Risk assessment and evaluation take place as an integral part 
of the Group’s annual strategic planning cycle. The Group has 
a detailed risk management process, which identifies the key risks 
faced by the individual reporting entities and the Group as a whole 
and the actions and controls required to manage these risks. The 
process is reviewed each year to ensure it remains relevant to the 
Group’s objectives over time. The Board and Audit Committee 
review this information as part of the internal control review.
• 
The Directors are required to approve yearly financial budgets. 
Performance against these targets is monitored monthly and 
reported on at Board meetings. Reasons for divergences are 
discussed at Board meetings.
• 
There are established procedures for planning, approving 
and monitoring capital expenditure and major projects.
• 
Board approval is required for all major investment, divestment 
and strategic plans and projects.
• 
The Group operates an effective Group reporting and 
consolidation system. Written monthly reports, management 
accounts and key performance indicators analysing performance 
by operating unit are reviewed every month by senior management. 
Significant risks and internal control issues are considered, actions 
agreed and progress monitored regularly with reporting entities 
and, where appropriate, at executive and Board meetings.
• 
Managers are responsible for the identification and evaluation of 
significant risks in their area of business, together with the design 
and operation of suitable internal controls. Through the use of risk 
registers, these risks are assessed on a continual basis.
• 
An annual review is performed on the effectiveness of the 
system of internal control, including a detailed risk assessment. 
The internal audit function undertakes work to review the system 
of internal control at each operation visited and reports findings 
to the Audit Committee.
• 
Operating units produce plans to improve controls relating to 
key risks and any significant weaknesses identified by internal 
and external audits. The Audit Committee monitors the progress 
against these plans to ensure that any corrective actions to the 
internal control procedures are made in a timely manner.
• 
The internal control regime is supported by the operation 
of a whistleblower reporting function. The system is operated 
by specialist external third-party service providers and allows 
employees to report concerns anonymously and in confidence. 
The Audit Committee receives regular reports on its operation.
The Directors confirm that they have carried out their annual 
review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control as 
it has operated throughout the year ended 31 December 2015 
and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report and Accounts. 
The directors also confirm that no significant failings or weaknesses 
have been identified from that review.
Audit Committee priorities for 2016
The priorities for the Committee for 2016 are set out below:
• 
continue to review the effectiveness of the Company’s overall risk 
management framework, including the generic procedures for risk 
identification, assessment, mitigation, monitoring and reporting;
• 
prepare for and implement any relevant regulatory changes 
to Audit Committee governance, including the Statutory Audit 
Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory 
Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee 
Responsibilities) Order 2014 and the EU Audit Regulation;
• 
review with PwC plans for future partner rotation; and
• 
continue to monitor the effectiveness of the internal audit 
function and internal controls.
Committee effectiveness
The effectiveness of the Committee is reviewed on an annual basis 
by both the Board and the Committee itself and the Committee 
is considered to continue to operate effectively and efficiently.

Responsibilities
Role of the Nominations Committee
The key responsibilities of the Committee are as follows:
• 
review and make recommendations to the Board on the structure, 
size and composition of the Board;
• 
succession planning for Directors and other senior managers;
• 
evaluate the balance of skills, diversity, knowledge and experience 
of the Board;
• 
prepare a description of the role and capabilities required for 
a particular appointment and lead the recruitment process;
• 
identify and nominate, for the approval of the Board, candidates to 
fill Board and senior management vacancies as and when they arise;
• 
review the time required from Non-executive Directors and 
evaluate the membership and performance of the Board 
and its Committees; and
• 
recommend the reappointment of Non-executive Directors 
and re-election of Directors.
Activities of the Committee during 2015
The following matters were considered by the Committee during 2015:
• 
evaluated the balance of skills, diversity, knowledge and experience 
of the Board and completed the final stage of the Non-executive 
recruitment plan approved by the Board in 2014;
• 
recommended the appointment of Kirsten English and Mark Rollins 
as Non-executive Directors. Korn Ferry, the external search firm, 
which has no connection to the Company, worked with the Chairman 
in 2014 to devise a longlist of candidates. A shortlist was then 
compiled and the Committee, together with the Executive Directors, 
met with these candidates during the end of 2014 and was able 
to formulate its recommendation to the Board in early 2015; and
• 
reviewed the succession planning for the Board and recommended 
to the Board that Mark Rollins should succeed Les Tench as Chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee after the 2015 AGM, when Les Tench 
retired from the Board.
Diversity of the Board
The aim of the Committee is to ensure that the Board is well balanced 
and appropriate for the needs of the business and the achievement 
of its strategy, comprising Directors who are appropriately experienced 
and are independent of character and judgement. Before recommending 
new candidates to the Board, the Nominations Committee takes 
account of the balance of skills, knowledge, experience and diversity 
of psychological type, background and gender. However, all Board 
appointments will always be made on merit. 
Committee effectiveness
The effectiveness of the Committee is reviewed on an annual 
basis by both the Board and the Committee itself and the Committee 
is considered to continue to operate effectively and efficiently.

Results and dividends
The total Group profit for the year after taxation amounted 
to £7,691,000 (2014: £9,331,000).
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 6.09 pence per 
ordinary share (2014: 6.00 pence) to be paid on 20 May 2016, 
subject to approval at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting 
(“AGM”) of the Company on 13 May 2016, to shareholders on the 
register on 22 April 2016. The ex-dividend date will be 21 April 2016. 
This, together with the interim dividend of 2.67 pence per share paid 
in September 2015, brings the total dividends for 2015 to 8.75 pence 
per ordinary share (2014: 8.00 pence).
Directors
The names and biographical details of all the current Directors are 
set out on pages 42 and 43. Kirsten English and Mark Rollins joined 
the Board on 1 April 2015 and Les Tench resigned on 15 May 2015. 
There were no other changes to the Board up to the date of this 
report and all the current Directors served throughout the period 
from the later of the start of the 2015 financial year or their date 
of appointment. Except for their shareholdings, the Non-executive 
Directors are entirely independent. There were no contracts 
subsisting during or at the end of the year in which a Director 
was or is materially interested. The Company maintains a policy 
of insurance against Directors’ and officers’ liabilities.
A description of the Board’s method of operation, its work during the 
year and that of its Committees is given in the Corporate governance 
report on pages 46 to 51. Details of the Directors’ remuneration, 
notice periods under their service contracts or terms of appointment 
and their interests in the share capital of the Company are shown in 
the Remuneration implementation report on pages 68 to 75. The 
service contracts for Executive Directors and terms of appointment 
for Non-executive Directors are available for inspection at the 
Company’s registered office and at the AGM. Tyman plc

Corporate governance Financial statements Strategic report
Re-election of Directors
In accordance with best practice under the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, each Director will stand for re-election at each AGM. Accordingly, 
Mr Pike, Mr Eperjesi, Mr Brotherton, Dr Westerwelle, Mr Towers, 
Ms English and Mr Rollins will offer themselves for re-election at 
the 2016 AGM. 
Share capital
The Company’s shares are listed in the premium segment of the 
Official List and are traded on the Main Market of the London 
Stock Exchange. The Company had 170,104,385 ordinary shares 
of 5 pence each in issue at 31 December 2015. Full details of the 
Company’s issued share capital, including the rights, obligations 
and restrictions attaching to the shares, are set out in note 23 to 
the financial statements.
Financing
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained 
profits, equity and borrowings. The Group does not trade in financial 
instruments. Full details of the Group’s borrowing facilities are set out 
in note 16 to the financial statements.
The main risks arising from the Group’s borrowings are market risk, 
interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and credit risk. 
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these 
risks and the policies, which have been applied throughout the year, 
are set out in note 18 to the financial statements.
Divestments
On 7 September the Company announced the sale of its steel 
reinforcer business, EWS, to Arc Specialist Engineering Limited for 
a net cash consideration of approximately £7.25 million. Full details 
of the Disposal are set out in note 22 to the financial statements. 
Purchase of the Company’s own shares
A resolution concerning the purchase of the Company’s own shares 
was approved at the AGM on 15 May 2015. The Directors believe 
that the Company should continue to have an authority to purchase 
shares of the Company. They will therefore propose a special resolution, 
in accordance with best practice, at the forthcoming AGM to obtain 
authority to make market purchases up to the date of the AGM in 
2017. The authority will be limited to 14.99 per cent of voting shares 
in issue (that is, excluding shares held in Treasury).
Allotment of shares
The Companies Act 2006 provides that the Directors may not allot 
ordinary shares unless authorised to do so by the Company in general 
meeting or by its Articles. At the forthcoming AGM the Directors will 
seek renewal, for a further period expiring at the earlier of the close of 
the next AGM or 13 August 2017, of the authority previously granted 
to the Directors at last year’s AGM held on 15 May 2015.
The Act gives holders of ordinary shares, with limited but important 
exceptions, certain rights of pre-emption on the issue for cash of 
new equity securities. The Directors believe that it is in the best 
interests of the Company that, as in previous years, the Board should 
have limited authority to allot some shares for cash without first 
having to offer such shares to existing shareholders. The Directors’ 
current authority expires at the close of the forthcoming AGM and, 
accordingly, they will seek to renew this authority on similar terms 
for a further period, expiring at the earlier of the close of the next 
Annual General Meeting or 13 August 2017.

Safety, health and the environment
The Board recognises that the highest standards in safety, 
health and environmental issues are an essential part of sound 
business practice. The Board is committed to improving the impact

Employees
The Group’s excellent performance would not be possible without

equipped to deal with the varying cultures, operating structures and 
geographic locations that exist in the Group.
Each operating entity in the Group is encouraged to implement 
comprehensive employment policies designed to attract, retain and 
motivate the highest quality of staff and to determine ways in which 
their knowledge and skills can best contribute towards the success 
of the business.
We are committed to ensuring that all our employees are treated 
equally, regardless of gender, age, colour, nationality, ethnic origin, 
race, disability, marital status, sexual orientation or religion. We 
are committed to regular communication and consultation with 
our employees and we encourage employee involvement in our 
performance. Each company in the Group endeavours to provide 
equality of opportunity in recruiting, training, promoting and 
developing the careers of disabled people.

Electronic communications at www.tymanplc.com
In line with a large number of other listed companies, and as 
permitted under the Company’s Articles of Association, the Company 
intends to use its website as its default method of publication 
to provide documentation and communications to shareholders 
except to those shareholders who elect to receive hard (printed 
paper) copies by post. E-communication allows shareholders faster 
access to important information about the Company. In line with 
good environmental policies the Board believes that it is not in 
the Company’s or the shareholders’ best interests to incur the costs 
or create the adverse environmental impact of unnecessarily printing 
and distributing hard copies of these documents. The Company’s 
announcements to the stock exchange and press releases are 
available online through the website. Shareholding details and 
practical help on share transfers and changes of address can be

Auditors and disclosure of information to auditors
The Directors who held office at the date of approval of this 
Directors’ report confirm that, so far as they are aware, there is 
no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are 
unaware and each Director has taken all the steps that they ought 
to have taken as Director to make themselves aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors 
are aware of that information.
The auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, have indicated their 
willingness to continue in office, and a resolution that they be 
reappointed will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
Financial reporting
The Annual Report and Accounts and the Interim Report are 
intended to provide a balanced and clear assessment of the 
Group’s past performance, present position and future prospects.

The Notice of the Company’s AGM to be held on 13 May 2016 
and related explanatory notes accompany this Annual Report and 
Accounts. As mentioned above, all the Directors are submitting 
themselves for re-election. The other business to be considered at the 
AGM is to renew the Directors’ authority to allot shares, to disapply 
pre-emption rights in certain limited circumstances and to purchase 
its own shares and other routine matters.
Further information on these resolutions is given in the explanatory notes

Annual statement
Remuneration Committee activities
The principal activities undertaken by the Remuneration Committee 
over the past 12 months were as follows:
• 
induction of two new Non-executive Directors, myself and 
Kirsten English, onto the Remuneration Committee and the 
subsequent transfer of the chairmanship of the Committee 
from Les Tench to myself;
• 
review of the normal activities of the Remuneration Committee 
and the consequent introduction of a formal and structured rolling 
calendar for its activities;
• 
setting of earnings per share thresholds for Tyman’s Long Term 
Incentive Plan share award made on 22 June 2015, along with 
the approval of the proposed participants and the number of 
shares awarded to them. The award was made later in the year 
than normal due to the timing of the change in chairmanship 
of the Committee; 
• 
consideration of market trends and corporate governance 
developments in listed company remuneration. This exercise 
included presentations and input from the Group’s remuneration 
consultants, Kepler Associates. During 2015, Kepler joined forces 
with Mercer, one of the world’s leading HR consulting firms;
• 
review of a benchmarking exercise on the remuneration 
structure for the two Executive Directors and the absolute level 
of the elements of their remuneration packages. This review was 
carried out in December 2015 by Kepler, on the direction of the 
Remuneration Committee, and indicated that the structure of the 
Executive Directors’ remuneration packages was appropriate and 
broadly in line with best practice, although their base salaries, 
particularly that of the CFO, were well below comparative 
median levels;
• 
determining the level of bonus payable for 2015 to the 
Executive Directors and other senior managers;
• 
consideration and approval of the extent to which the 2013 awards 
under Tyman’s Long Term Incentive Plan, whose performance 
period was the three years ended 31 December 2015, would vest;
• 
approval of the launch of the Tyman Sharesave Plan and the 
Tyman US Sharesave Plan under which awards were granted to 
208 employees of the Company at exercise prices ranging from 
£2.7612 to £2.7730 over a total of 175,750 ordinary shares. Vesting 
of the awards granted in 2015 under the UK ESSP will be on 
1 November 2018 and under the US ESSP will be 1 November 2016;
• 
approval of the level of base salaries to be paid to the Executive 
Directors and 25 other senior managers from 1 January 2016;
• 
establishing the 2016 bonus arrangements and bonus thresholds 
for the Executive Directors and other senior managers;
• 
consideration of the share awards to be made in mid-March 2016, 
shortly after the release of the Group’s financial results for 2015, 
under Tyman’s Long Term Incentive Plan. Approval was given for 
the proposed participants and the approximate number of shares 
to be awarded to them, with the exact number of shares to be 
dependent upon Tyman’s share price in the days immediately prior 
to the date of the award;
• 
in conjunction with the full Board, consideration and approval of the 
2016 fees to be paid to the Chairman and Non-executive Directors, 
with interested parties taking no part in the decisions taken; and
• 
overseeing the preparation of this 2015 Remuneration report.
Dear Shareholder
The Remuneration Committee’s primary objective is to set and 
implement a simple and transparent remuneration policy that 
drives the right behaviours in incentivising the Executive 
Directors to deliver the Group’s strategy and, with it, long term 
growth in shareholder value.
The Remuneration report, which provides details on the 
delivery of this objective, is split into three sections:
• 
an Annual statement;
• 
a summary of the remuneration policy (the “Policy”) which was 
approved at the AGM in 2014, where 99.8 per cent of the votes 
cast were in support of the Policy. A summary of the Policy is set 
out in the Remuneration policy report on pages 64 to 67. 
The Policy can be found on the Tyman website. It is the 
intention that a revised remuneration policy will be put to 
shareholders for approval at the 2017 AGM. The committee 
will consult with major shareholders in advance of making 
any material changes; and
• 
the Annual report on remuneration, which sets out 
the remuneration paid to Directors in 2015 and provides 
details on how the Committee intends to implement the 
remuneration policy for 2016. Shareholders will have the 
opportunity for an advisory vote on the Annual report 
on remuneration at the 2016 AGM.
This Annual statement on remuneration sets out the 
Remuneration Committee’s activities during 2015 and its 
overall approach to Directors’ remuneration. This is my first 
Annual statement, having taken over as Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee in May 2015 following the 
retirement of Les Tench from the Tyman plc Board. On behalf

and professional manner throughout his five years in the role. Tyman plc

Directors’ remuneration in respect of 2015
As highlighted in the Chairman’s statement, T yman delivered a 3 per cent 
increase in underlying earnings per share during 2015, despite generally 
challenging trading conditions. Delivery of the planned US$8.5 million 
of synergies from the Truth acquisition (acquired in July 2013) was the 
principal driver behind this positive result, along with some beneficial 
currency movements. Cash generation was healthy during the year, 
with the result that leverage (the ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA) 
fell to 1.35x at the year end (31 December 2014: 1.56x). This is now 
below the Group’s year-end target range of 1.50x to 2.00x.
The Group’s underlying profit before taxation and amortisation 
of £44.9 million achieved during 2015 was ahead of the minimum 
threshold target of £41.3 million but below the maximum threshold 
of £50.4 million, resulting in 39.9 per cent of the bonus relating 
to underlying PBTA becoming payable. Operational cash flow of 
£43.7 million for 2015 was above both the lower and upper threshold 
targets of £35.2 million and £43.0 million respectively such that 
100.0 per cent of the bonus relating to cash flow was achieved. Both 
the PBTA and the cash flow targets were adjusted for the impact of 
businesses disposed of during the year, most notably EWS and for 
the US footprint project which was approved during the year. Overall, 
this resulted in the Executive Directors receiving a bonus equal to 
57.9 per cent of 2015 salary for the year (2014: 31.0 per cent), of 
which 50 per cent will be deferred until March 2019 under the rules 
of the Deferred Share Bonus Plan.
The announcement of the Group’s results for 2015 was the trigger 
event for the vesting of the 2013 LTIP awards. Cumulative earnings 
per share over the three-year performance period was 51.57 pence, 
which is slightly above the upper end of the performance range 
of 45.00 pence (“Meets” performance) to 51.50 pence (“Stretch” 
performance). The actual outcome represents an average annual 
growth rate in earnings per share of 22.5 per cent over the three-year 
performance period. The Remuneration Committee was satisfied 
that this underlying earnings per share performance was a fair reflection 
of the performance of the Company over the period, having regard to 
a number of factors including the Company’s total shareholder return 
performance during that time. Accordingly, 100.0 per cent of the 
2013 awards will vest.
Directors’ remuneration in future periods
The salaries of the two Executive Directors, together with 25 of the 
Group’s senior management team, were reviewed in December 2015. 
The weighted average increase awarded for the group of senior 
managers was 3.0 per cent, reflecting local market conditions in the 
various geographies where Tyman operates together with a handful 
of market comparison-led increases. The Executive Directors were 
awarded a similar average increase, with the salary of the Group 
Chief Executive increasing by 2.6 per cent from £387,000 to 
£397,000 and that of the CFO by 3.4 per cent from £237,000 to 
£245,000. All increases took effect from 1 January 2016. In line with 
the remuneration packages of their direct reports and in accordance 
with the structure of the Group’s remuneration policy, the Executive 
Directors were each awarded a car allowance of £15,000 per annum 
with effect from the same date.
Apart from one small modification, the structure of the annual bonus 
scheme for Executive Directors and other senior managers during 
2016 is to remain unchanged from that operated in recent years. 
As a reminder, under the annual bonus scheme the Executive Directors 
can earn a maximum of 100 per cent of their salary dependent upon 
the achievement of certain financial measures: profit (maximum 
of 70 per cent of salary) and cash flow (maximum of 30 per cent 
of salary). 50 per cent of any bonus earned is paid in cash with the 
other 50 per cent being remunerated by shares deferred for three 
years, ensuring that focus on long term growth in shareholder value 
is encouraged. During 2016, the profit measure is to be related to 
internal financial targets and to prior year financial outcomes whilst 
the cash flow measure is to be linked to internal financial targets 
and cash conversion ratios. In prior years the linkages were to 
internal financial targets only.
On 22 June 2015 the Remuneration Committee granted share 
awards to 27 senior employees, including the two Executive 
Directors. The Executive Directors were awarded shares to the value 
of 100 per cent of salary. Vesting of these LTIPs is dependent upon 
the Company’s three-year cumulative underlying earnings per share 
for the years 2015 to 2017 and is subject to a holding period on 
vested shares (net of tax) of five years from the date of award. The 
performance measure is in line with prior year awards and the Group’s 
remuneration policy. In respect to the 2015 LTIPs no awards will vest 
if cumulative earnings per share is less than 69.90 pence, 25 per cent 
will vest at the 69.90 pence level and 100 per cent will vest at a level 
of 78.45 pence or higher. The maximum threshold represents average 
annual growth in underlying earnings per share of 18 per cent, whilst 
achievement of the minimum payout level would require average 
annual growth of 12 per cent. The Remuneration Committee 
considered these thresholds as stretching targets at the time of the 
award and, with market conditions since the time of award being 
poorer than anticipated, they are regarded as being even more 
so today.
The fees paid to the Chairman and Non-executive Directors were 
reviewed in December 2015, with the previous review having taken 
place in July 2014. The future intention is for the level of fees paid 
to Non-executives to be reviewed annually at the same time as the 
review of Executive Directors’ and senior managements salaries is 
undertaken. The outcome of the review was that the fees paid to 
the Chairman, the Non-executive Directors and the Audit and 
Remuneration Committee Chairs would increase by 2.0 per cent 
with effect from 1 January 2016. 
Annual General Meeting
As set out above, the Annual remuneration report will be put to 
shareholders for an advisory vote at the Annual General Meeting to 
be held on Friday 13 May 2016. I will be in attendance at the meeting 
and will be available to answer questions on the Remuneration report 
and the Group’s executive remuneration policy.

Policy report
Introduction
The Group’s policy is to provide remuneration that reflects the contribution of senior executives to the business, the performance of the Group, 
the size and complexity of the Group’s operations and the need to attract, retain, and incentivise executives of the highest quality.
The Committee seeks to provide remuneration packages which are straightforward and easily comprehensible and which align the interests 
of the Directors with those of the shareholders. The general principles underpinning the Group’s remuneration policy are that the policy should 
support and incentivise the delivery of the Group’s strategy while providing an appropriate balance between fixed and variable rewards.
This policy statement was submitted and approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on 16 May 2014 and took effect 
from the conclusion of the 2014 AGM and remains in effect until the 2017 Annual General Meeting, or earlier if amended by the shareholders. 
The policy has remained unchanged from the policy approved at the 2014 AGM. 
The full remuneration policy is published on the Tyman website. A summary of the key components of the remuneration policy and associated 
arrangements for Board members is shown below.
Executive Directors’ remuneration policy
Purpose and link to strategy Operation and opportunity
Base salary
To pay Executive Directors at a level commensurate with their 
contribution to the Company and appropriately based on skill, 
experience and performance achieved.
The level of salary paid is considered appropriate for motivation and 
retention of the calibre of executive required to ensure the successful 
formation and delivery of the Group’s strategy and management 
of its business in the international environment in which it operates.
Salaries are reviewed annually by the Committee. In normal 
circumstances, annual increases in salary will be limited to the general 
annual salary increase received by Group employees in the relevant 
Director’s country of residence.
The Committee may consider it appropriate and necessary to award 
larger increases, for example, in circumstances where the nature or 
complexity of the Group has increased materially or if an individual 
assumes significantly more responsibility. If there were a material 
change in business size or complexity (up or down), then this would 
be reflected in the market comparability.
Benefits
To provide a range of market-competitive benefits to encourage 
retention and which enable an Executive Director to perform his 
or her duties.
Eligible for a range of benefits that may include:
• 
life assurance cover;
• 
critical illness cover;
• 
private medical and dental cover;
• 
car allowance; and 
• 
professional tax and financial advice.
Pension
To provide a market-competitive benefit for retirement which rewards 
sustained contribution and encourages retention.
The maximum opportunity, either by way of a contribution to a Group 
pension arrangement or payment of a cash salary supplement, is 
20 per cent of base salary.
Annual bonus
To reward achievement of annual financial goals consistent with 
the strategic direction of the business.
The maximum annual bonus opportunity is 100 per cent of salary.
In normal circumstances, the Committee would expect to set annual 
bonus targets of 100 per cent dependent on the achievement of 
defined financial performance targets.
Any bonus payable under the annual bonus scheme is paid 50 per cent 
in cash and 50 per cent in shares deferred for three years under the 
Deferred Share Bonus Plan and is not pensionable. Tyman plc

Executive Directors’ remuneration policy continued 
Purpose and link to strategy Operation and opportunity
Long term incentive plans
To align interests of senior executives and those of shareholders 
in developing the long term growth of the business and execution 
and delivery of the Group’s strategy. To facilitate share ownership by 
Executive Directors and other senior management to provide further 
alignment with shareholders.
Awards are determined by the Committee at its discretion, with a 
maximum annual performance share award under the current plan of 
100 per cent of salary or 1 50 per cent of salary in exceptional circumstances. 
Awards are subject to the Company meeting underlying EPS targets 
over three financial years, starting with the financial year in which 
the grant takes place. A percentage of the award, typically 25 per cent, 
vests for threshold performance (0 per cent below threshold) increasing 
pro rata to 100 per cent vesting for stretch performance.
More recent LTIP awards have incorporated a discretionary TSR 
underpin and the Committee has introduced a two-year holding period 
from the date of vesting. This will make the aggregate holding period 
for an LTIP award five years from date of grant to permitted disposal.
Minimum shareholding requirement
To require Executive Directors to retain a minimum shareholding 
in the Company to ensure alignment with shareholders’ interests 
as a whole.
Expected to retain a minimum shareholding equivalent to 100 per cent 
of basic salary.
Remuneration outcomes in different performance scenarios
The charts overleaf set out an illustration of the remuneration policy for 2016. The charts provide an illustration of the proportion of total 
remuneration made up of each component of the remuneration policy and the value of each component.
Three scenarios have been illustrated for each Executive Director:

Fees
Attract and retain high calibre Non-executive Directors. Fees are reviewed annually. Additional fees may be paid to Chairmen 
of Board Committees and to the Senior Independent Director. No eligibility 
to receive bonuses or retirement benefits or to participate in the 
Group’s long term incentive plans or employee share plans.
Non-executive Directors’ letters of appointment
The Chairman and Non-executive Directors do not have service agreements but the terms of their appointment, including the time 
commitment expected, are recorded in letters of appointment.
Non-executive Directors are employed for terms of three years’ duration, terminable on a month’s notice by the Company or the Director. All 
Non-executive Directors are required to undertake that they will submit themselves for re-election at each Annual General Meeting occurring 
during their term of office and no Non-executive Director will serve more than three terms of three years without prior shareholder approval.
Non-executive Directors’ shareholding guidelines
Non-executive Directors do not have a minimum shareholding requirement; however, they are expected to acquire and retain a shareholding 
in the Group for the duration of their appointment.

Other policies
Recruitment of Non-executive Directors
Non-executive Directors who are recruited to the Board will 
be employed on a letter of appointment of three years’ duration, 
terminable on a month’s notice by the Company or the Director.
The remuneration for Non-executive Directors consists of annual 
fees for their services as members of the Board and, where relevant, 
for their work on selected Committees. New Non-executive Directors 
recruited to the Board will be paid the same rates and be subject to 
the same provisions concerning annual re-election and shareholdings 
as the then current Non-executive Directors.
Recruitment of Executive Directors
The Committee’s general policy on recruitment remuneration is that 
new Executive Directors should be offered a contract on similar terms 
to the existing Executive Directors.
In exceptional and unforeseen circumstances it may prove necessary 
for the Committee to exercise discretion and offer a variable pay 
opportunity (excluding buyouts) in the first year of employment to a 
new Executive Director that contains elements of variable remuneration 
which are in excess of the normal maxima stated in the policy table; 
however, the overall total variable pay opportunity on recruitment 
(excluding buyouts) would remain within the overall limit on variable 
pay of 250 per cent of base salary.
For a new CEO or CFO, their annual bonus framework and 
LTIP awards will normally be no more than those available to the 
current CEO or CFO, as applicable, at the date of recruitment. The 
Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation 
and associated expenses of a new Executive Director, subject 
to circumstances.
Where individuals are promoted to the Board from within the Group, 
the terms and conditions of their existing share grants or awards will 
not normally be amended; however, any new grants or awards would 
be subject to the same framework as the other Executive Directors.
In certain circumstances, and in order to secure the services of an 
outstanding candidate, it may be necessary to make an award to 
a new Executive Director to “buy out” unvested performance plan 
share or cash awards forfeited on leaving their previous employment. 
Any such reimbursement would be subject to independent confirmation 
of the existence, forfeiture on departure and probability of these 
historic awards vesting had the new Executive Director remained in 
post. In doing so, the Committee will seek to do no more than match 
the fair value of the awards forfeited, taking account of performance 
conditions attached to these awards, the likelihood of those conditions 
being met and the proportion of the vesting period remaining.
Any such reimbursement would be made in cash or in shares in 
Tyman plc, and may be subject to performance conditions attached 
to Tyman. No such incentives were paid in connection with the 
recruitment of Mr Eperjesi or for the promotion of Mr Brotherton 
to their respective roles, both of which occurred in 2010.
Exit payment policy for Executive Directors
The service agreements of the Executive Directors entitle them 
on termination of their contract by Tyman to a payment equal to 
salary and the value of benefits, pension allowance (including life 
cover), health cover, dental cover and car allowance (but not annual 
bonus or grants under long term incentive plans) until the earlier of 
12 months from notice of termination or the Director obtaining full 
time employment, with an obligation on the part of the Director 
to mitigate.
Payments will normally be made monthly, although the 
Committee retains discretion to agree settlement terms, which 
may include a bonus in respect of the period worked by the 
Executive Director up until the date of termination.
Executive Directors who are categorised as “Good Leavers” by 
the Committee will generally be eligible to receive historic awards 
under the LTIP and DSBP (the “Executive Share Plans”) as they vest in 
future years. Awards that vest under the LTIP post-employment may 
be pro-rated to reflect the fact that the Executive Director was not 
employed for the entire period under measurement. For LTIP awards 
made after the 2014 AGM, the Committee retains discretion to waive 
the extended holding period requirement for Good Leavers depending 
on circumstances.
In the event that an Executive Director is dismissed for reasons 
constituting gross misconduct, no unvested awards under Executive 
Share Plans may vest and the Committee retains no discretion in 
this regard.
Policy on external appointments
Executive Directors are allowed to accept external appointments 
as a non-executive director of one other company, subject to Board 
approval, provided that these are not with competing companies and 
are not likely to lead to conflicts of interest. Executive Directors would 
normally be allowed to retain the fees paid from these appointments. 
Executive Directors may not serve as the Non-executive Chairman of 
another quoted company.
As at 8 March 2016, neither Louis Eperjesi nor James Brotherton held 
any external directorships.
Other share plans
The Executive Directors may participate in any all-employee share plans 
on the same basis as other employees in their country of residence.
Consultation with employees
Although the Committee does not consult directly with employees 
on the Directors’ remuneration policy, the Committee does consider 
the general basic salary increase, remuneration arrangements and 
employment conditions for the broader employee population when 
determining remuneration policy for the Executive Directors.
Consultation with shareholders and shareholder bodies
The Committee is committed to regular engagement with 
shareholders and shareholder bodies and enters into extensive 
consultations in advance of implementing any material changes 
to the Executive Directors’ remuneration.
All Committee members attend the Annual General Meeting 
and may also be contacted through the Group’s registered office to 
answer any questions shareholders or shareholder bodies may have 
in relation to the Group’s remuneration policy.
Dilution
The Group operates the general principle that the vesting of 
share awards under Executive and Employee Share Plans should be 
satisfied either by the issue of shares out of treasury or, subject to 
Trustee consent, through the issue of shares acquired on the market 
by the Tyman Employees’ Benefit Trust.
Certain jurisdictions require that new shares are issued to employees 
to settle vesting under share arrangements. Where new shares are 
issued in these circumstances it is the Group’s intention to match the 
new shares issued with an equal purchase of shares on the market 
either into treasury or into the Tyman Employees’ Benefit Trust.  Tyman plc

Role of the Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for:
• 
setting, reviewing and recommending to the Board for approval 
the Company’s overall remuneration policy and strategy;
• 
determining and reviewing the terms of appointment and 
the remuneration arrangements of the Executive Directors 
of the Company and the Chairman;
• 
determining and reviewing the terms of appointment and

share options or payments under any such plan.
The Committee continues to receive advice from Kepler Associates, 
a firm of remuneration consultants appointed by the Committee 
after consultation with the Board. During 2015, Kepler joined forces 
with Mercer, one of the world’s leading HR consulting firms.
During the year, Kepler advised the Committee on developments 
in market practice, corporate governance and institutional investor 
views and on the development of the Company’s incentive arrangements. 
Total fees for advice provided to the Committee during the year were 
£10,820. Kepler are members of the Remuneration Consultants Group, 
and, as such, voluntarily operates under the Code of Conduct, which 
sets out guidelines to ensure that its advice is independent and free 
of undue influence.
The Committee also took advice from the Group’s legal advisers, 
Pinsent Masons LLP, as well as advice from a number of law firms 
around the world relating to local laws and regulations surrounding 
the granting, vesting and exercise of awards made to senior divisional 
management and to employees under the Company’s Sharesave 
Plans. Total fees for legal advice provided to the Committee during 
the year were £74,116.
The Committee is satisfied that the advice it has received has been 
objective and independent.

Corporate governance Financial statements Strategic report
Additional disclosures for single figure remuneration table
Base salary
As explained in the Remuneration report in the 2013 Annual Report, 
following consultation with major shareholders, the Committee 
decided to phase-in salary increases for the two Executive Directors 
to narrow the substantial gap from median levels in the market 
over two years. The Committee completed the second phase of the 
agreed plan in 2015, increasing the CEO’s base salary by 16 per cent 
to £387,000 per annum and the CFO’s base salary by 5 per cent to 
£237,000 per annum from 1 January 2015. This was in excess of 
the general level of salary increases of 2.5 per cent in the Group’s 
UK business.
Non-cash benefits
The benefits provided to the Executive Directors included private 
medical insurance, permanent health insurance and life assurance. 
The Executive Directors are not members of any of the Group 
pension schemes. There were no changes to the benefits policies 
or levels during the year.
Cash payments in lieu of pension
The cash payments in lieu of pension were non-bonusable.
Performance related remuneration
Annual bonus
For 2015, like 2014, the annual bonus scheme for Executive Directors 
was based 70 per cent on underlying PBTA targets and 30 per cent 
on free cash flow. 50 per cent of Executive Director bonuses are delivered 
in the form of nil-cost options under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan, 
to strengthen alignment with shareholders’ interests. These awards 
will normally vest (together with dividend equivalents in cash or 
shares) after three years and are not subject to any performance 
conditions. Other senior employees are also required to defer 
a proportion of their bonuses pursuant to the Deferred Share 
Bonus Plan.
2015 bonus outcome
As highlighted in the Chairman’s statement, Tyman saw healthy 
earnings growth in AmesburyTruth, despite low growth in underlying 
market demand, as operational efficiency improvements and the 
synergies anticipated at the time of the Truth acquisition in July 2013 
were both delivered. This improved performance was partly offset 
by continued difficult market conditions in the Schlegel International 
markets, particularly in Russia and Brazil, and a weaker performance 
from the Group’s UK business, ERA. Despite the increased finance 
costs reflecting the full-year impact of the higher cost US private 
placement finance, the Group delivered PBTA of £44.9 million for 2015. 
This was ahead of the minimum threshold target of £41.3 million but 
below the maximum threshold of £50.4 million, resulting in 39.9 per cent 
of the bonus relating to underlying PBTA becoming payable. 
Strong management of working capital helped the Group’s leverage 
decrease further in the year to 1.35x net debt:adjusted EBITDA. 
The operational cash flow of £43.7 million for 2015 was above both 
the lower and upper threshold targets of £35.2 million and £43.0 million 
respectively such that 100.0 per cent of the bonus relating to cash 
flow was achieved. Both the PBTA and the cash flow targets were 
adjusted for the impact of businesses disposed of during the year, 
most notably EWS and for the US footprint project which was 
approved during the year.
Overall, this resulted in the Executive Directors receiving a bonus 
equal to 57.9 per cent of 2015 salary for the year (2014: 31.0 per cent), 
of which 50 per cent will be deferred until March 2019 under the rules 
of the Deferred Share Bonus Plan. This compares to an average 
bonus in 2015, for the 20 most senior managers, of 29.4 per cent 
of maximum potential (2014: 29.3 per cent). This comparator is 
considered by the committee to be the most relevant comparator 
group for bonus purposes.
The calculation of the 2015 bonus, showing the target ranges and outcomes for each element of the bonus scheme, is set out below:
Target £’m
Achievement %
Performance over threshold Bonus as
Measure Threshold 0% Meets 50% Exceeds 100% £’m of target % of salary
Underlying profit before taxation and 
amortisation – 70% weighting 41.3 45.9 50.4 44.9 39.9% 27.9%
Operational cash flow – 30% weighting 35.2 39.1 43.0 43.7 100.0% 30.0%
The current remuneration policy provides that, for deferred bonus shares, malus provisions apply during the deferral period in the exceptional 
circumstance of gross misconduct. However, the Executive Directors have voluntarily agreed to be bound by broader malus provisions covering 
the exceptional circumstances of a material misstatement, gross misconduct, or a material misjudgement of the performance of the Company. Tyman plc

LTIP awards vesting
The announcement of the Group’s results for the year ended 
31 December 2015 was the trigger event for the vesting of the 
2013 LTIP awards made in November 2013. The awards covered the 
performance period from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2015, with 
awards dependent on the cumulative underlying EPS from continuing 
operations for the three years measured against a defined target range.
The underlying basic EPS achieved over the three-year performance 
period ending in December 2015 is set out below:
Performance year Earnings per share
2013 13.71p
2014 18.61p
2015 19.25p
Underlying cumulative EPS 51.57p
The percentage of awards vesting for the 2013 awards is set out below:
Performance
target % of award
Award range Achievement to vest
2013 awards 45.00 – 5 1.50p 51.57p 100.0%
The Remuneration Committee has satisfied itself that the recorded 
underlying cumulative EPS is a genuine reflection of the underlying 
business performance of the Group over the performance period, 
having regard to the Company’s total shareholder return performance 
during that time, and accordingly has approved the vesting of the 
2013 awards at the calculated percentage of 100.0 per cent. As a 
result a total of 800,178 share awards, excluding dividend shares, 
vested in March 2016.
The number of awards that vested for the Executive Directors and 
senior managers, excluding dividend shares where eligible, were:
Award Executive Directors Senior managers Total
2013 awards, excluding 
dividend shares 199,857 600,321 800,178
In addition, dividend shares to the following values were also awarded:
Executive Directors Senior managers Total
Award £’000 £’000 £’000
2013 award 
dividend shares 30 91 121
Awards will be satisfied, in accordance with Group policy, through the 
issuance of shares from the Tyman Employees’ Benefit Trust, shares 
out of Group treasury and new shares.
LTIP awards granted in 2015
On 22 June 2015 (the “Award Date”) the Remuneration Committee 
granted nil or nominal-cost options over 692,562 ordinary shares 
in the Company to 27 senior managers, executives including 
Executive Directors. Vesting of the 2015 LTIPs is based on the 
Company’s three-year cumulative underlying EPS for the financial 
years 2015 to 2017 and is subject to a compulsory holding period 
on vested shares (net of tax) of five years from the Award Date.
With respect to the vesting of the 2015 LTIPs, if over the three 
financial years 2015 to 2017, cumulative underlying EPS is less than 
69.60 pence, no 2015 LTIPs will vest; 25 per cent of 2015 LTIPs 
will vest for cumulative underlying EPS of 69.60 pence, rising on 
a straight-line basis to full vesting for cumulative underlying EPS 
of 78.45 pence or higher. 
In addition, if the Remuneration Committee considers that the 
recorded EPS is not a genuine reflection of the underlying business 
performance of the Company over the three-year performance 
period, it may, at its absolute discretion, reduce the number of vested 
award shares to the extent it considers appropriate (the “Financial 
Underpin”). In applying this Financial Underpin, the Committee shall 
(without limitation) have regard to:
• 
Tyman’s TSR relative to the FTSE All-Share Index and the TSR 
of the median company in a list of pre-determined comparator 
companies (set out in the order of their TSR performance over the 
three calendar years 2015, 2016 and 2017) using such methodology 
for TSR calculations as the Committee shall consider appropriate;
• 
the actual EPS achieved in financial year 2017 and the extent 
to which this exceeds the EPS achieved in financial year 2014;
• 
whether, in the Committee’s opinion, any inappropriate risk taking 
has occurred; and
• 
whether, in the Committee’s opinion, the three-year cumulative 
EPS target has been mostly achieved through the increased 
and inappropriate gearing of the balance sheet.
The 2015 LTIPs are expected to vest in March 2018, following 
the announcement of the Company’s results for the year ended 
31 December 2017 and the holding requirement is expected to 
lapse on 22 June 2020.
Employee Sharesave Plan awards granted in 2015
Tyman encourages employee share ownership through share options 
issued under the ESSP. On 24 September 2015 the Company granted 
share awards (“2015 ESSP Awards”) under the Tyman Sharesave Plan 
and under the Tyman US Sharesave Plan, in the form of options over 
ordinary shares of 5 pence each in the Company (“Ordinary Shares”). 
The 2015 ESSP Awards, which were granted to 208 employees of 
the Company, totalled of 175,750 Ordinary Shares at exercise prices 
ranging from £2.7612 to £2.7730. Vesting of the 2015 ESSP Awards 
will be on 1 November 2018 for those granted under the UK ESSP 
and on 1 November 2016 for those granted under the US ESSP.  Tyman plc

Dilution limit
Generally, it is the intention that LTIP awards will be satisfied through 
the transfer of existing shares by the Tyman Employees’ Benefit Trust 
unless the Remuneration Committee, in its discretion, feels that a 
new issue of shares would be more appropriate. In the event that 
LTIP awards are satisfied through new issue shares, the Company will 
operate within the Investment Association guideline dilution limit of 
10 per cent in 10 years for all share-based incentive schemes. 
The Remuneration Committee has the flexibility to operate 
outside the Investment Association guideline of 5 per cent in 
10 years dilution limit for discretionary share-based incentive 
schemes to accommodate LTIP awards for a broader employee 
population. In managing dilution, the Company will nevertheless be 
mindful of the 5 per cent in 10 years guideline and will be prudent in 
managing the flow rates, keeping shareholders informed of actual 
and anticipated dilution levels over time. The majority of the 2013, 
2014 and 2015 LTIP awards are likely to be satisfied through the 
transfer of existing shares rather than the issue of new shares.
Assuming that all performance targets are met in full, the 
Remuneration Committee currently envisages that none of the 
2,065,661 shares subject to the Awards outstanding will be satisfied 
through new issue shares.
As at 31 December 2015, shares equivalent to 1.6 per cent of 
the Group’s issued share capital (excluding treasury shares) would 
be required to settle all outstanding awards under Employee and 
Executive Share Plans, assuming maximum vesting.
Tyman Employees’ Benefit Trust
The EBT held 1,284,116 Tyman ordinary shares at 31 December 2015.

1  The number of shares over which awards vested during the year above excludes the additional awards made in respect of dividend shares and for the impact of the 
bonus element of the open offer for the Truth acquisition. The result of these adjustments was the award of 8,557 and 11,259 additional shares to Mr Brotherton and 
Mr Eperjesi respectively relating to the 2012 LTIP Awards and the award of 1,232 and 1,622 additional shares to Mr Brotherton and Mr Eperjesi respectively relating 
to the 2011 DSBP Awards. 
2  The exact date in March that LTIP and DSBP awards will vest will depend on the date of the Group’s results announcement for the year ended on the previous 31 December.
Market value at grant date is calculated using the closing mid market share price of Tyman plc on the date in question. Awards under both 
the DSBP and LTIP are made using average historic share prices calculated over a number of days prior to grant (LTIP 30 days and DSBP 
5 business days). Tyman plc

Current salary CEO – £397,000
CFO – £245,000
Pension allowance CEO – 20 per cent of base salary
CFO – 15 per cent of base salary
Benefits Typically life assurance cover, critical illness 
cover, private medical and dental cover, 
car allowance and professional tax and 
financial advice.
Annual bonus 100 per cent of base salary, with 50 per 
cent in cash and 50 per cent in shares 
deferred for three years. Targets for 2016 
will be all based on financial objectives. 
LTIP Normally nil-cost options of up to 100 
per cent of base salary, but exceptionally 
150 per cent. Performance metrics based 
on cumulative underlying EPS measured 
over a three-year period, with a discretionary 
total shareholder return underpin. Typically, 
25 per cent vests for threshold performance 
(zero per cent below threshold) increasing 
pro rata to 100 per cent vesting for stretch 
performance. LTIP awards to be retained 
for two years after vesting. 
Basic salary
The salaries of the two Executive Directors, together with 25 of the 
Group’s senior management team, were reviewed in December 2015. 
The weighted average increase awarded for the group of senior 
managers was 3.0 per cent, reflecting local market conditions in the 
various geographies where Tyman operates together with a handful 
of market comparison-led increases. The Executive Directors were 
awarded a similar average increase, with the salary of the Group Chief 
Executive increasing by 2.6 per cent from £387,000 to £397,000 and 
that of the CFO by 3.4 per cent from £237 ,000 to £245,000. All increases 
took effect from 1 January 2016. 
Car allowance
In line with the structure of the remuneration packages of their direct 
reports and in accordance with the Group’s remuneration policy, the 
Remuneration Committee awarded both Executive Directors a car 
allowance of £15,000 per annum with effect from 1 January 2016.
Cash allowance in lieu of pension
The cash allowances to be paid in lieu of pension remain unchanged 
for 2016, with the CEO receiving 20 per cent of base salary and the 
CFO 15 per cent of base salary.
Annual bonus
The maximum opportunity for the two Executive Directors under the 
2016 annual bonus plan remains unchanged at 100 per cent of basic 
salary. The performance measures for 2016 also remain unchanged 
at 70 per cent linked to profitability (PBTA) and 30 per cent linked to 
cash flow measures. During 2016, the profit measure is to be related 
to internal financial targets and to prior year financial outcomes whilst 
the cash flow measure is to be linked to internal financial targets and 
cash conversion ratios. In prior years the linkages were to internal 
financial targets only. It is expected that targets for the 2016 annual 
bonus plans will be disclosed in the 2016 Annual Report provided 
they are not deemed to be commercially sensitive at that time.
LTIP awards
It is anticipated that an award of shares will be made under Tyman’s 
Long Term Incentive Plan in mid-March 2016, shortly after the 
release of the Group’s financial results for 2015 (the “2016 Awards”), 
with the two Executive Directors being awarded shares to the value 
of 100 per cent of their respective base salaries. The measurement 
period for the 2016 Awards will be from 1 January 2016 to 31 
December 2018.
The 2016 Awards are expected to vest (to the extent that the 
performance conditions have been satisfied) in March 2019; 
however, in line with the Group’s policy on the vesting of LTIPs, 
Executive Directors will ordinarily be required to hold all vested 
awards under the 2016 Awards for a further two years until March 2021. 
The performance measures are anticipated to be unchanged, and in 
line with the remuneration policy, being cumulative underlying earnings 
per share over the three-year performance period supplemented with 
a discretionary underpin in line with that used for the 2015 Award 
as set out on page 70.
The Committee will report back on the actual 2016 Awards granted, 
along with the absolute level of the performance measures, in its 
2016 Annual report on remuneration.

Report on the Group financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion, Tyman plc’s Group financial statements 
(the “financial statements”):
• 
give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 
31 December 2015 and of its profit and cash flows for the year 
then ended;
• 
have been properly prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the 
European Union; and
• 
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of 
the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
What we have audited
The financial statements, included within the Annual Report 
and Accounts (the “Annual Report”), comprise:
• 
the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2015;
• 
the consolidated income statement and statement of 
comprehensive income for the year then ended;
• 
the consolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended;
• 
the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year 
then ended; and
• 
the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of 
significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the 
Annual Report, rather than in the notes to the financial statements. 
These are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are 
identified as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union.
• Overall Group materiality: £2.5 million which represents 5 per cent of underlying operating profit before tax.
• Five operating units subject to full scope audits on the basis of financial significance.
• Specific procedures over certain transactions and balances at eight further operating units where the particular 
balances were financially significant.
• Components where full scope audits performed accounted for 71 per cent of Group revenue and 67 per cent 
of Group underlying operating profit before tax.
• Goodwill and intangible asset impairment assessments, particularly in respect of the Schlegel International Cash 
Generating Unit (“CGU”).
• Carrying value of provisions, particularly property related provisions and warranty provisions.
The scope of our audit and our area of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing 
the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In 
particular, we looked at where the Directors made subjective 
judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting 
estimates that involved making assumptions and considering 
future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits we 
also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, 
Materiality
Audit scope
Areas of 
focus
including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the Directors 
that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our 
audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are identified 
as “areas of focus” in the table opposite. We have also set out how we 
tailored our audit to address these specific areas in order to provide 
an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments 
we make on the results of our procedures should be read in this context. 
This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.  Tyman plc

Goodwill and intangible assets impairment assessment
There is £253.7 million of goodwill and £86.8 million of intangible 
assets on the balance sheet, predominantly arising from past 
acquisitions. The Group operates in the building products market and 
therefore future results are impacted by fluctuations in the housing 
market and wider economy.
We focused on these balances because the determination of 
whether or not an impairment charge was necessary involved 
significant judgements about the future results of the business.
In particular, we focused on the estimated value in use calculations 
of the Schlegel International cash generating unit (“CGU”) (£18.1 million 
goodwill) for which there is limited headroom as a result of it having 
a high degree of exposure to European markets, where the housing 
market and wider economic environment continues to be difficult. 
The Schlegel International CGU has not met budget for the last 
three years, predominantly due to these market factors. 
The value in use calculation to support the carrying value of goodwill 
and intangibles in the Schlegel International CGU includes the 
impact of some anticipated improvement in European housing 
markets and realisation of the benefits of investment made by the 
Group over the last two years in consolidating the manufacturing 
footprint and closure of loss-making business units and 
strengthening the management structure.
The Group’s other CGUs, ERA and AmesburyTruth, operate in the UK 
or US markets which have experienced positive growth and each 
have significant headroom relative to the CGU carrying value.
For all CGUs, including Schlegel International, we evaluated 
management’s future cash flow forecasts and tested the underlying 
value in use calculations. We agreed management’s forecast to the 
latest Board approved strategic plan. We also compared historic actual 
results to those budgeted to assess the quality of management’s 
forecasting. Whilst Schlegel International have not met budget for the 
last three years, we have evaluated the reasons for this and management 
have reduced growth expectations compared to previous years. 
Based on this, we considered the forecasts to be balanced.
The key assumptions in the calculations were growth in revenue 
and EBITDA margins. In assessing these assumptions we considered 
external construction industry outlook reports and economic growth 
forecasts from a variety of sources, as these are the main drivers of 
building product sales. Where management’s growth assumptions 
were in excess of these external forecasts, we evaluated management’s 
rationale, being the benefit of restructuring and closure of loss-making 
business units and investment made over the last two years and 
consider the forecasts to have been prepared on a supportable basis.
We also tested:
• 
management’s assumption in respect of the long term growth 
rates in the forecasts by comparing them to long term average 
growth rates of the economies in the relevant territories; and
• 
the discount rate by assessing the cost of capital for the Company 
and comparable organisations.
We were satisfied these assumptions were appropriate.
Sensitivity analysis was also performed in respect of the key assumptions, 
which were flexed within a reasonable range, and determined at what 
level this would eliminate the headroom in the model. The Schlegel 
International CGU was the only CGU which was highly sensitive to 
changes in the key assumptions, as outlined in the disclosure in note 
10. We are satisfied the disclosures in note 10 highlight the limited 
headroom and the sensitivity of Schlegel International to changes 
in key assumptions.

How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed 
enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements 
as a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the 
Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry 
in which the Group operates. 
The Group is structured along three business lines being AmesburyTruth, 
ERA, and Schlegel International along with centralised functions 
covering Group treasury and central costs. The Group financial 
statements are a consolidation of the 46 reporting units for the 
Group’s operating businesses, which map into the three business 
lines and centralised functions.
Of the Group’s 46 reporting units, we identified five which, in our 
view, required an audit of their complete financial information, due 
to their size. The units were based in the United Kingdom (“UK”) 
and the United States (“US”).
Specific audit procedures on certain balances and transactions were 
performed at a further eight reporting units, as while overall the units 
were not financially significant, certain transactions and balances 
were material or considered to be higher risk, including provisions, 
borrowings, cash, operating expenses, exceptional expenses, and 
interest expense. This included PwC Spain undertaking specific 
procedures on the exceptional redundancy expense arising from 
the closure of Schlegel Taliana.
In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we determined 
the type of work that needed to be performed at each of the reporting 
units either by us, as the Group engagement team, or the US and 
Spain PwC network firms operating under our instruction. Where 
work was performed by the US firm, the UK engagement leader and 
Senior Manager visited the US component team, reviewed audit work 
papers related to areas of focus, and participated in the US component 
clearance meetings.

Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Carrying value of provisions
The Group holds a number of provisions which are inherently 
judgemental, including:
Property related provisions (£4.6 million)
The Group has been built up through acquisition and is in the process of 
going through a footprint rationalisation programme which has resulted 
in the exit and consolidation of manufacturing and warehouse facilities. 
Consequently there are a number of manufacturing and warehouse 
sites which are no longer used. Provisions have therefore been made 
in relation to onerous leases. In addition, a number of leasehold 
properties require the Group to reinstate them to their original 
state of repair, for which dilapidation provisions have been made. 
We focused on these because there is inherent judgement in 
assessing the cost of repairs at the end of a lease term.
Warranty provisions (£1.9 million)
The provision is based on the estimated costs of warranty claims 
on products sold. We focused on this provision as the estimation and 
timing of costs in respect of future warranty claims requires judgement, 
and, as such, there is a risk that the provision may be understated.
Property related provisions
Onerous lease provisions are based on the residual lease period and 
contractual lease payments, discounted for the time value of money. 
Our approach to onerous lease provision calculations included agreeing 
remaining rental costs to lease agreements and assessing the 
reasonableness of discount rates applied against the risk free interest 
rate in each applicable country. We were satisfied the onerous lease 
provisions were made on a reasonable basis.
The Group has implemented a rolling programme of obtaining updated 
external valuations for costs of reinstating leasehold properties to their 
original state of repair. We reviewed available external valuation reports, 
assessed the competence of the valuer by reviewing qualifications, 
and agreed the estimate by the expert to management’s calculation. 
Where no external valuations were available, we considered the 
reasonableness of the items included in the calculation, being the 
estimated removal costs of equipment, and repair costs considering 
the relative size and complexity of work across sites. We also compared 
the provisions made by management in prior years to the external 
valuations to assess the accuracy of management’s estimations, 
noting that there was no significant difference between management’s 
previous estimate and the external valuation.
Based on the work performed, we were satisfied that the property related 
provisions had been made on a reasonable basis.
Warranty provisions
We tested the accuracy of management’s calculation of forecast 
claims, which contain a general element based on historic claims 
experience, and specific elements for known warranty issues, and 
compared the level of historic warranty claims to that forecast. 
Based on the work performed, we were satisfied that the provision 
was made on a reasonable basis. Tyman plc

Report on the group financial statements continued
How we tailored the audit scope continued
In addition to the site visits we held regular phone calls with the US 
team and obtained formal reporting. The US engagement leader 
also attended the Group Audit Committee meeting in the UK. Where 
work was performed by the Spanish firm, we have held regular calls 
and obtained formal reporting. We concluded sufficient appropriate 
audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the 
Group financial statements as a whole.
Components where we performed full scope audits accounted for 
71 per cent of Group revenue and 67 per cent of Group underlying 
operating profit before tax. Further coverage was provided through 
the work over specified balances and transactions at the additional 
eight reporting units where these transactions or balances were 
financially significant. We considered the quantitative and 
qualitative characteristics of the remaining reporting units which 
comprise a large number of small units in which we consider the risk 
of material misstatement to the Group to be low. The Group team 
performed appropriate analytical procedures over these remaining 
units. Together with additional procedures performed at the Group 
level on balances such as goodwill, intangible assets, and taxation, 
this gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the Group 
financial statements as a whole.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of 
materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. 
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to 
determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent 
of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line 
items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, 
both individually and on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality 
for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall Group 
materiality
£2.5 million (2014: £2.0 million).
How we 
determined it
5% of underlying operating profit before tax.
Rationale for 
benchmark 
applied
Underlying operating profit before tax is the 
key measure used internally by management in 
assessing the performance of the Group, externally 
by analysts, and is the measure disclosed as a key 
performance indicator in the Annual Report. This 
measure provides us with a consistent year on year 
basis for determining materiality based on trading 
performance and eliminates the impact of non-recurring 
items. Underlying operating profit excludes net finance 
costs, exceptional items, amortisation of acquired 
intangible assets, and impairment of acquired 
intangible assets and goodwill.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to 
them misstatements identified during our audit above £125,000 
(2014: £100,000) as well as misstatements below that amount that, 
in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ 
statement, set out on page 50, in relation to going concern. 
We have nothing to report having performed our review. 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have 
anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to the 
directors’ statement about whether they considered it appropriate to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. 
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to. 
As noted in the Directors’ statement, the Directors have concluded 
that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the financial statements. The going concern basis presumes that 
the Group has adequate resources to remain in operation, and that 
the Directors intend it to do so, for at least one year from the date 
the financial statements were signed. As part of our audit we have 
concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis is 
appropriate. However, because not all future events or conditions can 
be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.

Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have 
anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to:
• 
the Directors’ confirmation on page 56 
of the Annual Report, in accordance with 
provision C.2.1 of the Code, that they have 
carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group, including 
those that would threaten its business 
model, future performance, solvency 
or liquidity.
We have nothing

• 
the disclosures in the Annual Report 
that describe those risks and explain how 
they are being managed or mitigated.
We have nothing 
material to add or

• 
the Directors’ explanation on page 35 
of the Annual Report, in accordance with 
provision C.2.2 of the Code, as to how they 
have assessed the prospects of the Group, 
over what period they have done so and 
why they consider that period to be 
appropriate, and their statement as to 
whether they have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall 
due over the period of their assessment, 
including any related disclosures drawing 
attention to any necessary qualifications 
or assumptions.
We have nothing 
material to add or 
to draw attention to.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ 
statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group and the Directors’ statement in 
relation to the longer term viability of the group. Our review was 
substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of 
making inquiries and considering the Directors’ process supporting 
their statements; checking that the statements are in alignment with 
the relevant provisions of the Code; and considering whether the 
statements are consistent with the knowledge acquired by us in the 
course of performing our audit. We have nothing to report having 
performed our review.
Adequacy of information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit. We have no exceptions to 
report arising from this responsibility. 
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration 
specified by law are not made. We have no exceptions to report 
arising from this responsibility.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement 
set out on page 51, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only 
for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 
of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We 
do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for 
any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is 
shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed 
by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: 
• 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; 
• 
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates 
made by the Directors; and 
• 
the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ 
judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, 
and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing 
techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable 
basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through 
testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a 
combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in 
the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. 
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

We have reported separately on the Company financial statements 
of Tyman plc for the year ended 31 December 2015 and on the

Notes to the financial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2015
1. General information
Tyman plc (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (together, the “Group”) is a leading international manufacturer and supplier of engineered 
components to the door and window industry. At 31 December 2015 the Group has 20 manufacturing sites in eight countries along with 
a further five sourcing and distribution sites across North America, Europe, Asia and Australasia with its products being found in homes 
and buildings worldwide.
The Company is a public limited company listed on the London Stock Exchange. The Company is incorporated and domiciled in England 
and Wales. The address of its registered office is 29 Queen Anne’s Gate, London SW1H 9BU.
2. Accounting policies and basis of preparation
The accounting policies in this section relate to the financial statements in their entirety. Accounting policies, including critical accounting 
judgements and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements, that relate to a particular note are described in the specific 
note to which they relate. The accounting policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
2.1 Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of Tyman plc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
and IFRS Interpretations Committee as adopted by the European Union and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting 
under IFRSs. 
The consolidated financial statements are principally prepared on the basis of historic cost. Where other bases are applied, these are identified 
in the relevant accounting policy. 
2.2 Going concern
The Group’s strategic plan covers the period to 31 December 2018. The Group’s banking and private placement facilities are committed 
beyond the period of the strategic plan and contain significant covenant headroom. The Group’s published year-end leverage target of 1.50x 
to 2.00x is designed to ensure that the Group has structural headroom on its financial covenants as it comes into each financial year such that 
it could withstand a material downturn in its end markets and any normalisation of interest rates. 
In order to satisfy itself that the Group has adequate resources for the future, the Board reviewed the Group’s committed funding and liquidity 
positions, its ability to generate cash from trading activities and its ability to raise external funding in the future. The operational performance, 
the future plans for the Group and the risks facing the Group were also reviewed. In addition, note 18 to the consolidated financial statements 
includes the Group’s policies and processes for managing capital, liquidity and credit risks as well as details of its financial instruments and 
hedging strategies. 
In performing its reviews, the Board acknowledges the current level of growth prospects in global markets and has considered various 
sensitivity analyses when assessing the forecast funding and headroom requirements of the Group.
The Directors are therefore confident, on the basis of current financial projections and the banking facilities available, and after considering 
sensitivities, that the Company and the Group has sufficient resources for its operational needs that will enable the Group to remain in compliance 
with its financial covenants in its bank facilities for at least the next 12 months. Accordingly, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis.
2.3 Accounting judgements and estimates
The preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Group’s accounting policies. It also 
requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income 
and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised and in any affected future periods. 
The areas representing the critical judgements made by management in the preparation of the Group’s financial statements are listed 
below and in more detail in the related notes: 
• 
the carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets (note 10);
• 
the carrying amount of inventories (note 12);
• 
the carrying amount of trade receivables (note 13); and
• 
provisions (note 19).
The areas involving key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty that are significant to the 
financial statements are listed below and in more detail in the related notes: 
• 
deferred tax assets (note 8); and
• 
defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit schemes (note 20).
2.4 Changes in accounting policy and disclosures
2.4.1 New, revised and amended EU endorsed accounting standards
There were no new or amended accounting standards relevant to the Group’s results that are effective for the first time in 2015 that have 
a material impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements. Financial statements

2.4 Changes in accounting policy and disclosures continued
2.4.2 New, revised and amended accounting standards currently EU endorsed but not yet effective
A number of new, revised and amended accounting standards and interpretations are currently endorsed but are effective for annual periods 
beginning after 1 January 2016, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements. None of these are expected 
to have material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group, except the following:
Accounting standard Requirement
IFRS 16 Leases Under the previous guidance in IAS 17 , a lessee had to make a distinction between a finance 
lease (on balance sheet) and an operating lease (off balance sheet). The new standard requires 
lessees to recognise almost all lease contracts on the balance sheet; the only optional 
exemptions are for certain short term leases and leases of low-value assets. An interest expense 
on the lease liability and depreciation on the ‘right-of-use’ asset will also have to be recognised. 
IFRS 16 will be effective for the first time for the year beginning on or after 1 January 2019 
(subject to EU endorsement).
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers IFRS 15 deals with revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful 
information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and 
uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity’s contracts with customers. 
Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has 
the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good or service. The standard 
replaces IAS 18 Revenue and IAS 11 Construction contracts and related interpretations. 
It is not anticipated that this will have a material impact on the Group; however, additional 
disclosures will be required. IFRS 15 will be effective for the first time for the year beginning 
on or after 1 January 2018 (subject to EU endorsement).
IFRS 9 Financial instruments IFRS 9 addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and 
financial liabilities. It replaces the guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the classification and 
measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 establishes three primary measurement 
categories for financial assets: amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income 
and fair value through profit or loss. The basis of classification depends on the entity’s business 
model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. Investments in equity 
instruments are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss with the irrevocable 
option at inception to present changes in fair value in other comprehensive income not recycling. 
The standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 (subject to 
EU endorsement). The Group is in the process of assessing IFRS 9’s full impact.
There are no other IFRSs that are not yet effective that would be expected to have material impact on the Group.
2.5 Consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, 
variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries 
are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are 
also eliminated. Where necessary, amounts reported by subsidiaries have been adjusted to conform to the Group’s accounting policies.
2.6 Foreign exchange
2.6.1 Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are presented in British Pounds, 
which is the functional currency of the Company and the presentation currency of the Group.
2.6.2 Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates 
of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in other 
comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges. Other than the ineffective element, these are 
recognised directly in equity until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in the income statement.
2.6.3 Group companies
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of Group companies denominated in foreign currencies are translated into British Pounds at the exchange 
rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated into British Pounds at the average rates throughout the year.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of opening net assets of Group companies, together with differences arising from 
the translation of the net results at average or actual rates to the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date, are taken to other 
comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign entity, the cumulative translation differences recognised in other comprehensive income 
relating to that particular foreign operation are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal. Tyman plc

3. Segment reporting
3.1 Accounting policy
3.1.1 Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Revenue represents the amounts receivable for goods 
supplied, stated net of discounts, returns and value-added taxes.
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group and when the amount of 
revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have 
been substantially transferred to the buyer. Other than goods sold free on board, this is usually on dispatch of the goods.
3.1.2 Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision-Makers. 
The Chief Operating Decision-Makers, defined as the Board of Directors, are responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance 
of the operating segments.
3.2 Segment information
The reporting segments reflect the manner in which performance is evaluated and resources are allocated. The Group operates through 
three clearly defined Divisions, namely: AmesburyTruth, ERA and Schlegel International. 
Following the closure of the Group’s Barcelona, Spain facility in 2015, the Board reviewed the appropriateness of the disclosure of the 
Group’s operating segments. Following this review, the 2015 operating segmental analysis disclosure has been presented under the Group’s 
current organisational structure with 2014 comparatives restated. Under the revised segmental analysis, ERA comprises the Group’s UK and 
Ireland hardware business, together with Ventrolla. Schlegel International comprises all of the Group’s other business outside of the US, 
Canada and Mexico including the two UK seal manufacturing plants previously reported as part of ERA. Tyman Sourcing Asia is reported 
through the ERA Division. This change reflects the Group’s day-to-day operational and management structure in 2015, with the Schlegel 
International management team being responsible for the Group’s sealing businesses outside North America. No changes have been 
made to the AmesburyTruth segmental disclosure. 
In addition, the Group has implemented a revised methodology for the allocation of certain functional costs incurred centrally to the Group’s 
operating segments. Historically, all centrally incurred costs were allocated pro rata to each of the Group’s Divisions broadly on the basis of their 
proportional contribution to Group revenue. For the 2015 disclosures going forward centrally incurred costs which are directly attributable 
to the Division will be allocated or recharged to that Division. All other centrally incurred costs and eliminations will be disclosed in aggregate 
as a separate line item in the segmental analysis. The 2014 comparatives have been restated to reflect the revised reporting structure.
The Board believes that the revised segmental analysis and disclosure of central costs will allow analysts and investors a better understanding 
of the relative contribution of each of the Divisions to the Group as well as more accurately reflect the day-to-day operational structure of 
the Group.
Each reporting segment broadly represents the Group’s geographical focus, being the North American, the UK and International operations 
respectively. In the opinion of the Board, there is no material difference between the Group’s operating segments and segments based on 
geographical splits apart from those disclosed in notes 3.2.1 and 3.2.4. Accordingly, the Board does not consider geographically defined 
segments to be reportable.
The following tables present Group revenue and profit information for the Group’s product segments, which have been generated using 
the Group accounting policies, with no differences of measurement applied, other than those noted above.

5. Employees and employee costs
5.1 Accounting policy
5.1.1 Wages and salaries
Wages and salaries are recognised in the income statement as the employees’ services are rendered.
5.1.2 Termination benefits
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an 
employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises termination benefits at the earlier of 
the following dates:
• 
when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits; and
• 
when the entity recognises costs for a restructuring that is within the scope of IAS 37 and involves the payment of termination benefits.
In the case of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy, the termination benefits are measured based on the number of 
employees expected to accept the offer. Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the end of the reporting period are discounted 
to their present value.
5.1.3 Profit sharing and bonus plans
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit sharing, based on a formula that takes into consideration the profit 
attributable to the Company’s shareholders after certain adjustments. The Group recognises a provision where contractually obliged or 
where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.

6. Exceptional items
6.1 Accounting policy
 
Where certain income or expense items recorded in the period are material by their size or incidence, the Group presents such items as 
exceptional within a separate line on the income statement, except for those exceptional items that relate to net finance costs and tax. 
Separate presentation provides an improved understanding of the elements of financial performance during the year so as to facilitate 
comparison with prior periods and to assess trends in financial performance.
Exceptional items include one-off redundancy and restructuring costs, and transaction costs associated with merger and acquisition activity.

footprint project. 
M&A and integration costs
The charge for the year principally relates to legal, financial, taxation and consultancy costs associated with M&A activity undertaken 
during 2015. 
Loss on disposal of business
The loss on disposal of business relates to the sale of EWS announced in September 2015 for a net cash consideration of £6,754,000 and 
includes the write off of goodwill and intangibles associated with EWS of £5,921,000. A summary of the loss on disposal and the net cash 
inflow on disposal are disclosed in note 22.
Redundancy and restructuring
Redundancy and restructuring comprises certain one-off redundancy and restructuring programmes undertaken by the Divisions during 
the year, most notably the restructuring of the ERA Division in anticipation of the consolidation into a single site in 2017.
Property provision releases and disposals
Property provision releases and disposals of £684,000 comprises £230,000 of profit realised on the disposal of land and buildings in the UK 
together with £454,000 of surplus onerous lease provisions released during the year. In 2014 gains of £398,000 were realised following the disposal 
of surplus property in the US.  Tyman plc

8. Taxation
8.1 Accounting policy
Income tax charge comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to 
items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in other comprehensive income or directly 
in equity.
The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date 
in the countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income.
Deferred income tax is recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the consolidated financial statements. No deferred tax liabilities are recognised if it arises from the initial recognition of:
• 
goodwill; or
• 
an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting 
nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are 
expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which 
the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax liabilities are provided on taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except for deferred 
income tax liabilities where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised on deductible temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries only to the extent 
that it is probable the temporary difference will reverse in the future and there is sufficient taxable profit against which the temporary 
difference can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the 
same tax entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
8.1.1 Key source of estimation uncertainty: deferred tax assets
Estimation is required of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their tax base. Deferred tax 
liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences but, where deductible temporary differences exist, management’s 
judgement is required as to whether a deferred tax asset should be recognised based on the availability of future taxable profits. It is 
possible that the deferred tax assets actually recoverable may differ from the amounts recognised if actual taxable profits differ from 
management’s estimates. Financial statements

The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK changed from 21 per cent to 20 per cent with effect from 1 April 2015. Accordingly, the 
Group’s UK profits for this accounting period are taxed at an effective rate of 20.25 per cent (2014: 21.50 per cent).
A reduction in the UK corporate tax rate to 19 per cent was substantively enacted on 26 October 2015 and will be effective from 1 April 2017. 
A further reduction to 18 per cent, effective 1 April 2020, was substantively enacted on that same date. The deferred tax balances have been 
remeasured to reflect these future changes of rate. The impact of the deferred tax rate change has not been material in the 2015 year. 
Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at rates prevailing in those respective jurisdictions. 
8.2.2 Reconciliation of the total tax charge

The deferred tax asset arises from timing differences in the US, UK and Australia. Given both recent and forecast trading, the Directors are 
of the opinion that the level of profits in the foreseeable future are more likely than not to be sufficient to recover these assets. 
Deferred tax liabilities of £23,718,000 (2014: £25,351,000) are expected to fall due after more than one year and deferred tax assets 
of £8,132,000 (2014: £9,568,000) are expected to be recovered after more than one year.

As the future use of these losses is uncertain, in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy, none of these losses has been recognised 
as a deferred tax asset.

No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of £57,799,000 (2014: £53,800,000) relating to the unremitted earnings 
of overseas subsidiaries. As a result of UK legislation, which largely exempts from UK tax the overseas dividends received, the temporary 
differences arising on unremitted profits are unlikely to lead to additional UK corporate taxes. Furthermore, although the remittance to the 
UK of those earnings could still result in a tax liability, arising as a result of withholding taxes levied by some overseas tax jurisdictions in which 
those subsidiaries operate, such jurisdictions provide currently for zero dividend withholding tax in their tax agreements with the UK.
9. Earnings per share
9.1 Non-GAAP measure accounting policy
The Directors believe that the underlying profit and earnings per share measures provide additional useful information to shareholders 
on the underlying performance of the business. These measures are consistent with how business performance is measured internally. 
The underlying profit before tax measure is not recognised under IFRS and may not be comparable with underlying profit measures used 
by other companies. 
The adjustments made to reported profit before tax is to derive underlying profit before taxation exclude the following:
• 
Exceptional items – these are largely one off in nature and therefore create volatility in reported earnings.
• 
Amortisation of borrowing costs, accelerated amortisation of borrowing costs, amortisation of acquired intangible assets, impairment 
of acquired intangible assets, impairment of goodwill and unwinding of discount on provisions – these are non-cash in nature and the 
events giving rise to them are expected to be infrequent.

10. Goodwill and intangible assets
10.1 Accounting policy
10.1.1 Goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the Group’s interest in 
the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the CGUs that are expected to benefit 
from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity 
at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill is monitored at the operating segment level.
Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential 
impairment. The carrying amount of goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair 
value less costs of disposal. Any impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.
10.1.2 Intangible assets
Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment. On acquisition of businesses by the Group, the Group 
recognises any separately identifiable intangible assets separately from goodwill, initially measuring the intangible assets at fair value.
Purchased intangible assets acquired through a business combination, including purchased brands, customer relationships, trademarks and 
licences, are initially measured at fair value and amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives as follows:
• 
Acquired brands – 5 to 20 years
• 
Customer relationships – 9 to 15 years
• 
Internally developed computer software – 5 to 10 years
• 
Purchased computer software – 3 to 4 years Financial statements

10.1 Accounting policy continued
10.1.2 Intangible assets continued
Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software products controlled 
by the Group are recognised as intangible assets when the following criteria are met:
• 
it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use;
• 
management intends to complete the software product and use it or sell it;
• 
there is an ability to use or sell the software product;
• 
it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benefits;
• 
adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the software product are available; and
• 
the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured.
Directly attributable costs capitalised as part of the software product include the software development employee costs and an 
appropriate portion of relevant overheads. Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an 
expense as incurred. Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period. 
Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised when the intangible assets are in the location and condition 
necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. 
The estimated useful lives of acquired intangible assets are reviewed whenever events or circumstances indicate that there has been a 
change in the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset. Any amendments to the estimated 
useful lives of intangible assets are recorded as a change in estimate in the period the change occurred.
10.1.3 Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
Intangible assets, including goodwill, that have an indefinite useful life or intangible assets not ready to use are not subject to amortisation 
and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying 
amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value in 
use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are largely independent cash inflows 
(CGUs). Prior impairments of non-financial assets (other than goodwill) are reviewed for possible reversal at each reporting date. Goodwill 
previously impaired cannot be reversed at a later date.
10.1.4 Critical accounting estimates and judgements: carrying amount of goodwill and intangibles
As at 31 December 2015, the Group had goodwill of £253,718,000 with intangible assets amounting in total to £86,772,000. An impairment 
review using a value in use calculation has been performed for each CGU. There is significant judgement involved in determining appropriate 
assumptions to use in the calculations, including the forecasted cash flows of each CGU and appropriate discount rates relative to the 
Company’s cost of capital. These assumptions have been subjected to sensitivity analyses. Details of estimates used and sensitivities in the 
impairment reviews are set out in this note.

The ERA and Schlegel International CGUs have been amended to reflect the current Group operating structure (see note 3). Accordingly, 
impairment testing as at 31 December 2015 has been performed on the basis of the revenues and cash flows directly attributable to the 
respective ERA and Schlegel International CGUs, which now mirror the operating segments.
The Board, in its capacity as Chief Operating Decision-Maker, believes that these amendments to the Group’s CGUs provide a more accurate 
reflection of the revenues, cash flows and value in use attributable to the Group’s intangible assets and therefore constitute the most appropriate 
basis for the conduct of impairment testing.
10.2.1 Impairment tests for goodwill
Assumptions
The recoverable amounts of CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. Value in use is determined by discounting the future pre-tax 
cash flows generated from the continuing use of the CGU, using a pre-tax discount rate. 
Cash flow projections are derived from financial plans approved by the Board and cover a five-year period. They reflect management’s 
expectations of revenue growth, operating cost and margin for each CGU based on past experience. Cash flows after the five-year forecast 
period were extrapolated using a long term growth rate of 1.50 per cent in order to calculate the terminal recoverable amount. 
Discount rates are estimated using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risk profiles of the CGUs. 
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations in each of the Group’s CGUs at 31 December 2015 are as follows: 
Average EBITDA growth
Average pre-tax discount rate for years one to five
2015 2014 2015 2014
AmesburyTruth 13.6% 13.2% 10.1% 10.1%
ERA 8.9% 9.4% 9.4% 8.3%
Schlegel International 13.4% 12.7% 20.3% 32.9%
Impairment review results: 2015
The closure of the manufacturing facility in Taliana, Spain has given rise to a £1,796,000 impairment of goodwill, previously forming part 
of the Schlegel International CGU. Impairment of goodwill is included in administrative expenses in the income statement. 
A review of the carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets across the Group has been carried out at year end in light of current 
trading conditions and future prospects. Apart from an impairment charge noted above, the annual impairment review did not result 
in any further impairment losses being recognised in the 2015 year. 
Whilst economic conditions in European markets continue to be challenging, the carrying amounts of goodwill and intangible assets 
in Schlegel International are considered to be sustainable based on current projections. If markets continue to deteriorate, this could give 
a further impairment charge at a future date.
The AmesburyTruth and ERA CGUs both have significant headroom such that a permanent diminution of the value in use to below the carrying 
value of goodwill is considered by the Board to be highly unlikely. The headroom in the Schlegel International CGU is materially lower and accordingly 
the Board has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the cash flows of this CGU.
Sensitivity of assumptions
A sensitivity analysis was conducted by lowering the forecast EBITDA margin for Schlegel International, the assumption the model was most 
sensitive to, by a constant percentage each year from year one onwards to perpetuity until the excess of value in use over the carrying amount 
of the CGU’s assets was reduced to zero. Schlegel International’s EBITDA margin would need to be 211 basis points lower than the five-year 
average base margin in each year from year one to perpetuity before the excess of the value in use over the carrying amount of the assets 
would be reduced to zero.
Given the strengthened management structure and significant investment made in the Schlegel international CGU, the Board believes it 
is unlikely that such a sustained deterioration in EBITDA margins would occur. Whilst economic conditions in European markets continue to 
be challenging, the carrying amounts of goodwill and intangible assets in Schelgel International are considered to be sustainable based on 
current projections. If markets continue to deteriorate, this could give a further impairment charge at a future dates and the Board will keep 
this under review.
Accordingly, the Board has concluded that at 31 December 2015 there is no permanent diminution in the carrying value of the goodwill 
attributable to the Schelgel International CGU.
Impairment review results: 2014
The closure of the Belgium Industrial Products operations gave rise to a £3,411,000 impairment of goodwill, previously forming part 
of the Schlegel International CGU. Impairment of goodwill was included in administrative expenses in the income statement in 2014. Financial statements

of acquired intangible assets and a £27,000 impairment of computer software in 2014.
11. Property, plant and equipment
11.1 Accounting policy
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Cost includes expenditure that is 
directly attributable to the acquisition of the assets. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a 
separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the specific asset will flow to the 
Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and 
maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Freehold land is not depreciated. Depreciation is provided on all other property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write off the 
cost less estimated residual value of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life, at the following annual rates:
• 
Freehold buildings – 2 to 5 per cent
• 
Plant and machinery – 7.5 to 33 per cent
The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment periodically if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The assets’ residual values, useful lives and method of depreciation are 
reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised in the income statement. Tyman plc

12. Inventories
12.1 Accounting policy
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined in accordance with the first-in, first-out method. Cost 
includes the cost of materials determined on a purchase cost basis, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of manufacturing overheads 
based on normal levels of activity. It excludes borrowing costs. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of 
business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Where necessary, a provision is made to reduce cost to no more than net realisable value having regard to the nature and condition of 
inventory, as well as its anticipated saleability.
12.1.1 Critical accounting estimates and judgements: carrying amount of inventories
The carrying amounts of inventories are stated with due allowance for excess, obsolete or slow-moving items. Group management exercises 
judgement in assessing net realisable value and provisions for slow-moving and obsolete inventory which is based on current assessments 
of future demand, market conditions and new product development initiatives. Financial statements

There were no borrowings secured on the inventories of the Group (2014: £Nil).
13. Trade and other receivables
13.1 Accounting policy
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold in the ordinary course of business. If collection is expected in one 
year or less they are classified as current assets; otherwise they are presented as non-current assets.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost, using 
the effective interest rate method, less appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts (provision for impairment).
13.1.1 Critical accounting estimates and judgements: carrying amount of trade receivables
Provision against trade receivables is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due to 
it in accordance with the original terms of those receivables. The amount of the write down is determined as the difference between the 
carrying amount and present value of estimated future cash flows. Group management exercises judgement in assessing the amount 
of any write downs required which is based on current assessments of the creditworthiness of current customers.

The debt placement is unsecured and comprises US$55,000,000 debt with a seven-year maturity at a coupon of 4.97 per cent and US$45,000,000 
with a 10-year maturity at a coupon of 5.37 per cent. 
17. Derivative financial instruments
17.1 Accounting policy
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are 
subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when fair value is positive and as liabilities when fair value is negative.
The Group designates certain derivatives as either:
• 
hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm commitment (fair value hedge);
• 
hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge); or
• 
hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge).
For those instruments designated as hedges, the Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging 
instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The 
Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in 
hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining hedged item is more than 
12 months and as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised immediately 
in the income statement.
17.1.1 Fair value hedges
Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualifying as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with 
any changes in fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. 
17.1.2 Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in 
other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the income statement in the period in which the hedged item affects profit or loss. 
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain 
or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the 
income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity 
is immediately transferred to the income statement.
17.1.3 Net investment hedge
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument 
relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective 
portion is recognised in the income statement. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement when the 
foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold. Financial statements

17.2.3 Net investment hedges
The Group uses foreign currency denominated debt to hedge the value of its US Dollar denominated net assets which may change due to 
movements in US Dollar exchange rates. At 31 December 2015, the value of the net investment hedge was £94,501,000 (2014: £94,380,000). 
This hedge is considered highly effective and no ineffective portion has been recognised in the income statement. 
18. Financial risk management and financial instruments
18.1 Accounting policy
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions 
of the instrument and are generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold or cancelled or expires.
18.1.1 Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period. These are classified 
as non-current assets. The Group’s loans and receivables comprise “trade and other receivables” (note 13) and “cash and cash equivalents” 
(note 14) in the balance sheet.
18.1.2 Financial liabilities held at amortised cost
Financial liabilities held at amortised cost comprise “trade and other payables” (note 15) and “interest-bearing loans and borrowings” (note 16). Tyman plc

18.3 Financial instruments: risk profile
18.3.1 Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital structure to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern. The capital structure of the Group 
consists of cash and cash equivalents (note 14), interest-bearing loans and borrowings (note 16) and equity attributable to the shareholders 
of the Parent as disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
18.3.2 Financial management
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, private debt and cash and short term deposits. The Group has various other 
financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables that arise directly from its operations. No trading in financial instruments 
is undertaken.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each financial instrument risk and they are summarised below.
18.3.3 Liquidity and credit risk
The Group maintains sufficient cash and marketable securities and the availability of funding through an adequate amount of credit facilities. 
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity on the basis of expected cash flow. 
The Group manages liquidity risk by the pooling of cash resources and depositing funds available for investment in approved financial 
instruments with financial institutions. Counterparty risk with respect to cash and cash equivalents is managed by only investing in banks 
and financial instruments with independently assessed credit ratings of at least A2 as published by Standard and Poor’s. Individual risk limits 
are assessed by management based on the external ratings. Management does not expect any losses from the non-performance of 
these counterparties. 
Credit risk is also attributable to the Group’s exposure to trade receivables due from customers. Management assesses the credit quality 
of customers taking into account their financial position, past experience and other factors. In order to mitigate credit risk the Group utilises 
credit insurance in those areas of its operations where such insurance is available. In areas where such insurance is not available or it is uneconomical 
to purchase, management monitors the utilisation of credit limits by customers, identified either individually or by group, and incorporates this 
information in credit risk controls. The diverse nature of the Group’s customer base means that the Group has no significant concentrations of 
credit risk.
Trade receivables are presented in the balance sheet net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based 
on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment. 
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the balance sheet date. Management 
considers all financial assets that are not impaired for each of the reporting dates under review are of good credit quality, including those that 
are past due.

18.3.5 Foreign currency risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to 
the US Dollar and the Euro. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial and financing transactions, recognised assets and liabilities 
denominated in a currency that is not the Group’s functional currency and net investments in overseas entities.
The Group has a number of overseas subsidiaries, whose net assets are subject to currency translation risk. The Group borrows in local 
currencies as appropriate to minimise the impact of this risk on the balance sheet.

18.3.6 Capital management
The Group’s capital management objectives are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern so as to provide returns 
to shareholders and benefits to stakeholders. The Group defines its capital as total equity plus net debt. 
In maintaining the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount paid as dividends to shareholders, issue new shares or dispose of assets 
to reduce debt.
The Group monitors its financial capacity by reference to financial covenant ratios, including leverage and interest cover. If the Group fails to 
meet its key financial ratios required by its lenders, this could impact the Group’s average interest rate of borrowings and the future availability 
of credit to the Group.
The Group is in compliance with the financial covenants contained within its credit facilities, and has been in compliance throughout the 
financial year.

18.4 Fair value estimation
The Group’s derivative financial instrument used for hedging is measured at fair value. The Group uses the following hierarchy for measuring 
fair value:
• 
Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
• 
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
• 
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
Derivatives shown at fair value in the balance sheet have been valued by reference to level 2 techniques described above.
There were no transfers between levels during the year.
18.4.1 Valuation techniques used to derive level 2 fair values
Level 2 hedging derivatives comprise interest rate swaps fair valued using forward interest rates extracted from observable yield curves. The 
effects of discounting are generally insignificant for level 2 derivatives. The fair value of the derivative financial instruments at 31 December 2015 
is a net liability of £93,000 (2014: net asset of £105,000).
There were no changes in valuation techniques during the year.
18.4.2 Group’s valuation process
The Group has a team that performs the valuations of financial assets required for financial reporting purposes. This team reports to the CFO 
and the Audit Committee.
18.4.3 Fair value of financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost
The fair values of borrowings are as follows:
2015 2014

The fair values of the following financial assets and liabilities approximate their carrying amounts:

• 
cash and cash equivalents; and
•

19. Provisions
19.1 Accounting policy
Provisions are recognised when:
• 
the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event;
• 
it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and
• 
a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance 
sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows 
estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows using a pre-tax rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. 
The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised in the income statement within net finance costs. Provisions are not 
recognised for future operating losses.
19.1.1 Critical accounting estimates and judgements: carrying amount of provisions
Provisions, by their nature, are uncertain and highly judgemental. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure 
required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date based on the nature of the provisions, the potential outcomes, any developments 
relating to specific claims and previous experience.

(2014: £1,406,000). Property provisions are expected to be utilised by 2018.
For onerous leases, the Group has provided for the rental payments due over the remaining term of existing operating lease contracts where 
a period of vacancy is ongoing. The provision has been calculated after taking into account both the periods over which properties are likely 
to remain vacant and any likely sub-lease income on a property-by-property basis. The provision covers potential transfer of economic 
benefit over the full range of current lease commitments disclosed in note 28.
The provision for leasehold dilapidations relates to contractual obligations to reinstate leasehold properties to their original state of repair. 
The transfer of economic benefits will occur at the end of the leases set out in note 28. Financial statements

20. Retirement benefit obligations
20.1 Accounting policy
The Group operates both defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans and post-employment medical plans.
20.1.1 Pension obligations
Defined contribution plans
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into publicly or privately administered pension 
insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group recognises contributions as an employee benefit expense when 
they are due and has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The Group has no legal or constructive obligation 
to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the 
current or prior periods. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund in the future is available.
Defined benefit plans
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that is not a defined contribution plan. Typically defined benefit plans define an amount of 
pension benefit an employee will receive on retirement. This amount is usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years 
of service and compensation.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation 
at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent 
actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates 
of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity 
approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation. In countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, the market rates 
on government bonds are used.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity 
in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in income.
20.1.2 Other post-employment obligations
Some Group companies provide post-retirement healthcare benefits to their retirees. The entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional 
on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these 
benefits are accrued over the period of employment using the same accounting methodology as used for defined benefit pension plans.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in 
other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. These obligations are valued annually by independent qualified actuaries.
20.1.3 Key source of estimation uncertainty: defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit schemes
The defined benefit obligations are calculated using a number of assumptions including future salary increases, increases to pension 
benefits, mortality rates and, in the case of post-employment medical benefits, the expected rate of increase in medical costs. The plan 
assets consist largely of listed securities and their fair values are subject to fluctuation in response to changes in market conditions. Effects 
of changes in the actuarial assumptions underlying the benefit obligation, effects of changes in the discount rate applicable to the benefit 
obligation and effects of differences between the expected and actual return on the plan assets are classified as actuarial gains and losses 
and are recognised directly in equity. Further actuarial gains and losses will be recognised during the next financial year. An analysis of the 
assumptions that will be used by management to determine the cost of defined benefit plans that will be recognised in the income 
statement in the next financial year is presented in this note. Tyman plc

20.2 Defined contribution pension schemes
The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes, the assets of which are held externally to the Group in separate 
trustee-administered funds. The costs of the Group’s defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the income statement in the period 
in which they fall due. The Group had no unpaid pension contributions included within employee benefit liabilities (2014: £Nil).

1 The income statement charge included within profit before taxation includes current service cost, interest cost and past service costs. 
The Group’s principal defined benefit pension scheme and post-employment medical benefit scheme are operated in the US. The defined 
benefit schemes provide benefits to members in the form of guaranteed level of pension payable for life. The level of benefits provided 
depends on members’ length of service and their salary in the final years leading up to retirement. 
For US plans, pensions in payment do not receive inflationary increases. The benefit payments are from trustee-administered funds. 
Plan assets held in trusts are governed by local regulations and practice in the US, as is the nature of the relationship between the Group 
and the trustees and their composition. 
Responsibility for governance of the plans, including investment and contribution schedules, lies jointly with the Group and the board 
of trustees. The board of trustees must be composed of representatives of the Company and plan participants in accordance with the 
plan’s regulations.
The current service cost, past service costs and expenses relating to the administration of the defined benefit schemes are included in 
the income statement within administrative expenses. Net expense is included within net finance income and costs. 
Actuarial gains and losses from participant experience, changes in demographic assumptions, changes in financial assumptions and net 
return on plan assets are recognised, net of the related deferred tax, in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

20.3.1 Balance sheet disclosures continued
Through its defined benefit pension plans and post-employment medical plans, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant 
of which are detailed below: 
Asset volatility The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; if plan 
assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit. The US plans hold a significant proportion of fixed 
income investments, comprising a mixture of government and corporate bonds, and provide an acceptable 
level of investment risk to better match liabilities. The Group believes that given the long term nature of plan 
liabilities, and the strength of the supporting Group, a level of continuing equity investment is an appropriate 
element of the Group’s long term strategy to manage the plans efficiently. Equities are expected to outperform 
corporate bonds in the long term while providing volatility and risk in the short term. As the plans mature, 
the Group intends to reduce the level of investment risk by investing more in assets that better match 
the liabilities.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by 
an increase in the value of the plans’ bond holdings.
Inflation risk Some of the Group’s pension obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher 
liabilities (although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect the plan 
against extreme inflation). The majority of the plans’ assets are either unaffected by fixed interest bonds or 
loosely correlated with equities inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit. 
In the US plans, the pensions in payment are not linked to inflation, so this is a less material risk.
Life expectancies The majority of the plans’ obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life 
expectancy will result in an increase in the plans’ liabilities.
The significant actuarial assumptions were as follows: 
2015 2014
Discount rate 4.2% 3.8%

Assumptions regarding future mortality are set based on actuarial advice in accordance with published statistics and experience in each 
jurisdiction. These assumptions translate into an average life expectancy in years for a pensioner retiring at age 65:
2015 2014
Retiring at the end of the reporting year:
Male 21.4 21.3
Female 23.0 22.9
Retiring in 20 years after the end of the reporting year:
Male 22.6 22.6
Female 24.1 24.1
The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the weighted principal assumption is: 
Impact on defined benefit 
pension obligation
Increase in Decrease in
assumption assumption
by 0.25% by 0.25%
Discount rate
Decrease by 
2.96%
Increase by 
3.11%
The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this 
is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit 
obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same methodology has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised 
within the statement of financial position.
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analyses did not change compared to the previous year.
The pension scheme is closed to new entrants; as a result the service costs to the Group will rise in future years. The expected level of 
contributions to the defined benefit pension scheme and post-employment medical benefits in the year to December 2016 is £865,000.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 12 years. Financial statements

21. Business combinations
21.1 Accounting policy
The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a 
subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interest 
issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration 
arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured 
initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of 
the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability are recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in profit or loss or 
as a change to other comprehensive income. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured, and its subsequent 
settlement is accounted for within equity.
The excess of the consideration transferred and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value 
of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill (note 10.2). If the total of consideration transferred is less than the fair value of 
the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
21.1.1 Critical accounting estimates and judgements: acquisition accounting
IFRS 3 requires assets and liabilities acquired to be recorded at fair value and to separately identify intangible assets from goodwill, initially 
measuring each group of intangible assets at fair value. Groups of intangible assets include purchased brands and customer relationships. 
There is judgement involved in estimating fair value, particularly in relation to identifiable intangible assets, which requires the Directors 
to estimate the useful economic life of each asset and the future cash flows expected to arise from each asset and to apply a suitable 
discount rate.

21.2 Acquisition of Vedasil Brasil
On 26 February 2014, the Group acquired 100 per cent of the issued share capital of Vedasil Brasil. At 31 December 2014, the fair values in 
relation to this acquisition were provisional. The Group has completed its review and there were no further adjustments or amendments made 
to the fair value in 2015.

23. Share capital and share premium
23.1 Accounting policy
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are shown 
in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly 
attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes) is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s owners until the shares are 
cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental 
transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company’s owners.

The total authorised number of ordinary shares is 180,000,000 (2014: 180,000,000) with a par value of 5.00 pence per share 
(2014: 5.00 pence per share). All issued shares are fully paid up. 
24. Share-based payments
24.1 Accounting policy
The Group operates the LTIP which is an equity-settled share-based compensation plan for certain employees under which the entity 
receives services from employees as consideration for equity instruments (share options) of the Group. The fair value of the employee 
services received in exchange for the grant of options is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s 
estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the 
impact of any non-market vesting conditions. Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that 
are expected to vest. At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest, with 
any changes in estimate recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment in equity. The fair value of awards granted 
under LTIP is measured using a probability model to predict target EPS levels.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium 
when the options are exercised. Financial statements

In 2015, the Group operated the LTIP. The charge to the income statement in 2015 was £968,000 (2014: £903,000). 
LTIP
Conditional, annual awards of shares are granted under the LTIP to certain Executive Directors and senior managers at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee. Provided the participant remains an employee of the Group and the performance conditions are met, awards will 
vest three years after the date of the grant at no cost to the employee. Further information on the LTIP and the performance conditions is 
given in the Remuneration report.
The fair value of the awards granted under the LTIP and the assumptions used in the calculation of the share-based payment charge are as follows:

Date of grant 22 June 2015
Number granted 692,562
Share price at date of award 324 pence

Report on the Company financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion, Tyman plc’s Company financial statements (the 
“financial statements”):
• 
give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as 
at 31 December 2015;
• 
have been properly prepared in accordance with UK Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice; and
• 
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the

What we have audited
The financial statements, included within the Annual Report and 
Accounts (the “Annual Report”), comprise:
• 
the Company balance sheet as at 31 December 2015; 
• 
the Company statement of changes in equity for the year then 
ended; and
• 
the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of 
significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the 
Annual Report, rather than in the notes to the financial statements. 
These are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are 
identified as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the financial statements is UK Accounting Standards, 
comprising FRS 101: “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and applicable 
law (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Other required reporting
Consistency of other information
Companies Act 2006 opinion
In our opinion, the information given in the Strategic Report and 
the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
ISAs (UK & Ireland) reporting
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs 
(UK & Ireland)”) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, 
information in the Annual Report is:
• 
materially inconsistent with the information in the audited 
financial statements; or
• 
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, our knowledge of the company acquired in the course of 
performing our audit; or
• 
otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Adequacy of accounting records and information and 
explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
• 
we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit; or
• 
adequate accounting records have not been kept by the company, 
or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
• 
the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

Directors’ remuneration report – Companies Act 2006 opinion
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.
Other Companies Act 2006 reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion, certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified 
by law are not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from 
this responsibility. 
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement 
set out on page 51, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only 
for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 
of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We 
do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for 
any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown 
or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our 
prior consent in writing.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit continued
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & Ireland). An 
audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, 
whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
• 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the 
Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; 
• 
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made 
by the Directors; and 
• 
the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ 
judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, 
and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing 
techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable 
basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through 
testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a 
combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information 
in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements and to identify any information that is 
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the 
audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

For the year ended 31 December 2015 Financial statements
Tyman plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 124
1. Accounting policies
1.1 Basis of preparation
The financial statements of Tyman plc have been prepared in accordance with FRS 101. The financial statements have been prepared 
on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with FRS 101 requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires 
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies. Areas involving a higher degree of 
judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in note 2.3 
of the Group financial statements.
1.1.1 First time adoption of FRS 101
The financial statements of Tyman plc for the year ended 31 December 2014 were prepared in accordance with previous UK GAAP. These 
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 101 for the first time. When preparing the financial statements for the year 
ended 31 December 2015, management has amended certain accounting and valuation methods applied in the previous UK GAAP financial 
statements to comply with FRS 101. The comparative figures were restated to reflect these adjustments in line with the provisions of IFRS 1 as 
applicable to companies applying FRS 101. There was no effect on the transition from previous UK GAAP to FRS 101 on the Company’s equity 
and profit and therefore no reconciliation is provided. None of the mandatory exemptions or operational exemptions from full retrospective 
application of IFRS were applicable to the Company.
1.1.2 FRS 101 – reduced disclosure exemptions
The following exemptions from the requirements of IFRSs have been applied in the preparation of these financial statements in accordance 
with FRS 101:
•

• 
IFRS 7 Financial instruments: disclosures;
•

The financial statements are presented in British Pounds, which is also the functional currency. 
1.2.2 Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.

monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss.
Notes to the Company financial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2015 Tyman plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 125
Corporate governance Financial statements Strategic report
1. Accounting policies continued
1.3 Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument and are 
generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires. 
1.3.1 Financial assets: loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an active market. 
They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period. These are classified 
as non-current assets. The Company’s loans and receivables comprise “debtors” (note 5) and “cash and cash equivalents” in the balance sheet. 
1.3.2 Financial liabilities held at amortised cost
Financial liabilities held at amortised cost comprise “creditors” (note 6).
1.4 Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
1.5 Borrowings
Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Interest-bearing loans are 
subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. All borrowing costs are expensed as incurred, on an accruals 
basis, to the income statement using the effective interest rate method.
1.6 Share-based payments
The Company operates an equity-settled share-based compensation plan (Long Term Incentive Plan, “LTIP”) for certain employees under 
which the entity receives services from employees as consideration for equity instruments (share options) of the Company. The fair value of 
the employee services received in exchange for the grant of options is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the 
Company’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. 
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding 
the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options 
that are expected to vest. At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest, with 
any changes in estimate recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment in equity. The fair value of awards granted under 
LTIP is measured using a probability model to predict EPS levels.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium when 
the options are exercised.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as a 
capital contribution. The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised over the 
vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity in the parent entity accounts.
The social security contributions payable in connection with the grant of the share options are considered an integral part of the grant itself, 
and the charge will be treated as a cash-settled transaction.
Details of share-based payments are provided in note 24 of the Group financial statements.
2. Profit attributable to the shareholders of the Company
The Company is an investment holding company. It receives dividend income from subsidiaries and bank interest. It pays loan interest to a 
subsidiary. The majority of administrative expenses are paid by the Company’s subsidiary, Tyman Management Limited, including the whole 
amount of relevant auditors’ remuneration and operating lease costs.
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account for the year. 
The Company reported a profit for the financial year ended 31 December 2015 of £558,000 (2014: £523,000). 
3. Employees

Chairman’s letter 
 
Dear Shareholder, 
 
When I wrote to shareholders this time last year with the publication of our 2012 Annual Report, I set out a 
number of achievements which had made 2012 a momentous year of change and achievement for NMC 
Health plc.  
 
I am pleased to report that again this year many key milestones have been achieved. Specifically the year 
has seen strong growth with your company following the strategy set out at the time of its IPO in April 2012. 
Moreover, shareholder value has increased significantly during the year. Group Revenue increased from 
US$490.1m in 2012 to US$550.9m in 2013. EBITDA at Group level also improved from US$79.6m to 
US$92.9m in the latest financial year. 
 
Financial stability 
 
In June 2013, the Company announced that it had successfully completed the replacement of its existing 
Syndicated Bank Loan with the help of J P Morgan. Although no additional funds were raised, the proceeds 
of the replacement Syndicated Bank Loan have enabled the Company to restructure its existing loans, 
streamline its financing by reducing the number of loans, reduce its cost of funds and create additional 
headroom to ensure that the Group is more conservatively financed. The reduction in cost of funds is 
estimated to generate average savings of US$2m per annum over the next four financial years, which will 
have a significant positive effect on the Company’s net profit and EPS.  
 
Capital projects 
 
The year has not been without its challenges in relation to the Group’s capital projects. The Group’s 
progress on certain projects within its capital development programme has been slower than expected with 
both the Brightpoint Women’s Hospital and our new DIP General Hospital having encountered construction 
delays. These facilities are expected to open in H1, 2014. However, our first new facility since IPO, the 
NMC Day Surgery Centre in Mohammed Bin Zayed City, opened, in part, in July 2013 and is performing as 
expected. Our most ambitious capital project, the 250 bed hospital being built in the expanding Abu Dhabi 
suburb of Khalifa City, is on track to open in H1, 2015. Finally we also announced in 2013 the launch of a 
medical centre in Al Ain. This project is progressing well.  
 
Operating divisions 
 
In the Healthcare division, occupancy rates and outpatient numbers across all of our Specialty Hospitals 
continue to improve and the Group continues to increase the range of specialty procedures that its clinical 
teams undertake. During the year, our Healthcare division also signed a Memorandum of Understanding 
with Oxford Fertility Unit. This joint venture arrangement to provide specialist IVF services at our new 
Brightpoint Women’s Hospital will be a welcome addition to our range of specialist services. 
 
The private healthcare market in the UAE has been growing steadily in recent years, and the Board expect 
this to continue. The announcement in November 2013 of the introduction of mandatory insurance for 
residents of Dubai will help to underpin the growth potential in the UAE private healthcare market. As our 
Healthcare division has existing operations across both Abu Dhabi and Dubai, your company is well placed 
to benefit from the roll-out of mandatory health insurance in Dubai and, in the future, across the remainder 
of the UAE.     
 
In the Distribution division, performance has continued to improve with an increasing number of product 
lines distributed on behalf of our very supportive suppliers. General macro-economic conditions continue to 
indicate good growth levels for the division.  
 
Corporate Governance 
 
During the year, your Board has continued to assist management in the wider aspects of Corporate 
Governance where there have been a number of changes in UK regulations and “Best Practice” standards 
affecting UK Listed Companies. In addition, the previous Board committee framework has changed with the 
establishment of a Clinical Governance Committee under the guidance of its chair, Heather Lawrence. The 
Committee will monitor the key areas of clinical risk, quality and safety and will work alongside the audit 
committee to ensure key clinical risks facing the Group are monitored and, where necessary, mitigated.  5 
 
Work has progressed on the establishment of integrated IT systems; a new Hospital Information System 
will start to be rolled out in 2014 and the Group’s new Enterprise Resources Planning (“ERP”) financial 
system will be operational in H1, 2014 and will help simplify administration processes. These key 
improvements in the Group’s internal controls are important aspects of NMC’s risk mitigation strategy.    
 
Board changes 
 
During the year there were a number of changes affecting the Board. Jonathan Bomford was appointed to 
the Board in June 2013. Jonathan, a Chartered Accountant, is our new independent Non-Executive 
Director and Chairman of the Audit Committee, and brings sound financial experience to both the audit 
committee and the board, as well as experience of working in the Gulf Region. Justin Jewitt ceased to be a 
Director in June 2013 and the Board would like to thank him for his contribution during his time as a 
Director of the Company and Chairman of the Audit Committee. 
 
In addition, Mr Keyur Nagori was appointed as an Alternate Director to His Excellency Saeed Bin Butti in 
June 2013. 
 
On 24 February 2014, H.E. Saeed Bin Butti resigned as a Director of the company. On the same date, H.E. 
Saeed nominated Mr. Abdul Rahman Basaddiq to be appointed as a Director of the company and his 
appointment was approved by the Board. The Board would like to thank His Excellency for his significant 
contribution to the company and welcome Mr. Basaddiq to the Board. 
 
Dividend 
 
Given the good performance of the Company, and the continued financial stability of the Group, your Board 
plans to submit a Resolution to shareholders at the 2014 annual general meeting authorising payment of a 
cash Dividend of 4.4 pence per share. This is approximately 20% of Profit After Tax, a level unchanged 
from the amount which shareholders approved in relation to the 2012 financial year.
 
 
Executive remuneration 
 
The Remuneration Committee, under the chairmanship of Lord Clanwilliam, has been reviewing the 
structure of Executive remuneration. A new Short Term Incentive Plan has been implemented for the 2013 
financial year and a Long Term Incentive Plan is proposed for 2014. Both of these plans, which are 
described more fully in the Directors’ Remuneration Report, are designed to focus and incentivise 
management on the long term value of your company and align them with any value change experienced 
by shareholders in the Company over the longer term.   
 
Management and staff 
 
Economic conditions in the UAE are favourable, but Dr Shetty, his management team and staff across the 
Group have had to continue to work hard through a continuing period of significant change to achieve 
strong results on your behalf. The Board greatly appreciates the continued commitment, energy and 
goodwill which they have shown in the last 12 months and would like to thank them all for their respective 
contributions.  
 
Outlook 
 
Your Board continues to view the outlook for the Group with confidence and enthusiasm and looks forward 
to a period of continued well financed growth.

Group Strategic Report 
 
CEO review   
 
Since the very beginning of this business as a small pharmacy and two doctor clinic nearly forty years 
ago in Abu Dhabi, NMC has been a story of commit, evolve and grow. This commitment is towards 
our patients and their wellbeing, our quality and affordability, our staff and their performance and our 
country and its people. Yet without the vision and drive of the founders and leaders of the UAE, our 
successful journey would not have been possible.  
 
In the second year following NMC Health’s listing on the Premium Segment of the London Stock 
Exchange Main Market, as the first UAE company to successfully pursue this avenue, I am truly proud 
to report on our continued success – as a company, management and team encompassing all NMC 
staff on the ground here in the UAE.  
 
This success is demonstrated through our double digit top-line growth and EBITDA margin 
appreciation in FY 2013. We delivered a 12.4% top-line growth year on year, nearly 200bps higher 
than 2012, as revenues reached US$550.9m. We successfully opened the NMC Day Surgery Centre 
in Mohammed Bin Zayed City in July 2013, while the major additions to our healthcare portfolio will be 
introduced in 2014 and 2015.  
 
EBITDA reached US$ 92.9m in FY 2013 – equating to a 16.7% year on year growth, a rate expansion 
of 372bps compared to 2012. Group EBITDA margins increased by 62bps compared to 2012 and 
closed the year at 16.9%.  
 
The devotion and hard work of management and employees at NMC achieved a new milestone in 
2013, as NMC Healthcare crossed the 2m annual patient mark for the first time. We increased our 
operational bed capacity by 13.5% year on year to 261, nevertheless, Group hospital occupancy 
increased by 420bps to 64.7%.  We continued to strengthen our human resources and added 83 new 
doctors during the year. 
 
Similar efforts in the Distribution division yielded an increase in Stock Keeping Units (SKU’s) of 8.7% 
in 2013, with the total number of products offered by NMC reaching 71,215. In this division we 
enhanced our sales, promotion and marketing capabilities by adding 132 new people in those specific 
areas.  
 
We have continued to face some challenges in relation to the progression of our capital projects 
programme, but we are taking steps to mitigate similar problems arising in the future. We are also in 
the process of implementing two new major IT systems which will establish a suitable IT infrastructure 
for the Group in the future.  
 
We expect the strong performance of the UAE economy to continue in 2014, with a positive effect on 
both our divisions. We are particularly excited about the Emirate of Dubai’s decision in late 2013 to 
begin rolling-out mandatory healthcare insurance for all its residents this year. According to the Dubai 
Health Authority (DHA), around 66% of the Emirate’s residents are without healthcare insurance. 
NMC Health already has two hospitals and a day surgery in Dubai. In addition we plan to open a 60 
bed general hospital in Dubai Investment Park (DIP) in H1, 2014. In the Abu Dhabi market we plan to 
open Brightpoint Women’s Hospital, the first private sector women’s hospital, with a 100 bed capacity.  
 
Finally, I would like to thank our shareholders and my fellow members of the Board of Directors for 
their continued support throughout the past year.

Our Business Model 
 
 
Established in 1975, NMC Health plc is now the leading private sector healthcare operator in the 
United Arab Emirates, with a nationwide network of hospitals and operations in the country. The 
group also operates a UAE wide distribution and wholesale business.  
 
 
 
Healthcare services 
 
Through our healthcare services division we provide people in the UAE with a range of high quality 
outpatient and inpatient services across our facilities. Our facilities range from the larger specialty 
hospitals to medical centres. In addition, we have retail pharmacies mainly selling pharmaceuticals 
prescribed by our doctors to our patients either within, or in the immediate vicinity of, our healthcare 
services facilities. Our comprehensive care approach maximises patient convenience and increases 
revenue contribution to our business.   
 
While we serve both insured and self-paying patients, the overwhelming majority of our healthcare 
division’s revenue is generated through insured patients. In return for the services rendered to insured 
patients, we submit claims to insurance companies to collect the remainder of our fees (usually 
insured patients have some co-pay element, which is paid directly when services are delivered to 
them at our facilities).  
 
Pricing of our healthcare services is typically negotiated on an annual basis with the insurance 
companies we work with and may differ between the various insurance plans offered in the market. In 
contrast, prices of the majority of pharmaceutical products sold in our pharmacies are regulated and 
set by the UAE Ministry of Health. 
 
NMC Hospitals are currently covered by the majority of the approximately 40 insurance companies 
operating in the UAE, including the largest market participants. These companies have either a direct 
relationship with us or through the 13 Third Party Administrators (TPAs) who currently provide private 
medical insurance into the Abu Dhabi market. 
 
Our Healthcare division also provides operational and management services to third party owned 
healthcare services assets. In return for our services, we receive a contracted management fee by the 
asset owner. Typically the fee received is partially tied to a set of pre-agreed performance metrics 
incorporating either qualitative and/or quantitative operational targets. We currently have one 
management contract with the UAE Ministry of Presidential Affairs pertaining to a general hospital in 
Umm al Quwain in the Northern Emirates.  
 
 
 
  12 
 
Product distribution 
 
NMC’s Distribution Division is now one of the largest in the UAE and it offers products across several 
segments including FMCG
5
, Pharmaceuticals, Scientific Equipment and Food.  
 
NMC counts among its clients UAE Government entities, the largest UAE retailers, pharmacies and 
hospital operators. We supply our customers with a portfolio of globally and locally established brands 
and products with end-user demand in the UAE. We ensure our customers receive quality products in 
a timely manner with the required support services. Our distribution capabilities are supported by a 
network of strategically located warehouses and a fleet of distribution vehicles ensuring timely 
delivery to our customers across the country. Products are overwhelmingly sold on credit, with 
payments collected based on agreed terms. Our pricing of these products includes a mark-up over 
the product cost to generate a profit and to cover import costs and duties, registration administration 
and fees, distribution expenses, credit costs and, in certain cases, marketing costs. Pharmaceuticals 
are the only segment where pricing is widely regulated by the UAE Ministry of Health.  
 
Only registered domestic distributors, a locally established company like NMC, are entitled by 
customs authorities to import products into the country. Principals (suppliers) contract NMC as their 
distributor to gain access to the UAE market through a reputable partner with a long track-record, 
established distribution channels and infrastructure and strong financial standing. Every individual 
brand and product has to go through an approval and registration process with local authorities before 
being allowed to be sold in the country. NMC facilitates this process and ensures local requirements 
are met. The majority of agreements with our Principals are on exclusive basis. All agreements are 
registered with the government.   
 
NMC procurement is on a principal basis. In the majority of cases, NMC takes the inventory and 
collection risk of the product that it buys and sells. Acting as a Principal rather than an agent 
enhances NMC’s margins at the expense of increasing the Group’s risk profile. Our agreements are 
almost exclusively operated on a credit basis, with the number credit days agreed with our Principals.

Our Strategy 
 
 
Strategy: Historic opportunity drives focused healthcare expansion 
 
The highly positive macro environment coupled with NMC’s long-track record, experience and 
reputation for quality care drives our determined expansion in the UAE. Through the utilization of our 
2012 IPO proceeds, long-term loans and cash flows from operations, we aim to maximise our growth 
and market position at this historic inflection point in the UAE healthcare sector presented by the 
impact of mandatory insurance adoption.  
 
NMC’s primary strategic objective is to extend the operational reach of its healthcare services through 
the development of a hub and spoke model in the key emirates of the UAE with mandatory medical 
insurance. This will be achieved by organic and inorganic means in what remains a highly fragmented 
private sector, thus bringing our services to thousands of new patients. 
 
 
We also aim to continue expanding our Distribution division through organic means and with limited 
additional capital expenditures, focusing mainly on new product additions to our growing portfolio and 
increased market penetration. 
 
Healthcare Division: Adding 410 beds in Abu Dhabi and Dubai 
 
The initial growth plan post IPO, and the largest in NMC’s history, is almost entirely organic, with 
nearly US$330m deployed into developing three hospitals and an equal number of medical 
centres/day surgeries in the country’s main population centres.  With this expansion plan, we aim to 
take the total number of NMC’s licensed hospital beds from 310
6
 as of 2013 to 720
7
 in 2015, a 132% 
growth. The addition of two medical centres and a day surgery is further strengthening our hub-and-
spoke model.  
 
Note: E = Estimated 
Projects under development

 NMC Health had 261 operational beds as of December 2013 out of 310 licensed bed capacity. Spare capacity 
was mainly in our most recent hospital addition, Al Ain City Specialty Hospital. 
7
 This refers to the total licensed capacity in all our facilities when the three new hospitals are completed and 
open. However, we will not commence operations with the full licensed capacity. NMC will adopt a phased 
introduction of the bed capacity in the new hospitals. The current plan is to start operation with 50 beds (out 
of 100) at Brightpoint Womens Hospital, 30 beds (out of 60) at DIP General Hospital and with 75 beds (out of 
250) in Khalifa City Hospital.  14 
 
We announced five development projects as part of our IPO and a further new facility in Al Ain in H1 
2013.

To date we have completed the acquisition of BR Medical Suites in Dubai Healthcare City (DHCC) 
and the development of the NMC Day Surgery Centre in Mohammed bin Zayed City (MBZC) in Abu 
Dhabi. Apart from delays on Brightpoint womens’ hospital and Dubai Investment Park general 
hospital, all other developments are in progress for opening on a phased basis in 2014 and 2015. Full 
details of the progress of the relevant projects is set out on page 24 of the Business Overview. 
 
Post completion of this organic expansion plan, NMC will have 550 licensed beds in Abu Dhabi 
(including 100 in Al Ain City) and 170 in Dubai. Our 2012 development plan prioritised Abu Dhabi – as 
the only market at the time with mandatory healthcare insurance, a major catalyst for investment 
returns. However, we highlight that NMC’s healthcare division is operationally present in four Emirates 
(Abu Dhabi [includes Al Ain City], Dubai, Sharjah and Umm Al Quwain), which account for around 
85% of the UAE population.

We believe that the new healthcare facilities will extend NMC Health’s lead as the largest private 
sector operator in the UAE with a nationwide hub-and-spoke model centred around the 250 bed 
Khalifa City Hospital and our specialty hospitals in the largest cities. As a result, NMC will be serving 
patients through an extended network of hospitals, day surgeries and medical centres on UAE 
regional level down to local and community levels.

Volumes raising specialisation 
 
Our hospitals and medical facilities received over 2m patient visits in 2013, amongst the highest for 
any private healthcare group in the UAE. Higher volumes allow us to reinforce and elevate quality and 
diversity of services at NMC Health. We are able to support the introduction of more sub-specialties / 
higher complexity procedures through cross-referrals between our network – leading to higher value-
added services and increasing our competitive advantages. Note that most of the private sector 
competition in the UAE are made up of single hospital operations, typically with limited volume flow 
beyond standard services, often rendering increased specialisation difficult, operationally demanding 
and financially unfeasible.  
 
With increased volumes we have been able to expand our service offering, enhance our competitive 
advantages, reduce loss of patient spend (due to unavailability of services) and thus increase revenue 
per patient. 
 
Strategic market segments 
 
We seek to expand our addressable market through new facilities and geographic locations of our 
services and attracting all major insurance categories, rather than confine NMC’s market to smaller 
but higher value per patient segments. We are keen not to price existing or future NMC medical 
facilities out of any major insurance category, albeit select future assets will have a more premium 
positioning, such as our highly specialized Brightpoint Women’s Hospital. We view the Brightpoint 
Women’s Hospital as an extension of our patient and service segment diversification strategy. The  17 
 
hospital is expected to benefit from substantial referrals through our growing Abu Dhabi network and, 
as part of our increased specialisation. We have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to create a 
joint-venture with the highly reputable British firm Oxford Fertility Unit to provide IVF services at the 
new hospital. 
 
Hiring for growth  
 
Recruitment and retention of clinical practitioners is undoubtedly one of the major challenges with 
such a sizeable expansion program, especially in a country with a shortage of medical staff and 
overwhelmingly reliant on an expatriate work force and in a global market where the availability of 
qualified clinicians is limited.  We mitigate this risk through our HR capabilities and long-term 
experience in international hiring. We also have long-term partnerships with recruitment firms in 
several markets, including the Philippines, for nursing staff. UAE healthcare authorities have also 
established supervised exam and testing centres for the required licensing in key markets, such as 
India and the Philippines, for nurses.  
 
For physicians the process is more demanding, with licensing and associated exams performed only 
in the UAE. It typically takes around six months to gain the right to practice medicine in the UAE. 
Some countries and medical boards are exempt from this process. We constantly evaluate and 
shortlist potential physician candidates to fill new openings and reduce recruitment lead time. Our 
priority is to add new capacity to the market by hiring externally, rather than deplete the limited 
domestic pool of predominantly expatriate staff and encourage extraordinary wage inflation. UAE has 
an estimated 1.1 doctors per 1,000 inhabitants, compared to a global average close to 3. .  
 
Our external hiring also emphasizes our NMC brand centric approach to our service, as opposed to 
the doctor-brand centric alternative. We focus on attracting patients to the quality of service 
synonymous with NMC as an institution. The vast majority of our clinical staff are compensated 
through a fixed salary model with elements of incentivisation and not revenue sharing – we strongly 
believe that puts quality of service first. 
 
Our recruitment capabilities are best demonstrated through the recent Operation & Management 
contract awarded to us by the Ministry of Presidential Affairs to manage and operate the 205-bed 
Sheikh Khalifa General Hospital in Umm Al Quwain, UAE. We were awarded the contract in early Q4 
2012, started outpatient services at the beginning of December of the same year. By December 2013 
we had nearly 517 staff operating the hospital.  
 
 
Healthcare Management Services  
 
The operation and management of third party hospitals is a new but attractive business for us. It is a 
very asset light model which we are keen to expand to complement our core operations. We are 
extremely proud of having been selected to perform this role by the UAE Ministry of Presidential 
Affairs for the 205 bed Hospital in Umm Al Quwain.  
 
We view our selection as a testimony and recognition of our capabilities and the quality of our 
services. To date we have made very good progress at the Umm Al Quwain hospital and client 
feedback has been excellent.  
 
In-hospital pharmacies: Win-Win strategy 
 
With our pharmacies we complement our comprehensive care approach and, as a result, we capture 
the maximum proportion of revenue streams associated with patient visit to our hospitals. As a result, 
our pharmacies are located either within or in the immediate vicinity of our hospitals. Convenience 
and proximity, coupled with the fact that pharmaceutical prices are fixed by the Ministry of Health, 
means most patients visiting our hospitals would opt to purchase any pharmaceuticals required from 
our retail outlets.  
 
The company has no plans to pursue the retail pharmacy business outside this context. We currently 
operate eight pharmacies and expect to open one in each of our new facilities.   18 
 
Distribution – A rewarding legacy business 
 
In addition to our healthcare services business, NMC Health is one of the top distributors and 
wholesalers in the country for leading international brands and products in the areas of 
Pharmaceuticals, FMCG, Food and Scientific equipment amongst others.  
 
While we envisage minimal investments in this part of our business, we expect growth to continue to 
be driven by: 
 
 Positive macro environment;  
 Roll-out of mandatory medical insurance in Dubai with positive impact on pharmaceuticals 
and medical products;  
 Sizeable expansion of retail space and tourism in the country affecting our non-
pharmaceutical business; 
 Entry of generics into the Pharmaceutical sector; and  
 Our introduction of new products.    
NMC’s track-record, strong management, seamless integration of the distribution business, 
established supplier and customer networks, logistics infrastructure and the fact that it is a listed 
company with high-levels of disclosure allowing unparalleled insight for prospective partners to our 
strong financial standing – are all key factors in our capability to attract established global brands to 
the UAE via the exclusive distributor model prevalent in the country. Another competitive advantage 
of our distribution division is its access to over 500 doctors at NMC and its retail pharmacies providing 
a direct market for the supply of pharmaceutical and medical equipment products.   19 
 
Business Overview

The UAE’s strong GDP growth, coupled with the increased population due to the continued influx of 
expatriates to the growing economy, had a positive effect on the performance of the healthcare 
division.  
 
In addition we have sought to increase referrals from community clinics towards our specialty 
hospitals. Our marketing team launched several initiatives to engage with the residential 
community/corporates, including holding health awareness sessions and lectures. We have also 
worked to increase our engagement with the medical community to showcase our capabilities.  
 
Keeping in mind that a large proportion of outpatients in the UAE visit stand-alone private sector 
clinics lacking inpatient capacity, we have sought to encourage these third-party operators to refer 
patients to our hospitals. Meanwhile, we have continued to invest in new equipment and technologies 
to complement our service offering and medical staff efforts.  
 
In July 2013 we also supplemented our healthcare assets with the opening of the NMC Day Surgery 
Centre in Mohammed Bin Zayed City, one of the fastest growing suburbs of Abu Dhabi City. This 
facility began receiving its first patients in July 2013 and will act as a referral centre to our growing 
Abu Dhabi network, thus extending the operational reach and addressable market of Abu Dhabi 
Specialty Hospital initially, and eventually also Brightpoint Women’s Hospital and Khalifa City 
Hospital.  
  
Operational gearing, our continued drive to enhance our service offering with new higher value added 
sub-specialties, supported by our growing volumes, and the entry into third party hospital operation  20 
 
and management, are additional contributing factors to the strong performance of the Healthcare 
division in 2013. 
 
Healthcare Division revenue and patients 
 
 
 
 
The Healthcare division reported US$289.3m of revenues in 2013 (+15.0% year on year). Division 
EBITDA amounted to US$81.7m (+19.8% year on year), with an EBITDA margin of 28.2% (+113bps 
year on year). Average revenue per patient reached US$112 (+6% year on year), supported by a 
combination of price increases and improved service mix effect, as we continue to enhance our 
offering of higher value added sub-specialties.  
 
Healthcare division revenue per patient and EBITDA 
 
 
 
Note: Revenue per patient is based on contribution from our healthcare services, excluding the contribution from the operation 
& management contract on the Sheikh Khalifa Hospital in UAQ. It also excludes the contribution from five out of our eight 
pharmacies, specifically those located around the hospitals rather than within them. 
 
Excluding the government hospital managed by NMC, the division had a total of 261 operational beds 
(+13.5%, year on year) out of an unchanged 310 licensed beds, as we continued to phase-in beds 
mainly in our Dubai Specialty and Al Ain Specialty Hospitals.  
 
We have a 15.8% spare system capacity, measured in beds, which we expect to gradually phase into 
our operations in 2014 and 2015. Out of 49 beds yet to become operational, 40 are in our most recent 
hospital, Al Ain Specialty Hospital, and nine are in Dubai Specialty Hospital. We expect the continued 
growth in Al Ain, as demonstrated by the hospital’s performance to date, to absorb the remainder of 
our spare bed capacity in the next couple of years. Mandatory healthcare insurance adoption in Dubai 
this year, coupled with growing network referrals from our existing and new healthcare facilities in 
Dubai, should allow Dubai Specialty Hospital to increase its operational beds.     
 
 
 
  21 
 
Healthcare division operational beds and occupancy rates 
 
 
 
 
 
As our revenue continued to grow at rapid pace, we enhanced our service ability and revenue 
generating capacity through the increase in total Healthcare Division staff by 18.3% in FY 2013 to 
3,400. We increased the number of doctors to 503 by year end 2013 (+19.8% year on year).  
 
Healthcare division staff 
 
  
 
 
Division-wide bed occupancy reached 64.7% (+420bps year on year), despite the rise in operational 
beds during the year by 13.5%. The main reasons behind the improvement in occupancy rates at our 
hospitals include: 
 patient count increase to almost 2.1m (+9.5% year on year);  
 expansion in the proportion of our total patients who are Inpatients to 3.1% (+8bps, year on 
year); and  
 higher average length of stay (ALOS).  
 
A like for like comparison based on last year’s deployed operational bed capacity and FY2013 
utilisation, would have yielded an occupancy rate well above the 70% level compared to the 60.5% in 
FY2012.  
 
We continue to regard full bed occupancy for medical facilities in the UAE to be around 75%, as 
opposed to 90-95% often experienced in other countries. The population leveraged reality in the UAE, 
with around 85% of residents being expatriates, does create higher resident seasonal volatility. This is 
typically manifested through extended departures/holidays to home country for working expatriates 
(up to one month) and even longer for non-working family members particularly during the summer 
season. In addition, we highlight that our occupancy figures exclude day surgery patients, as the 
occupancy calculation we adopt only includes patients staying overnight. Consequently, we are 
rapidly approaching full occupancy, even before the effects from further roll-out of universal medical 
insurance beyond the emirate of Abu Dhabi, hence our investment in new capacity.  
 
  22 
 
Abu Dhabi Specialty Hospital 
 
Abu Dhabi Specialty Hospital, the Group’s first ever hospital, has evolved from being a very small 
building in the 1970’s to a tower on the same land plot with adjacent buildings. It is located in the 
densely populated centre of Abu Dhabi City. This remains the largest patient recipient within the NMC 
network. The facility continues to provide a wide range of specialties and had its Joint Commission 
International (JCI) accreditation renewed in 2013. With nearly 40 years of service in the very same 
area of the city, this hospital has built a noteworthy reputation for quality amongst the Abu Dhabi 
population.  
 
Reported revenues increased by 12% to US$101m in 2013 compared to the preceding year. The total 
number of patients reached 937k (+5%, year on year) with an average revenue per patient amounting 
to US$108 (+7%, year on year). Occupancy increased by 1,060bps year on year to reach 79% - the 
highest amongst all NMC healthcare assets. 
 
Al Ain Specialty Hospital 
 
NMC Health inaugurated the Al Ain Specialty Hospital in the second largest city within the emirate of 
Abu Dhabi in 2009. This expansion was encouraged by the adoption of mandatory healthcare 
insurance in Abu Dhabi in the immediately preceding years. Al Ain Specialty Hospital had the JCI 
accreditation of its quality and service levels renewed for a further three year period in 2012. 
 
Being our most recent hospital addition, we have been gradually introducing this facility’s capacity – 
starting with 12 operational beds, moving up to 45 in 2012 and with 60 beds as of year-end 2013. As 
part of our organic expansion and capital projects programme, we are also in the process of 
developing a medical centre in Al Ain’s Sanaiya area, which holds a high concentration of industrial 
establishments. We believe this will further expand the operational reach and market of the hospital 
by bringing NMC closer to high population areas and increasing referrals to the specialty hospital. 
 
Al Ain Specialty Hospital’s performance has been continuously improving with revenues reaching 
US$48m in 2013 (+21% year on year), revenue per patient increased to US$117 (+8% year on year) 
and occupancy rose to 60% (+430bps year on year) despite the 33% increase during the year in 
operational beds. 
 
Dubai Specialty Hospital 
 
Opened in 2004, the Dubai Specialty Hospital is well situated in the growing residential area of Al 
Nahda on the Dubai-Sharjah border, which enables the hospital to take advantage of referrals, not 
only from both the Dubai General Hospital and Sharjah Medical Centre, but also from certain targeted 
sections of the population of the northern emirates. This location has helped the hospital grow 
significantly since opening. The facility continues to provide a wide range of specialties. Dubai 
Specialty Hospital had its JCI accreditation for its quality and service levels renewed for a further 
three year period in 2012.  
 
The recent decision by Dubai authorities to initiate the roll out of mandatory healthcare insurance, 
starting early 2014, is expected to further support the growth of this facility in the coming years. Dubai 
Health Authority (DHA) has reported that nearly two thirds of Dubai residents are uninsured, 
suggesting a potential phased growth of up to 200% in insured residents over the coming years. 
Dubai Specialty Hospital will soon see further support from the NMC DIP General Hospital located on 
the other side of Dubai. 
 
Dubai Specialty Hospital’s performance has been continuously improving with revenues reaching 
US$56m in 2013 (+16% year on year), revenue per patient increased to US$164 (+4% year on year) 
and occupancy declined to 54% (-160bps year on year) slightly effected by the increase in operational 
beds at the facility from 75 to 91 beds (+21% year on year).  
 
 
 
 
  23 
 
Dubai General Hospital 
 
Dubai General Hospital was established in 1999, this 10 bed facility is located in the highly populated 
area of Deira. The hospital acts as a referral centre to the NMC Dubai Specialty Hospital which is a 
short distance away. 
 
Dubai General Hospital’s revenues reached US$12.2m in 2013 (+5% year on year), revenue per 
patient increased to US$62 (+6% year on year) and occupancy reached 44% (+580bps year on year). 
 
Sharjah Medical Centre 
 
This multi specialist medical centre was opened in 1996 and is located on the busy commuter route 
along the Corniche in Sharjah. Since the facility was upgraded in 2010 from a clinic to a medical 
centre offering increased specialities such as radiology and minor procedures, revenue has increased 
significantly. The Group also benefits from referrals made from this facility to the Dubai Specialty 
Hospital. 
 
This medical centre saw a 26% year on year increase in patients, with revenues reaching US$ 10.3m 
(+16% year on year). Meanwhile revenue per patient declined to US$67.0 (-8% year on year) as we 
expanded our services by offering lower fee procedures. 
 
BR Medical Suites 
BR Medical Suites is a high-end specialty day surgery, located in Dubai Healthcare City. It is 
specifically designed to attract highly experienced doctors from around the world to carry out 
minimally invasive surgery and other procedures within its modern international standard facility. The 
Group acquired BR Medical Suites for a consideration of US$9m paid in cash on 1 July 2012. 
 
During FY 2013 the facility generated revenues of US$ 2.6m and received 9,582 patients (+480% 
year on year). Revenue per patient was around US$ 269. While the facility’s total revenues increased, 
revenue per patient declined by 17%, mainly due to the introduction of new services. Historically, this 
day surgery has been focused on high-complexity and high value procedures. As we widened the 
service offering, the revenue per patient has declined.  
 
Unlike our other healthcare assets, this day surgery is overwhelmingly focused on utilisation by 
external doctors. Consequently, its revenues were accounted for net of the external doctor’s share.  
 
NMC Day Surgery Centre in Mohammed Bin Zayed City  
This facility in the rapidly growing Abu Dhabi suburb known as Mohammed Bin Zayed City (MBZC) 
began receiving its first outpatients in July 2013. NMC Day Surgery Centre in Mohammed Bin Zayed 
City will act as a referral centre to our growing Abu Dhabi hospital network, thus extending the 
operational reach and addressable market of Abu Dhabi Specialty Hospital initially and eventually 
also Brightpoint Women’s Hospital and Khalifa City Hospital 
 
The facility has seen strong monthly growth in patient numbers since opening and, we expect this 
trend to continue as we open new sections of the day surgery centre. In addition, we expect to open a 
pharmacy in the same building in 2014 which should support revenue growth. 
 
Revenue amounted to just under US$1m with over 19,000 patients and US$48 in revenue per patient. 
 
Third party hospital operations & management 
 
NMC Health provides operation and management services to third party healthcare asset owners and 
developers. Our management service contract to date is for the 205 bed Sheikh Khalifa General 
Hospital in Umm Al Quwain, which we are managing on behalf of the UAE Ministry of Presidential 
Affairs since Q4 2012. This is a five year contract in return for an annual management fee based on 
qualitative as opposed to financial metrics. We believe this is the first such contract to manage a large 
Government healthcare facility awarded by a Government Department to a local UAE business. This 
demonstrates the confidence in NMC’s significant healthcare experience and capabilities. 
 
  24 
 
Capital projects  
 
NMC Health’s expansion plans, as announced during the IPO in 2012, included five new healthcare 
assets. Three of the assets, which included the lease, redesign and equipping of existing buildings 
are: 
 
 Brightpoint Women’s Hospital (100 bed) in Abu Dhabi; 
 
 NMC Day Surgery Centre in the Mohammed Bin Zayed City Suburb of Abu Dhabi (opened in 
July 2013); and  
 
 Dubai Investment Park (DIP) General Hospital (60 bed). 
.  
 
In addition, a fourth medical facility is being developed the 250 bed Hospital in the Khalifa City suburb 
of Abu Dhabi. However, in this case the building is an entirely new development, owned and 
contracted by NMC Health. Finally, the plans also included the acquisition of BR Medical Suites 
(completed in 2012), a specialist day surgery centre in Dubai Health Care City (DHCC). 
 
The Group faced significant challenges in 2013 to progress the construction of certain of its new 
facilities, particularly those requiring the re-design and fit-out of existing buildings.  
 
The Brightpoint Women’s Hospital, which was originally planned to open in August 2012, has been 
particularly complex refit and construction slower than expected. Following a number of delays we are 
now expecting the facility to open in H1, 2014. Similarly the DIP General Hospital, construction has 
been delayed on several occasions and we have also had licensing delays. We are now expecting the 
facility to open in H1, 2014.  
 
As a result of the delays experienced, we have introduced new processes for future projects 
including: 
 
 appointment of an external project manager for our larger future projects; and 
 enhanced our tendering process, to ensure that appropriately experienced contractors are 
appointed in the future. 
 
We are also reviewing our internal project management structure and will be making changes to 
further enhance quality in this area.  
 
The construction of Khalifa City Hospital is progressing well, with the concrete structure of the building 
now complete. We continue to target receiving the first patients at this facility starting H1 2015. The 
Sanaiya Day Surgery Centre in Al Ain is on track to open in H2, 2014, in-line with our previous 
guidance on this project. The building is being adapted internally and equipped for healthcare 
services with good progress so far. 
 
As a result of the delays in the opening of certain facilities, additional costs in respect of loan interest 
and leases have been capitalised. Had these facilities opened in line with original plan these costs 
would have been expensed.Other than these items the delays have not resulted in an increase in 
budgeted capital costs. 
Distribution Division 
 
Top-line growth in the Distribution division accelerated to 10.7% year on year in 2013, compared to 
7% year on year growth between 2011 and 2012, demonstrating the positive impact by the: 
 
 expansion of the UAE economy;  
 growing population;  
 rise in tourism;  
 substantial increase in retail space;  
 addition of new products to our offering; and  
 positive efforts of the Distribution division team in growing product sales.  
  25 
 
The division generated revenues of US$ 300.2m (+10.7% year on year) in FY2013 with 71,215 
SKU’s
8
 (+8.7% year on year). EBITDA margins continued to expand on operational gearing, 
increased efficiencies and economies of scale. EBITDA reached US$ 29.9m in 2013 (+14.1% year on 
year) with EBITDA margins exceeding last year by 30bps to reach 10.0% as of year-end 2013.  
 
Distribution division’s revenue and EBITDA contribution  
 
  
 
 
FMCG remained the largest segment with 39% of the distribution division’s 2013 revenues, a two 
percentage point reduction in proportional contribution compared to 2012. Food & Catering delivered 
the strongest segmental growth and increased its proportional contribution to 11.8% of the division’s 
revenues, almost three percentage points higher than in 2012.

IT 
  
The Group has operated in recent years with legacy IT systems which, as a smaller private company, 
were appropriate for the needs of the Group. Following a review of the Group’s IT requirements, the 
Board agreed capital investment in two new primary Group systems: 
 
a. Hospital Information System (HIS).  
The current HIS system operating within NMC is a home-grown system which has been 
operating successfully over many years. Continuing developments in the regulatory framework in 
the UAE healthcare system, as well as additional monitoring and reporting requirements which 
the Group feels that it requires as the business grows, has resulted in a decision to implement a 
new HIS. 
 
The Group has chosen to implement a third party system which is already operating successfully 
within the UAE regulatory structure. The implementation will commence in 2014 and is expected 
to be completed by 2015. The Company feels that the new system will be robust enough to deal 
with the demands of significant growth of the business.   
 
b. Enterprise Resources Planning (ERP) financial system.   
It was reported in the 2012 Annual Report that the Company planned to implement a new 
financial IT system during 2013. Implementation of the new system commenced in 2013, but 
completion will now be delayed following management’s decision to switch from instant “Go-live” 
to a phased roll out of the new IT system, to enable full testing and the integration of the new 
Oracle version. We anticipate the implementation of the new ERP system will be completed in 
the first half of 2014. Initial indications from the implementation programe have been 
encouraging.  
 
The Company has been aware of the need to improve its IT infrastructure and is on track to deliver 
new IT systems across the Group. The implementation of new IT systems always presents 
organisations with a significant challenge, and implementing two new primary systems within the 
Group will be no exception. However, the management team and the Board feels that now is an 
opportune time to be implementing a new IT infrastructure as the Group prepares for significant 
growth in the coming years. This investment in new technology will help to reduce an element of 
manual intervention and improve reporting and therefore the company’s internal control environment.

Financial review    
 
NMC Health delivered a strong performance in 2013 at both the Group and divisional level. 
Consolidated Group Revenues increased from US$490.1m in FY2012 to US$550.9m in FY2013, a 
growth of 12.4%. After elimination of US$38.6m of intra-group trading revenue, Consolidated Group 
EBITDA improved from US$79.6m in FY2012 to US$92.9m in FY2013, a growth of 16.7%. 
 
Group Net profit reached US$69.1m in FY2013, yielding Earnings per share (EPS) of US$ 0.367 
compared to US$0.343 for the same period in 2012. Excluding the effects of one-off items; IPO costs 
of US$3.4m in 2012 and writeoff of unamortised finance fees of US$3.4m in 2013, the increase in 
EPS would have been US$ 0.390 in 2013, representing an adjusted increase of 13.7%. 
 
Healthcare division 
Revenue in the Healthcare division increased from US$ 251.6m in FY2012 to US$289.3m in FY2013, 
a growth of 15.0%. EBITDA increased from US$ 68.2m in FY2012 to US$81.7m in FY2013, a growth 
of 19.8%. EBITDA margin improved from 27.1% in FY2012 to 28.2% in FY2013. 
 
Distribution division 
Within the Distribution division, revenues increased from US$271.1m in FY2012 to US$ 300.2m in 
FY2013, a growth of 10.7%. EBITDA increased from US$26.2m in FY2012 to US$29.9m in FY2013, a 
growth of 14.1%. EBITDA margin improved from 9.7% in FY2012 to 10.0% in FY2013. 
 
Capital Expenditure 
Capital expenditure incurred for the year was US$82.7m (FY2012: US$118.9m). This encompassed 
US$72.2m on the Group’s capital projects. The Group also incurred US$7.3m on equipment required 
across the existing operations. 
 
The Company was able to capitalise certain expenses, in accordance with IFRS and the Company’s 
accounting policies. We expect this to continue in relation to costs (for example lease costs) arising 
during the construction of future projects. Although pre-operating expenses were nil in the year to 31 
December 2013, we expect a small level of pre-operating costs which will be expensed in the 2014 
financial year as a result of the opening of new facilities.  
 
As a result of the delays in the opening of certain facilities discussed in “Business overview”, 
additional costs in respect of loan interest and leases have been capitalised. Had these facilities 
opened in line with original plan these costs would have been expensed. Other than these items the 
delays have not resulted in an increase in budgeted capital costs. 
 
A table outlining original estimated capital expenditure and other budgeted costs for each of our 
current development projects, and a further table setting out costs to date on these projects is set out 
below.

Total 315 135.9 10.7 25.7 172.3 
 
Notes  
1: Prior to commencement of development of the existing four capital projects, management had an expectation that 
there would be an element of expense incurred before the new facilities were opened which would be written off 
through the Income Statement. Following a review certain of these costs have been capitalised in line with the 
Company’s accounting policies (for example lease rent paid and finance costs). The Group expects such costs will 
continue to be capitalised on these projects during the construction phase.  
  28 
 
2: The lease in respect of Brightpoint contains a rent free period as well as specified rent increases. In line with IFRS 
and the Company’s accounting policies, the rental cost of the lease has been adjusted to appropriately account for 
these items over the length of the lease. Accounting policies stipulate that the total lease value for the full lease period 
is divided evenly over the years.  
 
3. Apart from the projects mentioned above, the Group had spent US$9m on the acquisition of BR Medical Suites 
during the last financial year as part of the projects announced during the IPO. 
 
4. The Group has not spent any amount towards the development of the Al Ain Medical Centre as at 31-December-
2013. 
 
The company has reviewed all significant capital expenditure projects including the delayed projects 
for impairments and have concluded that the projects have sufficient headroom and that none of the 
assets are impaired. 
Cash 
Net cash inflow from operating activities for the 2013 financial year was US$85.1m, compared with 
US$35.3m for the comparative period in 2012. This was mainly due to: 
 
 improved performance of the Group; and 
 effective management of working capital . 
 
Including funds held on deposit, cash as at 31 December 2013 was at US$268.7m compared to US$ 
257.5m at the end of FY 2012. The company had allocated the funds raised through the IPO as well 
as through the JP Morgan syndicated loan against the capital cost of the five expansion projects 
announced during the IPO. As a result, together with positive operating cashflow, the Company is well 
financed to complete its capital expenditure program.  
 
As expected, the Group had a net debt position of US$63.7m at 31 December 2013 compared with 
US$46.1m at 31 December 2012. As the Group continues with its capital project development 
program, and the Company’s cash is committed to such projects, the level of net debt is expected to 
increase during FY 2014.

Working Capital  
Working capital for our two operating business divisions is funded differently due to the nature of their 
business models. The Group is able to fund its working capital requirements for its Healthcare division 
from operational cash flow, and we do not expect this position to change in the 2014 financial year.  
 
In relation to our Distribution division, the working capital requirement is dependent on a number of 
factors including the timing of receipt of debtors and the timing of payment of creditors as well as 
inventory flow during the year and the timing of re-imbursement of promotional expenses agreed with 
our Principals in relation to the sale and marketing of their products. The Distribution division requires 
external working capital facilities throughout the year, the level of which is dependent on business 
seasonality. These working capital facilities are arranged through a number of banking providers and 
in general terms the level of working capital required is between 30%-40% of the Group’s total debt 
facilities. 
 
Long term debt facilities 
A five year debt facility of up to US$ 300m was made available to the Group during the year by a 
syndicate of lenders led by J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, to refinance high interest bearing credit lines.  A 
total of US$ 225m has been drawn down from this facility to date.  The cost of funds for this facility is 
3.0% over one month LIBOR. This rate is substantially lower than the credit lines replaced. We expect 
this change to yield a total saving of around US$ 10m over the five year tenure of the loan compared 
to the previous arrangement, net of the one off of US$3.4m written off in the current year of 
unamortised finance costs,  
  30 
 
The total debt of the Group, excluding accounts payable and accruals, was US$332.4m as at 31 
December 2013 compared to US$303.6m on 31 December 2012. 
 
Finance costs and income 
Total finance costs for 2013 were US$14.3m compared to US$ 13.7m in 2012. This was mainly on 
account of the increased utilization of working capital lines commensurate with the increase in the 
activity levels in both the Group’s operating segments. The Group’s replacement of high interest 
bearing credit lines during the year limited, to some extent, the increase in finance costs.  
 
Dividend 
The Board is proposing to continue with its policy of annual dividend payments of between 20% and 
30% of Profit After Tax, outlined in the Company’s IPO prospectus in 2012. The Board is therefore 
recommending that a final dividend of 4.4 pence per share be paid in cash in respect of the year 
ended 31 December 2013 (FY2012: 4.1 pence per share).

Principal risks and uncertainties 
 
The Board consider the identification and mitigation of material risks and uncertainties faced by the 
Group as a key issue to be monitored at all levels of the organisation. The senior management team 
ensure that operational management consider risk as part of their day to day activities. This is 
considered to be particularly key for NMC as a Group working in a regulated environment. 
  
In order to monitor the Group’s business and strategic plans on a more formal basis, the management 
team has, with the assistance of the Group’s Internal Auditors, Crowe Horwath, reviewed and re-
assessed the strategic and key risks faced by the Group. These risks, the potential effect of these 
risks on the Group and the mitigation of those risks is analysed in the following table. It should be 
noted that the order that these risks are expressed in the table do not reflect an order of magnitude as 
regards their potential impact on the Group.

Corporate Social Responsibility 
 
 
Human Rights responsibilities 
 
The NMC Group is committed to being a responsible corporate citizen. This mission is headed by our 
CEO, Dr B R Shetty, who is one of the pioneers in the private healthcare sector in the UAE and 
founded NMC with the philosophy of ‘affordable quality healthcare for all’. The right to medical 
assistance and treatment is the basic right of each human and this is the ideology that each person at 
NMC abides by and follows.  This is in line with the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights 1948, which states that "Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health 
and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and 
necessary social services."  We take forward this mission by following ethical human rights practices 
at all levels of our business including our employees, our patients and our stakeholders. 
 
Since our inception in 1975, NMC has continually provided affordable quality health care to its patrons 
and, as we enter the 40
th
 year of our operations in the UAE, we intend that our endeavours to serve 
the community will grow stronger and better. NMC encounters over 2 million patients annually across 
all its facilities, which are spread throughout the UAE and we are dedicated to making a positive 
difference in the lives of each person who walks in through NMC doors. To be able to touch 
thousands of lives each day, increases our responsibility towards our patients as well as our 
employees who serve as the lifeline of our organisation.  
 
Patients 
 
Over the last four decades, NMC Health has believed in the philosophy of ‘healthcare for everyone’ – 
irrespective of nationality, income level or socio-economic demographic. NMC is one of the few large 
hospital chains in the UAE that accepts patients from virtually all health insurance plans, from the top 
end plans for higher income groups to the lowest end plans meant for blue collar workers.  
 
NMC’s patient base mirrors the demographic make-up of the UAE. We are now touching the lives of 
nearly 6,000 patients a day, from all walks of life who represent the many nationalities that reside in 
the UAE and whose families have been NMC patrons for more than a generation.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
NMC Healthcare operates or manages hospitals and medical centres in the largest cities and across 
four of the emirates of the UAE. In terms of locations, our facilities are accessible to over 85% of the 
country’s population. We are the only private healthcare provider in the country that has such a broad 
presence across the country.  36 
 
Quality of Care for our patients is of utmost importance.  
 
We have 3 priorities which are:  
 
– Safe Facilities 
– Clinical Excellence 
– Patient Experience 
 
We follow the International Patient Safety Goals and have Joint Commission International 
accreditation in each of our three Specialty Hospitals. Our medical practitioners and staff are 
dedicated to maintaining the high level of patient safety and quality of medical care that we promise.  
 
NMC Health’s distribution business, NMC Trading, has a number of pharmaceutical medical 
representatives and medical equipment salespersons who remain in close contact with the doctors 
and bio-medical and administrative teams in hospitals, medical centres and pharmacies across the 
UAE. The business imports and distributes essential pharmaceuticals, medical equipment and 
consumables of high quality and ensures they are readily available to healthcare institutions. 
 
Employees 
At NMC Health, we consider our human resources as our biggest assets. Our employees not only 
serve as our partners in serving the community, but are also our brand ambassadors who take 
forward and enhance our mission and vision for a better tomorrow.   
 
Diversity 
As at 31 December 2013, the Group had grown its employee base across all its business operations 
to 5,356 employees. We employ individuals of 49 different nationalities and offer an approach of 
employment without discrimination. .

In our efforts to offer a work-life balance, all our staff members are provided with the option of free 
company accommodation or an accommodation allowance. This allows them to stay close to their 
place of work and to cut the time spent in commuting to and from work.  This also contributes to 
providing better care to our patients since on-call doctors can be at the patient’s side from their home 
within minutes in case of an emergency.  
 
NMC Health also extends additional benefits to its employees including offering all its female 
employees over the age of 40, free mammogram screening at all our hospitals during the breast 
cancer awareness month. NMC runs a number of fitness events and sports clubs including cricket 
and volleyball teams. 
 
NMC Health employees are eligible for discounted rates for most services within our medical facilities, 
and can also take advantage of discounted prices for the FMCG and food products that are 
distributed by NMC Trading. NMC Health celebrates events and conducts cultural and social 
gatherings for its employees, such as the cultural programs conducted every year on the occasion of 
International Nurses’ Day, NMC Annual Day and UAE National Day among many other such 
occasions. These events serve as a great platform for our employees to bring forth their creative side 
as well as interact with their colleagues in an informal environment.  
 
Community 
 
NMC Health believes that community outreach programmes are an ideal way to contribute towards 
enhancing the health of the society and the nation.  Along with providing medical assistance and 
treatment to our patients, NMC undertakes hundreds of community initiatives over the year including 
blood donation camps, health awareness programs, free health screenings and hygiene workshops 
among others. The following section will provide a few examples of our Community Health Awareness 
program: 
 
NMC’s Give Blood Give Life Initiative (July 2013) 
Continuing with its endeavour to provide compassionate and quality healthcare, NMC Specialty 
Hospital, Abu Dhabi organised a Blood Donation Drive in collaboration with the Abu Dhabi Blood 
Bank. The Give Blood Give Life themed Voluntary Blood Donation Drive was organised to raise 
awareness for the need of safe blood and blood products. This was the second drive in 2013 to 
generate awareness amongst our staff and to help prevent blood shortage issues in the country. 
  39 
 
 
 
World Heart Day  (September 2013) 
 
- NMC Healthcare conducted one of the largest public awareness and education drives in the 
UAE on heart diseases and cardiac care where almost 10,000 people received free health 
check – ups comprising of Blood Pressure, Body Mass Index (BMI), Blood glucose and 
cholesterol measurements.  The week-long initiative that ran from 23 – 29 September 2013

NMC Health Index (December 2013) 
 
Being the UAE’s trusted healthcare partner since 1975, NMC took it upon itself to commission a 
research document that would give a deeper insight of the health conditions of the residents of UAE 
and to raise awareness about the country’s health issues. With this intention in mind, NMC launched 
the NMC Health Index to:  
- evaluate the importance of healthcare in the country 
- be an indicator of the physical, social and emotional well-being of UAE society 
- help people be more informed on factors that can enhance well-being in daily life and make 
healthier choices 
- engage in the public health debate and develop solutions to tackle health issues in the UAE  41 
 
For the NMC Health Index, we surveyed 1,054 adults (aged 18+) in the UAE exploring perceptions of 
health and wellness, where mixed modes - online and computer-assisted personal interviewing 
(CAPI) were used for data collection. The survey which was available in English and Arabic included 
a set of questions to evaluate the physical, social and emotional health score of the respondents. 
Quotas based on UAE government statistics were assigned for age, gender and nationality to reflect 
the population. 
 
A few interesting findings resulted from the survey: 
- The majority of respondents (65%)  feel that having a healthy lifestyle is not wholly 
within their control 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- Overall, three in ten (31%) either smoke some form of tobacco or drink alcohol 
weekly 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
- One in ten (9%) has never visited a doctor for any medical reason, while three in four 
(76%) say the healthcare system in the UAE is better than other countries. 
 
This is the first health index of its kind in the UAE with NMC providing market leading benchmarking 
for future research in the healthcare sector. We plan to make this index a continuous effort to 
contribute towards improving the overall health, not only physical, but also the happiness quotient as 
well as social wellness of the residents of UAE.  
 
Environment 
NMC understands the significance of healthy living and takes great care in creating and maintaining a 
sustainable environment for generations to come. Some of the initiatives made by NMC to contribute 
to the cause of a healthier environment are: 
 
 
 Men (32%) are five times 
more likely than women 
(6%) to smoke tobacco  
 21% Smoke tobacco  42 
 
- NMC Health supported the Clean-up UAE campaign organised by The Emirates 
Environmental Group, an environmental programme devoted to environmental conservation 
and sustainability. Through the years, the campaign has grown in strength and popularity; 
garnering support from the government and private organisations NMC proudly supported the 
campaign this year with 22 volunteers from the hospital participating in the environmental 
programme. We firmly believe in a cleaner, greener and more sustainable environment – not 
just for a healthier today, but a happier tomorrow as well.

- NMC Health, in its efforts to being an eco-friendly organisation, practices safe disposal of 
medical waste to maintain a less infection prone environment in its facilities and offices. 
Complementing these efforts is developing Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) policies 
and procedures, conducting audits, inspections and incident investigations and, ensuring 
continuous improvement of the NMC EHS management system and processes.  Our aim 
remains to remove or reduce the susceptibility of risk of fatalities, occupational diseases and 
disorders, disabling and other injuries, healthcare associated infections, spread of 
antimicrobial resistance and significant environmental incidents. 
 
- The introduction of e-claims for health insurance has significantly reduced the amount of 
printed paper submitted in our monthly invoices to insurance paying companies. We also 
encourage recycling of paper used internally to reduce consumption of paper.

CEO 44 
 
 
Governance 
 
The Board is responsible for, and committed to, ensuring that procedures are in place so that good 
standards of corporate governance are operated at all levels in the Group in accordance with the 
guidance and principles set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code published by the Financial 
Reporting Council in September 2012 (the “Code”). The Code can be found on the Financial 
Reporting Council website, frc.org.uk. 
 
In the 2012 Annual Report, the Group stated that good progress had been made on the governance 
environment during the period since the Company’s IPO and that this would continue into the new 
financial year. This has indeed been the case. The management team and the Board, supported by 
the Audit Committee, have continued to review the governance and control environment ensuring that 
governance processes are documented and implemented and, where appropriate, continue to 
improve. This Corporate Governance report describes how the Board has applied Corporate 
Governance principles during the 2013 financial year.  
 
Both the Board and the senior management team encourages appropriate levels of governance for a 
Company listed on the Premium Segment of the London Stock Exchange, whilst respecting where 
possible business processes acceptable in the Group’s country of operation. The Board believes that 
progress has been made in relation to the governance structure during the year. 
 
Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
 
The Board has reviewed the Company’s compliance against the provisions of the Code.  
 
Since the Company’s IPO in April 2012, the Board has continued to seek to ensure that Board and 
Governance processes evolve appropriately and in a manner which protects the interests of the 
Company and all of its shareholders. There are a number of provisions of the Code that the Company 
has not complied with during the year. These provisions are stated and an explanation of non-
compliance provided either below or within this Governance Section. 
 
- Provision A.4.1 of the Code. The Company did not have a Senior Independent Director from 
27 June 2013 for the remainder of the 2013 financial year after Mr Justin Jewitt ceased to be 
a Director of the Company. This was a result of the appointment of a new Non-Executive 
Director, Jonathan Bomford, to the Board and a preference to allow Mr Bomford to transition 
into his new role prior to choosing the most appropriate candidate to become Senior 
Independent Director. The Board have subsequently appointed Jonathan Bomford as the 
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director with effect from 21 January 2014 and the 
Company is therefore now compliant with this Code Provision. 
 
- Appraisals and evaluation processes. The Board has not to date undertaken a formal and 
rigorous annual evaluation of its own performance and that of its committees and individual 
directors. This was due to the relatively short period of time that the Board has been 
constituted. The Company therefore did not comply with provisions B.6, B.6.1 and B.6.3 of the 
Code during 2013. The Board is currently assessing its preferred process for proceeding with 
such an evaluation which it intends to undertake in the first half of 2014. Similarly, the Non-
Executive Directors did not meet during 2013 to appraise the Chairman’s performance. 
Therefore the Company also did not comply with provision A.4.2 of the Code. The 
Independent Non-Executive Directors did however meet in January 2014 to appraise the 
Chairman’s performance, which is the start of the formal Board and Directors appraisal 
process which is currently being implemented. The Board intends to comply with Provisions 
A.4.2, B.6, B.6.1 and B.6.3 of the Code by the end of the first half 2014 financial year. 
 
- Provision B.2.1, B.2.2 and B.2.4 of the Code. Mr Jonathan Bomford was appointed by the 
Board with effect from 27 June 2013. The decision to appoint Mr Bomford was considered by 
the Board as a whole and the Nominations Committee did not operate a formal process in 
relation to his appointment; the Company therefore did not comply with the provisions of 
B.2.1, B.2.2 and B.2.4 of the Code. Further details are provided on page 57. Furthermore, 
during the year to 31 December 2013, whilst the Board have reviewed proposals for, and  45 
 
discussed the implementation of a senior management succession plan, although this 
process has not been finalised as a result of the Board’s primary focus on the Group’s 
Governance and overall control environment processes. A formal senior management 
succession plan is expected to be implemented in 2014 and the Nominations Committee will 
meet to consider the effectiveness of such plan thereafter. The Company was therefore not 
compliant with part of Provision B.2 of the Code during the period under review 
 
- Provision B.4.2 of the Code. The Chairman did not meet with each Director to consider their 
training and development needs during 2013. However, a formal process has commenced in 
early 2014 in this respect.  It was considered appropriate that the implementation of this 
process be introduced in conjunction with new Board and Director evaluation processes 
which are currently being implemented as outlined above. 
 
- Provision C.3.1 of the Code. The Chairman was a member of the Audit Committee during the 
year but resigned from the Committee in December 2013. The reasons for his membership of 
the Audit Committee are set out on page 63. The Company intends to be compliant with this 
provision for the 2014 financial year onwards.  
 
 
Unless otherwise stated above or in the Corporate Governance Report, the Board believes that it has 
been compliant with the remaining provisions of the Code for the 2013 Financial Year.

other directors have been appointed to serve during the period from 1 January 2013 to 31
 
December 
2013 or subsequently.  
 
Share Capital 
There have been no changes to the issued share capital of the Company during the year. The issued 
share capital as at 1 January 2013 and at 31 December 2013 is £18,571,428 divided into 
185,714,286 shares of 10p each. As at the date of this report, the Company has not issued any 
options over the Company’s share capital. 
  52 
 
At the annual general meeting held in 2013, shareholders approved an authority for the Board to be 
permitted, in certain circumstances, to purchase its own shares. This authority has not been used.  
 
Under the articles of association of the Company, all Ordinary shares have equal rights to dividends 
and capital and to vote at general meetings of the Company. There are no restrictions on the size of 
holding nor on the transfer of shares, which are both governed under the terms of the articles of 
association and relevant legislation. The directors are not aware of any agreements between holders 
of the Company’s shares that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or in voting rights.  
 
Principal shareholders 
As at 24 February 2014, the Company is aware of the following significant shareholdings in the 
Ordinary shares of the Company: 
 
Shareholder Number of shares % of issued share 
capital held 
Nature of holding 
    
H.E. Saeed Bin Butti 53,466,559 28.8 Direct 
Dr B. R. Shetty 37,742,409 20.3 Direct 
Mr Khalifa Bin Butti 19,059,842 10.3 Direct 
Infinite Investment LLC 14,072,024 7.6 Direct 
 
Political donations 
Neither the Company nor any subsidiary company in the Group made any Political donations during 
the year ended 31 December 2013. 
 
Whilst the Company has no intention of making formal political donations in the future, the Board 
acknowledge that given the wide interpretation of such donations, certain business events in which 
the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or the Board, may wish to participate may be caught under the 
formal definition of political donations. The Company will therefore again be seeking approval from 
shareholders at this year’s annual general meeting, for a small approved limit for “political donations”, 
for use in such circumstances. If this is approved by shareholders, the Board will provide full details of 
any such payments made in the next annual report.  
 
Contracts of significance with directors 
Under UAE law and regulations, with the exception of certain specific areas designated by the 
Government as such, all land must be held legally by a UAE National. In addition, all healthcare 
facility and pharmacy operating licences may only be held legally by a UAE National, and not a body 
corporate. As a result, some of the property owned beneficially by the Group and all the Group’s 
medical facility and pharmacy licences, are held legally in the name of either H.E. Saeed Bin Butti 
previously a Director of the Company or Mr Khalifa Bin Butti, a Director of the Company.       
 
Related Party Transactions 
Details of related party transactions are included in note 28 of the financial statements on pages 136 
to 138. 
 
Post Balance Sheet Events 
The Company’s subsidiary, NMC Healthcare LLC, entered into a renewed lease of 27 years with     
Municipality of Abu Dhabi for the site on which the Group’s new Khalifa City Specialty Hospital is 
being constructed. There were no other events which would have a material effect on the 
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position between 31 December 2013 and the date of this report. 
 
Going Concern 
The Group has two diverse operating divisions, both of which operate in a growing market. The Board 
have undertaken an assessment of the future prospects of the Group and the wider risks that the 
Group is exposed to. In its assessment of whether the Group should adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing its financial statements, the Board has considered: 
 
Operating risk: The Board receives monthly management reports covering key operational 
matters, monthly comparison to budget and updated forecasts on a half yearly basis for the full 
financial year to ensure that the business is trading in line with its expectations. The 
management team prepare a Group budget for each financial year and a cashflow forecast for  53 
 
the following 18 months which allows the Board to monitor the financial position of the Group 
and to consider appropriate risks which the business may face from a financial perspective. 
 
Financing risk: The Company has worked to structure its debts for the medium and long term 
as well as utilising short term facilities to meet the Group’s working capital requirements. The 
funds raised as a result of the share issue undertaken at IPO in April 2012 and the US$300m 
five year syndicated term debt facility, of which US$225m has been drawn down to date, are 
more than sufficient to fund the Group’s material capital projects. The Group has banking 
arrangements through a spread of local and international banking groups. Debt covenants are 
reviewed by the board each month. The Board believes that the level of cash in the Group, the 
spread of bankers and the improved debt facility terms agreed during 2013 mitigates the 
financing risks that the Group faces from both its capital expenditure program and in relation to 
working capital requirements. 
 
Customer and Supplier risk: Both the Healthcare and Distribution divisions have continued their 
positive growth trends. All major financial and non-financial KPIs showed good improvement 
during 2013. In the Healthcare division, trade receivables are monitored regularly, provisions 
made where necessary and the Group has no history of significant bad debts. In the 
Distribution division, the increase in revenue and product flow has an adverse effect on the 
Group’s working capital position. Trade receivables are monitored regularly and management 
maintain a close working relationship with all major suppliers to monitor performance as well as 
signs of financial risk The Board has reviewed the business plan for 2014 as well as considered 
growth forecasts for the healthcare sector in UAE, and considers the Group’s future forecasts 
to be reasonable. 
 
Impairment risk: The Board has considered the carrying value of inventories, accounts 
receivable and property and equipment and concluded that there are no indicators of material 
impairment of these items and therefore no material cash flow impact associated with any loss 
in those areas. 
 
In its review, the Board considered other areas of potential risk, including regulatory risk, insurance 
and legal risks and potential areas of contingent liability and found no matters which are likely to affect 
the viability of the Group in the medium term.   
 
The Directors therefore continue to adopt the going concern basis in the preparation of the financial 
statements.  
 
Financial risk management objectives 
The financial risk management objectives and policies of the Group are included in note 29 to the 
financial statements on pages 138 to 142. 
 
Greenhouse gas emissions 
The Group has not collected data as required under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic and 
Directors’ Reports) Regulations 2013 in relation to its greenhouse gas emissions during 2013.  
 
The Company is aware of its responsibilities to the environment. The Company is aware that the 
climate in which its businesses operates is extremely hot when compared with other parts of the 
world. The Group’s medical facilities are particularly reliant on cooling to ensure a safe environment 
for our patients and employees. 
 
The measuring of greenhouse gas emissions or other environmental indicators is largely not prevalent 
within businesses in the UAE. The Group has therefore not had experience of having to consider 
environmental matters or its gas emissions previously. The Company considers that its primary areas 
for review in relation to the effect that the Group has on the environment is as follows: 
 
 The Group’s electricity usage which, given the focus on healthcare operations, is significant; 
 The use of air conditioning, and in particular the use of gases within cooling systems, which 
given the location of the businesses in an extremely hot climate, will be higher than other 
countries in the world;  54 
 
 The use of vehicle fuels, particularly with regards to the vehicle fleet used in the Distribution 
division, in an environment where the distribution of product throughout the UAE can only be 
made via the country’s road network.  
 
The Company has commenced a project to ensure that data in relation to the Group’s consumption of 
greenhouse gases is collected for 2014 onwards, but it hasn’t been practical for the Group to collect 
and publish historical data in relation to the 2013 financial year.   
 
Annual General Meeting 
The annual general meeting of NMC Health plc will be held at Allen & Overy LLP, One Bishops 
Square, London E1 6AD on Thursday, 26 June 2014 at 2.00 p.m.  
 
Further details of the resolutions to be proposed at the annual general meeting are set out in the 
separate Notice of Meeting circular which accompanies this Annual Report and audited financial 
statements. 
 
Auditors 
Directors’ statement as to disclosure of information to auditors: 
  
The Directors who were members of the Board at the time of approving the Directors‘ Report are set 
out on page 51. Having made enquiries of fellow directors and of the Company‘s Auditor, each of 
these Directors confirms that:  
 
 to the best of each Director‘s knowledge and belief, there is no information (that is, 
information needed by the group‘s Auditor in connection with preparing their report) of which 
the Company‘s Auditor is unaware; and  
 each Director has taken all the steps a Director might reasonably be expected to have taken 
to be aware of relevant audit information and to establish that the Company‘s Auditor is aware 
of that information. 
 
Ernst & Young LLP have confirmed that they are willing to be reappointed as auditor for the financial 
year ending 31 December 2014. As reported in the 2012 Annual Report, the Company agreed a basis 
for audit fees for a three year period 2014 and agreed, subject to their annual re-appointment by 
shareholders, that Ernst & Young LLP would remain as auditor to the Group for that period. The Audit 
Committee now expect that Ernst & Young LLP will remain as auditor to the Group for 2015, after 
which an audit tender process is proposed.   
 
Statement of Directors responsibilities 
 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
 
The Directors are required by Company Law to prepare financial statements for the Group and the 
Company in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union (“IFRS”).  
 
The financial statements are required to present fairly for each financial period the Company’s 
financial position, financial performance and cash flows. In preparing the Group and parent company 
financial statements the Directors are also required to: 
 
 Properly select and consistently apply accounting policies 
 Present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, 
reliable, comparable and understandable information 
 Provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS is 
insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance 
 Make an assessment of the company’s ability to continue as a going concern 
 
The Directors confirm that they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the financial 
statements. The Directors also confirm that they consider the annual report and accounts, taken as a  55 
 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy. 
 
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that are sufficient to show and 
explain the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. The Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities and for the 
preparation of a Directors’ report and Directors’ remuneration report which comply with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006. 
  
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation 
in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements differs 
from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
 
We confirm to the best of our knowledge: 
 
 The financial statements, prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole 
 The Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the 
business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties they face.

The roles and responsibilities of each of the individuals and groups above, and their role in the overall 
governance framework, are set out in the remainder of this Governance section.  
 
How the Board Operates 
 
The role of the Board 
 
The Board is responsible to shareholders for the overall conduct of the Group’s business and the 
performance of management and of the Group. The Board has the powers and duties as set out in 
the Company’s articles of association and the relevant regulations applicable to the Company as a 
registered public listed company registered in England and Wales.  
 
The Board is primarily responsible for: 
 determining the strategic direction of the Group; 
 approving major capital projects, acquisitions and divestments; 
 setting the annual budget; 
 monitoring the financial performance of the Group against its targets; 
 approving annual and half-year results and monitoring shareholder communications; 
 promoting good governance within the Group, and seeking to ensure that the Company meets its 
responsibilities towards all stakeholders; and 
 demonstrating leadership and focussing on matters that affect shareholder value.  
 
The Board seeks at all times to ensure that there is an appropriate balance between short term and 
long term considerations and objectives of the Group.  
  57 
 
The Company has an agreed formal schedule of matters reserved for the Board which includes 
approval of strategic plans, financial statements, budgets, material investment decisions, acquisitions 
and divestments. The Board has overall responsibility for the effectiveness of the Group’s systems of 
internal control and is assisted by the Audit Committee in this respect. 
 
As part of the terms of their appointment, each director agreed that they will act collectively with the 
rest of the Board to ensure the success of the Group. The Board delegates authority in relation to 
matters which it has not reserved to the CEO who is responsible for delivering the Company’s 
strategic objectives. 
 
Board composition  
 
The names of the directors and their biographical details are set out on pages 46 to 48.  
 
The Board of the Company comprises seven directors, six of whom have served throughout the year: 
 
 the Non-Executive Chairman 
 two Executive Directors 
 one Non-Independent Non-Executive Director 
 three Independent Non-Executive Directors, one of whom was appointed during the year 
 
The Non-Executive Chairman and the three independent Non-Executive Directors are all UK based. 
The two Executive Directors and the Non-Independent Non-Executive Director are based in Abu 
Dhabi. The Senior Independent Director with effect from 21 January 2014 is Jonathan Bomford, who 
is available to shareholders should they have any concerns that they do not wish to raise with the 
Company or the Chairman directly. The Senior Independent Director can be contacted through the 
registered office of the Company at 23 Hanover Square, London W1S 1JB.    
 
The Board considers that the extensive and diverse business, cultural and operational experience of 
the Independent Non-Executive Directors, and their UK listed company experience, ensures that 
appropriate corporate governance procedures are considered in all aspects of Group decision making 
and control. These attributes also enable them to bring independent judgement to bear on issues of: 
 
 strategy, including constructively challenging the strategic direction of the Group; 
 scrutinising and challenging the performance of the Group; 
 assessing risk and controls operating within the Group and in its decision making; and 
 standards of conduct and governance and other matters presented to the Board.  
 
 
Process for Board changes during the year and diversity 
 
Mr Jonathan Bomford was appointed by the Board on 27 June 2013. The decision to appoint Mr 
Bomford was considered by the Board as a whole and the Nominations Committee did not operate a 
formal process in relation to his appointment; the Company did therefore not comply with the 
provisions of B.2.1, B.2.2 and B.2.4 of the Code. Mr Bomford is a Chartered Accountant having 
previous significant financial experience as a senior partner with Ernst & Young in the Middle East 
region, including the UAE. Given the lack of formal financial expertise on the Audit Committee prior to 
June 2013, and Mr Bomford’s financial and culturally aware background in the region, the Board 
considered it appropriate to appoint him to the Board and as Chairman of the Audit Committee 
notwithstanding that a Nominations Committee process was not undertaken. Mr Bomford met various 
members of the Board prior to the consideration of his appointment as a Director. As a result, given 
his particular experience, no external search was undertaken. As a result of Mr Bomford’s 
appointment, the Board considers that the Company now more fully complies with the requirement of 
provision C.3.1 of the Code in relation to financial expertise on the Audit Committee.  
 
The constitution of the current Board is diverse in terms of gender and in relation to its cultural and 
racial mix. The Board will consider both gender and cultural balance when reviewing whether the 
future make-up of the Board is appropriate to ensure the Group is managed appropriately on behalf of 
shareholders. However, neither the Board, nor the Group businesses, have formal diversity policies in  58 
 
place in relation to board and employee appointments. The Board considers that in addition to 
considering gender and race in relation to future Board appointments, it is important to consider the 
appropriate skills and character of potential new Directors to ensure that the Board acts effectively on 
behalf of shareholders.  
 
The UAE does not have legislation in relation to gender or racial equality, but is a culturally and 
racially diverse country with many different nationalities working across all sectors of the country’s 
workforce. Given local practice, the Group does not believe that it is appropriate to have a formal 
diversity policy in the region within which it operates. However its recruitment processes ensure that 
the most appropriate candidate is appointed to each available role having consideration of his or her 
experience, skills and with consideration as to how the new employee would fit culturally into the team 
into which they are recruited.  
  
Board independence 
 
For the purposes of the Code, the Board considers Mr Mark Tompkins, Mr Jonathan Bomford, Lord 
Clanwilliam and Mrs Heather Lawrence to be independent.  
 
The Independent Non-Executive Directors met separately to the other directors on five occasions, as 
well as having a number of other ad-hoc meetings and discussions, during the year. During their 
meetings the Independent Non-Executive Directors discussed various board related matters and 
other matters which, given their position as Independent Directors, they considered were of interest to 
them. 
 
The Board did not classify His Excellency Saeed Bin Butti who served during the 2013 financial year 
as an Independent Director for the purposes of the Code because of his significant shareholding in 
the Company. However, His Excellency has a detailed knowledge of the UAE and its culture, as well 
as having good connections within Abu Dhabi, both of which were of significant value to the Group 
and the Board. 
 
Tenure of independent non-executive directors 
 
Provision B.1.1 of the Code suggests that length of tenure is a factor in determining the independence 
of non-executive directors. The table below therefore shows how long each of the Independent Non-
Executive Directors have been members of the Board. 
 
 Date of appointment Full Term years to 
2014 AGM

Key roles and responsibilities in the governance structure 
 
The roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) are separate.  
 
 Chairman 
The Chairman was appointed to the Board in March 2012 in anticipation of the Company’s 
IPO. The Chairman is responsible for the proper functioning of the Company’s Board of 
directors who oversee the strategic direction of the Group including: 
 
 the effective operation and governance of the Board 
 setting the agenda and coordinating the style and tone of Board discussions 
 ensuring the directors receive accurate and timely information 
  59 
 
 
 Chief Executive Officer 
The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for identifying, with the senior management team, 
opportunities that are deemed appropriate and in line with the Board’s strategic objectives. He 
is also responsible for delivering the key strategic objectives set by the Board. The Chief 
Executive Officer is assisted in this task by the senior management team who meet regularly 
to review the performance of the business, the progress of key capital projects, new 
development opportunities as well as other material matters arising within the business. 
Members of senior management attend Board meetings, as appropriate, to highlight and 
debate, with the Board, developments within their areas of responsibility 
 
 Senior Independent Director 
The Senior Independent Director acts as a sounding board for the Chairman and serves as 
an intermediary for the other Directors as required. The Senior Independent Director is 
available to shareholders if they have concerns which they have not managed to resolve 
through the normal channels of the Chairman or the Executive Directors, or who feel that 
such contact is inappropriate for the concerns that they may have.   
 
 Group Company Secretary 
The Group Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Board and to the Board Committees. 
He assists the Chairman in ensuring that all Directors have full and timely access to all 
relevant information and in organising induction programmes for new Directors. The Group 
Company Secretary is responsible for ensuring that the correct Board procedures are 
followed and advises the Board on corporate governance matters. The appointment and 
removal of the Group Company Secretary is a matter for the Board as a whole. 
 
The biographical details of the Chairman, CEO and Senior Independent Director can be found 
on page 46-48. The biographical details of the Group Company Secretary can be found on 
page 50. 
 
Conflicts of interest 
Given the history of the Group as a private business, the Board is aware of the interest that the 
Executive Directors have in other businesses in which they have invested. Any conflicts of interest 
that may arise are monitored by: 
 
 The list of the other interests of each Executive Director being circulated to the Board at each 
of its Board Meetings; 
 Each of the Directors are asked to confirm that they have no other interests which would 
conflict them for the purposes of any item to be discussed at the meeting; where such conflict 
is reported, the respective Director is not permitted to take part in the consideration of that 
matter by the Board; 
 Each Director discloses to the Board any related party transactions in which they are 
connected, and such transactions are reported in the Group’s financial statements. 
 
Whilst Directors on the Board have other business interests, the Board do not consider that these, nor 
the time commitment that they require, materially affects the ability of such Directors to undertake 
their role or comply with their statutory obligations, directly or through their designated nominees.  
 
Board meetings 
 
The Company Secretary supports the Chairman in finalising the agenda for each Board meeting and 
ensuring that appropriate papers are provided from the management team in a timely manner for 
circulation in advance of Board and committee meetings. This is to ensure that fully informed 
decisions can be reached.  
 
The Board considers the following standard matters at each of its Board meetings: 
 
 Operational performance through the CEO’s report 
 Financial performance, including monitoring current and forecast trading, cash and debt levels 
against its expectations presented through the CFO report  60 
 
 Progress being made on the Group’s key capital development projects 
 Legal and regulatory matters 
 Investor relations, including an update in relation to activity in the Company’s shares and 
principal movements of its shareholders 
 
During the course of the 2013 financial year the Board has also considered, as appropriate: 
 
 the Group’s half-year and full-year results  
 interim management statements 
 updates from the Chair of discussions held at each of the Board Committees 
 the proposed budget for the following financial year 
 the Group’s future strategy 
 monitoring the progress of succession planning procedures which are in the process of being 
implemented in relation to senior management of the Group 
 the changes made in the Corporate Governance environment 
 the replacement of the Group’s Term Debt Facility 
 changes in the way in which the Group’s capital development projects are managed 
 changes proposed by management to the Group’s IT environment, including a new Hospital 
Information System and a new financial system, the implementation of which are both 
underway. 
 
Board effectiveness 
 
 Director Induction 
On appointment, directors have the benefit of a personalised induction programme which is 
undertaken during the first few months of their tenure as a director. Each induction 
programme covers a number of different areas including: 
 
 briefings and presentations from management to understand the business operations 
and financial drivers 
 their legal and regulatory responsibilities as directors 
 opportunities to visit the Group’s key facilities and new capital development project 
locations 
 meeting privately with the Company’s key advisors  
 
 Board information and professional development 
 
The Directors maintain an appropriate dialogue amongst themselves and with senior 
management, which ensures that Non-Executive Directors are kept up to date with major 
developments in the Group’s business.  
 
Following an initial induction process, it is important that the Non-Executive Directors meet 
with management and undertake visits to operational facilities each year in order to further 
understand the way the business operates and any change within the business. Each of the 
NEDs have visited the UAE a number of times in 2013, with particular emphasis on 
monitoring progress in relation to the Company’s key capital projects and to oversee the 
implementation of improving controls and governance within the Group.  
 
As part of their overall training and development needs, all of the non-executive directors 
have attended externally provided seminars and discussion forums relating to their areas of 
Board responsibility during the period and also met individually with a number of industry 
specialists to increase their current knowledge of key investment issues in the healthcare 
sector. Given the significant changes in the governance framework and reporting 
requirements for companies listed on the Premium Segment of the London Stock Exchange, 
all of the Directors have either attended specific seminars or received presentations and 
documentation covering all aspects of corporate governance. 
 
All Directors also received a comprehensive file of documents towards the end of 2013 
designed to increase their specific knowledge of the implementation of new governance 
requirements for London Stock Exchange Premium listed companies.  61 
 
 
In early 2014, a formal process of reviewing each Directors’ training and development needs 
has commenced. This review, undertaken by the Chairman with individual Directors, will set 
the framework for each Directors’ professional development in any particular financial year. 
 
 Performance evaluation 
 
As mentioned above, the Board did not undertake an evaluation of its own performance 
during the year to 31 December 2013. It is the Board’s intention to formally evaluate the 
performance of directors individually and collectively during the first half of the 2014 financial 
year and to advise shareholders of the findings of that review in the 2014 Annual Report and 
audited financial statements. 
 
 Re-election of directors 
 
All of the directors of the Company submit themselves for re-election at the annual general 
meeting of the Company to be held on 26 June 2014, with the exception of Jonathan Bomford 
who will seek election at his first annual general meeting as required by the Company’s 
articles of association. Each resolution for re-election of a retiring director, or the election of a 
new director, will be proposed as a separate resolution. Whilst a formal performance 
evaluation has not taken place, the Board have confirmed that the contributions made by 
each director to board deliberations continues to be effective and that the shareholders of the 
Company should support their re-election or election.  
 
 Independent advice 
 
Each of the directors is permitted to obtain independent legal advice at the Company’s 
expense in the performance of their duties as directors. This would normally be managed 
through the Group Company Secretary.  
 
All directors, and the Board as a whole, also have access to the advice and services of the 
Group Company Secretary who, under the Chairman’s direction, is responsible for ensuring 
that good Board procedures are followed.  
 
 Indemnification of directors 
 
The Company has put in place a Directors and Officers Liability Insurance policy which 
provides all Board members with insurance cover in respect of liabilities that may arise 
against the Directors collectively or individually. The Directors do not benefit from any form of 
qualifying third party indemnities made by the Company. 
 
 
Board Committees 
 
The Board has established an Audit Committee, a Remuneration Committee, a Clinical Governance 
Committee and a Nominations Committee. Further details in relation to these Committees are set out 
on pages 63 to 73. The terms of reference of each committee are available on our website at 
www.nmc.ae/ir.  
 
 Board and Board Committee attendance in the 2013 financial year 
 
During the period under review, the Board met on nine occasions; six of these meetings were 
scheduled as full periodic board meetings and three meetings were either brief meetings on 
matters requiring board approval or ad-hoc matters which arise. Scheduled periodic Board 
Meetings are planned in each financial year to be split, where possible, evenly between 
London and Abu Dhabi. 
 
 
  62 
 
The attendance of the Directors at each of the Board and Committee meetings during the 
period was as follows:

*Note: The number of meetings that each director could have attended during the period 
under review is noted in brackets. The Nominations Committee did not meet during the year. 
  
During 2013, given his other commitments, H.E. Saeed Bin Butti was not able to attend any of 
the board meetings held. His Excellency kept up to date with key matters relating to the Group 
outside of the formal Board Meeting environment through meetings with other board directors. 
His valuable time commitment to the Board and the Group, and fulfilment of his duties as a 
Director of the Company, were provided in this way. Given his other commitments, during the 
year His Excellency decided to appoint an alternate, Mr Keyur Nagori, who attended the 
majority of the Board Meetings held since his appointment in June 2013. Mr Nagori also 
attended a number of Board Meetings as an invited attendee before his formal appointment 
as an alternate director. His Excellency contributed to the Board process and to the 
effectiveness of the formal Board process, through his alternate. On 24 February 2014, H.E. 
Saeed resigned as a Director of the Company and nominated Mr. Abdulrahman Basaddiq to 
be appointed as a Director. The Broad approved his nomination on 24 February 2014.

Audit Committee report 
 
o Audit Committee Chairman foreword 
 
This is the first Audit Committee report since my appointment as Audit Committee Chairman. 
Following my appointment in June 2013, my induction process included elements specifically 
connected to financial and key risks matters, which are increasingly important in the 
Governance environment.  
 
2013 has seen significant changes in various aspects of UK listed company reporting 
requirements, and I am pleased to report that both management and the audit committee 
have been committed to ensuring that they have a good understanding of these new 
requirements. This report sets out the work of the Committee, significant matters addressed 
by the Committee during the year and the responsibilities of, and work undertaken by, the 
external and internal auditors. 
 
o The Audit Committee 
 
 Membership 
 
The Audit Committee has consisted entirely of independent non-executive directors during the 
year under review. The Audit Committee members who have served during the year are: 
 
Audit Committee 
Member 
Position Period of membership during 2013 
Jonathan Bomford  Audit Committee 
Chairman and financial 
expert  
Member and Chairman of Audit 
Committee from 27 June 2013 until end of 
the year 
Lord Clanwilliam Independent Non-
Executive Director 
Member of Audit Committee throughout 
the year 
Heather Lawrence Independent Non-
Executive Director 
Member of Audit Committee throughout 
the year 
H.J. Mark Tompkins Independent Non-
Executive Chairman 
Member of Audit Committee from 
beginning of the year until 14 December 
2013 
Justin Jewitt Previous Audit Committee 
Chairman 
Member and Chairman of Audit 
Committee from beginning of the year 
until 27 June 2013 
 
 
During the 2013 financial year until 27 June 2013, there were no Chartered Accountants on 
the Audit Committee. During this period, the Chairman of the Audit Committee, Mr Jewitt, and 
its members had general financial experience gained through their previous employment and 
board experience.  
 
From 27 June 2013 to the date of this report, the new Chairman of the Committee and the 
Committee’s financial expert is Mr Jonathan Bomford. Mr Bomford is a Chartered Accountant 
and his biographical details and experience are set out on page 48 of the annual report.   
 
On 14 December 2013, Mr Tompkins resigned as a member of the Audit Committee. Code 
provision C.3.1 of the UK Corporate Governance states that the Chairman of the Company 
should not be a member of the Audit Committee. Following the Company’s IPO in 2012, it 
was decided that it would be appropriate for all the Independent Non-Executive Directors to 
be members of the Audit Committee as the Group implemented new policies and procedures 
and enhanced its Corporate Governance environment. Following the change of Audit 
Committee Chairman in June 2013, Mr Tompkins remained on the Committee to assist the 
new Committee Chairman during the transition period following his appointment, but in 
compliance with best practice as determined by the Code, Mr Tompkins has now resigned as 
a member of the Committee.  
   64 
 
 Key role and responsibilities 
 
The key role of the Committee is to ensure that the integrity of published financial information by 
the Company, and the effectiveness of both external and internal audit processes, are 
appropriate to ensure that the interests of all shareholders are protected. 
 
The Audit Committee assists the Board in: 
 
 discharging its responsibilities with regard to financial reporting, external and internal 
audits and controls; 
 reviewing the Company’s financial results announcements, Annual Report and audited 
financial statements; 
 monitoring the independence and extent of the non-audit work undertaken by the 
external auditors; 
 making recommendations to the Board on the appointment of external auditors and the 
level of their remuneration; 
 reviewing the effectiveness of the Company’s internal audit activities and  internal 
policies; 
 Overseeing the Group’s compliance processes; and 
 Undertaking reviews of the Group’s internal controls and risk management systems.  
 
The Audit Committee is required to report regularly to the Board of Directors in relation to its 
findings on the above. The ultimate responsibility for reviewing and approving the Company’s 
Annual Report and audited financial statements and the half yearly reports remains with the 
Directors of the Company. 
 
 Committee meetings 
 
The Audit Committee met formally four times during the year, which will be the normal frequency 
in a given financial year unless otherwise as requested by any member of the Committee. The 
Meetings are scheduled to align with the Group’s reporting timetable with planning meetings in 
advance of both the half-year review and full-year audit, and approving meetings shortly in 
advance of the announcement of the Group’s half-year and full-year results. 
 
Meetings are normally attended by the Chairman of the Company, the Chief Executive Officer, 
the Chief Operating Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the Head of Strategy and Investor 
Relations. The Group Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee. The Committee 
also meets separately with the external auditors, the internal auditors and management with the 
other parties not present. 
 
 Main activities of the Committee during the year 
 
During the year, the Committee has focussed significantly on areas of corporate governance 
and management of risk. The listing of the Company on the London Stock Exchange has 
required significant change management in the Group, in particular in the way that formal 
reporting is undertaken to the Board and the formal documented policies and procedures 
within the businesses.  
 
The significant items which the Audit Committee focussed on and discussed during the year 
included: 
 
- The implementation plan for the new ERP financial accounting system. The Group is in 
the process of implementing a new accounting IT system which is designed to ensure a 
less manual working environment than has previously been in existence when the Group 
was in private ownership. Implementation of the new system commenced in 2013, but 
completion will now be delayed following management’s decision to switch from instant 
“Go-live” to a phased roll-out of the new IT system, to enable full testing and the 
integration of the new Oracle version. . The revised implementation plan for the roll-out of 
the new system was reviewed by Internal Audit who found that there are no material 
concerns in relation to the implementation of the new system. The new financial system  65 
 
is in the process of being rolled out into the Group’s operations and will be fully functional 
by the end of H1, 2014.  
 
- Revenue recognition 
The Group has a number of revenue streams across both its Healthcare and Distribution 
businesses. Whilst the Group ordinarily acts as principal in relation to its sales, there are 
a number of areas within both businesses where the recognition of revenue has been 
reviewed to ensure that the correct treatment of principal versus agency revenue has 
been adopted in all business areas. There is a risk that incorrect accounting treatment 
could be adopted within a particularly business unit, for example agency revenue being 
treated as principal revenue. Any error of this nature would affect the Revenue and not 
the EBITDA of the Group. The Audit Committee has reviewed the different treatment 
adopted by management in each relevant business unit and is comfortable with the 
accounting for revenue across the Group. 
 
- Trade receivables and other receivables 
The time taken for payers to settle invoices in the UAE is generally longer than would 
normally be expected in other parts of the world. In addition, within the Healthcare 
division, the vast majority of healthcare customers settle their invoices through medical 
insurance claims. The Group therefore experiences delays in payment as a result of the 
time taken to process claims through insurance companies and to arrange settlement of 
the claim. In the distribution business, payment delays are experienced from bulk retail 
sales customers and delays in processing bulk discounts and rebates achieved from key 
customers have an additional effect on receivables and working capital. The level of both 
trade and other receivables has been improving following a number of actions 
undertaken by management, but this will continue to be a key focus for the audit 
committee particularly to ensure that adequate bad debt provisioning is made. 
 
- The internal audit programme - this was designed to review areas of the business which 
the Committee determined to be of the highest risk to the Group’s operations, and the 
mitigation of those risks. The internal audit programme is working well and importantly, 
has been helpful to both the Committee and to management. Due to the Group’s stage of 
development, the internal audit plan has to date been partly transaction based, rather 
than wholly strategic based. From 2014 onwards the internal audit plan will be strategic 
risk based to ensure that those areas of key and strategic risks are more closely and 
independently monitored. This transition of methodology will be closely monitored during 
2014. 
 
- The implementation of new reporting and additional corporate governance requirements. 
Having prepared the Company’s inaugural annual report as a listed company for the 
2012 financial year, the implementation of so many new regulations and governance 
provisions after just one year as a listed company, and after a period of significant 
governance change throughout the Group, has been a challenge which the Audit 
Committee and the Board wished to prepare for. Members of the Audit Committee, the 
CFO and the Group Company Secretary have all attended seminars and met with 
advisers to consider to effect of the new environment on the Group’s governance 
environment and on the 2013 annual report. The Board have also received a 
comprehensive pack of all documents making up the governance framework with which 
the Group should comply, as well as attended a presentation on the same from the 
external auditors. 
 
During the 2014 financial year, the Audit Committee is intending to continue to closely monitor 
the roll-out of the Group’s new financial system, which the Committee sees as the one key 
element of the Group’s future internal control environment.  
 
o Internal control 
 
The Committee has reviewed the process by which the Group evaluates its control environment. 
The CFO provides a report each year to the Audit Committee on the effectiveness of internal 
controls and confirms to the Committee whether or not he is aware of any significant fraud that 
may have occurred within the business. The internal auditors also undertake a review across a  66 
 
wide range of control areas to give the Audit Committee and the Board assurance on the internal 
control environment. 
o Risk Management 
 
The risk management process is primarily driven by scrutiny of the register of significant risks 
which is retained and reviewed by management and the Internal Auditors. This risk register, 
which is produced in discussions with the Group’s operating facilities, is the basis for the list of 
principal risks and uncertainties which are set out on pages 31 to 34. Whilst the Internal Auditors 
already focus on areas of key risks identified by the business, the risk management of the Group, 
and the maintenance of the register of significant risks, will be enhanced further by the change in 
methodology of the Internal Audit Programme which, as outlined above, will be a more strategic 
risk based approach from 2014. 
 
o Internal audit 
 
A review of the work undertaken by the Group’s internal auditors is an agenda item for each 
Audit Committee meeting. The internal auditors report to the Committee their findings together 
with action plans to resolve any matters which they believe require to be addressed. The action 
plans are graded with key high risk matters taking priority to be resolved.  
 
 
o External audit and auditor independence 
 
The Committee believes that the effectiveness of the external audit is dependent on the 
identification of key risks during the financial year under review. Ernst & Young LLP (hereinafter 
referred to as EY) produces and discusses with the Committee a detailed audit plan identifying 
these key risks and the work to be done to test management’s assumptions and accounting 
treatment in these areas.  
 
The Committee meets separately with the External Auditors to ensure that an independent 
dialogue is maintained in relation to monitoring key business and financial risks and to ensure 
that management have not restricted the scope of their audit. The Audit Committee Chairman 
also meets with the lead audit partner on a number of occasions during the year outside the 
formality of Audit Committee meetings. 
 
The Committee discusses separately with management matters arising from the audit process 
and also to assess their view of the effectiveness of the audit work being undertaken.  
 
The Committee has not undertaken a formal review of the effectiveness of the external audit, 
although discussions were held at the June 2013 Audit Committee meeting where a review of 
any FY2012 audit recommendations was undertaken. The audit in relation to the 2012 financial 
year was the Company’s first as a listed company and management and the external auditors 
discussed the audit process, including matters which had worked well and areas of improvement 
in audit process for FY2013.  
 
The Committee believes that it will be appropriate to undertake a formal review of the 
effectiveness of the external audit following the Company’s second audit as a listed Company, 
which has just completed. This review will be undertaken in advance of the interim review for 
FY2014.  
 
 Auditor fees and appointment 
 
EY were appointed as auditor to the Company at the time of the Company’s IPO in April 
2012. As reported in the 2012 Corporate Governance Report, the Company agreed a basis 
for audit fees for the three year period of 2012, 2013 and 2014 and agreed that, subject to 
their annual re-appointment by shareholders, EY would remain as Auditors to the Group for 
those financial years. The level of audit fees paid in relation to the 2013 financial year is set 
out in note 125 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
The Committee has considered further its intentions in relation to the tender of the provision 
of external audit services following a review of new guidance in the year.  Having considered  67 
 
this guidance the Committee believes that the earliest that a tender for the provision of 
external audit service is likely to be undertaken will be subsequent to the 2015 financial year 
end audit. 
 
 Non-Audit fees 
 
During FY2013, the level of non-audit fees, excluding the fees for the half-year review, 
amounted to a total of US$ 0.1m. This figure is much reduced from FY2012, as the amount 
in that year included US$4.9m paid to EY, or its associate firm in the UAE, in relation to fees 
for their role as Reporting Accountants in relation to the Company’s IPO. The FY2013 non-
audit fees were paid to EY, or its associate firm in the UAE, in relation to a number of one-
off projects in assisting the NMC finance team with a number of business process related 
matters and for tax compliance services. The Audit Committee believe that the level of non-
audit fees in 2013 were acceptable in the first full financial year following the Company’s 
IPO. 
 
The Audit Committee has adopted a non-audit fees policy whereby it will only permit such 
fees in circumstances where they feel that use of the Auditor firm is necessary, appropriate 
or efficient, and has delegated authority to the CFO to agree such projects subject to a strict 
cap on fees in relation to each financial year. 
 
 Auditor Independence 
 
The Audit Committee formally reviewed the independence of the Company’s auditor, EY, 
during the period under review. The review took account of the relationship between 
management and the audit team, the processes that EY have in place internally to ensure 
objectivity and independence and also the level of non-audit fees incurred during the year.  
 
As part of this review the Committee reviewed the potential threats to auditor independence 
as a result of: 
 
- auditor self-interests, being those areas where the auditor may have a financial or other 
interest in the Company; 
- auditor self-review, being areas where the results of non-audit services are reflected in 
the amounts included or disclosed in the financial statements; 
- management threats, which may occur if partners or employees of the auditor take 
decision on behalf of management; and 
- Other threats, such as familiarity and intimidation. 
 
The Audit Committee is satisfied that in all areas sufficient safeguards were adopted by the 
auditor and that the independence of EY and of the audit engagement partner had not been 
compromised. There is no limitation of liability in the terms of appointment of the Auditor for 
the audit of the Company’s financial statements.

Clinical Governance Committee 
 
The Clinical Governance Committee was established by the Board in June 2013 to provide 
assurance to shareholders that the key operational risks of the business are considered by a 
Committee of the Board and to ensure that the key risk of clinical care and quality associated 
with the Group’s healthcare business is independently monitored.  
 
The Committee has consisted entirely of independent non-executive directors during the period 
under review. The Clinical Governance Committee members who have served during the year 
are: 
 
Clinical 
Governance

Committee from 27 June 2013 until the 
end of the year 
Justin Jewitt Previous Independent 
Non-Executive Director 
Member of Clinical Governance 
Committee from its establishment until 27 
June 2013 
 
Meetings of the Committee will be scheduled for three times per financial year. In addition to 
the Clinical Governance Committee members, the Group Medical Director, Chief Operating 
Officer and Vice President – Quality and Standards attend each meeting. The Group 
Company Secretary is Secretary to the Committee. 
 
o Key role and responsibilities 
 
The key role of the Committee is to oversee governance structures, processes and controls in 
place within the Group healthcare operations. This is to ensure that the risks associated with 
clinical care are mitigated in the interests of the Company and its stakeholders, including 
shareholders. 
 
Specific responsibilities of the Committee include:  
  
-  Ensuring processes and controls are in place across the NMC Healthcare hospitals to 
promote safety and excellence in patient care and manage risks arising from clinical care on a 
continuing basis; 
-  Review the systems of clinical governance, monitoring that they operate effectively and that 
action is being taken to address any areas of concern; 
-  Review clinical performance indicators quarterly to gain assurance; and 
- Review compliance to local Health Authority requirements and standards. 
 
The establishment of the Clinical Governance Committee was undertaken as a result of an 
appreciation of the clinical risks faced by the Group. As a result the Committee is a key aspect of the 
Group’s internal control environment.  
 
The Chair of each of the Audit Committee and the Clinical Governance Committee therefore intend 
during 2014 to consider the ways in which the two committees interact providing an overall control 
and governance framework to manage the Group’s key risks.

Remuneration Committee  
 
The Remuneration Committee consists entirely of independent non-executive directors.  Further 
details of the Remuneration Committee, its membership and its role and responsibilities, is set out in 
the Remuneration Report on pages 74 to 98. 
 
Nominations Committee 
 
The Nominations Committee has consisted entirely of independent non-executive directors during the 
year under review. The Nominations Committee members who have served during the year are:

27 June 2013 until the end of the year 
Justin Jewitt Previous Audit Committee 
Chairman 
Member of Nominations Committee from 
beginning of the year until 27 June 2013 
 
 
The Nominations Committee has a role to assist the Board in: 
 
 reviewing and making recommendations to the Board in relation to its structure, size and 
composition; 
 reviewing succession planning in place for senior management; 
 determining the appropriate skills and characteristics required of directors; identifying 
individuals qualified to become Board members and recommending such individuals to the 
Board; 
 recommending individuals to be considered for election as Directors at the next Annual 
General Meeting of the Company or to fill vacancies; and 
 preparing a description of the role and capabilities required for a particular appointment. 
 
The Committee will also undertake annual reviews of the composition of the Board and assess 
various attributes of each Board member, including reviewing annually the time required from a non-
executive director and assesses whether he or she contributes effectively and demonstrates 
commitment to the role. 
 
The Nominations Committee did not meet during 2013 but did meet early in 2014. A full senior 
management succession planning process is underway and the Committee met to consider this 
process and to ensure that a rigorous succession plan is being implemented. The Committee will 
meet further in 2014 to review progress on the succession planning implementation as well as the 
results of a board appraisal and any effect the results of that appraisal has on the structure of the 
Board. 
 
Other than in relation to specific matters which the Nominations Committee will be required to 
discuss, it is expected that the Nominations Committee will meet at least once in each financial year, 
or otherwise as requested by any member of the Committee. The Committee would expect to meet to 
consider appropriate candidates to fill any vacancy created on the Board should such a vacancy arise 
or be considered appropriate given other skills and experience on the Board. The duties and activities 
of the Committee during the year will be disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report and audited 
financial statements each year. 
 
 
  70 
 
Shareholder engagement 
The Company is committed to communicating with shareholders and stakeholders and to be available 
to meet with shareholders who require additional explanation of any matter which is of concern to 
them. 
 
The Chairman and Senior Independent Non-Executive Director are also available, either through 
contacting the Company Secretary or at the Company’s Annual General Meeting, to discuss any 
matters within their areas of responsibility or where individuals do not feel it is possible to discuss 
these matters with management.  
 
During 2013, the Company has increased its formal program of investor interaction including one-to-
one meetings with institutional investors, investor days and attendance at investor conferences. As 
part of this increasing shareholder interaction, the Company appointed a full time executive during 
2013, Mr Roy Cherry as Head of strategy and Investor Relations.  
 
 
In relation to the year ended 31 December 2013, the Company issued its half year unaudited results, 
two interim management statements and a pre-close trading update prior to entering the close period 
at the end of each of the  half year and full year periods.  
 
Aside from direct shareholder meetings, the principal ongoing communication with shareholders will 
be through the publication of the Company’s Annual report and audited financial statements, Interim 
Results and Interim Management Statements, together with the opportunity to question the Board and 
Committees at the AGM. Financial Results presentations are made available on the Company’s 
Investor Relations website. Shareholders are encouraged to attend the AGM and if unable to do so 
are encouraged to vote by proxy. The Chairman and other board members meet regularly with the 
Company’s brokers and/or other healthcare sector specialists to remain up to date with shareholder 
views and sector developments. The Chairman has also met with, or spoken to, a number of the 
Company’s principal shareholders and discussed with them their views on the Company. 
 
The Company has an investor relations section on its corporate website, www.nmc.ae. This has been, 
and will continue to be, updated regularly with information that the Company considers relevant to its 
investors. Additionally, the Company continues to communicate with the market in respect of the 
Group’s performance and prospects through the release of appropriate press announcements and 
other updates. 
 
Internal Control and risk management 
 
 Financial and operational reporting 
 
The Group has for nearly 40 years grown into a substantial business and a leader in the 
provision of private healthcare, as well as operating a substantial distribution business, in 
the United Arab Emirates. The Group is a regulated business operating many clinical and 
quality controls processes. Not unusually for a Group which was until recently a private 
business, whilst the financial and operational performance was monitored closely by the 
senior management team prior to IPO, formal written policies and governance procedures 
were not what might have been expected of a Company listed on the premium segment of 
the London Stock Exchange.  
 
As reported in the 2012 Corporate Governance report, the management team, with the 
support of the Audit Committee, has been progressively incorporating additional key internal 
controls into its financial and operational processes as part of an overall process to improve 
the Governance structure within the Group and to improve the Group’s formal internal 
control processes.  
 
The internal control environment has improved further in the year with: 
 
 The implementation of new policies and procedures covering all aspects of the 
Group’s accounting policies and controls; and 
 The Group’s internal audit function being in place for a full financial year. 
  71 
 
Other than items connected with the implementation of the Group’s new financial accounting 
system which is now due to be implemented in H1, 2014, all financial reporting procedures 
recommendations made at the time of the Company’s IPO have been implemented.  
 
The key elements of the Groups’ internal controls are as follows: 
 
- An annual budget and updated long-term forecasts for the Group that identifies risks and 
opportunities which are reviewed and approved by the Board. 
 
- A monthly executive meeting at which the senior management team review Group 
financial and operational performance, progress on capital projects and other principal 
functional areas of the business. 
 
- A system of internal monthly operational and financial reporting which includes monthly 
comparison of results and against budget and forecast, a review of KPIs, each discussed 
with additional management commentary and the reporting of key matters arising within 
the business during the month under review. The Group has a very flat organisational 
hierarchy resulting in an easy flow of information throughout the organisation structure. 
Communication of exceptional items happens naturally. 
 
- A defined process for controlling capital expenditure, including appropriate authorisation 
levels, which is monitored and approved by the Board as appropriate. 
 
- Medical Directors’ meetings to monitor clinical governance procedures. 
 
- The establishment of the Clinical Governance Committee at which the Committee, on 
behalf of the Board, independently review performance against a range of key KPIs 
based on clinical quality and safety metrics, and thus acts as mitigation against clinical 
risks.   
 
- An effective independent internal audit program which independently assists 
management in identifying key risks to the Group and monitors those risks through a 
program agreed with both management and the Audit Committee. 
 
- An appropriate approach to decentralisation within the Group. Each healthcare facility 
has a Medical Director and Head of Administration who are accountable for the operation 
of the facility. Both Healthcare and Distribution divisions are managed through 
fundamental activities of planning, executing and checking. The strategic direction of all 
operations is governed by the corporate office. All banking, treasury and payment 
processing is centralised in the Group finance function but accounting for payments is 
decentralised. The management team believes that these divisions of responsibility 
provide a natural check and balance across all internal control areas. 
 
- The delegation of authority provides that very few individuals within the organisation 
have payment approval authority. Access to cash is also restricted to very few 
individuals. All material payments are restricted to the senior management team.  
 
 Risk appetite 
 
The Senior Management Team and the Board have considered their business approach to 
risk. The Board acknowledges that elements of risk are inherent within all business 
operations and that the Group’s approach should be to encourage the exploitation by 
management of appropriate profitable business opportunities but through controlled and 
disciplined business and financial activities. 
 
The Healthcare division operates a zero tolerance policy to the taking of risk in relation to 
clinical and safety matters. The Group operates in an emerging market which means that, 
by definition, the natural risk profile of the Group’s business and financial operations is 
moderate to high. The Board’s approach in reviewing the Group’s operations is to ensure 
that this natural risk profile is not increased above this level. The Board’s governance and 
risk mitigation processes are set and operated accordingly.   72 
 
 Approach to risk mitigation 
 
As a regulated business, the Group operates within a framework of managing all elements 
of risk which arise within the Group. As a result there are a number of ways in which the 
Company monitors its keys risks. 
 
In 2012, the Company appointed Crowe Horwath as Internal Auditors to the Group. The 
Internal Auditors report directly to the Chairman of the Audit Committee but work in 
conjunction with the CFO. Their initial reports to the Audit Committee are received and 
discussed at Audit Committee meetings twice a year, in June and December. 
 
The significant risks faced by the Group were reviewed prior to the Company’s IPO and 
again by the Internal Auditors in conjunction with management towards the end of 2013.  
 
The work undertaken by the Internal Auditors, alongside the improvements undertaken in 
the formal documenting of policies and procedures and the current implementation of new IT 
systems, are the main focus of the Audit Committee as it seeks to improve the mitigation of 
risks associated with the Group’s internal control environment. 
 
The key strategic and business risks faced by the Group, the potential effect and the 
mitigation of those risks, are set out on pages 31 to 34. The consideration by the 
management team of the key risks faced by the Group is crucial to the work which will be 
undertaken by the Internal Auditors during 2014. The internal auditors have discussed with 
management, and have obtained agreement of the Audit Committee, their planned areas of 
focus during the coming financial year. 
 
Following the completion of each review, the internal auditors identify areas for remedial 
action and the required action plans are discussed and agreed with management. The 
internal auditors present the reviews and the agreed management plans for any remedies to 
the Audit Committee and then monitor the implementation of any required changes on 
behalf of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee reports to the Board on internal audit 
matters. 
 
During the year, the Clinical Governance Committee was established. Aside of financial 
risks, the Board is aware that as a significant healthcare business it is subject to a range of 
risks related to clinical care and quality. The work of the Clinical Governance Committee, 
and how it fits into the Group’s overall control environment and risk mitigation, is set out on 
page 68.   
 
 Effectiveness of Internal Controls 
 
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s systems of internal control, and on 
behalf of the Board, the Audit Committee has been engaged in the process of ensuring that 
management have established continuous processes for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the risks the Group faces. These processes include the reporting from the finance 
department on Group performance, the work of the internal auditors and issues identified by 
the external auditors to the extent covered by their audit work. The Board is responsible for 
monitoring the ongoing effectiveness of these systems and for conducting a formal annual 
review of the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls.  
 
A system of internal controls is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure 
to meet business objectives and is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, 
assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
 
In reviewing the effectiveness of the internal controls in place during the year,  the Audit 
Committee considered, amongst other matters, manual controls in place, the independence 
of the separate operating units, the delegation of authority, the balance of centralised and 
decentralised systems and the reporting process in relation to exceptional items. 
 
 
  73 
 
The Audit Committee has noted that the Group does not operate under a fully integrated 
high end IT environment and therefore an element of manual intervention is prevalent within 
the Group. The Board has approved the implementation of a new Hospital Management 
System which, together with the implementation of the new ERP financial system in the first 
half of 2014, will result in a new integrated IT system becoming fully functional during the 
2014 financial year. 
 
The Group continues to enhance its Internal Control practices and environment and as part 
of that progression have also implemented formal policies and procedures in relation to 
accounting policies and controls in 2013. 
 
The Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, has reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s 
systems of internal controls for the 2013 financial year, in light of the key elements of the 
Group’s internal controls outlined above. Given the additional internal controls that have 
been incorporated into the Group’s financial and operational reporting process, such that 
sufficient internal controls were in place to monitor the Group’s key risks, the Board 
believes, having evaluated the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, that 
these were effective during the period covered by this report. The Board also believes that 
the process undertaken by the Board and the Audit Committee to monitor the internal 
control environment, accords with the guidance provided in Internal Control: Revised 
Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code.  
 
Other governance matters 
 
Whistleblowing Policy 
A confidential whistleblowing procedure is in operation allow employees to raise concerns of possible 
improprieties in relation to either operational or financial conduct.   
 
Employees have been provided with a copy of this policy and are aware of the significance of it. New 
employees receive training on all company policies and procedures as part of their induction program. 
A copy of the policy is included on the Company’s employee intranet.    
 
Bribery Act 2010 
The Group has an Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy which applies to all directors and 
employees of all Group Companies. The Policy, which has been communicated to all employees, 
includes clear statements setting out the Group’s Anti-Bribery measures and Anti-Corruption culture. 
Practical guidance has been issued in relation to specific circumstances considered to be most 
relevant to Group employees. These include guidance notes for clinical staff attending pharmaceutical 
and training and development conferences in relation to entertainment and other possible 
inducements, as well as guidance notes in relation to the receipt of free products and equipment and 
how such products and incentives may affect clinical judgement. Specific guidance has also been 
provided in relation to the provision of sales incentives to senior sales and marketing staff within our 
Distribution division.  
 
New employees receive training on all company policies and procedures as part of their induction 
program. A copy of the policy is included on the Company’s employee intranet.

Directors’ Remuneration Report 2013 
 
 
Letter from the Remuneration Committee Chairman 
 
Dear Shareholder 
 
I am pleased to present to you our Directors’ Remuneration Report for the 2013 financial year. 
 
As shareholders may be aware, listed companies are now required to provide more detailed 
disclosures in relation to Directors’ remuneration and present such information in a different format. 
There is a requirement to set out not only the remuneration which Directors have received during the 
financial year under review, but also the Remuneration Policy which the Remuneration Committee 
(“the Committee”) will be applying in relation to future financial years. This has resulted in a change in 
format for the Directors’ Remuneration Report this year which I hope shareholders will find provides 
clarity and transparency in the way that our senior team is remunerated. 
 
Changes in Remuneration Policy  
 
The new disclosure requirements are very timely in relation to the work undertaken by the Committee 
in 2013 in relation to the implementation of the Group’s remuneration policies applicable for Executive 
Directors and Senior Management of NMC (“executives”). In the main body of this report, the 
Committee sets out its remuneration policy for executives, including the incentive plans which have 
been implemented to ensure that executives are aligned with the interests of shareholders in seeking 
to improve performance and enhance shareholder value. 
 
The principal changes which the Committee have discussed and agreed in relation to executive 
remuneration, and which are set out in the Remuneration Policy Report, are:  
 
 The implementation of a short term incentive plan (STIP) for the Executive Directors and 
other senior management for 2013. 
 
 The grant of awards under the long term incentive plan (LTIP) to Executive Directors and 
other senior management. The rules of the LTIP were approved as part of the Company’s 
IPO in 2012.  The Committee intends to make awards under this plan for this first time in 
2014.  
 
Further details of the STIP and LTIP are provided in the main part of the report.   
 
Rewarding good performance 
 
The introduction of short and long-term incentives into the executive remuneration structure reflects 
our remuneration philosophy which is to provide competitive remuneration packages which reward 
strong performance in line with the Company's strategic objectives.   
 
The use of performance based incentives, part of which is delivered in shares, seeks to align the 
interests of management with those of our shareholders and reflects market practice in the listed 
environment in which we now operate.  
 
Alignment of base pay 
 
No base pay increases were awarded to any of the Executive Directors during the 2013 financial year. 
The base pay of members of the senior management team was increased in May 2013 following a 
benchmarking exercise undertaken by the Committee during the year in conjunction with our 
remuneration consultants, Deloitte LLP. Whilst the percentage increases awarded were above the 
levels awarded more widely across the NMC group, this reflected several years of pay freeze at 
senior management level and a reflection of the increased responsibilities and complexity of roles 
undertaken by the senior management team following the Company’s IPO.    
 
  75 
 
Consultation with shareholders 
 
In addition to consulting our principal shareholders on the implementation of the new executive 
remuneration structure, I also met or spoke with several of our external shareholders to discuss the 
Committee’s new arrangements with them. I thank them for their positive support and contribution.  
 
Our first Directors’ Remuneration Report last year received a 99.99% vote in favour (and 0.01% 
voting against) for those votes validly cast, which were from 92.36% of the Company’s issued share 
capital; votes were withheld on the resolution from shareholders holding 2,275,476 Ordinary shares of 
the Company (1.23%).  
 
The Committee were delighted with both the level of shareholder voting on the report and the 
significant level of support from shareholders for our remuneration arrangements. The Committee 
sincerely hopes to receive your support for our new incentive arrangements at the AGM being held on 
26 June 2014.     
  
Finally, I would like to express my appreciation for the input of my fellow Remuneration Committee 
members during the year for their support and work to implement our new remuneration structure.

Operation  Maximum opportunity  Performance measures  
Base salary To attract and retain 
management of the calibre 
required to deliver the Group's 
strategy without paying more 
than is necessary.  
To reward executives for the 
performance of their role.  
  
Salaries are reviewed annually, with 
changes generally taking effect from 1 
June.   Salaries may be reviewed at 
different intervals if the Committee 
considers that this is appropriate. 
When setting base salaries, consideration 
is given to the following:  
 Remuneration levels at companies of 
a similar size and complexity in the 
FTSE, other UAE companies of a 
similar size and other international 
healthcare companies.                                                                                                                           
 Salary increases elsewhere in the 
Group.  
 Business and individual performance. 
 The experience of the individual. 
 The external economic climate and 
market conditions. 
 Local market practice.  
The Committee has also taken into 
account the tax treatment of salaries for 
UAE based management in setting base 
salary levels. 
While there is no maximum  
salary level, ordinarily, salary 
increases will be in line with 
increases awarded to other 
employees of the Group.   
However increases may be 
made above this level at the 
Committee's discretion to take 
account of individual 
circumstances, such as:  
 An increase in scope / 
responsibilities.  
 To reflect the individual's 
development in the role 
(e.g. for a new appointment 
where the salary may be 
increased over time rather 
than set directly at the level 
of the previous incumbent / 
market).  
 Alignment to market level. 
None, although an individual's 
performance in the role will be 
considered when reviewing base salary 
levels.   78

Benefits are set at a level which the 
Committee considers is appropriate taking 
into account:  
 Local market practice. 
 Practice at companies of a similar 
size and complexity, other UAE 
companies and other international 
healthcare companies. 
 The role and the individual's 
circumstances. 
The Group provides a range of benefits 
which reflect typical benefits offered in the 
UAE including:   
 Employee / family accommodation.

family cover).                                                                                                                  
 Life and Permanent Health Insurance 
cover.

country.                                                                      
 30 days' holiday. 
 End of service benefit.   
 Reimbursement of reasonable 
personal accommodation and travel 
costs.  
In the event that an Executive is required to re-
locate to undertake their role, the Committee 
may provide an additional reasonable level of 
benefits to reflect the relevant circumstances 
(on a one off or on-going basis).  Other benefits 
may be offered if considered appropriate and 
reasonable by the Committee.                                                                                                   
The cost of benefit provision will 
depend on the cost to the 
Company of providing individual 
items and the individual’s 
circumstances and therefore 
there is no maximum value.

allowance and pension contribution).   
 
The Company currently does not operate 
any pension arrangements, but an end of

annually in accordance with local UAE 
laws.  The Committee retains discretion to 
operate pension arrangements in the 
future

set an absolute maximum 
opportunity, the Committee will 
determine the level of benefit

Short Term 
Incentive Plan 
("Bonus Plan") 
To provide a structure to attract, 
retain and motivate senior 
executives of the calibre 
required to manage the 
business. 
 
To align the interests of senior 
executives with those of 
shareholders by linking a 
significant proportion of the 
potential remuneration to 
performance and delivery of 
strategic objectives. 
 
To provide a bonus 
arrangement which is clearly 
structured and transparent for 
senior executives and 
shareholders  
 
 
Bonus measures and performance targets 
are set annually dependent on the 
deemed strategic priorities for that year.   
                                                                      
Performance is determined by the 
Committee after the year-end based on 
performance against targets.       
 
The Remuneration Committee has the 
discretion to amend the bonus pay-out 
should the formulaic output not produce a 
result which in the view of the Committee 
fairly reflects overall performance or 
individual contribution.  
                                                                                        
Any annual bonus achieved for a financial 
year is normally paid 50% in cash and 
50% is deferred into Company shares 
which vest three years from award subject 
to continued employment.   There are no 
further performance conditions or other 
conditions which will apply to any deferred 
shares awarded (with the exception of 
continued employment).  
 
The maximum bonus 
opportunity is 100% of base 
salary. 
 
Up to 50% of the award pays 
out for target performance.  
 
Performance is based on a mix of key 
financial, operational/strategic metrics 
and individual KPIs measured over one 
financial year. 
 
At least 50% of the bonus is based on 
financial metrics. Payout against the 
operational/strategic measures and 
individual KPIs is subject to a gateway 
hurdle in relation to the level of EBITDA 
achieved.  
 
The measures that will apply for the 
financial year 2014 are described in the 
Directors' annual remuneration report.

shares) equal to the dividends paid or 
payable between the date of grant and the 
vesting of the award on the number of 
shares vested. This amount may be 
calculated assuming the reinvestment of 
these dividends into shares. 
                      
Payment of the cash element of any

The Committee may adjust or amend the 
terms of the deferred bonus awards in 
accordance with the plan rules.

Incentive Plan 
("LTIP") 
To incentivise long-term value 
creation and exceptional

the achievement of stretching 
Group financial targets.  
Awards vest based on performance 
measured over a three year period. The 
Committee may determine that a longer

The Company also operates a shareholding guideline for Executive Directors and Senior

Committee discretion  
 
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of 
office notwithstanding that they are not in line with the policy set out above where the terms of the 
payment were agreed (i) before the policy came into effect or (ii) at a time when the relevant individual 
was not a director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in 
consideration for the individual becoming a director of the Company.  For these purposes “payments” 
includes (but is not limited to) the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in 
relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are “agreed” at the time the award is 
granted. 
 
For share awards, in the event of a variation of the Company’s share capital or a demerger, delisting, 
special dividend, rights issue or other event the number of shares subject to an award and/or any 
performance condition attached to awards, may be adjusted. 
 
The Committee may amend any performance conditions applicable to the LTIP or SOP awards if an 
event occurs which causes the Committee to consider an amended performance condition would be 
more appropriate and not materially less difficult to satisfy. 
 
The Committee retains the discretion to make any payment which is not explicitly provided in this 
policy which is it obliged to make under UAE or relevant local laws. 
 
The Committee may make minor amendments to the policy set out above (for regulatory, exchange 
control, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation) without obtaining 
shareholder approval for that amendment.     
 
Selection of performance measures 
 
The performance measures for the STIP have been selected, and for the LTIP will be selected, to 
support the delivery of short and long term performance of the business and shareholder value 
creation.  Targets are set each year based on stretching internal budgets as well as those financial 
and operational areas which the Committee feel are key to business performance; achieving or 
exceeding these targets will both return value to shareholders and reward the executive team for 
delivery.  
 
The performance measures selected by the Committee may change from time to time to reflect any 
shift in Group Strategy, for example from a growth strategy to a consolidation strategy. 
 
Remuneration arrangements throughout the Group 
 
Remuneration philosophy is the same throughout NMC – that individuals should be remunerated 
based on their role, responsibilities, experiences and local market practice.  NMC has a variety of 
different roles from senior executives, to doctors to administrators and therefore remuneration levels 
and structures vary to reflect the different requirements and expectations of these roles.   
 
The Committee does consider that it is important, however, that senior executives are all remunerated 
in a similar way to ensure that they are incentivised to collectively deliver the Group’s strategy and 
create value for shareholders.  Executive Directors and senior managers will therefore all participate 
in the annual bonus plan and LTIP on principally the same basis for 2014. 
 
The Committee has retained the existing benefits structure which applied to UAE based Executive 
Directors and Senior Management before the Company’s IPO in April 2012.  A similar benefit 
structure is operated throughout the organisation.  The benefits included reflect the expatriate nature 
of senior management in the UAE and are similar in nature to the types of benefits which are  84 
 
available to other expatriate employees in the Group. The benefits include private medical insurance, 
which is mandatory for employees in Abu Dhabi, where the Group is based.  
 
Remuneration outcomes in different performance scenarios 
 
The Committee has set a remuneration structure which ensures that a high proportion of the potential 
total reward available for Executive Directors and senior management is related to the performance of 
the Company. 
 
To demonstrate this three scenarios have been illustrated below for each Executive Director.  These 
are based on STIP and LTIP awards of 75% of base salary. 
 
Minimum    
 Fixed pay 
 No STIP pay out 
 No vesting under the LTIP 
Mid performance  
 Fixed pay  
 50% of maximum STIP opportunity  
 25% of LTIP shares vest at threshold performance.

Remuneration policy on recruitment 
 
When determining the remuneration package for a newly appointed Executive Director, the 
Committee would seek to apply the following principles:  
 
 The package should be market competitive to facilitate the recruitment of individuals of sufficient 
calibre to lead the business. At the same time, the Committee would intend to pay no more than it 
believes is necessary to secure the required talent.  
 
 The structure of the on-going remuneration package would normally include the components set 
out in the policy table for Executive Directors. 
 
 In addition, the Committee has discretion to include any other remuneration component or award 
which it feels is appropriate taking into account the specific commercial circumstances, and 
subject to the limit on variable remuneration set out below. The key terms and rationale for any 
such component would be appropriately disclosed. 
 
 Where an individual forfeits outstanding variable pay opportunities or contractual rights at a 
previous employer as a result of appointment, the Committee may offer compensatory payments 
or awards, in such form as the Committee considers appropriate taking into account all relevant 
factors including the form of awards, expected value and vesting timeframe of forfeited 
opportunities.  When determining such ‘buy-out’ the guiding principle would be that awards would 
generally be on a ‘like for like’ basis to those forfeited, unless this was not considered appropriate 
in the particular circumstances, and that the ‘buy-out’ package would be an appropriate reflection 
of the value forfeited.   
 
 The maximum level of variable remuneration which may be awarded (excluding any 
compensatory payments or awards referred to above) is 200% of salary.  
 
 Where an Executive Director is required to re-locate to take-up their role the Committee may 
provide reasonable assistance with re-location (either via one-off or on-going payments or 
benefits). 
 
 In the event that an internal candidate was promoted to the Board legacy terms and conditions 
would normally be honoured, including pension entitlements and any outstanding incentive 
awards.   
  86 
 
To facilitate awards outlined above, the Committee may make awards under company incentive plans 
or other available structures as appropriate, including using listing rule 9.4.2 for the purpose of making 
“buy-out” awards.   
 
The remuneration package for a newly appointed non-executive director would normally be in line 
with the structure set out in the policy table for Non-Executive Directors.  Remuneration for new hires 
may be paid in the form of cash or shares.   
 
Executive Director service contracts  
 
Dr B R Shetty is employed by NMC Healthcare LLC pursuant to a service agreement dated 19 March 
2012. The service agreement provides for an indefinite term of employment unless terminated earlier 
in accordance with the terms of the service agreement. The service agreement may be terminated on 
twelve months’ prior written notice given by either Dr B R Shetty or NMC Healthcare LLC.  
 
Mr Khalifa Bin Butti is employed by NMC Healthcare LLC pursuant to a service agreement dated 19 
March 2012. The service agreement provides for an indefinite term of employment unless terminated 
earlier in accordance with the terms of the service agreement. The service agreement may be 
terminated on twelve months’ prior written notice given by either Mr Khalifa Bin Butti or NMC 
Healthcare LLC.  
 
Copies of the above Service Agreements are available for inspection during normal business hours at 
the Company’s Registered Office, and are available for inspection at the Company’s annual general 
meeting. 
 
For future executives the Committee policy is that notice periods will not exceed 12 months. There are 
no matters for which the Company requires approval of shareholders for the purposes of Chapter 4A 
of Part 10 of the Companies Act 2006.

On termination without notice, Executive Directors may be entitled to compensation based 
on what would be earned by way of salary and other contractual benefits (including 
retirement benefits) over the notice period. 
STIP  There is no automatic entitlement to an annual 
bonus.  
Executive Directors may receive a bonus in 
respect of the financial year of cessation. This 
payment will normally be pro-rated for time and 
subject to performance, however the Committee 
retains the discretion to review overall business 
and individual performance and determine that a 
different level of bonus payment is appropriate. 
In certain circumstances, the Committee 
may determine that a bonus payment 
may be due to reflect performance and 
contribution to the point of cessation.  
Deferred bonus 
plan 
[Plan terms to be 
determined] 
Awards would normally continue to vest at the 
end of the normal deferral period.  The 
Committee may determine, in appropriate 
circumstances, that awards should vest at 
cessation of employment.   
Awards would normally lapse.

Long-term 
incentive plan 
(“LTIP”) 
Awards may vest at a level determined by the 
Committee taking into account the extent to 
which the performance conditions have been 
met and the time elapsed since grant, unless the 
Committee determines otherwise. 
Awards will normally carry on to the normal 
vesting date except in the case of death where 
awards may vest immediately.  The Committee 
may determine that awards should vest at 
cessation of employment. 
Awards in the form of nil cost options may be 
exercised for a period of 6 months from vesting 
(12 months in the cases of death).  Participants 
have 6 months from cessation to exercise 
vested awards (12 months in the case of death). 
The Committee may allow alternative exercise 
windows if it considers it appropriate. 
Awards will lapse.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Share option

Options may vest at a level determined by the 
Committee taking into account the extent to 
which the performance conditions have been 
met and the time elapsed since grant, unless the 
Committee determines otherwise. 
Options vesting will normally carry on to the 
normal vesting date except in the case of death 
where awards may vest immediately.  The 
Committee may determine that awards should 
vest at cessation of employment. 
Options may be exercised for a period of 6 
months from vesting (12 months in the case of 
death).  Participants have 6 months from 
cessation to exercise vested awards (12 months 
in the case of death). 
Unvested awards will lapse.   
 
Vested options may be exercised for 6 
months from the date of cessation. 
 
 
 
 
Change of control  
 
On a change of control, awards under the LTIP and SOP would normally vest to the extent that the 
performance conditions are satisfied at the date of the event. Any early vesting would generally be on 
a time pro-rata basis. 
 
The Committee may vary the level of vesting, if it believes that exceptional circumstances warrant 
this, taking into account any other factors it believes to be relevant in deciding to what extent an 
award will vest.  
 
The Executive Directors may exchange their awards over Company shares for awards in shares of 
the acquiring company if the terms of the offer allow this.   
 
Deferred bonus shares will normally vest in full upon a change of control. 
 
In the event of a winding-up of the Company, demerger, delisting, special dividend or other event 
which in the opinion of the Committee may affect the current or future share price, the Committee may 
allow LTIP, SOP and deferred bonus awards to vest on the same basis as set out above.

The remuneration of Non-Executive 
Directors is approved by the 
Executive Directors following 
recommendations and discussions 
with the Chairman of the Company 
and the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee.  
 
Fees are structured as follows:  
 
 The Chairman is paid a single, 
consolidated fee. 
 The Non-Executive Directors 
are paid a basic fee, plus 
additional fees for the Senior 
Independent Director. 
 
Fees are paid in cash with local 
taxes deducted at source.  
 
 
Non-Executive Directors are also 
reimbursed for travel and 
reasonable personal expenses. 
 
Non-Executive Directors do not 
currently receive any benefits.  
However, benefits may be provided 
in the future if this was considered 
appropriate.  
The maximum level of Non-
Executive Director remuneration is 
set out in the Company’s articles of 
association.  This may be amended 
from time to time subject to 
shareholder approval. 
  
Fees are set at a level which reflect 
the commitment and contribution 
that is expected from the Chairman 
and Non-Executive Directors and 
that are appropriately positioned 
against comparable roles in 
companies of a similar size and 
complexity. 
 
Fee levels are disclosed in the 
Directors' remuneration report for 
the relevant financial year.  
 
 
Additional fees may be payable to 
Non-Executive Directors from time 
to time for additional board 
responsibilities (e.g. Committee 
Chairmanship).  Additional fees 
may also be paid where the time 
commitment in a particular year 
was significantly more than 
anticipated.    
 
Terms and conditions for Non-Executive Directors  
 
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service agreements with the Company, but instead all have 
letters of appointment. The appointment of each of the Non-Executive Directors is stated for an initial 
term until the next annual general meeting of the Company at which, and at subsequent annual 
general meetings, they need to submit themselves for re-election if they so wish. Each of the Non-
Executive Directors have a minimum time commitment that they need to give to the Company in any 
year. 
 
The letters of appointment for each Non-Executive Director are summarised below:

Shareholder views and consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the 
Group  
 
Communication with our Shareholders - The Committee maintains an open dialogue with our 
shareholders and seeks their views when any significant changes are made to remuneration 
arrangements. The Committee met or spoke with several of our external shareholders to discuss the 
Committee’s new arrangements this year.  
 
Consideration of pay and conditions of employees - The Committee considers pay information in 
relation to doctor and support staff when determining executive pay, to ensure that pay structures are 
appropriately aligned. The Committee did not consult with employees when setting executive director 
pay.

Annual Remuneration Report 
 
Some of the  information contained in the Annual Remuneration Report is subject to audit.  Where the 
information is subject to audit this is identified in the relevant heading. 
 
How executive remuneration policy will be applied in 2014 
 
Base salaries for 2014  
 
Executive Directors base salaries are as follows: 
 
CEO – Dr BR Shetty $408,400 
Executive Chairman – Mr Khalifa Bin Butti $245,000 
 
No salary increases have been awarded from 2013 salaries although a review is scheduled for June 
2014. 
 
Operation of the annual bonus plan for 2014  
 
The operation of the annual bonus for 2014 will be consistent with the policy detailed in the 
remuneration policy section.  The maximum award level will be 100% of base salary. 
 
The performance targets that will apply for the annual bonus for 2014 have yet to be considered and 
determined by the Committee. However the committee’s current view is that the performance 
measures will include a gateway hurdle in relation to the level of EBITDA achieved. 
 
Operation of the LTIP for 2014  
 
The operation of the LTIP for 2014 will be consistent with the policy detailed in the remuneration 
policy section.  The maximum award level will be 100% of base salary. 
 
The performance targets that will apply to the awards have yet to be finalised and determined by the 
Committee. However, the Committee’s current view is that the performance measures will likely be 
based principally on Earnings Per Share and Total Shareholder Return metrics over a three year 
period.

Bonus – subject to audit 
 
A bonus of 56.3% of base salary, out of a potential maximum entitlement of 75% of base salary set for the 2013 financial year, was paid in respect of that 
year to the CEO and Executive Vice Chairman.  The bonus was based on the following performance measures: 
 
Measure Percentage 
Weighting  
Performance Outcome 
EBITDA 50% 
 
EBITDA performance for the year was US$92.9m 
representing a growth of 16.7% on 2012. This strong 
performance exceeded the relevant EBITDA targets 
set by the Committee and therefore this portion of the 
bonus paid out in full. 
 
50%  92 
 
Progress on capital development 
projects 
12.5% The Committee considered that sufficient progress on 
capital development projects was not achieved, with a 
number of the projects being significantly delayed. 
0% 
Performance against clinical care 
KPIs 
25.0% Maximum performance was achieved in relation to the 
4-5 KPIs monitored by each of the Group’s Specialty 
Hospitals under the terms of their JCI accreditation. 
JCI accreditation sets standards that all monitored 
KPIs must be achieved to the extent of 90% over the 
course of the review period. Group performance was 
well in excess of this target.   
25% 
Doctor recruitment targets 12.5% The targets set for the recruitment of new Doctors to 
the Group was not met in 2013 as a result of a number 
of expected new facility openings not being achieved. 
0% 
 
Half of the bonus paid to the Executive Directors is deferred into shares, for which additional performance conditions or other conditions, with exception of 
continued employment, do not apply. 
 
There was no bonus plan in operation for 2012. 
 
Long-term incentive plans – subject to audit 
 
There were no long-term incentive plan awards which were due to vest in respect of performance in 2012 and 2013. 
 
Pension – subject to audit 
 
There were no pension contributions in 2012 or 2013.

interest over 14,072,024 Ordinary shares of the Company (14,072,024 Ordinary shares as at 1 January 
2013) held by Infinite Investment LLC, a company which is owned jointly by H.E. Saeed Bin Butti and Mr 
Khalifa Bin Butti. 
 
H.E. Saeed Bin Butti resigned as a Director of the company on 24 February 2014. 
 
None of the Directors of the Company held any form of option over the shares of the Company during the 
year ended 31 December 2013. 
 
None of the Directors received any loans, advances or other form of credit granted by the Company, nor 
were any guarantees of any kind provided by the Company on behalf of any Directors during the year 
ended 31 December 2013. 
 
There have been no changes in the above shareholdings between 31 December 2013 and the date of this 
Directors’ Remuneration Report.  
 
Executive directors are required to build a shareholding of 200% of base salary.  Both the CEO and the 
Executive Vice Chairman are significant shareholders in the Company and therefore meet this 
requirement.

Note: The performance graph shows the Total Shareholder Return performance of the Company from the

The Committee believes that the FTSE 250 Index is an appropriate comparator index used to compare 
performance given that the Company is a constituent of this Index and the lack of direct competitor 
comparators available in the London market. 
 
The table below summarises the CEO's single figure for total remuneration since listing.  This table is also 
required to show the annual bonus and long-term incentive vesting as a percentage of the maximum for 
each year, however, there was no bonus or LTIP vesting in any of the years under consideration.

How remuneration policy will be applied for 2014 
 
For 2014, the fees payable to the non-executive directors effective as at 1
 
January 2014 are as follows: 
  
 (£’000) 
Chairman 170 
Senior Independent Director 60 
Non-executive director 50 
 
Additional fees may be also payable to non-executive directors from time to time for additional board 
responsibilities (this may include fees for additional time commitments). 
 
No additional fees are payable in relation to the Chairmanship or membership of any Board Committees.  
 
Details of the remuneration paid to each of the non-executive directors who served during the year are 
included in the table on page 95. 
 
Non-executive directors do not participate in any bonus or incentive plan or other form or performance-
related remuneration. The Company does not provide any contribution to their pension arrangements. 
 
What remuneration was paid in 2013 (single pay figure) – subject to audit 
 
The fee paid in cash to each Non-Executive Director during the year ended 31 December 2013 is set out

Notes: 
1. Each of the independent non-executive directors  is contracted for 16 days per annum with the exception of the Chairman 
who is contracted for 24 days per annum. Each of the Non-Executive Directors has spent more time than originally 
anticipated within the Letters of Appointment by which they were appointed. This  is because of time spent supporting the 
business in enhancing the Governance processes and improving the Group’s internal control environment which the 
Board, including the Non-Executive Directors, retain oversight over. As recognition for this, the Executive Directors agreed 
additional payments for each of the 2012 and 2013 financial years, both of which have been made in the 2013 financial 
year. An additional payment of £30,000 was made to Mr Tompkins, Lord Clanwilliam and Mrs Lawrence in relation to the 
2012 financial year and £24,465 in relation to the 2013 financial year. Whilst these amounts are in relation to additional 
time spent over two financial years, they were both paid in the 2013 financial year and are therefore consolidated with the 
normal fees payable for 2013 in the table above.  
  96 
 
2. In addition to the fees paid to Mr Justin Jewitt shown in the table above, an amount of £66,500 was paid to Mr Justin Jewitt 
after he ceased to be a director of the Company on 27 June 2013. The letter of appointment for each of the non-executive 
directors includes a provision for 3 months’ notice being required on the termination of the appointment. The additional 
payment made to Mr Jewitt was in recognition of time additional to his contractual requirement, defined in his letter of 
appointment as 16 days per annum, being provided by Mr Jewitt in the busy first year for the non-executive directors after 
the Company’s listing on the London Stock Exchange.  
 
The Remuneration Committee 
 
Membership 
 
The Remuneration Committee consists of four Independent Non-Executive Directors, with an Independent 
Non-Executive Director holding the chairmanship of the Committee. During the 2013 financial year, the 
following have served as members of the Committee: 
 
Chairman: Lord Clanwilliam  
Committee members: Jonathan Bomford (from 27 June 2013) 
 Justin Jewitt (until 27 June 2013) 
 Heather Lawrence  
 H J Mark Tompkins  
 
Whilst they do not attend Remuneration Committee meetings, the Chairman of the Committee discussed 
proposed remuneration policies with the Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice Chairman during 
their formulation. It is worth noting that the shareholdings of the Chief Executive Officer and the Executive 
Vice Chairman are large enough to form a majority veto on any remuneration proposals so their input and 
encouragement has been vital in the remuneration process.   
 
The Group Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Remuneration Committee and provides advice to 
the Committee on Corporate Governance aspects relating to remuneration matters. He also provides 
assistance to the Chairman of the Committee as required in discussions with the Remuneration 
Committee advisers and on implementation of Committee decisions. The Group Company Secretary is 
not present when his own remuneration is discussed. 
 
Role and responsibility 
 
The Remuneration Committee assists the Board in 
 
 making recommendations to the Board on the Company’s framework of executive remuneration, 
including the use of incentive arrangements within that framework;  
 
and 
 
 determining on the Board's behalf the entire individual remuneration packages for each Executive 
Director, the Chairman and the senior management team. 
 
All other recommendations must be referred to the Board for approval. In setting remuneration for senior 
management, the Committee has considered market practice in the UAE and are aware of remuneration 
structures existing for employees who are below senior management level. The Committee understands 
the need to incentivise executives appropriately, whilst ensuring that higher rewards are only achieved for 
exceptional performance. 
 
No committee member is permitted to participate in any discussion or decision regarding his/her own 
remuneration. Neither of the Executive Directors attend meetings of the Committee. The remuneration of 
non-executive directors is a matter for consideration by the Chairman of the Company, assisted by the 
Remuneration Committee Chairman, and the Executive Directors.  
 
The Remuneration Committee terms of reference clearly set out its authority and duties and were 
approved by the Board prior to IPO. The terms of reference are available on the Investor Relations section 
of the Group’s website at www.nmc.ae, or by contacting the Group Company Secretary.   
 
Support and External Advice 
 
The Remuneration Committee seeks and considers advice from Deloitte LLP, independent remuneration 
advisers. Deloitte provides no other advisory role to the Group. Deloitte acted as advisors to the Company  97 
 
in advance of the Company’s IPO in April 2012, but were formally appointed by the Committee as 
advisors to the Committee later in 2012 specifically to provide the Committee with objective and 
independent advice on executive remuneration matters. Deloitte is a member of the Remuneration 
Consultants’ Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under the code of conduct in relation to executive 
remuneration consulting in the UK. The Committee is satisfied that the advice they have received from 
Deloitte during the year has been objective and independent.  
 
The Chairman has direct access to Deloitte as and when required. The Group Company Secretary liaises 
with Deloitte as required to ensure that all Committee requests and decisions are dealt with and 
implemented, but does so under the guidance of the Remuneration Committee Chairman. Deloitte attend 
meetings of the Committee as required. 
 
During the year, Deloitte provided the following services and advice to the Committee: 
 
 Market practice in relation to remuneration practices prevalent within similar sized listed and 
private groups; 
 a review of the previous remuneration policies existing in relation to the Executive Directors and 
senior management; 
 a base salary benchmarking exercise against companies of a similar size and complexity, taking 
account of the tax regime prevalent in the UK and UAE; and 
 provided advice as to the structure of the new short term bonus plan and long term incentive plan, 
and the targets relating thereto. 
 
Deloitte received fees of £38k (charged on a time plus expenses basis) for advice received during the 
year. 
 
Meetings 
 
The Remuneration Committee met formally three times during the period under review, in addition to a 
number of discussions held informally during the year whilst the structure and implementation of the new 
incentive arrangements were being discussed.  
 
The primary matter for discussion was the implementation of a new STIP which would be put in place for 
Executive Directors and senior management. Discussion at the initial meetings during the year focused on 
the structure of the new incentive plans, with advice from Deloitte as to market practice and expectations.  
 
The Remuneration Committee also discussed basic salary levels for senior management following the 
benchmarking exercise undertaken by Deloitte. The Remuneration Committee decided not to increase the 
basic salary of either of the Executive Directors, but the salaries for the four members of the senior 
management team in place at that time were increased by an average of 14% to bring them into line with 
median salaries payable for similar roles within a comparator group of companies. 
 
Assessment of risk and key priorities 
 
The Committee is aware of the need to be mindful of potential risks associated with elements of executive 
remuneration. The Committee is keen to ensure that variable remuneration is not structured in such a way 
as to encourage the taking of undue business risks for the purposes of achieving higher remuneration.  
 
All the members of the Remuneration Committee are also members of, or normally attend meetings of, 
the Audit Committee and, as a result, are aware of the key risks and challenges faced by the Group. 
 
The new remuneration structure has been implemented to ensure an appropriate reward system is in 
place, but considers that the new incentive structure mitigates key business risks as follows: 
 
 the deferral of 50% of STIP awards into shares for a three year period. The introduction of an 
LTIP in 2014 will also encourage focus on long term share value enhancement; 
 the STIP includes two financial measures and three operational measures which the Committee 
believe are key to the success of the Company in a particular financial year; 
 market practice malus and clawback provisions allow the Company to forfeit the delivery of share 
related benefits to plan participants. 
 
External commitments 
 
The Chairman holds a Non-Executive role on the Board. Whilst he has other business interests, these are 
not considered material enough to interfere or conflict with his duties to the NMC Group.   98 
 
 
The Board acknowledges that each of the Executive Directors also have interests as directors and/or 
shareholders of other businesses outside of the NMC Group. The Board believes that such interests do 
not interfere, or conflict, with the role which either Executive Director has with the NMC Group. 
 
The other Directors are required to spend a specific amount of time performing their duties as Non-
Executive Directors and none have significant other external commitments which interfere, or conflict, with 
their duties to the NMC Group.  
 
 
It is my pleasure to submit this report to shareholders. The Directors’ Remuneration Report has been 
approved by the Board and is signed on its behalf by:

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF NMC HEALTH PLC 
 
We have audited the group financial statements of NMC Health plc for the year ended 31 December 2013 
which comprise the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of 
financial position, the consolidated statement of changes in equity, the consolidated statement of cash 
flows and the related notes 1 to 34. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union.  
 
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 
of the Companies Act 2006.  Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.  
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.   
 
 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor  
 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on pages 54 to 55, the 
directors are responsible for the preparation of the group financial statements and for being satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the group financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.  
 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements  
  
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements 
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, 
whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information 
in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to 
identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.  
 
Opinion on financial statements  
 
In our opinion the group financial statements:  
 give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as at 31 December 2013 and of its profit 
for the year then ended;  
 have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and  
 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 
4 of the IAS Regulation.  
 
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement  
 
We identified the following risks that have had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy; the 
allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team: 
 
 The valuation of trade receivables 
 Revenue recognition, including the timing of revenue recognition and the determination of 
whether the Group is acting in the capacity of an agent rather than principal; and 
 The capitalisation of costs into capital work in progress. 
 
   
Our application of materiality  
 
We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing our audit, and in evaluating 
the effect of misstatements on our audit and on the financial statements. For the purposes of 
determining whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement, we define 
materiality as the magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the  101 
 
aggregate, in light of the surrounding circumstances, could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. We also determine a level of 
performance materiality which we use to determine the extent of testing needed to reduce to an 
appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected 
misstatements exceeds materiality for the financial statements as a whole. 
When establishing our overall audit strategy, we determined a magnitude of uncorrected 
misstatements that we judged would be material for the financial statements as a whole. We 
determined materiality for the Group to be $3.60 million (2012: $2.48 million), which is 
approximately 5% (2012: 4%) of adjusted profit before tax. We used adjusted profit before tax to 
exclude the non-recurring write-off of unamortised finance fees resulting from the refinance of 
loan facilities in the year. This provided a basis for determining the nature, timing and extent of 
risk assessment procedures, identifying and assessing the risk of material misstatement and 
determining the nature, timing and extent of further audit procedures. 
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall 
control environment, our judgement was that overall performance materiality (ie: our tolerance 
for misstatement in an individual account or balance) for the Group should be 50% (2012: 50%) 
of materiality, namely $1.80 million (2012: $1.24 million). Our objective in adopting this approach 
was to ensure that total detected and undetected audit differences in all accounts did not exceed 
our materiality level. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Audit Committee all audit 
differences in excess of $0.16 million (2012: $0.12 million). We also agreed to report differences 
below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
 
An overview of the scope of our audit  
 
Following our assessment of the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements 
we selected eight components which account for 95% of the group’s profit before tax and 97% 
of the group’s total assets. Six of these components were subject to a full audit, whilst one 
component was subject to a partial audit where the extent of audit work was based on our 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement and one component was subject to analytical 
review procedures. They were also selected to provide an appropriate basis for undertaking 
audit work to address the risks of material misstatement identified above. 
The audit work at the eight components and the statutory audits were executed at levels of 
materiality applicable to each individual entity which were much lower than Group materiality. 
Given that the Group operates solely in the United Arab Emirates the Senior Statutory Auditor 
visited the United Arab Emirates three times during the current year audit process. The Group 
audit team interacts regularly with the component team in the United Arab Emirates where 
appropriate during the various stages of the audit, reviewed key working papers and were 
responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process. 
Our response to the risks identified above was as follows: 
Valuation of trade receivables 
We challenged management on the significant estimation and subjectivity involved in the 
appropriateness of provisions for bad debts which included obtaining evidence to support the 
recoverability of the older un-provided debts. We obtained direct external confirmations for a 
sample of customer receivable balances and we vouched post year end cash receipts for a 
sample of year-end trade receivable balances.  
Revenue recognition, including the timing of revenue recognition and the determination 
of whether the Group is acting in the capacity of an agent rather than principal   102 
 
We relied upon testing relating to controls over revenue recognition, including the timing of 
revenue recognition. We performed analytical procedures and cut-off testing procedures to 
check that revenue had been recognised in the appropriate accounting period. We tested a 
sample of new revenue agreements entered into during the year. We checked the Group’s 
adherence to their revenue recognition policies, including their determination of whether the 
Group is acting as an agent rather than as a principal, to agree that these policies are in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. 
Capitalisation of costs into capital work in progress 
We vouched the majority of additions to capital work in progress in the year to supporting 
documentation to check that the costs met the criteria for capitalisation into work in progress. 
We also held discussions with the project managers on major capital projects.  
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006  
 
In our opinion the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year 
for which the group financial statements are prepared is consistent with the group financial statements.  
 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception  
 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:  
 
Under the ISAs (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the 
annual report is:  
 materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or  
 apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the 
Group acquired in the course of performing our audit; or  
 is otherwise misleading.  
 
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our 
knowledge acquired during the audit and the directors’ statement that they consider the annual report is 
fair, balanced and understandable and whether the annual report appropriately discloses those matters 
that we communicated to the audit committee which we consider should have been disclosed.  
 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:  
 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or  
 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.  
 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:  
 the directors’ statement, set out on page 54, in relation to going concern; and  
 the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the company’s compliance with the 
nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.  
 
Other matter  
 
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of NMC Health plc for the year 
ended 31 December 2013 and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described 
as having been audited.

Notes: 
1. The maintenance and integrity of the NMC Health plc website is the responsibility of the directors; 
the work carried out by the auditors does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the 
auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the financial statements since 
they were initially presented on the web site.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
At 31 December 2013 
 
 
1 CORPORATE INFORMATION 
 
NMC Health plc (the “Company” or “Parent’’) is a Company which was incorporated in England and Wales 
on 20 July 2011. The Company is a public limited company operating solely in the United Arab Emirates 
(“UAE”).  The address of the registered office of the Company is Suite 23 Hanover Square London, W1S 
1JB.  The registered number of the Company is 7712220. There is no ultimate controlling party. 
 
The Company completed its Premium Listing on the London Stock Exchange on 5 April 2012. 
 
The Parent and its subsidiaries (collectively the “Group”) are engaged in providing professional medical 
services, wholesale of pharmaceutical goods, medical equipment, cosmetics, food and IT products and 
services in the United Arab Emirates. 
 
The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2013 were 
authorised for issue by the board of directors on 24 February 2014 and the consolidated statement of 
financial position was signed on the Board’s behalf by Dr B. R. Shetty and Mr Khalifa Bin Butti. 
 
 
2.1 BASIS OF PREPARATION 
 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union as they apply to the financial statements of the Group 
for the year ended 31 December 2013 and applied in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.  
 
The consolidated financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, except for 
derivative financial instruments that have been measured at fair value.  The principal accounting policies 
adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies 
have been consistently applied to all periods presented. 
 
Functional and reporting currency 
The functional currency of the Company and its subsidiaries is UAE Dirham. The reporting currency of the 
Group is United States of America Dollar (US$) as this is a more globally recognised currency. The UAE 
Dirham is pegged against the US Dollar at a rate of 3.673 per US Dollar. 
 
All values are rounded to the nearest thousand dollars ($000) except when otherwise indicated. 
 
Going concern 
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position are set out in the Strategic Review on pages 8 to 43. The financial position of 
the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial Review 
on pages 27 to 30. 
 
The directors have undertaken an assessment of the future prospects of the Group and the wider risks 
that the Group is exposed to. In its assessment of whether the Group should adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing its financial statements, the directors have considered the adequacy of financial 
resources in order to manage its business risks successfully, together with other areas of potential risk 
such as regulatory, insurance and legal risks.

NMC Health plc 
  
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
At 31 December 2013 
  
 
2.1 BASIS OF PREPARATION continued 
 
The Group has banking arrangements through a spread of local and international banking groups and 
utilizes short and medium term working capital facilities to optimise business funding. Debt covenants are 
reviewed by the board each month. The Board believes that the level of cash in the Group, the spread of 
bankers and debt facilities mitigates the financing risks that the Group faces from both its capital 
expenditure program and in relation to working capital requirements. 
 
Both the Healthcare and Distribution divisions have continued their positive growth trends and all major 
financial and non-financial KPIs showed good improvement during 2013. The directors have reviewed the 
business plan for 2014 and the five year cash flow, together with growth forecasts for the healthcare 
sector in UAE. The directors consider the Group’s future forecasts to be reasonable.  
  
The directors have not identified any other matters that may impact the viability of the Group in the 
medium term and therefore they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated 
financial statements. 
 
Comparative information 
 
Reclassifications 
 
The Group has made following reclassifications in respect of the comparatives to conform to the current 
period presentation. These reclassifications are made to correct the presentation of the consolidated 
financial statements. 
 
 Amounts of US$ 1,746,000 as of 31 December 2012 and US$ 1,161,000 as of 31 December 
2011 in respect of employees’ end of service benefits have been reclassified from non-current 
liabilities to current liabilities (note 26).   
 An amount of U$ 3,402,000 in respect of flotation costs has been reclassified from financing 
activities to operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. 
 
These reclassifications have no impact on previously reported equity or profit of the Group. 
 
2.2 BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION 
 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains 
control, and continue to be consolidated until the date when such control ceases. The financial statements 
of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the Parent, using consistent accounting 
policies. All intra-group balances, transactions, unrealised gains and losses resulting from intra-group 
transactions and dividends are eliminated in full.  
 
Total comprehensive income within a subsidiary is attributed to the non-controlling interest even if that 
results in a deficit balance. Non-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets 
not held by the Group and are presented separately in the statement of comprehensive income and within 
equity in the consolidated statement of financial position, separately from shareholders’ equity. 
 
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity 
transaction.  
 
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, a gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss and is 
calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of consideration received and the 
fair value of any retained interest and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), 
and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests.

2.3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES  
 
The key assumptions concerning the future, key sources of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements 
at the reporting date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below: 
 
Significant estimates 
 
Impairment of inventories 
Inventories are held at the lower of cost and net realisable value. When inventories become old or 
obsolete, an estimate is made of their net realisable value. For individually significant amounts this 
estimation is performed on an individual basis. Amounts which are not individually significant, but which 
are old or obsolete, are assessed collectively and a provision applied according to the inventory type and 
the Group’s policy for inventory provisioning. The gross carrying amount of inventories at 31 December 
2013 was US$ 94,839,000 (2012: US$ 72,574,000) and the provision for old and obsolete items at 
31 December 2013 was US$ 716,000 (2012: US$ 116,000).  
 
Impairment of accounts receivable  
An estimate of the collectible amount of trade accounts receivable is made when collection of the full 
amount is no longer probable.  For individually significant amounts, this estimation is performed on an 
individual basis.  Amounts which are not individually significant, but which are past due, are assessed 
collectively and a provision applied according to the length of time past due, based on historical recovery 
rates.

NMC Health plc 
  
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
At 31 December 2013 
 
2.3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES continued 
 
A majority of the receivables that are past due but not impaired are from insurance companies and 
government-linked entities in the United Arab Emirates which are inherently slow payers due to their long 
invoice verification and approval of payment procedures. Payments continue to be received from these 
customers and accordingly the risk of non-recoverability is considered to be low. 
 
Gross trade accounts receivable at 31 December 2013 were US$ 154,234,000 (2012: US$ 164,907,000) 
and the provision for doubtful debts at 31 December 2013 was US$ 8,241,000 (2012: US$ 6,444,000).  
Any difference between the amounts actually collected in future periods and the amounts expected will be 
recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
 
Significant judgements 
 
Functional currency 
The UAE Dirham is determined to be the functional currency of the Company. 
 
Judgement has been used to determine the functional currency of the Company that most appropriately 
represents the economic effects of the Company’s transactions, events and conditions.  
 
The primary economic environment influencing the Company’s income (dividends) is the UAE and the 
effect of the local environment is limited to expenses incurred within the UK. The ability of the Company to 
meet its obligations and pay dividends to its shareholders is dependent on the economy of, and the 
operation of its subsidiaries in, the UAE.  
 
Refinancing of JP Morgan loan 
Judgement has been used to determine that the terms and conditions of the new JP Morgan syndicated 
loan are substantially different from the previous loan and accordingly the previous JP Morgan syndicated 
loan has been derecognised (note 25). Management used the following basis for determining that the 
terms and conditions are substantially different: 
 
 The principal amount of the loan changed from US$ 150 million to US$ 225 million 
 The interest risk profile on the loan changed as the interest rate decreased from 3.5% plus margin 
to 3% plus margin. 
 The securities and guarantees of the loan changed as the personal guarantees of shareholders 
have been removed in the new loan. 
 The loan covenants changed; and 
 The repayment terms changed as the new loan had an initial repayment grace period of six 
months. 
Assets held in the name of the previous shareholder 
In accordance with local laws, except in some specific locations in the UAE the registered title of land and 
buildings must be held in the name of a UAE national. As a result, land and buildings of the Group are 
legally registered in the name of shareholders or previous shareholders of the Group. As at 31 December 
2013 certain land and buildings with a carrying amount of US$ 9,648,000 (2012: US$ 9,974,000) are held 
in the name of a previous shareholder for the beneficial interest of the Group. As the beneficial interest of 
such land and buildings resides with the Group, these assets are recorded within land and buildings in the 
Group consolidated financial statements. The directors take into account this local legal registration 
requirement, the Group's entitlement to the beneficial interest arising from these assets, as well as other 
general business factors, when considering whether such assets are impaired.  
 
Leases for buildings and land  
Generally our hospitals, day patient medical centres and hospital projects under development are located 
on land and in buildings which are leased. As at 31 December 2013, the majority of the lease periods 
range from five to twenty years apart from the leases for New Medical Centre Hospital LLC-Dubai (‘Dubai 
General Hospital) the land on which the Khalifa City Specialty Hospital is being constructed and the 
warehouse facilities, which had leases which are renewable on an annual basis with a total value of US$

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

2.3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES continued 
 
Leases for buildings and land continued 
50,244,600 included within Property, Plant and Equipment as at 31 December 2103. Of this US$ 
49,696,000 pertains to Khalifa City Specialty Hospital. If any such leases are terminated or expire and are 
not renewed, the Group could lose the investment, including the hospital buildings and the warehouses on 
the leased sites which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and 
results of operations. The directors have considered the following facts in determining the likelihood that 
these leases will be renewed: 
 Whilst some leases can be for long term durations, it is not unusual and can often be common 
practice throughout all of the emirates in the United Arab Emirates for landlords to lease land 
and buildings to companies on annually renewable leases of one year terms and for these 
leases to be renewed automatically. Throughout the Group’s 40 year history it has never had 
a lease cancelled or not renewed, and the Group enjoys a high degree of respect in the 
region and believes that it maintains strong relationships with the landlords.  
 Both the Dubai General Hospital and the warehouse facilities have been occupied by the 
Group on annually renewable leases, for a period of more than 13 years and each year these 
leases have been automatically renewed. 
 The warehouse facilities have been built by the company on land leased from government 
bodies in the Emirates of Dubai and Abu Dhabi on the back of the policies of these 
governments to attract investment in warehousing in the United Arab Emirates. 
 At 31 December 2013 the land on which the Khalifa City Specialty Hospital is being 
constructed is being leased to NMC from the Municipality of Abu Dhabi and was on a one 
year annually renewable basis. Subsequent to year end, the lease has been renewed and 
extended so that it is now a 27 year lease expiring in the year 2040. The total carrying 
amounts included within Property Plant and Equipment in respect of Khalifa City Specialty 
Hospital as at 31 December 2013 is US$ 49,696,000.  
2.4 CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
Changes in accounting policies: 
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except for 
employees’ end of service benefits as discussed below: 
 
Employees’ end of service benefits: 
The Group has reassessed its accounting policy with respect to employees’ end of service benefits. In 
previous years the Group was treating these as other long term benefits and has now assessed these to 
be treated as post-employment benefits. This change in accounting treatment did not materially impact 
the previously reported profit or equity of the group as the actuarial gain/loss as a result of the actuarial 
valuation is not material to the Group. 
 
New and amended standards and interpretations: 
The Group applies IFRS (as adopted in the European Union), the European Union endorsement states 
that IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12 must be applied at the latest with an effective date of 1 January 
2014 although earlier adoption is permitted. Accordingly, the Group has early adopted IFRS 10, IFRS 11 
and IFRS 12 with effect from 1 January 2013.  
The amendments to IFRS, which are effective as of 1 January 2013 and are described in more detail 
below, have no impact on the Group.

NMC Health plc 
  
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
At 31 December 2013 
 
2.4 CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued 
 
The following amendments to IFRS are effective as of 1 January 2013:   
 
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements 
IFRS 10 establishes a single control model that applies to all entities including special purpose entities. 
IFRS 10 replaces the parts of previously existing IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements 
that dealt with consolidated financial statements and SIC-12 Consolidation – Special Purpose Entities. 
IFRS 10 changes the definition of control such that an investor controls an investee when it is exposed, or 
has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those 
returns through its power over the investee. IFRS 10 had no impact on the consolidation of investments 
held by the Group  
 
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements and IAS 28 Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures 
IFRS 11 replaces IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures and SIC-13 Jointly-controlled Entities — Non-
monetary Contributions by Ventures. IFRS 11 removes the option to account for jointly controlled entities 
(JCEs) using proportionate consolidation. Instead, JCEs that meet the definition of a joint venture under 
IFRS 11 must be accounted for using the equity method.  
 
IFRS 11 had no impact on the financial position or performance of the Group as it does not have any 
JCEs. 
 
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities 
IFRS 12 sets out the requirements for disclosures relating to an entity’s interests in subsidiaries, joint 
arrangements, associates and structured entities. The requirements in IFRS 12 are more comprehensive 
than the previously existing disclosure requirements for subsidiaries. For example, when a subsidiary is 
controlled with less than the majority of voting rights. None of these disclosure requirements are 
applicable for consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, the Group has not made such disclosures.    
 
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement 
IFRS 13 establishes a single source of guidance under IFRS for all fair value measurements. IFRS 13 
does not change when an entity is required to use fair value, but rather provides guidance on how to 
measure fair value under IFRS when fair value is required or permitted. The application of IFRS 13 has 
not materially impacted the fair value measurements carried out by the Group. 
 
IAS 1 Financial Statements Presentation - Presentation of items of Other Comprehensive Income- 
Amendments to IAS 1 
The amendments to IAS 1 introduce a grouping of items presented in Other Comprehensive Income. 
Items that will be reclassified (‘recycled’) to profit or loss at a future point in time (e.g. Net loss or gain on 
available for sale financial assets) have to be presented separately from items that will not be reclassified 
(e.g., revaluation of land and buildings). The amendments affect presentation only and have no impact on 
the Group’s financial position or performance. 
 
IAS 1 Clarification of the requirement for comparative information (Amendment) 
The amendments specify that a third statement of financial position is required when a) an entity applies 
an accounting policy retrospectively, or makes a retrospective restatement or reclassification of items in 
its financial statements, and b) the retrospective application, restatement or reclassification has a material 
effect on the information in the third statement of financial position. The amendments specify that related 
notes are not required to accompany the third statement of financial position. The amendments affect 
presentation only and have no impact on the Group’s financial position or performance. 
 
IAS 19 Employee Benefits (Revised 2011)  
IAS 19 (revised 2011) changes the accounting for defined benefit plans and termination benefits. The 
most significant change relates to the accounting for changes in defined benefits obligation and plan 
assets. The amendments require the recognition of changes in defined benefit obligation and in the fair 
value of the plan assets when they occur, and hence eliminate the ‘corridor approach’ permitted under the  
previous version of IAS 19 and accelerate the recognition of past service costs. All actuarial gain and 
losses are recognized immediately through other comprehensive income in order for the net provision 
asset or liability recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position to reflect the full value of the

plan deficit or surplus. Furthermore, the interest cost and the expected return on plan assets used in the 
previous version of IAS 19 are replaced with a ‘net interest’ amount under IAS19 (as revised in 
2011),which is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. These 
changes have no material impact on the amounts recognised in the prior years.  
 
2.5 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
 
Revenue recognition 
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group 
and the revenue can be reliably measured, regardless of when the payment is being made. Revenue is 
measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, less discounts and rebates and 
talking into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes or duties. 
 
Revenue streams include clinic service revenues, sale of goods - Pharmacy, sale of goods –Distribution, 
Healthcare management fees and revenue from BR Medical Suites.  
The Group assesses its revenue arrangements against specific criteria in order to determine if it is acting 
as principal or agent. The Group determines it is acting as principal when it has exposure to the significant 
risks and rewards associated with the transaction and measures revenue as the gross amount received or 
receivable. When the Group does not retain the significant risks and rewards, it deems that it is acting as 
an agent and measures revenue as the amount received or receivable in return for its performance under 
the contract and excludes any amounts collected on behalf of a third party.  
Clinic service revenues:  
Clinic service revenues represent the revenue which NMC generates from the provision of either inpatient 
or outpatient medical services. The group primarily receives clinic service revenues from patients’ private / 
medical insurance schemes. Clinic revenues are recognised when, and to the extent that, performance of 
a medical service occurs, and is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.  
NMC has determined that it is acting as Principal in these arrangements as it has the responsibility for 
providing the medical services to the patient, it sets the prices for the clinic services which are provided, it 
bears the credit risk and it bears the risk of providing the medical service.  
Sale of Goods - Pharmacy: 
The sales of goods from pharmacy relates to the sale of pharmaceutical and other products from hospitals 
and pharmacies. Whilst the Group does not establish the prices for the pharmaceutical products sold as 
both the purchase and selling prices for all pharmaceutical products are fixed by the Ministry of Health, 
NMC has determined that it is acting as Principal in respect of these sales as it provides the goods for 
sale, it bears the inventory risk, and it bears the credit risk from customers. Revenue from the sale of 
goods – Pharmacy is therefore recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the 
goods have passed to the buyer. Significant risk for retail goods is passed to the buyer at the point of sale. 
 
Sale of Goods - Distribution: 
Where the Group bears the inventory risk and the customer credit risk and has the ability to set the prices 
for the products sold then the Group has determined that it is acting as Principal.  Revenue from the sale 
of goods is therefore recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have 
passed to the buyer. Significant risk for retail goods is passed to the buyer for wholesale goods at the time 
of delivery. 
 
For agency relationships, the revenue earned is measured as the Group’s share of the revenue, as 
specified in the contract. Any amounts collected on behalf of the third party are excluded from revenue 
and are recorded as a payable. There are currently no material agency relationships.

2.5 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued 
 
Healthcare Management fees: 
Management fees represent fees earned for managing a hospital. Management fees are recognised when 
the services under the contract are performed, and the service level criteria have been met, and are 
measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, in line with the terms of the 
management contract. 
 
Revenue from BR Medical Suites: 
BR Medical Suites enters into contracts with doctors whereby these doctors are employed to perform 
certain procedures or run outpatient services using the facilities at BR Medical Suites. In return the 
doctors obtain a share of the revenues that are generated from these facilities. Each contractual 
arrangement with individual doctors is assessed against specific criteria to determine whether the Group 
is acting as principal or agent in the arrangement with these doctors. 
 
Other income 
Other income comprises revenue from suppliers for the reimbursement of advertising and promotion costs 
incurred by the Group.  Revenue is recognised following formal acceptance of the Group's reimbursement 
claims by suppliers and is measured at the confirmed amount receivable. 
 
Interest income 
For all financial instruments measured at amortised cost, interest income or expense is recorded using the 
effective interest rate (EIR), which is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or 
receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the 
net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability. Interest income is included in finance income in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
 
Rebate from Suppliers    
The Distribution business receives rebates in the ordinary course of business from a number of its 
suppliers of pharmaceutical products, in accordance with contractual arrangements in place with specific 
suppliers. Rebates are accounted for once approval has been received from the supplier following the 
negotiations which have taken place with them.  Rebates receivable are accounted for as a deduction 
from the cost of purchasing pharmaceutical goods, once the rebate has been approved by the supplier on 
the basis under IAS 18 that the probability of inflow is not sufficiently certain and the amounts cannot be 
reliably measured until that point. When rebates have been agreed in advance, for example when it has 
been agreed that a certain rebate will be applied to the purchase of specific goods for a set period of time 
rather than just to a specific one off purchase, then the rebate is recognised as a reduction in the 
purchase price as soon as the goods are purchased. When rebates are offered based upon the volume 
purchased and it is probable that the rebate will be earned and the amount can be estimated reliably, then 
the discount is recognised as a reduction in the purchase price when the goods are purchased and the 
assessment is reviewed on an ongoing basis. Rebates receivable are accounted for on a net basis, being 
set off against the trade payables to which they relate, as they are a reduction in the amount we owe to 
our suppliers in respect of pharmaceutical products purchased. 
 
Business combinations and goodwill 
The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration 
transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities 
incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group. The 
consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent 
consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in 
a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group 
recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair 
value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the recognised amounts of acquiree’s 
identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. 
 
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the acquirer’s 
previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through 
profit or loss.

2.5 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued 
 
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is recognised at fair value at the acquisition 
date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset 
or liability is recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in profit or loss or as a change to other 
comprehensive income. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured, and its 
subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. 
 
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred 
and the amount recognised for non-controlling interest over the net identifiable assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration 
transferred, the gain is recognised in profit or loss.  
 
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the 
purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, 
allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, 
irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquire are assigned to those units.  
 
Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is 
disposed of, the goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the 
operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed in these circumstances is 
measured based on the relative values of the disposed operation and the portion of the cash-generating 
unit retained.  
 
Business combinations involving entities under common control 
Business combinations involving entities under common control do not fall under the scope of IFRS 3 
Revised ‘Business Combinations’. The transfer of companies under common control is therefore 
accounted for using the pooling of interests method. Under this method there is no requirement to fair 
value the assets and liabilities of the transferred entities and hence no goodwill is created upon transfer of 
ownership as the balances remain at book value. The consolidated income statement, consolidated 
balance sheet and the consolidated statement of cash flows comparative figures are also presented as if 
the Company had been the parent undertaking of the Group throughout the current and previous year. 
The consolidated financial statements are therefore presented as though the Group had always existed in 
its current form. 
 
Restructuring reserve 
The group restructuring reserve arises on consolidation under the pooling of interests method used for the 
group restructuring which took place on 1 April 2012. This represents the difference between the share 
capital of NMC Healthcare LLC, the previous parent company of the Group, and the carrying amount of 
the investment in that company at the date of the restructure. This reserve is non-distributable. 
 
Property and equipment 
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. 
 
Depreciation is calculated on all property and equipment other than land and capital work in progress, at 
the following rates calculated to write off the cost of each asset on a straight line basis over its expected 
useful life: 
 
 Hospital building 6% 
 Buildings 6% 
 Leasehold improvements 20% 
 Motor vehicles 20% 
 Furniture, fixtures and fittings 12.5% - 20% 
 Medical equipment 10% - 25%

The carrying amounts of property and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in 
circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists and where 
the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount, the assets are written down to their 
recoverable amount, being the higher of their fair value less cost to sell and their value in use. 
 
Capital work in progress is stated at cost and is not depreciated. Lease costs in respect of capital work in 
progress are capitalised within capital work in progress during the period up until it is commissioned. 
When commissioned, capital work in progress is transferred to the appropriate property and equipment 
asset category and depreciated in accordance with the Group’s policies. The carrying amounts of capital  
work in progress are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the 
carrying value may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists and where the carrying values exceed 
the estimated recoverable amount, the assets are written down to their recoverable amount. 
 
Expenditure incurred to replace a component of an item of property and equipment that is accounted for 
separately is capitalised and the carrying amount of the component that is replaced is written off.  Other 
subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases future economic benefits of the related item of 
property and equipment. All other expenditure is recognised in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income as the expense is incurred. 
 
Borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of an asset are capitalised 
as part of the cost of the asset until the asset is commissioned for use. Borrowing costs in respect of 
completed assets or not attributable to assets are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. 
 
Pre-operating expenses 
Pre-operating expenses are the expenses incurred prior to start of operations of a new business unit. 
These are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the year in which they 
occur. 
 
Inventories 
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value after making due allowance for any 
obsolete or slow moving items.  Costs are those expenses incurred in bringing each product to its present 
location and condition and are determined on a weighted average basis.  Net realisable value is based on 
estimated selling price less any further costs expected to be incurred to disposal. 
 
Accounts receivable 
Accounts receivable are stated at original invoice amount less a provision for any uncollectible amounts.  
An estimate of doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.  Bad debts 
are written off when there is no possibility of recovery. 
 
Cash and cash equivalents 
For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash in 
hand, bank balances and short term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, net of 
outstanding bank overdrafts. 
 
Equity 
The Group has issued ordinary shares that are classified as equity. The difference between the issue 
price and the par value of ordinary share capital is allocated to share premium. The transaction costs 
incurred for the share issue are accounted for as a deduction from share premium, net of any related 
income tax benefit, to the extent they are incremental costs directly attributable to the share issue that 
would otherwise have been avoided.

2.5 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued 
 
Listing transaction costs 
Transaction costs of the IPO are accounted for as a deduction from equity, net of any related income tax 
benefit. Transaction costs arising on the issue of equity instruments, however, do not include indirect 
costs, such as the costs of management time and administrative overheads, or allocations of internal 
costs that would have been incurred had the shares not been issued. Marketing costs for the IPO do not 
meet the definition of directly attributable expenses and are therefore expensed through the statement of 
comprehensive income, together with the indirect costs related to the IPO.  
 
Accounts payable and accruals 
Liabilities are recognised for amounts to be paid in the future for goods and services received whether 
billed by the supplier or not. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within 
one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer). If not, they are presented as 
non-current liabilities. Accounts payable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has an obligation (legal or constructive) arising from a past 
event, and the costs to settle the obligation are both probable and able to be reliably measured. 
 
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the 
obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and 
risks specific to the obligation. Increases in provisions due to the passage of time are recognised in the 
consolidated income statement within ‘Finance costs’. 
 
Term loans 
Term loans are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable 
transaction costs. After initial recognition, term loans are subsequently measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method. Interest on term loans is charged as an expense as it accrues, with unpaid 
amounts included in “accounts payable and accruals”. 
 
When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different 
terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is 
treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in 
the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. 
 
Employees’ end of service benefits  
The Group operates an un-funded post-employment benefit plan (employees’ end of service benefits) for 
its expatriate employees in UAE, in accordance with the labour laws of the UAE. The entitlement to these 
benefits is based upon the employees’ final salary and length of service, subject to the completion of a 
minimum service period. Payment for employees’ end of service benefits is made when an employee 
leaves, resigns or completes his service.  
The cost of providing benefits under the post-employment benefit plan is determined using the projected 
unit credit method. Re-measurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses, are recognized 
immediately in the statement of financial position with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings 
through other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Re-measurements are not 
reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods. 
 
Interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the defined benefit liability. The rate used to discount 
the end of service benefit obligation is determined by reference to market yields at the balance sheet date 
on high quality corporate bonds. The current and non-current portions of the provision relating to 
employees’ end of service benefits are separately disclosed in the consolidated statement of financial 
position.  
 
The Group recognises the following changes in the employees’ end of service benefits under ‘direct costs’ 
and ‘general and  administrative expenses’ in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income: 
● Service costs comprising current service costs 
● Interest expense

Employees’ end of service benefits continued 
With respect to its UAE national employees, the Group makes contributions to the relevant UAE 
Government pension scheme calculated as a percentage of the employees’ salaries. The obligations under 
these schemes are limited to these contributions, which are expensed when due. 
 
With respect to its UAE national employees, the Group makes contributions to the relevant UAE 
Government pension scheme calculated as a percentage of the employees’ salaries. The obligations under 
these schemes are limited to these contributions, which are expensed when due. 
 
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded in UAE Dirhams at the exchange rate ruling at the date of 
the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate 
of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.  All differences are taken to the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income. 
 
Translation of foreign operations 
On consolidation the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into US Dollars at the rate of 
exchange prevailing at the reporting date and their income statements are translated at exchange rates 
prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Since the UAE Dirham is pegged against the US Dollar a single 
rate of 3.673 per US Dollar is used to translate assets and liabilities and balances in the income statement. 
 
Derivative financial instruments 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps to hedge its interest 
rate risks. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a 
contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. The fair value of interest rate 
swaps are determined by reference to market values for similar instruments. Derivatives with positive 
market values (unrealised gains) are included in other assets and derivatives with negative market values 
(unrealised losses) are included in other liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position. Any 
gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year are taken directly to profit 
or loss. Whilst the policy of the group is not to apply hedge accounting, the derivatives are economic 
hedges of liabilities in issue and it is therefore considered appropriate to show the changes in fair value of 
derivatives in finance costs in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
 
Financial instruments 
Financial instruments comprise cash and bank balances, receivables, payables, bank overdrafts, term 
loans and certain other assets and liabilities. The fair value of these financial instruments are based on 
estimated fair values calculated using methods such as the quoted market prices and net present value of 
future cash flows. The fair value of interest bearing items is estimated based on discounted cash flows 
using interest rates for items with similar terms and characteristics. The fair value of investments traded in 
organised markets is determined by reference to quoted market bid prices.  
 
Impairment of financial assets 
An assessment is made at each consolidated statement of financial position date to determine whether there 
is objective evidence that a specific financial asset may be impaired. If such evidence exists, any impairment 
loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Impairment is determined as 
the difference between carrying value and the present value of future cash flows discounted at the current 
market rate of return for a similar financial asset. 
 
Leases 
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the 
arrangement at inception date, whether fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific 
asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset, even if that right is not explicitly 
specified in an arrangement. Operating leases are recognised as an operating expense in the statement 
of comprehensive income on a straight line basis.

3 ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS ISSUED BUT NOT EFFECTIVE 
 
The standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the 
Group’s financial statements are disclosed below. The Group intends to adopt these standards, if 
applicable, when they become effective. 
 
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 
IFRS 9, as issued, reflects the first phase of the IASB’s work on the replacement of IAS 39 and applies to 
classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities as defined in IAS 39. The 
standard was initially effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, but amendments 
to IFRS 9 Mandatory Effective Date of IFRS 9 and Transition disclosures, issued in December 2011, 
moved the mandatory effective date to 1 January 2015. In subsequent phases, the IASB is addressing 
hedge accounting and impairment of financial assets. The adoption of the first phase of IFRS 9 will not 
have a significant impact on the classification and measurement of the Group’s financial assets and 
financial liabilities.  
 
Investment Entities (Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27) 
These amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 provide an 
exception to the consolidation requirement for entities that meet the definition of an investment entity 
under IFRS 10.The exception to consolidation requires investment entities to account for subsidiaries at 
fair value through profit or loss. It is not expected that this amendment would be relevant to the Group, 
since none of the entities in the Group would qualify to be an investment entity under IFRS 10. 
 
IAS 32 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities-Amendments to IAS 32 
These amendments clarify the meaning of ‘currently has a legally enforceable right to set-off’ and the 
criteria for non-simultaneous settlement mechanisms of clearing houses to qualify for offsetting. These are 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014. These amendments are not expected to 
be relevant to the Group. 
 
IFRIC Interpretation 21 Levies (IFRIC 21) 
IFRIC 21 clarifies that an entity recognises a liability for a levy when the activity that triggers payment, as 
identified by the relevant legislation, occurs. For a levy that is triggered upon reaching a minimum 
threshold, the interpretation clarifies that no liability should be anticipated before the specified minimum 
threshold is reached. IFRIC 21 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014. The 
Group does not expect that IFRIC 21 will have any material financial impact in future financial statements. 
 
IAS 39 Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting-Amendments to IAS 39 
These amendments provide relief from discounting hedge accounting when novation of a derivative 
designated as a hedge instrument meets certain criteria. These amendments are effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014. These amendments have no impact on the Group. 
 
4 BUSINESS COMBINATION UNDER COMMON CONTROL 
 
On 28 March 2012 the Company became the holding company of NMC Healthcare LLC through its wholly 
owned subsidiaries, NMC Holding LLC and NMC Health Holdco Limited. This transaction falls outside the 
scope of IFRS 3 - Business Combinations, so the pooling of interests method is applied and the 
consolidated financial statements of the Group are presented as a continuation of the existing group. The 
following accounting treatment was applied: 
 
a) the assets and liabilities of the previous parent company, NMC Healthcare LLC, were recognised 
and measured in the consolidated financial statements at the pre-combination carrying amounts, 
without restatement to fair value; and 
 
b) the retained earnings and other equity balances of NMC Healthcare LLC immediately before the 
business combination, and the results of the period from 1 January 2012 to the date of the 
business combination are those of NMC Healthcare LLC as the Company did not trade prior to  
the transaction.

4 BUSINESS COMBINATION UNDER COMMON CONTROL continued 
 
The Company had no significant assets or liabilities immediately prior to the time of the acquisition. As 
part of the acquisition, 130,000,000 new 10 pence shares were issued to the shareholders of NMC 
Healthcare LLC. A group restructuring reserve of US$ 10,001,000 (debit) arose on consolidation being the 
difference between the share capital of NMC Healthcare LLC and the carrying amount of the investment 
in the books of the Company. This has been classified as part of the equity within the consolidated 
statement of financial position (note 22). 
 
5 SEGMENT INFORMATION 
 
For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on their products and 
services and has two reportable segments as follows: 
 
 The healthcare segment is engaged in providing professional medical services, comprising 
diagnostic services, in and outpatient clinics and retailing of pharmaceutical goods. It also 
includes the provision of management services in respect of a hospital.  
 
 The distribution & services segment is engaged in wholesale trading of pharmaceutical goods, 
medical equipment, cosmetics and food. 
 
No operating segments have been aggregated to form the above reportable operating segments. 
 
Management monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of making 
decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated  
based on profit or loss and is measured consistently with profit or loss, excluding finance income and 
finance costs, group administrative expenses, unallocated depreciation and unallocated other income, in 
the consolidated financial statements. 
 
Group financing and investments (including finance costs and finance income) are managed on a group 
basis and are not allocated to operating segments. This also includes the flotation costs incurred in 2012. 
 
Transfer prices between operating segments are on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to 
transactions with third parties. 
 
 
The following tables present revenue and profit and certain asset and liability information regarding the 
Group‘s business segments for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012.

14 TAX 
 
The Group operates solely in the United Arab Emirates and as there is no corporation tax in the United 
Arab Emirates, no taxes are recognised or payable on the operations in the UAE. It is the opinion of 
management that there are sufficient losses in the Company to offset any potential taxable income arising 
in the UK and accordingly any tax liability that could arise would be immaterial.  
 
15 EARNINGS PER SHARE 
 
Basic and diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable 
to ordinary equity holders of the Parent Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares 
outstanding during the year. 
 
The following reflects the income and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share 
computations: 
 
 2013 2012 
   
Profit attributable to equity holders of the Parent (US$ ‘000) 
 
68,165     58,891 
 Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue (‘000)

  171,824  
    
Basic and diluted earnings per share (US$) 
 
0.367 
 
     0.343  
    
 
The weighted average number of shares for the year ended 31 December 2012 has been adjusted for the 
effect of the increase in share capital as a result of the Company’s premium listing on the London Stock 
Exchange (note 21).

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
At 31 December 2013 
 
16 PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT continued 
 
As part of the Group’s capital expenditure programme, borrowing costs of US$ 4,886,000 (2012: US$ 
4,110,000) net of finance income of US$ 54,000 (2012: US$ 1,217,000) have been capitalised during the 
year. The rate used to determine the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation was 3.40% 
(2012: 3.81%) which is the effective rate of the borrowings used to finance the capital expenditure. As 
companies in UAE are not subject to taxation and as such there is no tax relief in respect of capitalised 
interest.  
 
Generally hospital and distribution operations are carried out on land and buildings which are leased from 
Government authorities or certain private parties. The majority of the lease periods range from five to 
twenty years apart from New Medical Centre Hospital LLC-Dubai (“Dubai General Hospital”), the land on 
which the Khalifa City Specialty Hospital is being constructed and the warehouse facilities which had 
leases renewable on an annual basis (note 2.3). As at 31 December 2013 US$ 50,244,600 (2012 US$ 
21,796,700) of the amounts included in Property plant and equipment related to assets with annually 
renewable leases. Subsequent to year end, the lease for the land on which the Khalifa City Specialty 
Hospital is being constructed was renewed for a period of 27 years (note 34). Khalifa City Specialty 
Hospital has US$ 49,696,000 included in Property plant and equipment as at 31 December 2103. 
  
In accordance with the local laws, except in some specific locations in the UAE the registered title of land 
and buildings must be held in the name of a UAE national. As a result, land and buildings of the Group are 
legally registered in the name of shareholders or previous shareholders of the Group. Certain land and 
buildings with a carrying amount of US$ 9,648,000 (31 December 2012: US$ 9,974,000) are held in the 
name of a previous shareholder for the beneficial interest of the Group As the beneficial interest of such 
land and buildings resides with the Group, these assets are recorded within land and buildings in the 
Group’s consolidated financial statements. The directors take into account this local legal registration 
requirement, the Group’s entitlement to the beneficial interest arising from these assets, as well as other 
general business factors, when considering whether such assets are impaired. 
 
Property and equipment with a net carrying amount of US$ nil at 31 December 2013 (2012: US$ 
4,849,000) are pledged as security against term loans.

On 1 July 2012, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of BR Medical Suites FZ LLC, a company 
registered in Dubai, UAE, from its owner, Dr BR Shetty, a shareholder and director of the Company.  The 
consideration for the acquisition was US$ 9,000,000. BR Medical Suites FZ LLC is a day patient centre 
with four operating theatres and state of the art medical equipment. The Group acquired BR Medical 
Suites FZ – LLC because it increases the range of services in its healthcare segment and will work as a 
synergy to their existing facilities in the areas of patient profiling as well as connectivity with international 
healthcare professionals.     
 
Goodwill arose on the acquisition of BR Medical Suites FZ LLC on 1
 
July 2012. The goodwill is attributable 
to the synergies that arose as a result of the acquisition. Goodwill is allocated to the healthcare segment 
and is monitored at the healthcare segment level, which equates to the level for impairment testing. 
 
The recoverable amount of the CGU has been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These 
calculations use pre-tax cash flow projection based on financial budgets approved by management 
covering a five year period. The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 9.3% and a 3% 
growth rate is used to arrive at the cash flows between year 6 to 10 and a terminal value beyond year 10

is used using a zero growth rate.  Management has assessed the key assumptions within these 
calculations using their past experience from operating within the healthcare industry. The growth rate 
does not exceed either the long term average growth rate for the healthcare business in which the CGU 
operates or the country growth rate. 
  
The main assumptions used to compute the value in use were those concerning the discount rate, the 
most recent cash flow projections and the expected growth rate at the end of the time horizon of the 
forecast. 
 
In addition, the Group performed a sensitivity analysis for changes in the basic assumptions of the 
impairment test, specifically focusing on the variables that have the greatest impact on recoverable value 
(discount rate and projections). The results of these tests showed no indications of impairment.

Unimpaired receivables are expected, on the basis of past experience, to be fully recoverable. It is not the 
practice of Group to obtain collateral over receivables and they are therefore unsecured. As at 31 December 
2013 trade receivables of US$ 8,241,000 (2012: US$ 6,444,000) were impaired and fully provided for. 
 
Credit risk is managed through the Group’s established policy, procedures and controls relating to credit 
risk management (note 29). A majority of the receivables that are past due but not impaired are from 
insurance companies and government-linked entities in the United Arab Emirates which are inherently 
slow payers due to their long invoice verification and approval of payment procedures. Payments continue 
to be received from these customers and accordingly the risk of non-recoverability is considered to be 
low. 
 
Of the net trade receivables balance of US$ 145,993,000 an amount of US$ 61,353,000 is against five 
customers (2012: US$ 63,966,000 is against five customers).  
 
The Group’s terms require receivables to be repaid within 90-120 days depending on the type of 
customer, which is in line with local practice in the UAE. Due to the long credit period offered to 
customers, a significant amount of trade accounts receivable are neither past due nor impaired.

Arab Emirates. These are mainly denominated in the UAE Dirhams and earn interest at the respective 
deposit rates. These deposits have original maturity between 3 to 12 months (2012: 3 to 12 months).  
 
Short term borrowings include trust receipts and invoice discounting facilities which mature between 90 
and 180 days. Trust receipts are short term borrowings to finance imports.  The bank overdrafts and short 
term borrowings are secured by assets of the Group up to the amount of the respective borrowings and 
personal guarantees of the shareholders (H.E. Saeed Mohamed Butti Mohamed Al Qebaisi, Dr BR Shetty 
and Khalifa Butti Omair Yousif Ahmad Al Muhairi) and carry interest at EIBOR plus margin rates ranging 
from 3% to 4%. 
 
At 31 December 2013, the Group had US$ 18,323,000 (2012: US$ 11,444,000) of undrawn bank overdraft

On 5 April 2012, NMC Health plc completed its Premium Listing on the London Stock Exchange and 
raised US$ 186,264,000 from the issue of 55,714,286 new ordinary shares, thereby diluting existing 
shareholders equity interest to 66.95% at the time of listing. 
 
Share issue costs incurred in 2012 include US$ 4,285,000 of fees paid to the auditor (note 11). 
 
 
22 GROUP RESTRUCTURING RESERVE 
 
The group restructuring reserve arises on consolidation under the pooling of interests method used for 
group restructuring. Under this method, the group is treated as a continuation of the NMC Healthcare LLC 
group. The difference between the share capital of NMC Healthcare LLC (US$ 27,226,000) and the 
carrying amount of the investment in that company (US$ 37,227,000), which equates to the net assets of 
NMC Healthcare LLC at the date of reorganisation (28 March 2012), amounting to US$ 10,001,000, is 
recorded on consolidation as a group restructuring reserve (note 4). This reserve is non-distributable.  
 
 
23 RETAINED EARNINGS 
 
As at 31 December 2013, retained earnings of US$ 14,333,000 (2012: US$ 12,627,000) are not 
distributable. This relates to a UAE Companies Law requirement to set aside 10% of annual profit of all 
UAE subsidiaries until their respective reserves equal 50% of their paid up share capital. The subsidiaries 
discontinue such annual transfers once this requirement has been met.

The term loans primarily carry interest at EIBOR / LIBOR plus margin. 
 
31 December 2013:  
During the year ended 31 December 2013, the Group agreed a new syndicated loan facility, led by JP 
Morgan Chase Bank, of US$ 225,000,000 (with an additional available facility of US$ 75,000,000 which 
the group has not drawn down to date). The loan facility is repayable over 54 monthly instalments with a 
grace period of six months and carries interest at the rate of 1 month US$ LIBOR + 3% + mandatory 
costs; if any, per annum. The new syndicated loan facility has been utilised to repay some of the existing 
debts including the debt with JP Morgan Chase Bank against the facility of US$ 150,000,000 obtained in

In accordance with the provisions of IAS 19 – ‘Employee Benefits’, management has carried out an 
exercise to assess the present value of its obligation at 31 December 2013 and 2012, using the projected 
unit credit method, in respect of employees’ end of service benefits payable under the UAE Labour Law. 
The impact of the actuarial valuation is not material to the Group, accordingly no actuarial gain or losses 
are recognised in other comprehensive income. Management has assumed an average length of service 
of 5 years (2012: 5 years) and increment/promotion costs of 3.0% (2012: 3.0%). The expected liability at

date of employees’ leaving service has been discounted to its net present value using a discount rate of 
4.5% (2012: 4.5%). Management also performed a sensitivity analysis for changes in discount rate and 
increment costs; the results of this analysis showed that none of the factors had any material impact on 
the actuarial valuation.

No actuarial valuation was performed as of 31 December 2011.

29 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES 
 
The Group’s principal financial liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise loans and borrowings and trade 
and other payables. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Group’s operations. 
The Group has accounts and other receivables, and cash and short-term deposits that arise directly from 
its operations.  
 
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.  
 
The Group’s senior management oversees the management of these risks. The Board of Directors 
reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks which are summarised below. 
 
Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate 
because of changes in market interest rates. The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on its interest 
bearing assets and liabilities (bank deposits, bank overdrafts and other short term borrowings and term 
loans).  Management has sought to limit the exposure of the Group to any adverse future movements in 
interest rates by entering into interest rate swap arrangements.  Management is therefore of the opinion 
that the Group’s exposure to interest rate risk is limited. 
 
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of the statement of comprehensive income to reasonably 
possible changes in interest rates, with all other variables held constant. The sensitivity of the statement 
of comprehensive income is the effect of the assumed changes in interest rates on the Group’s profit for 
the year, taking into account interest rate swap arrangements, based on the floating rate financial assets 
and financial liabilities as of the respective year end.

Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or 
customer contract, leading to a financial loss. The Group limits its credit risk with respect to customers 
due to the nature of the customers that it has dealings with. Within the Healthcare business the majority of 
the Group’s customers are Insurance Companies. The largest insurance company is fully backed by 
Sovereign wealth funding from Abu Dhabi. All other insurance companies are required to be listed on a 
stock exchange and therefore are governed by the regulations of their respective markets. Within the 
distribution business the Group deals primarily with large reputable multinational retail companies. The 
Group further seeks to limit its credit risk by setting credit limits for individual customers and monitoring 
outstanding receivables. 
 
The Group limits its credit risk with regard to bank deposits by only dealing with reputable banks. The 
external credit ratings for the banks at which the bank deposits and cash at bank are held are as follows:

Liquidity risk 
The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the 
use of banking facilities. The Group limits its liquidity risk by raising funds from its operations and ensuring 
bank facilities are available. Trade payables are normally settled within 90–120 days of the date of 
purchase.

Foreign currency risk 
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will 
fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. Foreign currency risk comprises of transaction 
and statement of financial position risk. Transaction risk relates to the Group’s cash flow being adversely 
affected by a change in the exchange rates of foreign currencies against the UAE Dirham. Statement of 
financial position risk relates to the risk of the Group’s monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies 
acquiring a lower or higher value, when translated into UAE Dirhams, as a result of currency movements. 
 
The Group is exposed to currency risk on its trade accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies, 
mainly in Euros, Swiss Francs and Pound Sterling. 
 
Significant foreign currency payable balances included in the consolidated statement of financial position

The table below indicates the Group’s foreign currency exposure at 31 December, as a result of its 
monetary liabilities. As the US Dollar is pegged to the UAE Dirham, balances in US Dollars are not 
considered to represent significant currency risk. The analysis calculates the effect of a reasonable

Capital management 
The primary objective of the Group's capital management is to ensure that it maintains healthy capital 
ratios in order to support its business and maximize shareholders’ value. 
 
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in business 
conditions. Capital comprises share capital, share premium, group restructuring reserve and retained 
earnings and is measured at US$ 386,236,000 as at 31 December 2013 (2012: US$ 329,669,000). In 
order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to 
shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. Certain 
banking facilities may also impose covenant requirements on the Group with respect to capital 
management.  
 
The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by capital plus net debt. The 
Group includes within net debt, interest bearing loans and borrowings, accounts payable and accruals and 
other payables less bank deposits and bank balances and cash.

The interest rate swaps were contracted to hedge the interest cash flows on term loans. As these swaps 
do not qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39, the movement in fair value gain of 
US$ 702,000 for the year ended 31 December 2013 (2012: gain of US$ 329,000) has been charged to the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
 
The notional amounts indicate the volume of transactions outstanding at year end and are neither 
indicative of the market risk nor credit risk. 
 
The negative fair value of interest rate swaps is included within accounts payable and accruals as “other 
payables”. 
 
  
33 FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS        
 
The fair values of the Group’s financial instruments are not materially different from their carrying values 
at the statement of financial position date. 
 
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial 
instruments by valuation technique: 
 
Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
 
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are 
observable, either directly or indirectly. 
 
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not 
based on observable market data. 
 
For financial instruments that are recognized at fair value on a recurring basis, the Group determines 
whether transfers have occurred between Levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorization (bases 
on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each 
reporting period.

During the year 31 December 2013, there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value 
measurements, and no transfers into or out of Level 3 fair value measurements.  
 
The fair value of the interest rate swap is determined by reference to market values for similar 
instruments.  It is measured using the Forward Price Method; under this method a forward rate or value is 
determined based on the current market price or value of the interest rate and an appropriate rate curve 
and assuming that the forward price, rate or value will be realized in future periods. 
 
 
34 SUBSEQUENT EVENT 
 
 
Subsequent to year end, the lease for the land on which Khalifa City Specialty Hospital is being 
constructed (which as at 31 December 2013 was an annually renewable lease) has been renewed so that 
it is now a 27 year lease expiring in the year 2040.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF NMC HEALTH PLC  
 
We have audited the parent company financial statements of NMC Health plc for the year ended 31 
December 2013 which comprise the Statement of Financial Position, the Statement of Changes in Equity 
and the Statement of Cash Flows, and the related notes 1 to 14 . The financial reporting framework that 
has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006. 
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 
of the Companies Act 2006.  Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.  
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.   
 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on pages 54 to 55, the 
directors are responsible for the preparation of the parent company financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements 
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, 
whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements.  In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information 
in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to 
identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. 
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the parent company financial statements: 
 give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs as at 31 December 2013; 
 have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and 
as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and 
 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
 the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and 
 the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for 
which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the parent company financial 
statements.   
147 
 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us 
to report to you if, in our opinion: 
 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate 
for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or 
 the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to 
be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. 
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the group financial statements of NMC Health plc for the year ended 31 
December 2013.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
At 31 December 2013 
 
 
 
1 CORPORATE INFORMATION 
 
NMC Health plc (the “Company” or “Parent’’) is a Company which was incorporated in England and Wales 
on 20 July 2011. The Company is a public limited company. The address of the registered office of the 
Company is 23 Hanover Square, London, W1S 1JB. The registered number of the Company is 7712220. 
There is no ultimate controlling party. 
 
The Company completed its Premium Listing on the London Stock Exchange on 5 April 2012. 
 
The Parent and its subsidiaries (collectively the “Group”) are engaged in providing professional medical 
services, wholesale of pharmaceutical goods, medical equipment, cosmetics, food and IT products and 
services in the United Arab Emirates. 
 
The financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2013 were authorised for issue 
by the board of directors on 24 February 2014 and the statement of financial position was signed on the 
Board’s behalf by Dr B.R. Shetty and Mr Khalifa Bin Butti. 
 
 
2.1 BASIS OF PREPARATION 
 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union as they apply to the financial statements of the Company for the 
year ended 31 December 2013 and applied in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.  
 
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting 
policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.  
 
No profit and loss account is presented by the Company as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies 
Act 2006.  
 
Functional currency 
The UAE Dirham is determined to be the functional currency of the Company. The reporting currency of 
the Company is United States of America Dollar (US$) as this is a more globally recognised currency. The 
UAE Dirham is pegged against the US Dollar at a rate of 3.673 per US Dollar. 
 
All values are rounded to the nearest thousand dollars ($000) except when otherwise indicated. 
 
Going concern 
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Company has made a 
profit of US$ 14,632,000 (2012: Loss of US$ 5,938,000) and has equity of US$ 206,214,000 (2012: US$ 
202,780,000).               
 
The Company is the parent of NMC Health plc group and is solely a holding company with no business 
activities of its own. The Company earned a dividend and reported a net profit during the year. The 
Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance 
and position are set out in the Strategic Review on pages 8 to 43. The financial position of the Group, its 
cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Strategic Review on pages 27 to 
30. 
 
The Group has considerable financial resources including bank facilities. As a consequence, the directors 
believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully. The directors expect that 
the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus 
they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
At 31 December 2013 
 
2.1 BASIS OF PREPARATION continued 
 
Comparative information 
 
Reclassification 
 
The Company has made the following reclassification in respect of the comparatives to conform to the 
current period presentation. This reclassification has been made to correct the presentation of the 
financial statements. 
 
 An amount of U$ 3,402,000 in respect of flotation costs has been reclassified from financing 
activities to operating activities in the statement of cash flows. 
 
This reclassification has no impact on previously reported equity or profit of the Company. 
 
 
2.2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES 
 
The key assumptions concerning the future, key sources of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements 
at the statement of financial position date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below: 
 
Significant judgements 
 
Functional currency 
The UAE Dirham is determined to be the functional currency of the Company.  
 
Judgement has been used to determine the functional currency of the Company that most appropriately 
represents the economic effects of the Company’s transactions, events and conditions. As part of this 
assessment, the following information has been taken into account: 
 
The primary economic environment influencing the Company’s income (dividends) is the UAE and the 
effect of the local environment is limited to expenses incurred within the UK. The ability of the Company to 
meet its obligations and pay dividends to its shareholders is dependent on the economy of, and the 
operation of its subsidiaries in, the UAE.  
 
Fair value of intercompany receivable from NMC Healthcare LLC 
Judgement has been used to determine the fair value of the intercompany loan due to the Company from 
NMC Healthcare LLC which has been capitalized by the Company as an investment in NMC Healthcare 
LLC. The market value of the intercompany loan was determined to be equal to its face and book value. 
The value of the shares in NMC Healthcare LLC issued to the Company was determined to be equal to 
the market value of the loan balance immediately prior to capitalisation.   
 
 
2.3 CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial period. 
 
The Company applies IFRS (as adopted in the European Union), the European Union endorsement 
states that IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12 must be applied at the latest with an effective date of 1 
January 2014 although earlier adoption is permitted. Accordingly, the Company has early adopted IFRS 
10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12 with effect from 1 January 2013.  
The amendments to IFRS, which are effective as of 1 January 2013 and are described in more detail 
below, have no impact on the Company.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
At 31 December 2013 
 
 
2.3 CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued 
 
New and amended standards and interpretations 
The following amendments to IFRS are effective as of 1 January 2013: 
 
 
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements 
IFRS 10 establishes a single control model that applies to all entities including special purpose entities. 
IFRS 10 replaces the parts of previously existing IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements 
that dealt with consolidated financial statements and SIC-12 Consolidation – Special Purpose Entities. 
IFRS 10 changes the definition of control such that an investor controls an investee when it is exposed, or 
has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those 
returns through its power over the investee. IFRS 10 had no impact on the consolidation of investments 
held by the Company  
 
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements and IAS 28 Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures 
IFRS 11 replaces IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures and SIC-13 Jointly-controlled Entities — Non-
monetary Contributions by Ventures. IFRS 11 removes the option to account for jointly controlled entities 
(JCEs) using proportionate consolidation. Instead, JCEs that meet the definition of a joint venture under 
IFRS 11 must be accounted for using the equity method.  
 
IFRS 11 had no impact on the financial position or performance of the Company as it does not have any 
JCEs. 
 
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities 
IFRS 12 sets out the requirements for disclosures relating to an entity’s interests in subsidiaries, joint 
arrangements, associates and structured entities. The requirements in IFRS 12 are more comprehensive 
than the previously existing disclosure requirements for subsidiaries. For example, when a subsidiary is 
controlled with less than the majority of voting rights. None of these disclosure requirements are 
applicable for financial statements. Accordingly, the Company has not made such disclosures. 
 
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement 
IFRS 13 establishes a single source of guidance under IFRS for all fair value measurements. IFRS 13 
does not change when an entity is required to use fair value, but rather provides guidance on how to 
measure fair value under IFRS when fair value is required or permitted. The application of IFRS 13 has 
not materially impacted the fair value measurements carried out by the Company. 
 
IAS 1 Presentation of items of Other Comprehensive Income- Amendments to IAS 1 
The amendments to IAS 1 introduce a grouping of items presented in Other Comprehensive Income. 
Items that will be reclassified (‘recycled’) to profit or loss at a future point in time (e.g. Net loss or gain on 
available for sale financial assets) have to be presented separately from items that will not be reclassified 
(e.g., revaluation of land and buildings). The amendments affect presentation only and have no impact on 
the Company’s financial position or performance. 
 
IAS 1 Clarification of the requirement for comparative information (Amendment) 
The amendments specify that a third statement of financial position is required when a) an entity applies 
an accounting policy retrospectively, or makes a retrospective restatement or reclassification of items in 
its financial statements, and b) the retrospective application, restatement or reclassification has a material 
effect on the information in the third statement of financial position. The amendments specify that related 
notes are not required to accompany the third statement of financial position. The amendments affect 
presentation only and have no impact on the company’s financial position or performance.

2.3 CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued 
 
 
IAS 19 Employee Benefits (Revised 2011)  
IAS 19 (revised 2011) changes the accounting for defined benefit plans and termination benefits. The 
most significant change relates to the accounting for changes in defined benefits obligation and plan 
assets, The amendments require the recognition of changes in defined benefit obligation and in the fair 
value of the plan assets when they occur, and hence eliminate the ‘corridor approach’ permitted under the 
previous version of IAS 19 and accelerate the recognition of past service costs. All actuarial gain and 
losses are recognized immediately through other comprehensive income in order for the net provision 
asset or liability recognized in the statement of financial position to reflect the full value of the plan deficit 
or surplus. Furthermore, the interest cost and the expected return on plan assets used in the previous 
version of IAS 19 are replaced with a ‘net interest’ amount under IAS19 (as revised in 2011), which is 
calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. These changes have 
had no impact on the financial position or performance of the Company as it does not have any defined 
benefit obligations and plan assets. 
 
2.4 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
Investment in subsidiary 
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Company controls the operating and financial policies, generally 
by owning more than 50% of voting rights. Investments in subsidiaries are recognised at acquisition cost 
less any provision for impairment. 
 
When the Company incurs increases in or return of share capital, to/from its subsidiaries, such 
movements are recognised within the cost of investment in subsidiaries.  
 
At each reporting date, an assessment is made to determine whether there are any indicators of 
impairment. Where an indicator of impairment exists, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount of the 
investment in subsidiary is made, which is considered to be the higher of the fair value less costs to sell 
and the value in use. Fair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the 
investment in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties. When this 
information is not available the fair value is determined based on the net present value of the future cash 
flows related to its subsidiaries, using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the asset. If the carrying amount of an investment exceeds the 
recoverable amount, a provision is recorded in the income statement to reflect the investment at the 
recoverable amount.  
 
Where an impairment charge has previously been recognised, an assessment is made at the end of each 
reporting period as to whether there is any indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist or may 
have decreased. If any such indication exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount is made. An 
impairment loss is reversed to the income statement to the extent that the increased carrying value of the 
investment in subsidiary does not exceed the carrying value that would have been determined had no 
impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.  
 
Acquisition of subsidiary under common control 
When the Company acquires a subsidiary under common control, the cost of the investment is deemed to 
be the Company’s share of the net assets of the subsidiary at the date of acquisition. 
 
Cash and cash equivalents 
For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consists of cash in hand and 
bank balances

2.4 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued 
 
Equity 
The Company has issued ordinary shares that are classified as equity. The difference between the issue 
price and the par value of ordinary share capital is allocated to share premium. The transaction costs 
incurred for the share issue are accounted for as a deduction from share premium, net of any related 
income tax benefit, to the extent they are incremental costs directly attributable to the share issue that 
would otherwise have been avoided. 
 
Listing transaction costs 
Transaction costs of the IPO are accounted for as a deduction from equity, net of any related income tax 
benefit. Transaction costs arising on the issue of equity instruments, however, do not include indirect 
costs, such as the costs of management time and administrative overheads, or allocations of internal 
costs that would have been incurred had the shares not been issued. Marketing costs for the IPO do not 
meet the definition of directly attributable expenses and are therefore expensed through the statement of 
comprehensive income, together with the indirect costs related to the IPO.  
 
Accounts payable and accruals 
Liabilities are recognised for amounts to be paid in the future for goods and services received whether 
billed by the supplier or not. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within 
one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer). If not, they are presented as 
non-current liabilities. Accounts payable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Company has an obligation (legal or constructive) arising from a past 
event, and the costs to settle the obligation are both probable and able to be reliably measured. 
 
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the 
obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and 
risks specific to the obligation. Increases in provisions due to the passage of time are recognised in the 
consolidated income statement. 
 
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded in UAE Dirhams at the exchange rate ruling at the date of 
the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the 
rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences are taken to the statement of 
comprehensive income. 
 
Financial instruments 
Financial instruments comprise amounts due from a related party, cash and bank balances and other 
payables. The fair value of these financial instruments are based on estimated fair values calculated using 
methods such as the quoted market prices and net present value of future cash flows.  The fair value of 
interest bearing items is estimated based on discounted cash flows using interest rates for items with 
similar terms and characteristics. The fair value of investments traded in organised markets is determined 
by reference to quoted market bid prices.  
 
Impairment of financial assets 
An assessment is made at each statement of financial position date to determine whether there is 
objective evidence that a specific financial asset may be impaired. If such evidence exists, any impairment 
loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.  Impairment is determined as the difference 
between carrying value and the present value of future cash flows discounted at the current market rate of 
return for a similar financial asset.

3 ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS ISSUED BUT NOT EFFECTIVE 
 
The standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the 
Company’s financial statements are disclosed below. The company intends to adopt these standards, if 
applicable, when they become effective. 
 
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 
IFRS 9, as issued, reflects the first phase of the IASB’s work on the replacement of IAS 39 and applies to 
classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities as defined in IAS 39. The 
standard was initially effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, but amendments 
to IFRS 9 Mandatory Effective Date of IFRS 9 and Transition disclosures, issued in December 2011, 
moved the mandatory effective date to 1 January 2015. In subsequent phases, the IASB is addressing 
hedge accounting and impairment of financial assets. The adoption of the first phase of IFRS 9 will not 
have an impact on classification and measurement of the Company’s financial assets and financial 
liabilities.  
 
Investment Entities (Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27) 
These amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 provide an 
exception to the consolidation requirement for entities that meet the definition of an investment entity 
under IFRS 10.The exception to consolidation requires investment entities to account for subsidiaries at 
fair value through profit or loss. It is not expected that this amendment would be relevant to the Company, 
since none of the Company’s subsidiaries would qualify to be an investment entity under IFRS 10. 
 
IAS 32 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities-Amendments to IAS 32 
These amendments clarify the meaning of ‘currently has a legally enforceable right to set-off’ and the 
criteria for non-simultaneous settlement mechanisms of clearing houses to qualify for offsetting. These are 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014. These amendments are not expected to 
be relevant to the Company. 
 
IFRIC Interpretation 21 Levies (IFRIC 21) 
IFRIC 21 clarifies that an entity recognises a liability for a levy when the activity that triggers payment, as 
identified by the relevant legislation, occurs. For a levy that is triggered upon reaching a minimum 
threshold, the interpretation clarifies that no liability should be anticipated before the specified minimum 
threshold is reached. IFRIC 21 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014. The 
Company does not expect that IFRIC 21 will have any material financial impact in future financial 
statements. 
 
IAS 39 Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting-Amendments to IAS 39 
These amendments provide relief from discounting hedge accounting when novation of a derivative 
designated as a hedge instrument meets certain criteria. These amendments are effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014. The amendments have no impact on the Company.

This represents the cost of investment in NMC Healthcare LLC (previous parent company), a wholly 
owned subsidiary held through the holding company subsidiaries NMC Health Holdco Limited and NMC  
Holding Co LLC. As part of the restructuring of NMC Healthcare LLC group, on 28 March 2012, NMC 
Health plc issued shares to the existing shareholders of NMC Healthcare LLC in exchange for shares 
already held in NMC Healthcare LLC. The cost of investment represents the Company’s share of the net 
assets of NMC Healthcare LLC at the date of the group restructuring.  
 
During the year NMC Healthcare LLC issued a promissory note to the Company in respect of the amount 
that it owed to the Company. Subsequently, during the year, agreement was reached between the 
Company and NMC Healthcare LLC, that the obligations which NMC Healthcare LLC had under the terms 
of the promissory note would be released and discharged by the Company in return for the Company 
receiving shares in NMC Healthcare LLC.  Accordingly, NMC Healthcare LLC issued 14,568 shares to the 
Company. The market value of the shares issued was equal to the market value of the inter-company 
debt as at the date of the loan capitalisation of US$ 166,900,000.

12 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
 
The Company’s principal financial liabilities are other payables, arising in the normal course of business. 
The Company’s financial assets include an amount due from a related party and bank balances. The 
company’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and 
foreign currency risk.  
 
Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate 
because of changes in market interest rates. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its bank 
balances only, as the balance due from a related party is interest free, and therefore the Company’s 
exposure to interest rate risk is limited.   
 
Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument, leading to 
a financial loss. The Company’s credit risk arises from amounts due from a related party and bank 
balances.

12 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued 
 
The directors assess the credit quality of the related party by taking into account their financial position, 
past experience and other factors. Management does not expect any losses from non-performance by this 
counterparty, which is a subsidiary of the Company.  
 
The Company limits its credit risk with regard to bank balances by only dealing with reputable banks. The 
credit rating of the bank at which the cash at bank is held is AA+. 
 
Liquidity risk 
The Company’s objective is to maintain sufficient funding to meet its obligations as they fall due.  
 
The table below analyses the Company’s undiscounted financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings

Foreign currency risk 
Foreign currency risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are 
denominated in a currency that is not the entity’s functional currency. 
 
The Company is exposed to currency risk on its other payables denominated in Pound Sterling. Foreign 
currency payable balances included in the statement of financial position denominated in Pound Sterling 
are US$ 571,000 (2012: US$ 1,251,000).  
 
A +/- 5% movement of the US Dollar currency rate against Pound Sterling, with all other variables held 
constant, results in an decrease/increase on the profit for the year of US$ 29,000 (2012: loss of US$ 
63,000).  
 
Fair value estimation 
The fair values of the Company’s financial instruments are not materially different from their carrying 
values at the statement of financial position date.  
 
Financial guarantees: 
The company is a guarantor along with other fellow subsidiary undertakings for US$ 225,000,000 (2012: 
nil) of syndicated loans from JP Morgan raised by its subsidiary NMC Healthcare LLC.

13 DIVIDENDS 
 
In the AGM on 27 June 2013 the shareholders approved a dividend of 4.1 pence per share, amounting to 
GBP 7,614,286 (US$ 11,598,326) paid to shareholders on the Company’s share register on 31 May 2013. 
The dividend was paid on 4 July 2013. No interim dividend was declared during the year. Subject to 
shareholder’s approval, a final dividend of 4.4 pence per share, GBP 8,212,700 (US$ 13,633,000) will be 
paid to shareholders on the Company’s share register on 31 May 2014 
 
 
14 TAX 
The Group operates solely in the United Arab Emirates and as there is no corporation tax in the United 
Arab Emirates, no taxes are recognised or payable on the operations in the UAE. It is the opinion of 
management that there are sufficient losses in the Company to offset any potential taxable income arising 
in the UK and accordingly any tax liability that could arise would be immaterial.

chairman’s statement
We have a clear strategy for growing
the business to create long term value
for all our stakeholders
Financial Performance
I am pleased to be able to report upon
another good set of financial results for
the year to 31 March 2008. Group
revenue increased by 11% to £564m and
headline profit rose 11% to £44.8m. This
improvement reflects strong trading in the
majority of our businesses, the principal
exception being landfill in Belgium which,
as expected, reported a reduced
contribution as new legislative restrictions
came into effect. Adjusted basic earnings
per share improved by 10% to 12.9p after
a reduction in the headline tax rate of 1%
to 32%.
Recognising the improving long term
growth prospects of the Group the Board
in future intends to follow a progressive
dividend policy, which balances earnings
growth and cash generation with the
future investment needs of the Group.
This year your Board is recommending a
final dividend of 4.2p per share which
together with the interim dividend
produces a total dividend of 6.2p, a 5%
increase on last year.
People
The good results for the year reflect the
efforts of all our employees across the
Group. Shanks is a service business and
delivering consistently high levels of
customer service in such an environment
is only possible with a highly committed
workforce. On behalf of the Board I would
like to thank them for their hard work and
commitment.
During the year Tom Drury took over from
Michael Averill as Group Chief Executive.
The Board is very pleased with the smooth
transition and the fresh perspective that
he has brought to the Group. At the
Board’s request Tom undertook a thorough
review of the Group’s activities and we
believe that this has provided us with
clarity of direction and focus for our
investment plans going forward. This is
described in the Chief Executive’s
statement and the Business Overview.
At the end of March 2008 the Head of
our Dutch business Fred Knitel retired
from the Group after 14 years of
dedicated service to Shanks and its
predecessor companies. Fred led the
development of our Dutch business as
managing director from 2000 and was
successful in positioning Shanks as one
of the leading waste management
companies in the Netherlands with a clear
market focus and strong financial
performance. We would like to thank Fred
for his contribution to the Group and wish
him well for the future. 
I am delighted that we were able to
replace Fred through an internal
appointment and on 1 April 2008 Michael
van Hulst was appointed managing
director of the Netherlands. Michael was
previously general manager of Icova, one
of our largest companies in the
Netherlands and has 17 years experience
in the waste industry.
Corporate Responsibility
Shanks operates in a highly regulated
industry which rightly requires high
standards of health and safety and
environmental compliance. It is also an
industry that is undergoing considerable
change and is increasingly seen as an
important contributor to supporting
governments’ efforts to manage
resources and control climate change.
Shanks is committed to playing its fullest
part in this challenge and achieving the
highest professional standards in all its
operations. Whilst we have a proud record
in this area we will continue to examine
ways to improve further our performance
and measure our contribution to a society
based upon more sustainable waste
management techniques. We will be
setting specific targets during 2008. 
It was pleasing during the year to report a
21% reduction in reportable accident rate,
with particular improvements in our
Belgian business. Whilst there were some
enforcement actions by regulators relating
to our environmental permits, these were
relatively minor and our performance
remains good in this area compared to
our peers. Finally, last year we submitted
a response to the Business in the
Environment (BiE) index of corporate
environmental engagement and I am
pleased that we improved our
assessment from a silver to a gold band.
Outlook
The Board is confident concerning the
future prospects for the Group. The full
year effect of the recent decline in landfill
volumes in Belgium should be more than
compensated by improved performances
in the rest of the Group. As a result the
Board continues to expect a good overall
performance in 2009 with increasing
growth thereafter as the Group benefits
from its more focused investment plans.
Adrian Auer
Chairman 4 shanks. annual report 2008
I joined as Group Chief Executive on 
1 October 2007 and since then have
managed to visit all of our major sites in
the Netherlands, Belgium, Canada and
the UK and met many of the people upon
whom we rely for our success. My overall
impression is that Shanks is a great
company to be joining at an exciting time
for the industry. Governments across the
world are urging the waste industry to
support them in recovering more
resources and energy from the things that
society throws away. They are providing
economic incentives to increase recycling
through taxation on landfill and in some
cases incineration, alongside subsidies
for treatment processes that support the
production of renewable energy from
waste. The new European Directive on
Waste currently moving through the
European Parliament will provide further
legislative support for this trend.
Shanks is well placed to prosper in this
changing environment. Our Group
operates in countries with the highest
recycling rates in Europe and has
experience of a number of treatment
processes capable of producing
renewable energy from waste. We have
set ourselves the aspiration to be
regarded as Europe’s leading sustainable
waste management company and will be
working hard over the coming years to
achieve this goal. 
Strategy
Having reviewed the business during my
first six months I believe there is an
exciting opportunity to generate attractive
returns for investors by focusing our
investment around sustainable waste
management in all of the countries in
which we operate. There is sufficient
market opportunity for us to generate high
organic growth rates from such
investment with a lower risk profile than a
growth strategy based solely on
acquisitions. 
Our Group strategy going forward is
therefore a simple one: to deliver organic
growth by investing in assets that support
sustainable waste management and are
capable of delivering attractive returns on
capital. Alongside this we will actively
share expertise and technology across
the Group whilst retaining a very strong
focus on keeping our unit costs amongst
the lowest in the industry. Finally, we will
use acquisitions to improve capacity
utilisation (our “tuck-in” model) or to
secure capabilities that re-orient the
Group to higher growth activities.
The potential for this growth strategy was
shown in this year’s financial results with
all major business units growing well
ahead of inflation other than our Belgian
landfill which, as expected, delivered a
reduced contribution.
Our investments in each of our country
operations during the year reflected the
strategic intent highlighted above.
chief executive’s statement
Our vision is to be Europe’s leading
provider of sustainable waste

The Netherlands
Strategy
Maintain our premium margins and grow
our Solid and Hazardous Waste
businesses ahead of GDP with higher
growth coming from Orgaworld and tuck-in
acquisitions.
Our Dutch business generated a trading
margin of 13% in 2008, a performance
which compares favourably with its peers.
Our goal is to maintain this premium
position whilst growing the business.
The acquisition of Orgaworld in April 2007
for €30m plus a five year earn-out of up
to €20m provides the Group with strong
capabilities to process source segregated
organic waste using advanced composting
or anaerobic digestion technologies.
These are technologies that have very
attractive growth potential in a number of
international markets. Already a leading
player in the Dutch organics market
serving both municipal and commercial
customers, we have been able to achieve
a strong market position in the Canadian
market through the application of
Orgaworld’s composting product. Long
term contracts in Toronto and Ottawa with
a total contract value of approximately
Can$250m were secured during the year.
We are also actively looking to introduce
its products into the UK and Belgian
markets.
We invested a further €18m (including
€3m of deferred payments) in 4 small
tuck-in acquisitions in the Netherlands
aimed at improving capacity utilisation
and increasing our local market share.
Our commitment to keeping at the
forefront of recycling in the Dutch market
was demonstrated by the completion of
an investment of €3m in the latest
recycling technology at our Vliko plant in
Leiderdorp.
Belgium
Strategy 
Grow our Industrial & Commercial (I&C)
Solid Waste business to replace declining
landfill profits by securing competitive
disposal outlets and through renewable
energy production.
In 2008 landfill accounted for around a
third of the Belgian profits, already down
from nearly 50% in 2007. The
contribution from this activity is falling as
the government seeks to ban municipal
biodegradable waste from going to landfill
and we are therefore creating profitable
alternatives by focusing on processing
I&C, organic and wood waste in a way
that creates a fuel source or renewable
energy at a lower overall cost than
traditional alternatives.
We invested in organic growth projects to
produce solid recovered fuel (SRF) from
I&C customers at our Ghent plant and in
the provision of anaerobic digestion and
wastewater treatment at our Roeselare
plant. Both of these will generate energy
from waste and support strong growth for
our non-landfill I&C business in Belgium.
Shortly after the year end we announced
the acquisition of the Foronex Group for a
consideration of €23m. Foronex is a
leading player in the wood waste and by-
products market in the Benelux and a
significant provider of wood based
products to the rapidly growing energy
from biomass marketplace. We see good
opportunities to support the continued
growth of this exciting business and to
access more profitable outlets for the
230,000 tonnes of waste wood we
currently process each year in the
Benelux.
UK
Strategy 
Make Shanks the preferred alternative to
landfill. By establishing a network of
processing centres based on the Shanks
Benelux model.
Having sold its landfill assets in 2004,
Shanks is well positioned to take
advantage of rising landfill taxation to
divert waste we collect to processing
centres that we will create similar to
those in our Benelux businesses. We will
continue to grow our municipal treatment
business through participation in Public
Finance Initiative (PFI) projects.
In November 2007 we completed the
acquisition of Wastecom for £11m to
provide us with advanced recycling
capability in the Kettering area. Building
on the success of recent investments in
Scotland, this further supports our belief
that there is a profitable opportunity in the
UK to develop a strong recycling business
using our expertise from the Benelux. In
April 2008 landfill tax rose by the highest
amount ever (£8 per tonne) on its way to a
target of £48 per tonne by 2010. The
government has confirmed its commitment
to further increases beyond this point and
this provides the right incentive for
investment in recycling and reprocessing
centres. We have targeted three regions in
the UK which in the short to medium term
will provide the geographic focus to build
our business. These are the Central Belt
of Scotland, the East Midlands and the
Northern Home Counties. We have
identified the sites that we would like to
develop and will be applying for planning
permission shortly. These, together with
continued tuck-in acquisitions, will support
the development of a profitable UK
recycling business. 6 shanks. annual report 2008
We continue to believe that the UK PFI
market offers attractive opportunities for
Shanks. Over the next ten years the
government estimates £10bn of funding
will be required to upgrade the
infrastructure needed to divert the
biodegradable municipal solid waste away
from landfill. Shanks has taken a strong
position in the market through its
proposition based upon the innovative
EcoDeco mechanical biological treatment
(MBT) technology. We believe this remains
a very attractive solution to the needs of
local authorities and so creates a strong
pipeline of opportunities as authorities
move to meet their 2010 and 2013
reduction targets. We continue our
negotiations with Cumbria County Council
where we are preferred bidder and expect
this opportunity to reach financial closure
during the current financial year.
Culture
Shanks has a highly decentralised
structure that has allowed it to keep its
central overheads low and maintain an
entrepreneurial culture in its operating
units. This, in my view, has been a
strength of Shanks and one which I
intend to retain. Waste collection and
processing remains essentially a local
business and it is important that decision
making is as close to the customer as
possible. It has also proved an important
factor in persuading entrepreneurial
managers who join the Group through
acquisition to remain with us. 
This said however, our strategy going
forward will be to focus on building
recycling and energy recovery activities
across the Group and it makes good
sense to share the technologies and
years of expertise that we have within the
Group. The Executive Committee, which
consists of the managing directors of the
three countries together with myself and
the Group Finance Director, meets
regularly and part of its remit is to ensure
that such knowledge transfer takes place.
We will focus on specific projects and
opportunities and will not seek to
centralise activities that are best done
locally, thereby avoiding the build-up of
unnecessary overhead. 
Performance
We are committed to producing attractive
returns for the owners of the business.
We have analysed our portfolio and have
identified where the best opportunities for
maximising returns on capital employed
(ROCE) are. Whilst our current overall
ROCE of 12% is ahead of our weighted
average cost of capital (WACC), we believe
that we can and should generate greater
returns from our capital base and will be
looking for our new investments to
contribute to this improvement alongside
improving the cash generation and
profitability of our underlying existing
businesses.
Tom Drury
Group Chief Executive 
chief executive’s statement continued shanks. annual report 2008 7
As last year much of the background
information remains unchanged. This is
repeated below, updated where
appropriate.
Each year the Group reviews its strategy.
This year, following the appointment of
Tom Drury as Group Chief Executive in
October 2007, a more in depth exercise
was undertaken. In order to give a clearer
understanding of the Group’s strategy this
section has been expanded.
The European Waste Market
Waste management is an essential
service. In societies where there is a high
level of regulation and enforcement, it is a
sophisticated industry using advanced
technologies. In societies with little or no
regulation or enforcement, waste tends to
be treated indiscriminately. 
In the European Union (EU) the level of
environmental regulation is high, however
unlike trade regulations, there are no
common standards for waste
management. EU legislation on waste
sets minimum standards which member
nations must meet, however they are free
to exceed these standards in order to
follow their own political and
environmental agendas. The result is that,
within the EU, national regulations differ
and there is no single market.
The waste management market can be
subdivided into non-hazardous and
hazardous waste. The former tends to be
a local business, as the relatively low unit
cost of treatment makes transport a
significant part of the overall cost.
Hazardous waste treatment costs tend to
be higher making it a more regional
business.
Both the public and the private sector are
active in the waste market. The degree of
privatisation varies across Europe; it is
high in the UK and France but lower in
Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium.
Advancing EU legislation is necessitating
substantial investment in new
infrastructure. This investment combined
with budgetary constraints is driving
privatisation initiatives in many EU
countries. Within the private sector,
consolidation of the industry has been a
feature for many years. The new
infrastructure requirements and the long
term nature of the business have recently
attracted infrastructure funds.
Within the national markets a further
distinction may be made between
“collection, transfer and recycling” and
“treatment and disposal”. The former has
historically had low barriers to entry and
hence has been made up of many small
participants. Increasing recycling requires
greater investment in infrastructure which
is moving this market towards the larger
players. Treatment and disposal have high
barriers to entry as facilities tend to be
capital intensive and projects have long
gestation periods. These activities are
therefore the domain of well capitalised
companies, and are populated by a few
large players, often multinationals. 
The markets may also be split between
the industrial and commercial (I&C) sector
and the municipal sector. In most EU
countries the municipalities have a
statutory duty to deal with household
waste, which they either do themselves or
use private sector contractors. They have
no such duty in respect of I&C waste. The
municipal sector is therefore typified by
long-term contracts which tend to be 5 to
10 years for collection and often in
excess of 20 years for treatment and
disposal. The I&C sector tends to be a
much more short term market, with
contracts in excess of a couple of years
being rare.
Market Trends and Drivers
In Europe, and indeed elsewhere in the
world, the general market trend can be
summarised as:
“Less waste, more materials recovery,
energy from waste and much less
landfill”
The high level factors behind this are
climate change, soaring fossil fuel prices
and increasing environmental awareness,
specifically an increasing appreciation
within society of the need to develop
sustainable waste solutions. These
factors are driving a convergence between
the waste, energy intensive and power
industries.
In terms of specific legislative and market
drivers these can be summarised as
follows:
The European Landfill Directive –
biodegradable waste in landfill is a major
source of methane emissions to the
atmosphere. Methane is a potent
greenhouse gas with 25 times the impact
of a carbon dioxide emission of the same
mass. A key objective of this directive is
to significantly reduce the landfilling of
biodegradable waste, a major component
of municipal waste, that is landfilled by
European member states. The directive
also aims to reduce the polluting impact
of landfills by substantially restricting
other types of waste that may be
landfilled.
business overview 8 shanks. annual report 2008
Landfill tax is a significant mechanism
being used by many European states to
drive waste out of landfill to more
environmentally acceptable options such
as recycling and energy recovery.
Soaring energy prices have increased the
pressure to find alternative fuels; waste is
one of these.
Carbon emissions quotas have further
increased the cost of using fossil fuels.
Waste derived fuels can be exempt from
carbon emissions calculations, increasing
interest in this source of fuel.
Renewable electricity – many waste
based electricity generation projects
qualify for renewable electricity subsidies
and credits, available in various forms
across Europe. This is because a major
component of waste derived fuels
comprises renewable short carbon cycle
materials, e.g. wood, paper, and other
vegetable matter.
European Waste Directive – this is
currently being revised and the changes
should be endorsed by the European
Parliament during the course of 2008. It
is likely this will impose even higher
targets on recycling and energy recovery
from waste on European member states
going forwards.
The effects of these drivers vary from
country to country. 
The Netherlands
The Netherlands has had some of the
most advanced environmental legislation
in Europe in place for some time. They
also have high levels of landfill tax
(currently €88 per tonne). These, together
with the geological characteristics of the
country, have resulted in a low reliance on
landfill, incineration being the
predominant final disposal route. The
higher cost and limited capacity of final
disposal outlets has made sorting and
recycling in the Netherlands more viable
and it is not uncommon for recycling rates
to be 70% or above. The Dutch market is
therefore relatively stable and not subject
to major changes.
Belgium
In Belgium, environmental responsibility is
devolved to the three Regions: Flanders,
Wallonia and Brussels. Flemish
environmental legislation and landfill tax
levels are very similar to those in the
Netherlands resulting in similar market
characteristics; high levels of recycling, a
reliance on incineration for final disposal
and very little landfill.
In the Walloon Region landfill tax on I&C
waste at an effective rate of €53 per
tonne is sufficient to drive reasonable
high levels of recycling. This rate will rise
to €90 per tonne in 2010, which
combined with a lack of incineration
capacity will promote increased recycling
and other forms of energy recovery. The
effective cost of landfill tax is 52% higher
than the actual tax because it is non-
deductible for corporation tax purposes.
In January 2008 new legislation was
introduced which has had a major impact
on the municipal waste treatment sector.
Prior to January 2008 a reasonable
proportion of municipal waste was still
landfilled as, unlike I&C waste, it
attracted very little landfill tax. In January
2008 the Walloon Region adopted a strict
interpretation of the Landfill Directive
requirement for pre-treatment of non-
hazardous waste which stopped residual
waste collected from households from
being landfilled without pre-treatment. At
the same time landfill tax was introduced
on other municipal waste streams at €20
per tonne. This is scheduled to rise to
€60 per tonne in 2010.
The Brussels Region has little landfill
capacity. It has its own incinerator but
beyond that it is reliant on the other
Regions for final disposal.
UK
The UK’s historical heavy reliance on
landfill means that the imposition of the
European Landfill Directive is having a
major impact, particularly on the
municipal sector. Implementation of the
directive implies that some 14 million
tonnes per annum of biodegradable
municipal waste needs to be diverted
from landfill between 2006 and 2020. In
November 2006 DEFRA estimated that
the investment in new infrastructure
required to achieve this is between £9bn
and £11bn. In an endeavour to secure
least cost compliance the Government
has introduced the Landfill Allowance
Trading Scheme (LATS), a tradeable
permit scheme between local authorities.
Here authorities who overachieve against
their landfill diversion requirements may
sell their overachievement to an
underachieving authority. Failure by an
authority either to meet its diversion
requirements or to secure the necessary
LATS, results in a £150 per tonne penalty
for the excess.
In parallel, the government has stated
that landfill tax will increase. Landfill tax
is one of the primary drivers for diverting
I&C waste. In the 2007 Budget the
Government increased the annual landfill
tax escalator from £3 per tonne per
annum to £8 starting in April 2008 and
committed to keeping it at this level until
April 2010. In the 2008 Budget it was
indicated that landfill tax may continue to
rise post 2010. This means that UK
landfill tax, which increased to £32 per
business overview continued shanks. annual report 2008 9
tonne in April 2008, will rise to £48 per
tonne in 2010, a similar amount to the
tax on I&C waste in the Benelux.
Another driver for the I&C waste market is
restriction of the type of waste that can
be landfilled. A significant milestone of
the European Landfill Directive is the
restriction on landfilling of untreated non-
hazardous waste. The government has
introduced new legislation which required
pre-treatment of non-hazardous waste
prior to landfilling from October 2007.
Whilst the authorities have taken a fairly
soft handed approach to the enforcement
of this legislation initially, it is expected it
will become more assiduous in the future. 
Canada
As part of the Orgaworld acquisition
completed in April 2007 the Group
acquired a start up operation in Canada.
In Canada there is strong public opinion
against landfill, which in some areas has
led to a shortage of consented capacity.
Like in Europe therefore there is a drive
to reduce waste going to landfill.
Orgaworld identified an opportunity in the
Canadian market to offer biological
treatment of source segregated organic
municipal waste, a market which has
significant potential in terms of volumes
and to date has few competitors.
Strategy
Group Vision
“To be Europe’s leading provider of
sustainable waste management
solutions.”
This will be achieved by firmly positioning
the Group in the Recycling and Energy
Recovery area of the Waste Hierarchy
(see Figure 1).
Corporate strategy
• Invest to drive organic growth where
returns are greatest.
• Develop our infrastructure further to
support sustainable waste management
and conversion of waste to renewable
energy.
• Share core capabilities and
technologies across the Group.
• Maximise asset utilisation and
minimise unit costs.
• Continue to use acquisitions to improve
asset utilisation and re-orient the
portfolio to high growth markets.
This provides a strong corporate
framework for clear individual country
strategies.
Dutch Strategy
The strategic goal for the Dutch
operations is to maintain the premium
operating margins we currently enjoy and
to grow both the Solid and Hazardous
Waste businesses ahead of gross
domestic product. This will be achieved
by: 
• maintaining the current decentralised
structure and culture but seeking out
greater benefits from collaboration
between the business units;
• upgrading existing recycling facilities to
improve their efficiency and thereby
maintain our market leadership in
processing costs;
• focusing on new niche mono-stream
markets such as the depleted growth
media from the Dutch greenhouse
industry we already process;
• continue the successful track record of
tuck-in acquisitions;
• maintain the current strong cash
generation from the business.
In addition the recent Orgaworld
acquisition provides significant
opportunities for higher rates of growth in
the organic waste treatment sector not
only in the Netherlands, but also in the
UK, Belgium and Canada.
Belgian Strategy
In Belgium the strategy is to grow the I&C
Solid Waste business to replace the
declining contribution from landfill. By
focusing on solid recovered fuel (SRF)
production from I&C waste we will be able
to create sustainable competitive
advantage by securing long term energy
from waste outlets at lower costs than
landfill or mass burn incineration (€120-
€130/tonne).
The recent acquisition of Foronex builds
on this strategy by moving us into the
European waste wood processing market
which creates further opportunities in the
biomass and co-generation areas with the
potential for Shanks to both supply and
invest in energy from waste projects.
There are also further opportunities to
invest in additional green energy
production at our landfill and hazardous
waste plants.
UK Strategy
In the UK the aim is to make Shanks the
preferred alternative to landfill. In the I&C
waste area we will build a resource
management and reprocessing business
with improved margins by importing more
than ten years of Dutch know-how in this
area. Initially we will focus on building
density in the three regions where we
already have critical mass, Scotland, the
East Midlands and the Northern Home
Counties. 
We will continue to bid for PFI residual
waste contracts, using those that we win
as a base from which to expand our I&C
business. At the same time we intend to
secure a share of the significant UK
demand for anaerobic digestion and

composting both in the municipal and I&C
sectors using the Orgaworld and other
technologies as appropriate.
Having established an enabling platform
of a strong regional business with a
differentiated and profitable business
model, we may then consider more
aggressive consolidation options.
Key Objectives
The key objectives over the coming three
years are:
• Grow UK Solid Waste trading margins
(post overheads) to a high single digit
percentage;
• Launch Orgaworld in the UK;
• Grow trading profit from non-landfill
Belgium business by an average of 15%
per annum;
• Win PFI contracts in the UK increasing
residual municipal waste under
management to 1.5m tonnes per
annum (currently 0.6m tonnes).
By achieving the above the Group will
maintain strong underlying organic growth.
Principal Risks and their Mitigation
The performance of our I&C businesses is
linked to the economic activity in the
sectors we serve. We are therefore
exposed to fluctuations in these sectors
across our national markets. We mitigate
this risk by diversifying our customer base
where possible.
In addition to this general economic risk
there are a number of waste industry
specific risks:
Environmental Legislation and its
Interpretation
As already mentioned, regulation is a key
driver of the waste market. The ability of
individual countries, and indeed regions in
the case of Belgium, to set their own
legislation makes this a very complex field.
This is further complicated by the rapid
rate of change in legislation resulting from
the increased profile of environmental
issues. Changes in the legislation or its
interpretation can have a significant and
far reaching impact on markets. The Group
endeavours to mitigate this risk by
employing high quality management in
each of our divisions to influence the
evolving legislative framework. We
therefore actively lobby for our interests at
European, National and Regional levels.
Environmental Compliance
All operating sites and activities are
regulated by environmental authorities in
line with the requirements set out within
licences and permits. These licences and
permits are required to carry on the
business, therefore the negotiation of,
and compliance with, their terms is of
paramount importance. Maintaining the
highest environmental standards is also
important to ensure continuing
acceptance of operations by host
communities, and to satisfy customers.
Details of how the Group monitors and
controls environmental compliance are
given in the Corporate Responsibility
section. 
Health and Safety
The waste management industry is
recognised as one of the most hazardous
sectors in which to work. Shanks’
employees are the Group's most
important and valuable asset and their
health and safety is paramount. As a
result the Group devotes considerable
management resources to ensuring the
highest health and safety practices are
imposed and maintained.
Details can be found in the Corporate
Responsibility section under Health and
Safety.
The Pace of the UK Municipal Waste
Contracts Tender Process
Significant resources are devoted to the
bidding process due to the size and
complexity of these contracts. A
consequence is that there are often
unforeseen delays in, and in extreme
cases, cancellation of the process. As the
investment in the bidding process is only
recouped in the event a contract is won,
the Group regularly reviews the risks and
rewards. The Group also tries to have its
advisors work on a contingency fee basis
wherever possible, and restrict
expenditure in the early stage of a bid
when the certainty of success is less.
Activities and Structure
The Group is a major player in the
Netherlands, Belgium and the UK. There
are also some operations in France close
to the Belgian border which are managed
from Belgium. Due to their small size these
are combined with the Belgian operations.
In April 2007 the Group acquired
Orgaworld, a Dutch business specialising
in the treatment of source segregated
organic waste streams from both the
municipal and I&C sectors. The business
uses in-house tunnel composting and
anaerobic digestion technologies some of
which are patented. The acquisition also
included a start up operation in Canada,
which is currently small but has
significant growth potential. This has
therefore expanded our geographical
presence to Canada.
The Group’s organisational structure
reflects the national nature of the
markets in which it operates, with
divisions in the Netherlands, Belgium, UK
and Canada. Management of the Group is
decentralised to ensure that the people
making the decisions are close to, and
understand, their markets. This structure
is underpinned by strong central financial
business overview continued shanks. annual report 2008 11
control. Throughout the organisation we
employ high calibre management who are
properly trained and motivated.
Table 1 summarises the Group’s waste
activities in each country and table 2
shows how these activities are grouped in
the segmental reporting.
In addition to the waste activities detailed
above we also operate a sand quarry
adjacent to our landfill site in Wallonia and
have small infrastructure and groundworks
operations in Ghent in Belgium and
Amersfoort in the Netherlands. Due to
their small size the infrastructure and
groundworks activities are reported as
part of the Solid Waste activities.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The Group’s KPIs can be divided into
three categories, health and safety,
environmental and operational. 
Health and Safety
Reporting of Injuries Diseases and
Dangerous Occurrences Regulations
(RIDDOR) is UK law which requires
companies to report specified more
serious accidents and incidents to the
Health and Safety Executive. While
RIDDOR is UK law the Group requires all
of its operations, no matter which country
they are based in, to report monthly to this
common format. Minor incidents are also
reported. The minor and RIDDOR KPIs for
the current and prior years are given in the
Health and Safety section.
Environmental
The Group closely monitors compliance
with environmental permits at locations.
All issues are reviewed at monthly
divisional meetings and, at least
quarterly, at Group Board level. Details of
convictions during 2008 are given in the
Environment section.
Operational
The number of waste activities undertaken
by the Group is significant, with each site
involved in differing ranges of activities.
The performance indicators used to
monitor these activities are varied and
range from lifts per day, lifts per kilometre
and tonnes per lift for collection activities,
to input and output tonnages and final
elimination diversion rates for treatment
and recycling activities. Also, even where
two sites perform similar activities, the
type of customer or urban characteristics
of the area the site serves may be quite
different. The result is that whilst non-
financial measures are extremely important
at an activity or site level, they are of very
limited value when aggregated across sites
or activities. For this reason the KPIs used
at a regional or country level are financial
in nature, being those common to most
businesses namely revenue, trading profit,
cash flows and return on capital employed.
Details of these for the main business
units are included in the Operating Review
section.

In order to come into line with general
practice amongst listed companies we
have redefined our headline profit to
exclude amortisation of intangible assets,
excluding landfill void and computer
software, arising on acquisition. This
charge is also excluded from operating
profit in the derivation of trading profit.
The definitions of these two financial
measures therefore become:
Trading Profit – operating profit before
amortisation of acquisition intangibles
and exceptional items;
Headline Profit – profit before tax,
amortisation of acquisition intangibles
and exceptional items, where the latter
includes the IAS 39 finance income or
charge relating to the mark to market of
interest rate swaps on PFI borrowings.
In the years prior to 2007 the impact of
this reclassification is immaterial.
Due to the significant impact of
movements in foreign currency exchange
rates, commentary on the operating
performance of the Netherlands and
Belgium businesses has been given in
Euros to demonstrate the underlying
trading performance.
Thanks are once again due to the staff
who have responded superbly to the
industry’s rapidly changing conditions to
deliver a 18% improvement in trading
profit which increased £8.6m to £55.9m
(2007: £47.3m). Tables 3 and 4 and

The Netherlands
Trading profit in the Netherlands improved
18% to £37.7m (2007: £32.0m) of which
£1.4m (4%) is attributable to exchange.
Tables 5 and 6 provide a breakdown by
activity of the key financial performance
indicators.
In Solid Waste four tuck-in acquisitions
were completed during the year for a total
gross consideration of €18m (including
€3m of deferred payments). These
combined with the full year effect of last
year’s acquisitions contributed some
€2.9m of additional trading profit. The full
year effect of the acquisition of Smink
Beheer BV on 30 June 2006 was
relatively modest as last year’s result
benefited from a large job during the
months immediately following the
acquisition.
Profits from the existing Solid Waste
businesses have improved slightly by 1%.
There have been a number of factors
contributing to this performance. In May
2007 the Amsterdam municipal
incinerator commissioned an additional
0.6m tonnes per annum of capacity. A
significant proportion of this capacity has
been taken by the major waste
companies, including Shanks, on long
term agreements at a rate below current
market rates. This has increased
competitive pressure for commercial
volumes in the market place. The
construction industry, a major source of
customers, remains buoyant although
competition for volumes has also
increased here as operators from outside
the Randstad area, attracted by the new
lower incineration prices in Amsterdam,
backload construction and demolition
waste for recycling. Spiralling fuel costs
and increasing labour costs have also put
pressure on margins.
Our Hazardous Waste activities performed
extremely well during the year showing a
9% year on year improvement. Our
industrial cleaning business Reym
continued to benefit from increased
activity in the petrochemical sector,
stimulated by ever increasing oil prices.
ATM, our one million tonne per annum
treatment facility in the south of the
Netherlands, benefited from buoyant
market conditions with increases in both
volumes and prices.
In April 2007 the Group acquired the
organic waste treatment business,
Orgaworld, for a gross consideration of
€30m, €5m of which is deferred, with the
potential for further payments up to €20m
dependent on future profits growth. The
bulk of the business is in the
Netherlands, however it also included a
start up operation in Canada more detail
of which is given below. The Dutch
operations have performed slightly below
the acquisition plan following the
contamination of a batch of inputs at one
of its anaerobic digestion plants. This
issue has now been resolved and
performance is back in line with our
acquisition plan.

Trading profit reduced 6% on last year to
£16.2m (2007: £17.3m). This reduction
is net of a £0.6m (3%) increase due to
exchange.  Tables 7 and 8 provide a
breakdown by activity of the key financial
performance indicators.
Solid Waste has performed extremely well
during the period aided by a significant
industrial disposal contract and progress
on prices. During the year two small tuck-
in acquisitions with a combined gross
consideration of €1m were completed.
These together with the full year effect of
last year’s acquisition account for €0.5m
(6%) of the trading profit increase.
As predicted in previous reports, the
contribution from our Landfill & Power
business has declined sharply in the year
ended 31 March 2008. Several factors
contributed to this: bonus volumes
received in the prior year did not repeat;
increased competition from other landfills
in the region resulted in lost inputs and
finally, from January 2008 the Walloon
Region introduced new restrictions on the
landfilling of municipal waste further
reducing inputs in the last quarter.
Landfill volumes are now believed to have
stabilised, however next year is likely to
show a further decline in profitability due
to the full year effect of the current
reduced inputs. In the longer term we
expect a further decline in landfill profits
as landfill tax is increased and further
restrictions come into force from 2010.
Hazardous Waste, whilst still generating
reasonable returns on invested capital,
had a difficult start to the year due to stiff
competition. In the last quarter this has
eased and the outlook is now more
promising.
At the sand quarry volumes were down
due to reduced construction activities in
the surrounding area.

Trading profit in the UK improved 109% to
£6.9m (2007: £3.3m). £3.4m of this
increase is attributable to the operations
which increased 77% to £7.8m, the
remaining £0.2m is due to lower PFI
bidding costs. Tables 9 and 10 provide a
breakdown by activity of the key financial
performance indicators.
Solid Waste improved significantly on prior
year with £1.3m (28%) of the increase
coming from organic growth mainly driven
by pricing. Acquisitions contributed a
further £0.5m (11%) with a full year’s
contribution from the 2007 Scottish
acquisitions and four months of
contribution from the current year
acquisition of Wastecom Ltd, a recycling
business in the East Midlands acquired
for a gross consideration of £11m.
Across the board recycling levels are
increasing as we move towards our
Benelux model of collection fleets feeding
large regional recycling centres which
allow waste to be diverted from landfill to
more cost effective outlets. We see this
as a significant competitive advantage as
the market shifts to accommodate the
escalation in the rate of landfill tax; now
at £32 per tonne and scheduled to
increase by £8 per tonne per annum for
at least the next two years.
Landfill & Power improved due to
increased waste inputs and additional
green electricity production at our
Avondale joint venture, in Scotland.
Hazardous Waste, which comprises our
Contaminated Land Services business,
improved due to the contribution from our
“soil hospital” outside Edinburgh, which
opened in May 2007. The performance
fell short of expectations due to a delay
in work from the clean up of the sites for
the 2012 London Olympics which has
started in the final quarter but only
contributed £0.1m of trading profit in the
year.
The innovative Mechanical Biological
Treatment (MBT) facilities used at two
sites on the East London Waste Authority
(ELWA) PFI contract and one on the
Dumfries and Galloway (D&G) contract are
now fully operational. At ELWA the
scheduled significant increase in gate fee
came into effect in July 2007, which
substantially increased the cash inflows
from the contract. This only produced a
limited uplift on trading profit as under
IFRS accounting most of the increased
income is allocated to repayment of the
financial asset and the interest thereon.
Interest from the cement and other
energy intensive industries in the SRF
produced by the MBT process continues
to increase and we have a secured long
term outlet contract for 50,000 tonnes
per annum, with negotiations at an
advanced stage for a further 150,000
tonnes. Whilst profits on our ELWA and
Argyll and Bute (A&B) contracts are
improving, these increases have been
offset by a set back at D&G due to an
interruption of inputs to a cement kiln in
North Wales following a problem at the
plant unrelated to the processing of SRF.
This has resulted in a temporary increase

in disposal costs for the contract. The
operators of the facility in North Wales
have made significant progress with
repairs and it is expected that the kiln will
be functioning again during the first
quarter of the 2009 financial year. At the
same time we are also pursuing
alternative outlets for this SRF stream.
Country Central Services costs of £5.7m
were net of disposal profits totalling
£0.6m relating to several small surplus
property sales. A similar amount was
included in the 2007 cost of £5.4m.
Canada
As mentioned above the acquisition of
Orgaworld in the Netherlands included a
start up operation in Canada. At the time
of the acquisition in April 2007 Orgaworld
had already secured a 10 year contract
with the City of York in Ontario to treat
33,000 tonnes per annum of source
segregated organic municipal waste using
tunnel composting. Since acquisition two
further contracts have been won, a five
year contract for Toronto for 70,000
tonnes per annum and a 20 year contract
for Ottawa for 100,000 tonnes per
annum. The construction of a facility in
London Ontario to process York’s waste
was underway at the time of acquisition
and started accepting waste in June
2007. This facility is currently being
extended to handle the Toronto waste
resulting in a combined facility capable of
processing 150,000 tonnes per annum.
The Ottawa contract will be serviced from
a second Can$15m facility capable of
processing 100,000 tonnes per annum in
the outskirts of Ottawa. This is scheduled
to be operational in summer 2009.
Group Central Services
Group Central Services costs reduced by
£0.3m to £5.0m (2007: £5.3m) due to
the non repeat of recruitment costs
experienced last year associated with the
appointment of new Board Directors.
The major factors impacting revenue,
trading and headline profit are
summarised in table 12. Operating profit,
which includes exceptional property
disposals in the UK of £1.9m and
amortisation of acquisition intangibles
has increased 20% to £55.3m (2007:
£46.2m).

denominated profits; the impact on the
Euro denominated year end balances is
much more substantial at 17%. The
Group only entered Canada during the
current year so there has been no impact
year on year.
Net Financial Income from PFI increased
to £0.7m (2007: £0.1m). As shown in
table 14 this comprises interest income
on financial assets arising on the UK PFI
contracts net of the interest charge on
the PFI net debt before taking into
account the International Financial
Reporting Standard IAS 39 change in
market value of financial instruments.
The £1.1m increase in interest income
from financial assets results from the
increase in the financial asset value
driven by ongoing capital expenditure,
principally on the ELWA project. The
£0.5m increase in interest charge on PFI
net debt reflects the higher average level
of debt during 2008 than during 2007,
despite the balance being lower at the
year end than at the start of the year. PFI
net debt rose during the first nine months
as it funded the ongoing PFI capital
expenditure, then in December 2007, the
Group injected £23m of subordinated
debt and equity into the ELWA PFI
company which was used to repay project
funding causing the fall at the year end.
Core Finance Charges increased £4.7m to
£11.8m (2007: £7.1m), the main
components of which are given in table 15.
The major factors behind the increase in
the finance charge on core borrowings are
detailed in table 16.
The factors behind the increase in the
level of core borrowing are covered in the
cash flow section below. For reasons
explained in the Treasury section, a
significant proportion of the Group’s
borrowings is in Euros and therefore
attracts Euro denominated interest. The
Sterling value of this has therefore
increased due to the strengthening of the
Euro. Over the last two years the Group
has opted to leave a significant
proportion of the debt on variable interest
rates due to the forward profile of interest
rate curves. The variable rate borrowings 18 shanks. annual report 2008
are at a margin over the London Inter
Bank Offer Rates (LIBOR) the annual
averages of which have risen by nearly
30% over the last two years as
demonstrated in chart 2.
Under IFRS all long term liabilities and
provisions, except for deferred tax, have to
be stated at current value. This involves
discounting the nominal value of a future
liability which then unwinds as time
progresses. The Group uses a 5% discount
rate, this being an estimate of long term
interest rates. The acquisition of Orgaworld
in April 2007 included a €25m deferred
element, €20m of which is dependent on
achieving future profitability targets. The
conditional element has been recognised
in full at the acquisition date so is
generating a significant finance charge
even though the trading profits on which it
depends will only arise in the future.
The average tax rate on headline profit fell
to 32% (2007: 33%). This was attributable
to a full year of the reduction in the Dutch
headline rate from 29.6% to 25.5% in
January 2007. The underlying rates of tax
in the UK and Belgium remained
unchanged at 30% and 34% respectively.
In Belgium the effective rate on landfill
derived profits is higher as landfill tax is
non-deductible for corporation tax. This is
mitigated via a deduction for notional
interest on Belgian equity. 
The exceptional disposal profits of £1.9m
relate to the disposal of two surplus
properties in the UK. These have been
excluded from headline profit due to their
exceptional size. There was no tax
payable on these disposals as the capital
gains arising were sheltered by significant
brought forward capital tax losses within
the Group.

The IAS 39 change in market value of
financial instruments relates to interest
rate swaps which fix the interest rate on
PFI contract borrowing. At the financial
close of a PFI contract the price of the
service is determined by, inter alia, the
long term interest rate available in the
market. The Group therefore protects
itself against future fluctuations in
interest rates by entering into interest
rate swaps to match its future cash
inflows and outflows. Under IAS 39 these
swaps must be valued at current market
value irrespective of the commercial
reasons for entering into them.
Revaluation of these swaps can lead to
large accounting gains or losses but does
not affect the long term profitability of the
contract as the Group has matched its
long term revenue and costs. Whilst IAS
39 does allow these gains and losses to
be taken directly to reserves, it is on the
proviso that onerous verification
requirements are fulfilled. The Group
believes it is not worth expending
significant resources fulfilling these
requirements in respect of an item that
does not reflect commercial reality. These
changes in value are excluded from our
headline profit. There was a £2.9m
adverse (2007: £6.9m favourable) change
in the market value of these swaps during
the year.
Cash Flow
Details of the Group’s cash flow
performance are summarised in Table 17
below.
The underlying cash generated by the
core business was £21m after net capital
expenditure of £42m. The £22m cross
funding represents the net cash flow
between the core and PFI activities
(including the PFI bid team) the major
element of this was the injection of £23m
of subordinated debt and equity into the
ELWA PFI company mentioned above. The
£48m outflow on acquisitions is the
amount paid plus £21m of net debt in the
acquired entities. There was a £32m
adverse movement on the translation of
Group’s Euro denominated debt into
Sterling, giving an overall increase in core
net debt of £79m.
The non-recourse aggregated net debt in
the PFI companies, excluding fair value of
interest rate swaps, reduced by £12m to
£111m (2007: £123m); increases due to
funding of ongoing capital investment
principally at ELWA being offset by a
repayment resulting from the £23m equity
and subordinated debt injection into the
ELWA PFI company.
Capital Expenditure
The Group spent £51m net on capital
expenditure (2007: £66m) of which £42m
was in the core business and £9m on PFI
contracts. The core business
maintenance capital expenditure was
£32m, net of disposal proceeds of £2m
from assets being replaced. Gross
expenditure on growth projects was £14m
and proceeds from sale of surplus assets
was £4m. Major projects in the core
business included the installation of SRF
production facilities in Belgium,
construction of tunnel composting
facilities in Canada, the expansion of a

The capital expenditure on PFI contracts
comprised £17m (2007: £31m) of
financial asset advances net of £9m
(2007: £1m) of financial asset
repayments and £1m of capitalised bid
costs relating to the Cumbria contract
where we are preferred bidder. The
financial asset advances related
principally to the completion of the MBT
facilities at our ELWA and D&G contracts.
The £8m increase in the repayments
reflected the step up in the ELWA gate fee
in July 2007 mentioned in the Operating
Review above.
Treasury
The Group’s treasury policy is to use
financial instruments with a spread of
maturity dates and sources in order to
reduce funding risk. Borrowings are drawn
in the same currencies as the underlying
investment to reduce cash and net
translation exposure on exchange rate
movements. No other currency hedging
mechanisms are used. The Group
maintains a significant proportion of its
debt on fixed rates of interest in order to
protect interest cover.
The Group’s principal financing is a
£250m multicurrency revolving credit
facility with five major banks expiring in
April 2010. Adjusting for cash on deposit,
this facility was less than 65% utilised at
31 March 2008. The 2001 notes issued
under the Group’s private placement of
£41m have maturity dates between 2009
and 2013. The Group also has £27m of
working capital facilities with various
banks.
Each of the Group’s PFI projects has
senior debt facilities which contribute
approximately 85% of the capital funding
required. These facilities are secured on
the future cash flows of the PFI
companies with no recourse to the Group
as a whole. Repayment of these facilities,
and any equity bridge facility in respect of
the remaining capital funding, commences
when construction is complete and
concludes one to two years prior to the
expiry of the PFI contract period. As the
Group currently holds 100% of the equity
in its PFI companies, the net debt of
£111m is fully consolidated in the Group
balance sheet. The maximum which could
be drawn down under these facilities at
31 March 2008 is £18m.
Insurance
The Group places all its insurance with
leading insurance companies with sound
financial credentials. For obligatory
insurances, the policy is to obtain the
necessary cover at competitive rates. For
other areas, regular risk assessments are
undertaken to identify and assess risks;
where appropriate insurance is then used
to mitigate these risks. The level of cover
put in place will depend on the nature of
the risks and the cost and extent of cover
available in the market. The majority of
our insurances are renewed annually.
The Group uses renowned international
brokers to advise on risk management,
appropriate insurers, cover levels and
benchmarking.
Insurance requirements for our UK PFI
contracts are set out in the funding and
project agreements.
Pensions
The Group uses IAS 19 Employee
Benefits to account for pensions. The
pension charge for the year has increased
to £7.7m (2007: £6.6m). Using
assumptions laid down in IAS 19 there
was a net retirement benefit surplus of
£9.4m (2007: £8.4m deficit). This relates
solely to the defined benefit section of
our UK schemes. The defined benefit
section of the UK scheme was closed to
new members in September 2002 and
new employees are now offered a defined
contribution arrangement. 
The pension arrangements within our
Belgian and Dutch operations are
considered to be defined contribution in
nature.
financial review continued shanks. annual report 2008 21
Environmental legislation, both European
and national, plays a critical role in
determining how all companies operate.
This is particularly so for waste
management companies and large
portions of environmental law are aimed
specifically at the industry. Such
legislation does not only pose a threat in
terms of penalties, but also shapes the
commercial environment within which the
Group operates. Few other industries can
see such a direct link between the law
and how they run their business.
Waste management, whilst an essential
service, is not always a popular industry
and companies which operate in the
sector have to be conscious of public and
political perception. Simply complying with
legislation is not sufficient and we
consider it a minimum requirement rather
than an ultimate goal.
While the Group is subject to the same
health and safety and employment law as
other companies, the potential impacts
for those involved in waste management
are higher than for most other industry
sectors.  Waste management is
acknowledged to be one of the highest
risk industries a company can operate in,
with fatal and serious accident rates at
least as high as those for construction,
agriculture and other sectors with known
elevated risk profiles. 
Virtually all of Shanks operations need to
hold local licences, permits and other
permissions to operate. These
permissions determine the basic criteria
under which a waste management site
can operate, such as how much and what
types of waste a site is allowed to accept,
its opening and closing times, restrictions
on noise, emissions and other key
parameters. Failure to abide by the
conditions of local permissions can result
in them being withdrawn and the site
being closed or restricted in its
operations.
Beyond the potential closure of existing
facilities, each time the Group wishes to
expand a site’s operations, such as by
accepting greater volumes of waste or a
different waste type, it must apply for a
variation to that facility’s local
permissions. The same applies to new
sites which must obtain the appropriate
local permissions before being allowed to
operate.
Waste management companies with a
poor enforcement record or those which
have attracted public or political concern
will find it more difficult to obtain and
revise local permissions than businesses
which have a more positive image. Of
course new or expanded waste
management facilities will never be
popular; at best they are often viewed as
a necessary evil. However, a waste
management concern with a positive
image is far more likely to be successful
in gaining the permissions it needs to
operate and expand.
One of the greatest potential impacts on
image for a waste management company
is the attitudes displayed and approach
taken by its local employees. A company
may have high quality management
systems and good intentions, but if local
management and operational employees
do not reflect this corporate ethic the
outcome will be poor local image. The
development, training, competence and
attitudes of local employees is therefore
of crucial importance to the Group to
ensure we maintain highly motivated
corporate responsibility Table 18

good local image is well appreciated by
the Group.
It is only by taking such a pro-active
approach, going beyond simple
compliance, that the Group will fulfil its
ambitions as a sustainable and
developing waste management company.
The Environment
Waste management and the environment
are intrinsically linked not only in public
and political perception, but in reality as
this is an industry whose actions can
have a direct and serious impact on the
environment. The Group aims to minimise
any detrimental impact its activities may
have on the environment. The Group’s
over-arching environmental policy is
available on the Group’s web site and
further details of individual environmental
management systems are available by
contacting the Group.
All of the Group’s sites operate under
strict environmental management
systems, many of which have been
accredited to the international ISO14001
environmental management standard.
Reporting of key environmental
performance indicators is Group-wide 
and communicated to all levels of
management and to the Group Board. 
Any failings are addressed through
country-based specialist departments and
review and improvement of systems is a
key area of activity.
The Group benchmarks its environmental
performance against its peers using
techniques such as the annual Business
in the Environment (BiE) Index of
corporate environmental engagement. In
2007 the Group scored in excess of 92
per cent in this index (compared to 83
per cent in 2006), a score well above the
sector average and one achieved by
targeted improvement in specific areas
identified by analysis of previous index
assessments.
Due to the Group’s size and the highly
regulated environment in which it
operates it is almost inevitable that there
will be some level of enforcement action
by regulators. Table 18 shows
environmental convictions against the
Group during the 2008 financial year.
Whilst any enforcement action is
disappointing the number of incidents is
low compared to our peers. Where these
incidents do arise they are thoroughly
investigated, the issues addressed and
the lessons learnt incorporated into the
ongoing management systems.
corporate responsibility continued
employees who understand clearly the
effect they can have on the environment,
health and safety and the Group’s public
image.
The above gives an insight into the
complex and changing web of law,
regulation and perception the Group
operates within. The Group considers
legal compliance as an absolute minimum
requirement but understands that going
beyond simple compliance is critical to
the Group’s continued development. 
There is currently no requirement on
companies to calculate their carbon
footprint, but the Group has already done
so for its UK operations and is in the
process of extending this to cover its
other areas of activity. The Group
understands that it must be prepared 
for future developments in carbon trading
and charging and that being ahead of 
the pack is critical to the Group’s
development. Notwithstanding any
financial impact, managing our carbon
footprint responsibly makes good sense
and is supportive of our brand
positioning.
Equally there is no obligation on
companies to publicly declare accidents
and incidents suffered by its employees,
but the Group firmly believes that it must
make clear and unambiguous statements
to all stakeholders, internal and external,
of the standards it expects and the extent
to which they are attained.
There is also no legislation which requires
companies to engage with local
populations around their sites and
operations, but the Group does so
through liaison groups, education centres
and direct contact. The importance of a shanks. annual report 2008 23
Enforcement actions are, by their nature,
a reactive measure of environmental
performance. The Group believes it has a
positive role to play in improving the
environmental performance of both itself
and its stakeholders, such as its
customers.  Recycling rates are one
measure of this. By encouraging
customers to recycle and by providing the
services and operations to allow recycling
rates to improve, the Group is making a
significant and beneficial impact on the
environment. Table 19 illustrates this
point and shows a synopsis of recycling
rates achieved by the Group.
Recycling also has positive benefits in
reducing carbon emissions. Our
commitment to finding innovative and
significant ways of efficiently generating
energy from waste is another way in which
we can help society reduce its overall
carbon emissions. 
Carbon management is a key future area
for development and one which the Group
is committed to being involved in. For
2009 the Group has set itself the
qualitative target of calculating its carbon
footprint (a task which has already
commenced). Based on these
calculations quantitative targets will be
set to stimulate reductions in the Group’s
carbon impact in the future. This aspect
of the Group’s activities will be reported
on in the 2009 Annual Report.
Health and Safety
The health, safety and wellbeing of its
employees is a prime consideration for
the Group. Companies which have a poor
record in this area are unlikely to have the
highly motivated employees they need to

ensure good risk management and to
allow the development of their facilities.
For the past five years the Group has set
itself the quantified target of improving its
RIDDOR (Reporting of Injuries, Diseases
and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations)
employee injury rate by 10% year-on-year.
RIDDOR is UK law, but the Group has
applied it across all of its operations no
matter which country they are in. This is
just one example of the setting of
common and quantifiable targets for key
performance indicators across the Group.
During 2008 the Group improved its
overall RIDDOR rate by more than 21%. 
In addition, each country of operation
showed improvement, although this varied
across the Group. For 2009 the Group will
maintain its 10% overall improvement
target and is also seeking to develop
additional quantifiable goals during the
coming year.
Employees and Business Ethics
All of the Group’s employment and
training policies are compliant with
relevant employment legislation and
regulatory obligations. The Group is an
equal opportunities employer. Full and fair
consideration is given to applications
from, and the continuing employment,
career development and training of
disabled people. A culture of two way
communications is actively promoted and
trade unions, works councils and other
employee groups are involved wherever
appropriate.
The Group’s approach to its business is
clearly outlined in its Statement of
Business Principles and Corporate Ethics.
This is publicly available alongside other
corporate publications on the Group’s web
site.

The commitment to achieve business
goals by acting with honesty, integrity,
openness and fairness is plainly stated,
together with a clear and public definition
of acceptable business practice. The
statement also includes the Group’s
vision and guidance on dealings with
stakeholders such as shareholders,
employees, customers, suppliers and
contractors, as well as covering the
specific areas of environmental protection
and health and safety.
This statement is communicated directly
to all managers within the Group and
through documents such as employee
handbooks to other personnel. The Group
is committed to ensuring that this
statement of ethics is a living document
and monitors its application at
operational level and has an established
‘whistle-blowing’ system.
The Wider Community
Because of the nature and extent of its
activities, the Group understands that it is
essential to keep good communication
lines open with its neighbours and other
stakeholders. More than this the Group
has a positive role to play in promoting
recycling and other more environmentally
sustainable waste management practices
to the public and its closer stakeholders
such as customers.
The Group has an open door policy and
encourages visits from local communities
and other interested persons and parties.
Open days are held at some sites, while
at others education centres have been
established for the use of local schools
and other bodies. Formal liaison groups
are encouraged at high-profile sites and
engagement with local political systems is
a direct duty of operational management.
The Group cannot rely on its regulators
and internal monitoring systems
completely when assessing the potential
impacts of its operations. It is essential
that local populace opinion and concerns
are accounted for. The Group has put in
place complaint and comment tracking
and response systems at all of its sites.
Trends in complaints are tracked centrally
with the aim of addressing any issues
before they either come to the regulator’s
attention or start to impact significantly
on the Group’s image and reputation. We
are more than aware that local perception
is a critical factor which can have a direct
effect on site development and success.
Corporate Responsibility Data-Set
It is not practical to include here all the
environmental, health and safety and
other corporate responsibility measures
the Group uses to assess its
performance. However, we understand
that some stakeholders may wish access
to a more complete analysis and spread
of indicators. To address this need we
have produced a corporate responsibility
data-set. The data-set is available on the
Group’s web site (www.shanks.co.uk) for
any interested party to view.
In addition, each of the Group’s three
main countries of operation is producing
its own corporate responsibility report
within the country concerned. These
reports will be available in September
2008.

Principal Activities and Business Review
The principal activities of the Group continue to be waste processing and waste management in the Netherlands, Belgium, UK, and
since April 2007, Canada.
The Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s Statement, Business Overview, Operating Review, Financial Review and Corporate
Responsibility on pages 3 to 24 refer to the objectives and strategy, competition and the markets in which the Group operates, the
principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group, a review of the development and performance of the business for the year ended
31 March 2008, the financial position of the Group as at the financial year end, key performance indicators and likely future
developments of the business.
The information referred to above fulfills the requirements of the business review provisions in section 234ZZB of the Companies
Act 1985 and is incorporated by reference into, and shall be deemed to form part of, this report together with the other information
referred to in this Directors’ Report.
Acquisitions and Disposals
Acquisitions have been made during the year at a total cost of £47.5m (2007: £65.3m) and are described in note 13 to the
financial statements. There have been no disposals during the year (2007: £Nil). Subsequent to the year end the Group announced
in April 2008 that it had acquired the Belgian Foronex Group for a cash consideration of £10.4m.
Research and Development
The Group spent £Nil (2007: £Nil) on research and development during the year ended 31 March 2008.
Results and Dividends
The Group’s Consolidated Income Statement appears on page 43 and note 2 to the financial statements shows the contribution to
revenue and profits made by the different segments of the Group’s business. The Group’s profit for the year amounted to £28.3m
(2007: £31.3m).
The Directors recommend a final dividend of 4.2p (2007: 4.0p) per share be paid on 1 August 2008 to ordinary shareholders
whose names appear on the register of members at close of business on 11 July 2008. This dividend, together with the interim
dividend of 2.0p (2007: 1.9p) per share already paid on 9 January 2008, if approved by shareholders, will make a total dividend for
the year of 6.2p per share (2007: 5.9p). shanks. annual report 2008 27
Statement of Going Concern
After making enquiries the Directors have formed the view, at the time of approving the financial statements, that the Company and
Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason the Directors
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Notifiable Interests
As at 27 May 2008, the Company had been notified of the following direct and indirect interests in voting rights equal to or
exceeding 3% of the ordinary share capital of the Company:
Number of shares Percentage
Legal & General Group plc 41,705,994 17.60 
Schroder Investment Management Limited 30,983,387 13.08
Aberforth Partners LLP 17,202,200 7.32
Liontrust Investment Services Limited 11,682,512 4.92
Artemis Investment Management Limited 10,337,324 4.38
Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited 9,947,564 4.22
Share Capital
During the year ended 31 March 2008 no ordinary shares were issued other than those issued in respect of exercises of options
under the Company’s share option schemes and long term incentive plan, details of which are given in note 5 to the financial
statements. As at 31 March 2008 and as at the date of this report the authorised ordinary share capital was and is £35,000,000
represented by 350,000,000 ordinary shares of 10 pence each. As at 31 March 2008 and as at the date of this report there were
236,928,379 ordinary shares in issue. The rights and obligations attaching to the shares are:
•
Dividend rights – holders of the Company’s ordinary shares may, by ordinary resolution, declare dividends but may not declare
dividends in excess of the amount recommended by the Directors. The Directors may also pay interim dividends. No dividend
may be paid other than out of profits available for distribution. Payment or satisfaction of a dividend may be made wholly or
partly by distribution of specific assets, including fully paid shares or debentures of any other company. Such action must be
directed by the general meeting which declared the dividend and upon the recommendation of the Directors.
•
Voting rights – voting at any general meeting is by a show of hands unless a poll is duly demanded. On a show of hands every
shareholder who is present in person at a general meeting (and every proxy appointed by a shareholder and present at a
general meeting) has one vote regardless of the number of shares held by the shareholder (or represented by the proxy). On a
poll, every shareholder who is present in person or by proxy has one vote for every share held by that shareholder (the deadline
for exercising voting rights by proxy is set out in the form of proxy). A poll may be demanded by any of the following: (a) the
chairman of the meeting; (b) at least 5 shareholders entitled to vote and present in person or by proxy at the meeting; (c) any
shareholder or shareholders present in person or by proxy and representing in the aggregate not less than one-tenth of the
total voting rights of all shareholders entitled to attend and vote at the meeting; or (d) any shareholder or shareholders present
in person or by proxy and holding shares conferring a right to attend and vote at the meeting on which there have been paid up
sums in the aggregate equal to not less than one-tenth of the total sum paid up on all the shares conferring that right. In the
case of an equality of votes, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, the chairman of the meeting is entitled to cast the
deciding vote in addition to any other votes he may have.
•
Return of capital – in the event of the liquidation of the Company, after payment of all liabilities and deductions taking priority
in accordance with statute, the balance of assets available for distribution will be distributed among the holders of ordinary
shares according to the amounts paid up on the shares held by them. A liquidator may with the sanction of a special resolution
of the shareholders and any other sanction required by the Companies Acts, divide among the shareholders the whole or any
part of the Company’s assets. Alternatively, a liquidator may, upon the adoption of a special resolution of the shareholders,
vest the assets in whole or in part in trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of shareholders, but no shareholder is
compelled to accept any assets upon which there is a liability. 28 shanks. annual report 2008

Powers of Directors
The Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company provides that the business of the Company shall be managed by the
Board which may exercise all the powers of the Company whether relating to the management of the business of the Company or
not. This power is subject to any limitations imposed on the Company by legislation. It is also limited by the provisions of the
Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company and any directions given by special resolution of the members of the
Company which are applicable on the date that any power is exercised. Specific provisions relevant to the exercise of power by the
Directors include:
•
Pre-emptive rights and new issues of shares – while holders of ordinary shares have no pre-emptive rights under the Articles of
Association, the ability of the Directors to cause the Company to issue shares, securities convertible into shares or rights to
shares, otherwise than pursuant to an employee share scheme, is restricted. Under the Companies Acts, the Directors of a
company are, with certain exceptions, unable to allot any equity securities without express authorisation, which may be
contained in a company’s Articles of Association or given by its shareholders in general meeting, but which in either event
cannot last for more than five years. Under the Companies Acts, the Company may also not allot shares for cash (otherwise
than pursuant to an employee share scheme) without first making an offer to existing shareholders to allot such shares to
them on the same or more favourable terms in proportion to their respective shareholdings, unless this requirement is waived
by a special resolution of the shareholders.
•
Repurchase of shares – subject to authorisation by shareholder resolution, the Company may purchase its own shares in
accordance with the Companies Acts. Any shares which have been bought back may be held as treasury shares or, if not so
held, must be cancelled immediately upon completion of the purchase, thereby reducing the amount of the Company’s issued
share capital.
•
Borrowing powers – the Directors are empowered to exercise all the powers of the Company to borrow money, subject to the
limitation that the aggregate amount of all net external borrowings of the Group outstanding at any time shall not exceed an
amount equal to three times the aggregate of the Group’s adjusted capital and reserves calculated in the manner prescribed in
the Articles of Association, unless sanctioned by an ordinary resolution of the Company’s shareholders.
Amendment to Company’s Articles
The Company may alter its Articles of Association by special resolution passed at a general meeting.
Corporate Governance
The Board is fully committed to high standards of corporate governance. Details relating to the Company’s compliance with the
Combined Code on Corporate Governance for the financial year are given in the Corporate Governance and Remuneration Reports
on pages 30 to 39. These sections contain details of Directors’ service contracts and further information on the appointment of
Directors and the responsibilities of the Board. Subject to the provisions of the Companies Acts, the Memorandum and Articles of
Association and directions given by special resolution, the business of the Company is managed by the Board, which may exercise
all the powers of the Company.
Corporate Responsibility
Information on Corporate Responsibility matters including the environment, employment policies, health and safety and community
relations are set out on pages 21 to 24.
Charitable and Political Donations
During the period donations made by the Group for charitable purposes amounted to £2,430 (2007: £2,980). No donations were
made for political purposes during the year (2007: £Nil). Payment of Suppliers
It is the Group’s payment policy to agree payment terms with all suppliers and to abide by them. The amount owed to trade
creditors at the year end in proportion to the amounts invoiced by suppliers during the year, expressed as a number of days, was
65 days (2007: 53 days) for the Group and was 25 days (2007: 31 days) for the Company.
Significant Agreements
The Group’s principal financing instrument, the multicurrency £250m revolving credit facility with five major banks, contains an
option for those banks to declare that all sums outstanding under that agreement are repayable immediately in the event of a
change of control. This notice takes effect no earlier than thirty days from change of control and, if exercised at 31 March 2008,
would have required the repayment of £211.7m in principal and interest.
The 2001 notes issued under the Group’s private placement contain an option for the noteholders to enforce prepayment between
thirty days and sixty days from change of control of outstanding principal and interest which would have amounted in total at
31 March 2008 to £41.8m. In addition, an amount of make-whole amounting to £6.9m which is not provided for in these accounts
would be payable to private placement noteholders based on treasury yields at 31 March 2008.
Disclosure of information to the Company’s auditors
In accordance with section 418 of the Companies Act 2006, each of the Company’s Directors in office as at the date of this report
confirms that, so far as he is aware, there is no relevant audit information in connection with preparing their report of which the
Company’s auditors are unaware. Each Director has taken all steps which he ought to have taken as a Director in order to make
himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the auditors are aware of that information.
Annual General Meeting
The AGM will be held on 24 July 2008, the notice for which is set out on pages 86 to 93. A form of proxy has also been included in
a separate document sent to shareholders with this report. Resolutions will be proposed to declare a final dividend, receive the
2008 report and accounts, approve the 2008 Remuneration Report, elect Directors, reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as
auditors of the Company and authorise the Directors to determine the auditors’ remuneration. Shareholders will also be asked to
renew the general authority of the Directors to issue shares, together with the authority to disapply pre-emption rights and authorise
the Company to make purchase of its own shares. In addition, a resolution will be proposed to revise the Articles of Association to
reflect some of the new provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and to reflect a number of other legislative, regulatory and best
practice developments which are explained further in the appendix to the notice of the AGM.
The Directors consider that all the resolutions proposed at the AGM to be held on 24 July 2008 are in the best interests of the
Company and its shareholders as a whole and they unanimously recommend that all shareholders vote in favour of the resolutions,
as they intend to do in respect of their own shareholdings.

corporate governance
Combined Code
The Group is committed to achieving high standards of corporate governance and integrity and exemplary ethical standards in all its
business dealings. This statement, together with the Remuneration Report on pages 34 to 39, explains how the Group has applied
the provisions of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance published in 2003 by the Financial Reporting Council and updated
subsequently in 2006. The Board considers that it has complied with Section 1 of the Combined Code in all material respects
throughout the year.
The Board of Directors
The Board currently comprises the Chairman, a further three independent Non-executive Directors, the Group Chief Executive and
Group Finance Director. The Chairman has primary responsibility for running the Board and the Group Chief Executive is responsible
for the operations of the Group and for the development of strategic plans and initiatives for consideration by the Board. The
division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Group Chief Executive has been clearly established, set out in writing and
agreed by the Board.
The Non-executive Directors bring a wide range of experience to the Group and are considered by the Board to be independent of
management and free from any business or other relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent
judgement. During the year, until his retirement in July 2007, Mr P Delaunois was not deemed to be independent in accordance with
the criteria set out in the Combined Code owing to his receiving fees for providing consultancy advice to the Group’s Belgian
subsidiaries in addition to the fees received for acting as a Director. The Non-executive Directors make a significant contribution to
the functioning of the Board, thereby ensuring that no one individual or group dominates the decision making process. Non-
executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Company’s share option or pension schemes. The Chairman also
meets as necessary with the other Non-executive Directors without the executives present.
The Combined Code also recommends that the Board appoints one of its independent Non-executive Directors to be the Senior
Independent Director. This Director is available to shareholders should they have concerns which contact through the normal
channels of Chairman, Group Chief Executive or Group Finance Director has failed to resolve or for which such contact is
inappropriate. During the year this role was fulfilled by Mr B Pointon until his retirement in July 2007 and thereafter by 
Mr E van Amerongen.
The Board meets regularly, having met nine times during the year. In addition, separate strategic discussions take place. Several
meetings are held at subsidiary company sites in the UK and overseas where local operations are reviewed. In line with the
requirement of sound corporate governance, there is a formal schedule of matters reserved specifically for the Board’s decision.
These include approval of financial statements, strategic policy, acquisitions and disposals, capital projects over defined limits,
annual plans and new borrowing facilities.
The Board operates under agreed terms of reference, which together with those of its Committees are documented formally and
updated as necessary. The Board is provided with appropriate information in a timely manner to enable it to effectively discharge its
duties. All Directors have access to the Company Secretary whose role includes ensuring that Board procedures and regulations are
followed. In addition, Directors are entitled, if necessary, to seek independent professional advice in the furtherance of their duties
at the Company’s expense.
Performance evaluation of the Board, its Committees and individual Directors during the year was undertaken through the
mechanism of formalised self assessment questionnaires. Key results, all of which were positive and constructive, continue to be
acted on by the Chairman and the Board. The performance evaluation of the Chairman was undertaken by the Non-executive
Directors, led by the Senior Independent Director.
All Directors submit themselves for re-election by shareholders in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, and all
Non-executive Directors are appointed initially for a three year term. Any new Director appointed to the Board will be subject to
election by shareholders at the first opportunity after their appointment. It has been agreed that any Non-executive Directors who
have served for a period greater than nine years from initial appointment will submit themselves for annual re-election. shanks. annual report 2008 31
On appointment, Directors are given an introduction to the Group’s operations, including visits to principal sites and meetings with
operational management. Specific training requirements of Directors are met either directly or by the Company through
legal/regulatory updates. Board succession planning is kept under review by the Nomination Committee.
The table below details the number of formal Board and Committee meetings held in the year and the attendance of each Director.
In addition, the Board held a two day strategy meeting with senior management attending for part of the time. There was also
regular communication between the Non-executive Directors without the presence of the Executive Directors.

Audit Committee
The Audit Committee, which met three times in the year, is formally constituted with written terms of reference which are available
on the Group’s website. The Committee is comprised solely of Non-executive Directors; Mr P Johnson, Dr S Riley and Mr E van
Amerongen. Mr P Johnson, who continues to have current and relevant financial experience under Combined Code requirements,
chaired the Committee throughout the year. During the year both Mr P Delaunois and Mr B Pointon also served on the Committee
until their retirement in July 2007. The external auditors, the Chairman and the Executive Directors are regularly invited to attend
meetings and the Committee has access to the external auditors’ advice without the presence of the Executive Directors. The Audit
Committee has the authority to examine any matters relating to the financial affairs of the Group. This includes the appointment,
terms of engagement, objectivity and independence of the external auditors, the nature and scope of the audit, reviews of the
interim and annual financial statements, internal control procedures, accounting policies, adherence with accounting standards and
such other related functions as the Board may require. The Committee also considers and reviews other risk management and
control documentation, including the Group’s policy on ‘whistleblowing’ and security reporting procedures.
The policy on engagement of the external auditors for non-audit services is that, where the work is closely related to the audit, or if
the work requires a detailed understanding of the Group, or when a significant benefit can be obtained from work previously
conducted, the work may be awarded to the auditors without compromising their independence and objectivity.
During the year the performance of the external auditors was formally reviewed. A resolution proposing the re-appointment of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Group auditors will be put to shareholders at the forthcoming AGM. 32 shanks. annual report 2008

Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee, which met four times in the year, is formally constituted with written terms of reference which are
available on the Group’s website. The Committee is comprised solely of Non-executive Directors; Mr E van Amerongen, Mr A Auer,
Mr P Johnson and Dr S Riley and has been chaired since July 2007 by Mr E van Amerongen. During the year Mr P Delaunois served
on and Mr B Pointon chaired the Committee until their retirement in July 2007. The Committee determines the Company’s policy on
remuneration and on a specific package for each of the Executive Directors. It also determines the terms on which the Long Term
Incentive Plan (LTIP) and the Save As You Earn (SAYE) share options are awarded to employees. The Committee also determines
the remuneration of the Group’s senior management and that of the Chairman. It recommends the remuneration of the Non-
executive Directors for determination by the Board. In exercising its responsibilities the Committee has access to professional
advice, both internally and externally, and may consult the Group Chief Executive about its proposals. The Remuneration Report on
pages 34 to 39 contains particulars of Directors’ remuneration and interests in the Company’s shares.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee is chaired by Mr A Auer and is comprised solely of Non-executive Directors; Mr E van Amerongen,
Mr P Johnson and Dr S Riley. During the year both Mr P Delaunois and Mr B Pointon also served on the Committee until their
retirement in July 2007. The Committee is formally constituted with written terms of reference which are available on the Group’s
website. It met twice during the year and is responsible for making recommendations to the Board on the appointment of Directors
and succession planning. During the year, the structure, composition and balance of skills of the Board were reviewed including
ensuring that all members of the Board had devoted sufficient time and contributed adequately to the work of the Board. During the
year the Committee implemented succession planning in respect of Mr M Averill’s retirement in September 2007 and the
appointment of Mr T Drury as successor to the position of Group Chief Executive. All appointments were made using the services of
an external executive search consultant.
Pensions
The assets of both the final salary and money purchase schemes in the UK are held separately from those of the Group. These are
invested by independent professional investment managers and cannot be invested directly in the Company. There are two member
nominated trustees and three trustees appointed by the Company. Senior employees in Belgium are provided with defined
contribution pension benefits. In the Netherlands, employees participate in compulsory collective transport industry wide pension
schemes, or equivalent schemes, which provide benefits up to a certain level of pay. Senior employees in the Netherlands earning
in excess of the maximum level of pay allowed for within the compulsory pension schemes also participate in a defined contribution
arrangement for the excess amount.
Investor Relations
The Company has an active investor relations programme, with designated members of the Board regularly meeting institutional
investors, analysts, press and other parties. The Board obtains feedback from its broker, Hoare Govett on the views of institutional
shareholders and the Chairman attends meetings with major shareholders whose views are communicated to the Board as a whole.
The Group also communicates with private and institutional investors through its AGM. The Group’s website www.shanks.co.uk
provides additional information for shareholders and the general public.
Risk Management
The Board confirms that processes for identifying, evaluating and managing the material risks faced by the Group have been in
place for the financial year 2008 and to the date of approval of the annual report and accounts. These include a formal review by
each business unit to identify and evaluate material strategic, operational, commercial and financial risks affecting the achievement
of their objectives. This review also identifies key procedures and controls used to mitigate the risks to an acceptable level and,
where appropriate, actions required to further manage and reduce them. In addition the Executive Directors consider those risks to
the Group’s strategic objectives that may not be identified and managed at the business unit level. The risk summaries developed
out of this process are discussed with both the Board and the Audit Committee in accordance with Turnbull Guidance.
Risk management also forms part of major decision-making processes such as acquisitions or major contract tenders. It is also
embedded in the day to day management of operations including health, safety and environmental compliance aspects. shanks. annual report 2008 33
Internal Control
The Directors are responsible for and have reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control during the period
covered by the annual report and accounts. The system is designed to provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against
material avoidable loss or misstatement of financial information. The key features of the control system are as follows:
(i) monthly visits by Executive Directors to key operating locations to attend local board or management meetings;
(ii) regular Executive Committee meetings of the Group’s most senior managers and Executive Directors;
(iii) formal written financial policies and procedures applicable to all business units;
(iv) comprehensive annual budgets, requiring Board and business unit approval, reviewed on a regular basis, with performance
measured against budgets and explanations sought for significant variances;
(v) a formal clearly defined framework for control and approval of capital expenditure and investment programmes, with cash
authorisation limits and post investment appraisals along with contract authorisation levels;
(vi) identification and evaluation of key risks applicable to each area of business assessed on a continuing basis at both operating
Board and Group Board level;
(vii) appointment of experienced and professional staff of the necessary calibre to meet their responsibilities;
(viii) annual peer reviews where the adequacy of the procedures and controls in each business unit’s operations are reviewed by
senior staff from elsewhere in the Group with the aid of extensive checklists. Summaries of findings from these reviews and
the status on follow-up actions are discussed by the Group Board;
(ix) a programme of internal site audits performed by senior finance staff. A selection of these audits is performed by individuals
from other business units or, where language is an issue, by a local firm of external auditors. Findings from these audits are
discussed at the monthly business unit Board meetings. Summaries of audit findings and the status of follow-up actions are
discussed at the Group Board and Audit Committee meetings on a regular basis;
(x) a range of quality assurance and environmental management systems are used at the Group’s sites. Where appropriate these
are independently certified to internationally recognised standards including ISO 9001 and ISO 14001, and as such are subject
to regular external audits;
(xi) an Environmental Advisory Board which during the year provided an independent assessment of the Group’s health, safety
and environmental performance; and
(xii) an Audit Committee comprising Non-executive Directors, the responsibilities of which are set out on page 31.
To strengthen the controls provided by the above the Audit Committee recommended and the Board agreed to the establishment of
an independent internal audit function in February 2008. A Group Risk Management and Internal Audit Manager has been recruited
to head up this function. He will join the Group in June 2008. 34 shanks. annual report 2008
remuneration report
Remuneration Policy
The principal objectives of the Remuneration Committee, which is chaired by Mr E van Amerongen and comprises the Non-executive
Directors are to attract, retain and motivate high quality senior management with a competitive package of incentives and awards
linked to performance and the interests of shareholders. The Committee seeks to ensure that the Executive Directors are fairly
rewarded taking into account all elements of their remuneration package in the light of the Group’s performance.
The Committee has appointed Deloitte & Touche LLP to provide independent market information and advice relating to executive
remuneration and benefits. Deloitte & Touche LLP are considered to be independent as they provide only very limited other services
to the Group. The Committee also engaged the services of an independent consultant, B Partridge Consulting Ltd, to assist in the
review of executive remuneration for the year to 31 March 2008.
As described below, a significant proportion of potential total remuneration is performance related and is built around annual and
longer term incentives. For Directors achieving median performance, performance related pay would represent approximately 40% of
total remuneration. If performance were such that the maximum award available under each incentive scheme was paid,
performance related pay would represent approximately 67% of total remuneration.
Basic Salary
The basic salary element is determined primarily by reference to external data which takes into account the Executive Director’s
duties and responsibilities. Basic salary is generally reviewed on an annual basis or following a significant change in
responsibilities. During the year Mr F Welham’s basic salary was increased from £220,000 to £250,000 per annum and from 
1 April 2008 to £257,500. Mr T Drury’s basic salary of £375,000 was increased from 1 April 2008 to £390,000.
Annual Cash Bonuses
Annual cash bonuses are payable at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee as a percentage of basic salary dependent on
corporate profit and operating cash flow performance compared to target. For the year to 31 March 2008, the Executive Directors’
potential cash bonus ranged from 30% for achieving target performance to a maximum bonus of 100% for achieving a performance
of approximately 15% above target performance. Cash bonuses are not pensionable.
For the year ending 31 March 2009, the component of the annual bonus relating to operating cash flow targets has been replaced
by individual personal objectives. The maximum bonus for this component remains 25% of basic salary. The maximum total bonus
for the Group Chief Executive will be 125% and 100% for the Group Finance Director.
Long Term Incentive Plan
Under the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) senior employees may be granted an award annually, the vesting of which is subject to
the attainment of two pre-determined performance conditions measured over a three year period. Awards are in the form of Shanks
Group plc shares. The maximum value in any financial year cannot be more than 100% of basic salary as at the date of grant and
is calculated on the Company’s share price at that time.
The first performance condition is based on Total Shareholder Return (TSR), where the Company’s TSR achieved during the three
year performance period is measured against the TSR achieved by those companies that constituted the FTSE Support Services
Sector immediately before the date of grant of an award. An award will only vest in full if the Company’s TSR results in it being
ranked in the upper quartile of the companies in the comparator group where the company with the highest TSR is ranked first. If
the TSR of the Company results in a median position in the comparator group, then 25% of the award will vest. Vesting above the
median position is on a sliding scale, with 3% of the award vesting for each percentile increase in the Company’s rank above the
median position up to the maximum award. If the Company’s TSR for the performance period results in a position below the median
then the award will lapse.
The second performance condition is based on Earnings Per Share (EPS) and for an award to vest, the average growth in the
Company’s adjusted EPS calculated on a consistent basis must exceed the growth in the Retail Price Index over the same period by
at least nine percentage points. Having reviewed this performance condition and in light of market conditions the Remuneration
Committee has decided to increase this to at least 12 percentage points for any grants awarded during the financial year 2008/9
and thereafter. This condition will be kept under review for future awards.
No amendment may be made to the performance conditions which would be to the material advantage of participants without the
prior approval of shareholders in general meeting. shanks. annual report 2008 35
During the year the Committee confirmed the performance conditions for the LTIPs granted in 2004 had been partially achieved and
were available for exercise. At a meeting of the Committee on 27 May 2008 the performance conditions for the financial year
ended 31 March 2008 were determined to have been achieved, resulting in the vesting in full of the LTIPs granted in 2005.
The Shanks Group plc Employee Share Trust has been established for the purpose of granting awards under the LTIP and to hold
shares in the Company either purchased in the market or new shares subscribed for, with funds provided by the Company or its
subsidiaries. As at 31 March 2008 the Employee Share Trust did not hold any of the Company’s shares.
The graph shows the Total Shareholder Return of the Company and that of the FTSE Support Services Sector Index over the five-
year period to 31 March 2008. This Index has been selected as it is a broad equity index of which Shanks Group plc is a
constituent member.
Share Option Schemes
The Committee believes that share ownership by employees encourages the matching of long term interests between employees
and shareholders. All UK employees including Executive Directors, subject to certain service conditions, may participate in HM
Revenue & Customs approved Savings Related Share Option Scheme (SRSOS). Senior executives were also able to participate in
an Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. Grants of options under the ESOS
were discontinued in August 2005 when this scheme was replaced by the LTIP.
Under the terms of the SRSOS for UK employees, options may be granted during the ten year period to July 2015 to acquire up to
10% of the issued equity share capital of the Company, including options granted under the ESOS and LTIP. Options are granted at
the higher of the nominal value of an ordinary 10 pence share and an amount determined by the Remuneration Committee being
not less than 80% of the market value. Employees held options over nearly 0.7m shares under the SRSOS as at 31 March 2008.
At the AGM held on 26 July 2007 the shareholders approved an amendment to the SRSOS rules to extend the dates upon which
invitations to apply for share options could be made to employees to include the period forty two days commencing from the AGM.
Under the terms of the discontinued ESOS, options could be granted during the ten year period to August 2005 to acquire up to 5%
of the issued equity share capital of the Company. The exercise of options granted under the ESOS, is subject to a performance
condition, achievement of which is a pre-requisite for exercise of options. The condition is tested once only after a period of three
years and if it is not achieved the relevant options will lapse. Options granted after 26 July 2001 will only be exercisable if the
Group’s EPS, calculated on a consistent basis, exceeds the growth in Retail Price Index over the same period by at least nine
percentage points. During the year the Committee confirmed the performance conditions for the ESOS granted in 2004 had been
met and therefore was available for exercise. At a meeting of the Committee on 27 May 2008 the performance conditions for the
financial year ended 31 March 2008 were determined to have been achieved resulting in the vesting of the final tranche of
executive options granted in 2005.

The Remuneration Committee applied a different performance condition for options granted under the ESOS prior to 26 July 2001.
These options may not be exercised unless the growth in the Group’s EPS over the period of any three consecutive years after the
date of grant equals or exceeds the increase in the Retail Price Index over the same period by at least six percentage points.
During the year the Committee re-tested the performance conditions for the ESOS granted in 2000 and 2001 and confirmed these
had been achieved and as a result these options were available for exercise.
Directors’ Service Contracts and Notice Periods
The Remuneration Committee has agreed that the policy with regard to the notice period for Executive Directors is one year.
Accordingly, Mr T Drury and Mr F Welham have rolling service contracts dated 3 September 2007 and 21 July 2005, respectively,
which require one year’s notice from the Company. In the case of notice from the Director, Mr T Drury is required to give one year’s
notice and Mr F Welham, six months. In the event of early termination, the Remuneration Committee will consider carefully what
compensation should be paid taking into account the circumstances of the particular case.
As has been detailed in the Directors’ Report, Mr Averill stood down from his position as Group Chief Executive and Director with
effect from 30 September 2007. However, in line with his notice period Mr Averill continued to be employed by the Company on an
advisory basis until the end of May 2008. Payments from that date were limited to the Director’s contractual remuneration including
basic salary and benefits for the unexpired portion of the notice period, being a salary of £187,000 and car allowance/medical
insurance benefit of £14,000 for the period 1 October 2007 to 31 March 2008. Any entitlement to the exercise of LTIPs awarded
previously is governed by the rules of the relevant scheme. Pensionable service is accrued for the unexpired portion of the notice
period.
The Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts as their terms of engagement are governed by letters of appointment. 
Mr P Delaunois had and, post his retirement from the Board in July 2007, continues to have an agreement to provide consultancy
services to the Group’s Belgian subsidiary companies which can be terminated on giving three month’s notice by either party.

External Appointments
The Remuneration Committee acknowledges that Executive Directors may be invited to become Non-executive Directors of other
quoted companies which have no business relationship with the Group and that these duties can broaden their experience and
knowledge to the benefit of the Company. Executive directors are limited to hold one such position and the policy is that fees may
be retained by the Director, reflecting the personal risk assumed in such appointments. Mr M Averill had Board approval for two
Non-executive positions during his last year in office. The fees received from these appointments until his retirement from the
Board were £35,000.
Directors’ Interests in Ordinary Shares
The Directors’ interests in the ordinary shares of the Company both during the year and at 27 May 2008 were as follows:

Notes
(i) Other emoluments for Mr M Averill and Mr F Welham include such items as car allowance and medical insurance which are not
pensionable. In the case of Mr F Welham this also includes Company contributions to the Defined Contribution section of the
Shanks Group Pension Scheme. Other emoluments for Mr T Drury include relocation assistance, a car allowance, medical
insurance and a cash element, paid in lieu of pension scheme contributions, equating to 25% of salary. All of these items are
non pensionable.
(ii) Other emoluments for Mr P Delaunois are for fees relating to consultancy services provided to the Group’s Belgian subsidiaries
by S.A. CGO of which Mr P Delaunois is a shareholder and director. As at the date of his retirement from the Board these fees
amounted to £14,000, although these fees continue to be paid for ongoing consultancy services at a rate of £42,000 per
annum.
(iii) The Non-executive Directors do not participate in the annual bonus plan and do not receive any pension contributions from the
Group.
Directors’ Pension Benefits
Mr M Averill and Mr F Welham are both members of the Final Salary (Defined Benefit) section of the Shanks Group Pension
Scheme, which is a funded scheme, approved by HM Revenue & Customs. In the case of Mr Welham, pension benefits are capped
at the notional HM Revenue & Customs earnings cap, which is reviewed annually. For the year to 31 March 2008 the notional cap
was £112,800. Under the terms of this scheme the Executive Directors have:
•
at retirement, and subject to length of service, a pension of up to two thirds of basic salary;
•
an employee contribution of 7% of basic salary;
•
a lump sum death in service benefit of four times basic salary; and
•
a spouse’s pension on death. 38 shanks. annual report 2008

Notes
(i) Mr F Welham was subject to the HM Revenue & Customs cap on approved pension benefits and was provided with additional
pension benefits for basic salary in excess of the cap via the Defined Contribution section of the Shanks Group Pension
Scheme. The Company contributed £21,000 into this section of Mr Welham’s pension during the year and is included in the
‘other emoluments’ section of the Directors’ remuneration table shown on page 37. The value of Mr Welham’s fund in the
Defined Contribution section as at 31 March 2008 including his own contributions was £40,000.
(ii) The increase in accrued pension during the year represents the difference between the total accrued pension at the end of the
year and the equivalent amount at the beginning of the year.
(iii) The pension entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement based on service at the end of the year.
(iv) The transfer value has been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11. 
The calculation is based on the assumption that pensions will be paid from the earliest retirement age possible without the
application of actuarial reduction factors (at age of 57 for Mr M Averill and 62 for Mr F Welham).
Mr Averill resigned as a Director on 30 September 2007. His transfer value has been calculated on his pensionable pay as at
30 September 2007. He remained a member of the Scheme to the year end, and the increase in accrued pension and transfer
value reflects accrual of benefits over the whole year.
(v) The increase in transfer value has been calculated taking into account market conditions and the Directors’ ages at 31 March
2007 and 31 March 2008.

Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
29 May 2008 40 shanks. annual report 2008
statement of directors’ responsibilities
in respect of the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have
prepared the Group and Parent Company financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. The financial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit of the Company and Group for that period.
In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to:
•
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
•
make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
•
state whether the financial statements comply with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
•
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue
in business; and
•
include a fair review of the development, performance and position of the business, together with a description of the principal
risks and uncertainties.
The Directors confirm that they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the Remuneration Report
comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 and as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS
Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. shanks. annual report 2008 41
independent auditors’ report to the members of
Shanks Group plc
We have audited the group and parent company financial statements (the ‘financial statements’) of Shanks Group plc for the year
ended 31 March 2008 which comprise the Consolidated Group and Parent Company Income Statements, the Consolidated Group
and Parent Company Balance Sheets, the Consolidated Group and Parent Company Cash Flow Statements, the Consolidated Group
and Parent Company Statements of Recognised Income and Expense and the related notes. These financial statements have been
prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report
that is described as having been audited.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are set
out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report,
including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the
Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other
purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our
prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements
and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 1985 and, as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether in our
opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements. The information given in the
Directors’ Report includes that specific information presented in the Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s Statement, Business
Overview, Operating Review, Financial Review and Corporate Responsibility that is cross referred from the Business Review section
of the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other
transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the
Combined Code (2006) specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not.
We are not required to consider whether the board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion
on the effectiveness of the group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial
statements. The other information comprises only the Directors’ Report, the unaudited part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report,
the Financial Highlights, Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s Statement, the Business Overview, Operating Review, Financial
Review, Corporate Responsibility, Corporate Governance Statement, Consolidated Five Year Summary and all other information as
referenced by the contents page of the Annual Report. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other
information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices
Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant
estimates and judgments made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the group’s and company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed. 42 shanks. annual report 2008
independent auditors’ report to the members of
Shanks Group plc
continued
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order
to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In
forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements and the
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
•
the financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the state of
the group’s and the parent company’s affairs as at 31 March 2008 and of the group’s and parent company’s profits and cash
flows for the year then ended;
•
the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; and
•
the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements.

notes to the financial statements
1 Accounting policies – Group and Company
General information
Shanks Group plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act
1985.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as required by
Article 4 of the European Union IAS Regulation and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies
reporting under IFRS. The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for derivative financial
instruments, which are stated at fair value. The policies set out below have been consistently applied. The Group has applied
all accounting standards and interpretations issued relevant to its operations and effective for accounting periods beginning on
1 April 2007.
During the year, the Group has adopted IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and the related amendment to IAS 1
Presentation of Financial Statements which are required to be implemented from 1 April 2007. Other than increased disclosure
concerning financial instruments and management of capital, IFRS 7 has not had an impact on reported profits or net assets.
During the year, the Group has early adopted IFRS 8 Operating Segments in order to facilitate a greater understanding and
improve the transparency of the Group’s reported results. Accordingly, the Group has restated its segmental information in 
note 2. There has been no impact on reported profits or net assets.
In July 2007 IFRIC 14 The Limit on Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction was issued. It
limits the recognition of a defined benefit asset when minimum funding requirements exist within a retirement benefit plan.
IFRIC 14 was implemented by the Group from 1 April 2007 and this has had no impact on reported profits or net assets.
Other accounting standards and interpretations in issue at the date of approval of these financial statements but not yet
effective are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results
ultimately may differ from those estimates. The most significant judgements made relate to assumptions concerning discount
rates, future returns on assets and future contribution rates in connection with the Group’s retirement benefit schemes (see
note 22). In making these assumptions, the Group takes advice from qualified actuaries. Other significant judgements made
relate to provisions and PFI contracts (see below).
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Shanks Group plc and all its subsidiary
undertakings (subsidiaries). Entities which are jointly controlled with another party or parties (joint ventures) are incorporated in
the financial statements by proportional consolidation. The results of subsidiaries and joint ventures acquired or sold during
the year are included in the consolidated financial statements up to, or from, the date control passes. Wholly owned subsidiary
companies set up under PFI contracts are fully consolidated by the Group.
PFI contracts
The Group’s PFI contracts are all Integrated Waste Management contracts. In these contracts, the existing Local Authority
waste management services are operated by the Group from inception of the contract. The PFI contract requires the building of
new infrastructure to add to that inherited from the previous service provider and all rights to the infrastructure pass to the
Local Authority at the termination or expiry of the contract. The payments made to contractors for the construction of the
infrastructure are accounted for as financial assets. The Group accounts for the service element as revenue and the repayment
element is deducted from the financial asset. Interest receivable is added to the financial asset based on the rate implied in
the contract payments. Reviews are undertaken regularly to ensure that the financial asset will be recovered over the contract
life.
Borrowing costs relating to contract specific external borrowings are expensed in the income statement. 50 shanks. annual report 2008
notes to the financial statements
continued
1 Accounting policies continued
Bid costs are expensed in the income statement until the Group is appointed preferred bidder and there is a high probability
that a contract will be awarded. Bid costs incurred after this point are capitalised within trade and other receivables. When the
contract is awarded, the costs are included in the relevant financial asset.
Revenue
Revenue represents the invoiced value of waste streams processed and other services provided including landfill tax but
excluding sales taxes. Revenue is recognised when processing occurs or when the service is provided.
Exceptional items
Items are classified as exceptional and disclosed separately due to their size or incidence to enable a better understanding of
performance. These include but are not limited to the change in fair value of financial instruments and the profit or loss on
disposals of properties.
Share-based payments
IFRS 2 Share-based Payments has been applied to grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 which had not vested
as of 1 April 2005. The fair value of options granted is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the
Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. Adjustments to the amounts expensed are only made in respect of non-
market related factors.
Discontinued operations
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business that represents a separate major line of business.
Classification as a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as
held for sale, if earlier.
Intangible assets
(i) Goodwill
Goodwill arises when the cost of acquiring subsidiaries and businesses exceeds the fair value attributed to the net assets
acquired. Capitalised goodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis. Any impairment is charged immediately to
the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to the date of transition to IFRS (31 March 2004) has been retained at the previous
UK GAAP net book value following impairment tests. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not
been reinstated.
The profit or loss on disposal or closure of a business is calculated after taking into account any goodwill excluding
amounts previously written off to reserves prior to 1998.
(ii) Landfill void
When landfill operations are acquired, landfill void is capitalised based on the fair value of the void acquired and is
amortised over its estimated useful life on a void usage basis.
(iii) Other intangibles
Other intangible assets are capitalised on the basis of the fair value of the assets acquired or on the basis of costs
incurred to purchase and bring the assets into use. These are amortised over the estimated useful life on a straight line
basis as follows:
Computer software 1 to 5 years
Waste permits 5 to 20 years
Other 5 to 10 years shanks. annual report 2008 51
1 Accounting policies continued
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment except for freehold land is stated at cost less depreciation and provision for any impairment.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
(i) Buildings, plant and machinery
Depreciation is provided on these assets to write off their cost by equal annual instalments over the expected useful
economic lives. The expected useful life of buildings is 25 to 50 years. Plant and machinery lives are:
Computer equipment 1 to 5 years
Mobile plant 5 years
Generation equipment 8 to 15 years
Heavy goods vehicles 5 to 10 years
Other items 3 to 20 years
(ii) Landfill sites
Site development costs including engineering works and the discounted cost of final site restoration are capitalised. These
costs are written off over the operational life of each site based on the amount of void space consumed.
Impairment of assets
Assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated in order to determine the extent of
any impairment loss. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value
in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value. If the recoverable amount is estimated to be
less than the carrying amount the asset is reduced to the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately
as an operating expense.
Leased assets
(i) Finance leases
Where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a leased asset, the lease is treated as a
finance lease. Leased assets are included in property, plant and equipment at the total of the capital elements of the
payments during the lease term and the corresponding obligation is included in payables. Depreciation is provided to write
off the assets over the expected useful life.
(ii) Operating leases
All leases other than finance leases are treated as operating leases. Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to
the income statement in the year to which they relate. The obligation to pay future rentals on operating leases is shown in
note 27 to the accounts.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value and are measured on a first in first out basis.
Government grants and subsidies
Capital related government grants are released to the income statement evenly over the expected useful lives of the assets to
which they relate. Revenue grants and subsidies are credited in the same period as the items to which they relate.
Unprocessed waste
The accrual or deferred income relating to unprocessed waste is calculated at the higher of sales value or processing cost.
Site restoration provision
Full provision is made for the net present value (NPV) of the Group’s unavoidable costs in relation to restoration liabilities at its
landfill sites and this value is capitalised and amortised over the useful life of the site. In addition the Group continues to
provide for the NPV of intermediate restoration costs over the life of its landfill sites and mineral extraction sites, based on the
quantity of waste deposited or mineral extracted in the year. 52 shanks. annual report 2008
notes to the financial statements
continued
1 Accounting policies continued
Aftercare provision
Provision is made for the NPV of post closure costs at the Group’s landfill sites based on the quantity of waste deposited in
the year. Similar costs incurred during the operating life of the sites are written off directly to the income statement and not
charged to the provision.
Discounting
All long term provisions for restoration, aftercare and onerous leases are calculated based on the NPV of estimated future
costs. The effects of inflation and unwinding of the discount element on existing provisions are reflected within the financial
statements as a finance charge. The real discount factor currently applied is 2%.
Retirement benefits
The Group accounts for pensions and similar benefits under the amended IAS19 Employee Benefits. For defined benefit plans,
obligations are measured at discounted present value whilst plan assets are recorded at market value. The operating and
financing costs of the plans are recognised separately in the income statement and actuarial gains and losses are recognised
in full through the statement of recognised income and expense. Surpluses on defined benefit plans are recognised only to the
extent that they are recoverable. Movements in irrecoverable surpluses are recognised immediately in the statement of
recognised income and expense.
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged to the income statement as they become due. The Group participates
in several multi-employer schemes in the Netherlands. These are accounted for as defined contribution plans as it is not
possible to split the assets and liabilities of the schemes between participating companies, and the Group has been informed
by the schemes that it has no obligation to make additional contributions in the event that the schemes have an overall deficit.
Tax
(i) Current tax
Current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit before tax in the income
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years or that are never
taxable or deductible. The liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted, or substantially
enacted, by the balance sheet date.
(ii) Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in full where the carrying value of assets and liabilities in the financial statements is different
to the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profits. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised
for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that the
taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax is calculated
at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax
is charged or credited in the income statement, except where it relates to items charged or credited through the statement
of recognised income and expense or directly to reserves, when it is charged or credited there.
Foreign currencies
Foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at the year end exchange rate.
Transactions and the results of overseas subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures in foreign currencies are translated at the
average rate of exchange for the year and the resulting exchange differences are recognised in the Group’s exchange reserve.
Cumulative exchange differences are recognised in the income statement in the year in which an overseas subsidiary
undertaking is disposed of. The Group applies the hedge accounting principles of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition
and Measurement relating to net investment hedging to offset the exchange differences arising on foreign currency
denominated borrowings with the translation of foreign operations. Net investment hedges are accounted for by recognising
exchange rate movements in the exchange reserve, with any hedge ineffectiveness being charged to the income statement in
the period the ineffectiveness arises. shanks. annual report 2008 53
1 Accounting policies continued
Financial instruments
(i) Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry interest and are stated at their nominal value reduced by appropriate allowances for
estimated irrecoverable amounts.
(ii) Financial assets relating to PFI contracts
Financial assets relating to PFI contracts are classified as loans and receivables and are initially recognised at the fair
value of the consideration paid and subsequently amortised using the effective interest rate method.
(iii) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with a maturity of three months or less.
(iv) External borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including
premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis to the
income statement using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the borrowings to the
extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
(v) Trade payables
Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
(vi) Derivative financial instruments
As part of the Group’s PFI contracts, the Group has a number of interest rate swaps. These swaps are measured at fair
value at each reporting date with the gains or losses between period ends being taken to finance charges in the income
statement.
(vii) Other receivables and other payables
Other receivables and other payables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Dividends
Dividends are accounted for on a cash basis and are not accrued in the balance sheet.
Segmental reporting
The Group’s organisational structure reflects the national nature of markets in which it operates, with divisions in the
Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom and Canada. 54 shanks. annual report 2008
notes to the financial statements
continued
2 Segmental reporting
The Group operates in the Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom and Canada. As discussed in the Business Overview on
pages 7 to 11 the waste markets are different in each member state of the European Union. As a result, the Group is
organised and managed mainly by geographical location. Each geographical location can be analysed according to the following
types of activity:
Solid Waste Non-hazardous solid waste collections, transfer and recycling
Landfill and Power Landfill disposal (including contaminated soils) and power generation from landfill gas
Hazardous Waste Industrial cleaning, hazardous waste transport, treatment (including contaminated soils) and disposal
and contaminated land remediation
Organic Treatment Anaerobic digestion and tunnel composting of source segregated organic waste streams
PFI Contracts Long term United Kingdom municipal waste treatment contracts
Sand Quarry Mineral extraction
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in note 1, except that pension expense
for the United Kingdom is recognised and measured on the basis of cash payments to the pension plan. The profit measure
the Group uses to evaluate performance is trading profit. Trading profit is operating profit before the amortisation of acquisition
intangibles excluding landfill void and computer software and exceptional items. The Group accounts for inter-segment trading
on an arm’s length basis. The information for the 2007 comparatives has been restated in the new format.

transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Charge for the year

For both the Group and the Company, in addition to the amount charged to the income statement, deferred tax relating to
retirement benefit obligations and share-based payments amounting to £4.9m (2007: £0.3m) has been credited directly to
equity.
As a result of changes announced in the 2007 Budget, UK corporation tax will reduce from 30% to 28% effective from April
2008 and the deferred tax impact of this has been included above. There will also be a phased withdrawal of industrial
buildings allowances over a period of 4 years and a reduction in general pool writing down allowances from 25% to 20% which
will be enacted in the Finance Act 2008. It is estimated that this will result in a £25m exceptional tax charge in the year
ending 31 March 2009. This principally relates to the non discounted value of tax relief that would have been available on the
PFI infrastructure towards the end of the 25 year PFI contracts. 62 shanks. annual report 2008

The Directors believe that adjusting earnings per share for the effect of the amortisation of acquisition intangibles excluding
landfill void and computer software and exceptional items enables comparison with historical data calculated on the same
basis. Adjusting for amortisation of acquisition intangibles brings the Group’s adjusted measure into line with general practice.
Exceptional items are those items that need to be disclosed separately on the face of the income statement because of their
size or incidence. Changes in fair values of interest rate swaps that the Group is required to enter into in relation to its PFI
arrangements are considered to be exceptional items. shanks. annual report 2008 63

Goodwill impairment
Impairment testing is carried out at segment level on an annual basis. The Group estimates the recoverable amount of goodwill
using projected cashflows for the next twenty years discounted at the Group’s estimated average cost of capital (9% after tax).
The cash flows are based on projections prepared by management covering a five-year period, and include no growth
assumptions after the end of the current five-year plan. The projections also assume that the current five-year plan is achieved.
The calculations use effective tax rates specific to each separate segment.
Other intangible assets impairment
Other intangible assets includes site or waste permits, customer lists and other acquired intangible assets as well as
computer software. During the year there has been no indication of any impairment. Accordingly, no impairment review has
been carried out. 64 shanks. annual report 2008

(a) On 13 April 2007 the Group entered into a contract to acquire 100% of the share capital of Orgaworld B.V. in the Netherlands,
for an initial consideration of £7.3m and with deferred consideration payable over the next five years. Orgaworld is involved in
the composting and anaerobic digestion of biodegradable waste. The goodwill recognised is attributable to Orgaworld’s strong
market position and technological know-how. From acquisition to 31 March 2008, Orgaworld has contributed £7.2m to revenue
and £0.4m to profit after tax. The aggregate book value of the assets and liabilities acquired and the provisional fair value to

goodwill recognised is attributable to synergies expected to arise post acquisition. From acquisition to 31 March 2008, Tammer
has contributed £2.0m to revenue and £0.1m to profit after tax. The aggregate book value of the assets and liabilities

(e) If all of the acquisitions had been completed on 1 April 2007 instead of the dates above, total Group revenue and Group profit
for the year would have been approximately £575.3m and £28.4m respectively on a pro forma basis. The pro forma amounts
include the results of the acquired companies from the date of acquisition together with pre-acquisition results from 1 April
2007 to the acquisition date as adjusted for the effect of significant fair value adjustments. The pro forma information is
provided for comparative purposes only and does not necessarily reflect the actual results that would have occurred, nor is it
necessarily indicative of future results of operations of the combined companies and businesses.

As at 31 March 2008, the Group has unused trading losses (tax effect) of £17.9m (2007: £20.4m) available for offset against
future profits. A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of £10.3m (2007: £11.8m) of such losses. No deferred tax
asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining £7.6m (2007: £8.6m) due to the unpredictability of future profit
streams. Tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
No liability has been recognised on the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of
subsidiaries because the Group is in a position to control the timing and method of the reversal of these differences and it is
probable that such differences will not give rise to a tax liability in the foreseeable future.

The fair value of the senior notes is measured by discounting the future cash flows at the market interest rate set by swaps
with an equivalent interest pattern. The fair value of interest swaps is measured by reference to the cost of foreclosing the
swap position at the year end. None of the change in fair value of interest rate swaps is attributable to changes in the Group’s
credit risk.
Risk management
The Group is exposed to market risk (interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk), liquidity risk and credit risk. Group Treasury
is charged with managing and controlling risk relating to the financing and liquidity of the Group under policies approved by the
Board of Directors. Group Treasury does not enter into speculative transactions. 70 shanks. annual report 2008

Interest rate risk
A substantial part of the Group’s borrowings are at floating rates which exposes the Group to interest rate risk. The Group’s
core borrowings are mainly at floating rates except for the senior notes which are at fixed rates. The debt relating to PFI non-
recourse borrowings is at floating rates and the Group has entered into interest rate swaps as a condition of the related debt.
The interest rate swaps represent a hedge of the interest cash flows and although hedge accounting under IAS 39 would allow
changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps to be recognised directly in reserves, the Group believes that it is not worth
expending significant resources fulfilling the onerous documentation requirements of IAS 39. The interest rate swaps are
therefore classified as held for trading in accordance with IAS 39. The swaps are presented in non-current liabilities together
with the related long term borrowings since the Group believes this best reflects the commercial reality of the instruments.
Changes in interest rates could have a significant impact on banking covenants relating to interest cover and on the interest
charge in the income statement. The Group manages this risk by fixing the interest rates on a proportion of its total
borrowings. The proportion of borrowings fixed at any one time is dependent on forecast interest rate cover.
In order to measure the risk, borrowings and the expected interest cost for the year are forecast on a quarterly basis and
scenarios run using management’s expectations of a reasonably possible change in interest rates.
Interest expense volatility remained within acceptable limits throughout the year. The Group’s exposure to, and the way it
manages interest rate risk has not changed from the previous year.

which are subject to fixed rates of interest. In addition, trade and other receivables and payables have been excluded as they
are not interest bearing.
The average term for short-term deposits is no more than seven days.
For the Company, the effective interest rate on short term deposits was 5.4% (2007: 5.3%) with an average term of 1 day
(2007: 30 days). The effective interest rate on the Company’s cash and cash equivalents was 5.0% (2007: nil). The weighted
average effective interest rates relating to the Company were nil (2007: 4.8%) for Euro bank overdrafts, 6.9% (2007: 6.9%) for

Derivative financial instruments – interest rate swaps
The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31 March 2008 was £123.8m

Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates in Europe and Canada and is exposed to foreign exchange risk for movements between the Euro, Canadian
Dollar and Sterling. The majority of the Group’s subsidiaries conduct their business in their respective functional currencies,
therefore there is limited transaction risk. Foreign exchange risk arises mainly from net investments in foreign operations. This
exposure is reduced by funding the investments as far as possible with borrowings in the same currency. The Group applies
hedge accounting principles to net investments in foreign operations and the related borrowings. During the year, the Group
acquired Orgaworld which has operations in Canada, exposing the Group to movements in the Canadian Dollar. This foreign
investment is hedged through borrowings in Canadian Dollars.
The Group has designated the carrying value of Euro borrowings of £113.5m (2007: £80.3m) (fair value of £113.6m 
(2007: £80.5m)) as a net investment hedge of the Group’s investments denominated in Euros. The hedge was 100% effective
(2007: 100%) for the year ended 31 March 2008 and as a result the related exchange loss of £17.1m (2007: £2.6m gain) on
translation of the borrowings into Sterling has been recognised in the exchange reserve.

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group does not have sufficient financial resources to meet its obligations as they fall due. As
well as term borrowing under a syndicated loan facility, the Group maintains uncommitted lending facilities with a range of
banks for working capital purposes. The Group manages liquidity risk by monitoring forecast cash flows to ensure that facility
draw-downs are arranged as necessary and an adequate level of headroom is maintained. The Group’s exposure to, and the
way it manages liquidity risk has not changed from the previous year. 72 shanks. annual report 2008

Security of borrowing facilities
The Group’s principal bank loans are unsecured but are subject to cross guarantees within the Group, excluding the PFI
companies (see note 28). Each PFI company has loan facilities which are secured by fixed and floating charges on the future
cash flows of PFI contracts.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss where counterparties are not able to meet their obligations.
Surplus cash, when not used to repay borrowings, is placed on deposit with banks and money market funds in accordance with
a policy that specifies the minimum acceptable credit rating and the maximum exposure to each counterparty. At 31 March
2008 the amount of credit risk totalled £53.2m (2007: £42.7m).
Credit risk on derivatives where the fair value is positive is closely monitored to ensure that it remains within the limits set for
each counterparty. At 31 March 2008 the credit risk was £Nil (2007: £0.4m).
Trade and other receivables comprise mainly amounts due from customers for services performed. Management consider that
the exposure to any single customer is not significant and that where credit quality is in doubt, adequate provision has been
made for probable losses. At 31 March 2008 the credit risk amounted to £144.8m (2007: £111.4m). The Group does not
hold any collateral as security.
The financial assets relating to PFI contracts are recoverable from the future revenues relating to the PFI contracts.
Management consider that as the counterparties for the future revenues are UK local authorities or councils, there is minimal
credit risk. At 31 March 2008, the credit risk was £158.7m (2007: £149.9m).
Capital risk management
The Group maintains a group funding strategy to ensure that the Group maintains an appropriate debt to equity ratio as well as
an appropriate debt maturity profile. The strategy is based on the requirements of the Company’s Articles of Association, which
state that debt should be limited to three times the level of capital and reserves.
The Group’s funding strategy has not changed from the previous year. shanks. annual report 2008 73

The Group has to comply with a number of banking covenants which are set out in the agreements for bank loans and senior

and relate to interest cover, the ratio of debt to EBITDA and the net worth of the Group. There are other restrictions in the loan
documentation concerning acquisitions, disposals, security and other issues. The Group has complied with its banking
covenants.

Site restoration
Site restoration provision as at 31 March 2008 relates to the cost of final capping and covering of the landfill sites. The
Group’s minimum unavoidable costs have been reassessed at the year end and the net present value fully provided for.
An element of the closing provision relates to costs of £0.5m that are expected to be paid next year. The remaining part of the
provision relates to restoration costs that are expected to be paid over a period of up to twenty five years from today. These
costs may be impacted by a number of factors including changes in legislation and technology.
Aftercare
The total post closure costs of landfill sites, including such items as monitoring, gas and leachate management and licensing,
have been estimated by management based on current best practice and technology available. These costs may be impacted
by a number of factors including changes in legislation and technology. The dates of payments of these aftercare costs are
uncertain but are anticipated to be over a period of approximately thirty years from closure of the relevant landfill site.
Other
Other provisions principally cover onerous leases, warranties and indemnities. The net present value of the rental on vacant
leasehold properties has been provided in full. These payments will be made over the next five years. Under the terms of the
agreements for the disposal of the United Kingdom landfill and power and other United Kingdom operations, the Company has
given a number of warranties and indemnities to the purchasers which may give rise to payments. shanks. annual report 2008 77

The Group and Company’s principal pension scheme is the Shanks Group Pension Scheme which covers eligible United
Kingdom employees and has both funded defined benefit and defined contribution sections. The Group also has two other
small funded defined benefit schemes, which are included in the defined benefit disclosures below. Pension costs for the
defined benefit section are determined by an independent qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the
projected unit method.
Assumptions
The most recent actuarial valuation of the principal funded defined benefit pension scheme operated by the Group dated 5
April 2006 have been updated by independent qualified actuaries to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 Employee
Benefits in order to assess the liabilities of these schemes at 31 March 2008. The main assumptions were as follows:
2008 2007
% p.a. % p.a.
Discount rate 6.9 5.4
Future salary growth 5.2 4.7
Rate of increase in pensions payment (fixed 3%) 3.0 3.0
Rate of increase in pensions payment (cap 5%) 3.6 3.2
Rate of increase in pensions payment (cap 2.5%) 2.4 2.4
Rate of price inflation 3.7 3.2
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements. The
assumptions are that a member currently aged 65 will live on average for a further 22 years if they are male and for a further
24 years if they are female. The assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries are the best estimates chosen from
a range of possible actuarial assumptions.

The overall expected rate of return on scheme assets is 7.1% (2007: 7.4%) and is a weighted average of the expected rates of
return on each asset class. The Group employs a building block approach in determining the long-term rate of return on
pension plan assets. Historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns
consistent with widely accepted capital market principles. The overall expected rate of return is then derived by aggregating the
expected return for each asset class over the actual asset allocation for the schemes as at 31 March 2008.
At 31 March 2008 the IAS 19 net retirement benefit surplus was £9.4m (2007: deficit £8.4m). The change is due to a £19m
decrease in liabilities mainly as a result of the increase in discount rate used to calculate the liability at the year end in
accordance with the accounting standard. The year end discount rate of 6.9% (2007: 5.4%) reflects corporate bond rates at
the year end and has led to a significant movement in the IAS 19 calculation for accounting purposes at 31 March 2008. The
amount of the surplus varies if the main financial assumptions change, particularly the discount rate. If the discount rate
increased or decreased by 0.1% the IAS 19 asset would increase or decrease by circa £1.5m. shanks. annual report 2008 79

(b) Overseas
In the Netherlands, employees are members of either a multi-employer pension scheme or other similar externally funded
schemes. These schemes are treated as defined contribution plans as it is not possible to separately identify the Group’s
share of the assets and liabilities of those schemes. The Group has been informed by the schemes that it has no obligation to
make additional contributions in the event that the schemes have an overall deficit. In Belgium, the Group operates small
defined contribution schemes. The total cost in the year for overseas pensions was £5.7m (2007: £4.9m).

Appendix to the notice of annual general meeting
Allotment of Shares (Resolutions 7 and 8)
The Directors may not allot new shares in the Company unless authorised by shareholders in general meeting. Resolution 7 seeks
authority to allot new shares up to the maximum nominal value of £7,896,000 representing approximately 33.33% of the nominal
value of the Company’s issued share capital (excluding treasury shares) as at the close of business on 27 May 2008, being the
latest practicable date prior to the publication of this document. The Company does not currently hold any shares in treasury and
there are no plans at present to issue new shares, except as needed to satisfy the exercise of options under the Company’s
employee share schemes. If the Directors wish to allot new shares for cash, the Companies Act 1985 states that the new shares
must be offered first to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing shareholdings. An offer of this type is called a ‘rights
issue’ or an ‘open offer’ and the shareholders’ entitlement to be offered the new shares is known as a ‘pre-emption right’. For
legal, regulatory and practical reasons, however, it might not be possible or desirable for new shares allotted by means of a rights
issue or open offer to be offered to certain shareholders, particularly those resident overseas. Furthermore, it might in some
circumstances be in the Company’s interests for the Directors to be able to allot some shares for cash without having to offer them
first to existing shareholders. To enable this to be done, shareholders’ statutory pre-emption rights must be disapplied.
Accordingly resolution 8 seeks to empower the Directors to allot equity securities as if shareholders’ statutory pre-emption rights
did not apply to such allotment:
(a) sub-paragraph (a) of resolution 8 seeks authority for the Directors to make any arrangements which may be necessary to deal
with any legal, regulatory or practical problems arising from a rights issue, open offer or other pre-emptive offer in favour of
ordinary shareholders, for example, by excluding certain overseas shareholders from such issue or offer; and
(b) sub-paragraph (b) of resolution 8 seeks the disapplication of shareholders’ statutory pre-emption rights by empowering the
Directors to allot shares for cash on a non-pre-emptive basis but only for new shares with a maximum aggregate nominal value
of £1,184,000 which is equivalent to approximately 5% of the Company’s issued share capital prior to the publication of this
document. The authority under resolution 8 would also cover the sale of treasury shares for cash. shanks. annual report 2008 89
Both resolutions 7 and 8 are in line with standard practice and the guidelines issued by the Investment Committees of the
Association of British Insurers and the National Association of Pension Funds. Resolution 8 also has regard to the Pre-Emption
Group’s 2006 Statement of Principles on Disapplying Pre-Emption Rights.
The proposed authorities under resolutions 7 and 8, if granted, will apply until the date being fifteen months from the passing of
this resolution or, if earlier, at the conclusion of the annual general meeting of the Company next held following the passing of these
resolutions.
Purchase of Own Shares (Resolution 9)
The Companies Act 1985 permits a company to purchase its own shares provided the purchase has been authorised by
shareholders in general meeting. Resolution 9, if passed, would give the Company the authority to purchase its own issued ordinary
shares at a price of not less than ten pence per share and not more than 5% above the average of the middle market quotations of
the Company’s ordinary shares as shown on the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List for the five dealing days before the
purchase is made. The authority would be to purchase a maximum of approximately 10% of the Company’s ordinary share capital in
issue on 27 May 2008, being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this document, and would expire at the end of
the next annual general meeting or on 23 January 2010, whichever is the earlier. The Directors’ present intentions are that in
certain circumstances it may be advantageous for such purchases to be made if they believe that they are generally in the best
interests of the shareholders and (except in the case of purchases intended to satisfy obligations under share schemes) the
expected effect of any purchase would be to increase earnings per share of the remaining shares.
The Directors would only exercise the authority after careful consideration, taking into account market conditions prevailing at the
time, other investment opportunities, appropriate gearing levels, the expected effect on the return on embedded value and the
overall financial position of the Group. Purchases would be financed out of distributable profits and shares purchased would either
be cancelled and the number of shares in issue reduced accordingly or held as treasury shares. As at 27 May 2008, there were
options and LTIP awards over 3.1m ordinary shares in the capital of the Company which represent 1.3% of the Company’s issued
ordinary share capital (excluding treasury shares). If the authority to purchase the Company’s ordinary shares were exercised in full,
those options would represent 1.5% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital (excluding treasury shares). As at 27 May
2008, being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this document, the Company did not hold any treasury shares and
no warrants over ordinary shares in the capital of the Company existed.
Adoption of new Articles of Association (Resolutions 10 and 11)
The Directors believe that the Articles of Association of the Company should be updated to reflect and take full benefit of some of
the new provisions of the Companies Act 2006 Act (the “2006 Act”) which have been brought in to effect to date. There have also
been a number of other legislative, regulatory and best practice developments since the Company’s Articles of Association were
adopted that the Board believes should be reflected in the Company’s Articles of Association. Accordingly, the Board considers it
prudent to replace the Company’s existing Articles of Association with new Articles which take account of those developments (the
“New Articles”).
The 2006 Act represents a major reform of UK companies’ legislation and is being brought into force in stages, beginning in
January 2007 with full implementation scheduled by October 2009. Over the course of the next year the Company intends to
conduct a further review of the New Articles in order to identify any additional amendments that might be necessary following the
full implementation of the 2006 Act in October 2009. It is the Board’s intention that any further amendments will be put to
shareholders at the annual general meeting in 2009. A copy of the New Articles and a copy of Article 99 identified in resolution 11
will be available for inspection from the date of this document until the conclusion of the annual general meeting during normal
business hours on any weekday at the registered office of the Company and at the offices of Dickson Minto WS at Royal London
House, 22-25 Finsbury Square, London EC2A 1DX. The New Articles will also be available for inspection at any time until the
conclusion of the annual general meeting on the Company’s website www.shanks.co.uk and shall be available at the venue of the
annual general meeting from 15 minutes prior to and until the conclusion of the meeting. The principal changes arising from the
adoption of the New Articles, other than changes which are of a minor, technical or clarifying nature and also some more minor
changes which merely reflect changes made by the 2006 Act, are set out below. References to Article numbers are references to a
particular Article in the New Articles. 90 shanks. annual report 2008
notice of annual general meeting

Articles that duplicate statutory provisions
Certain provisions in the current Articles which replicate provisions contained in companies legislation are in the main amended to
bring them into line with the 2006 Act. Certain examples of such provisions, including provisions as to convening general meetings
and proxies, are detailed below.
Treasury Shares
Since 1 December 2003, listed companies that buy back shares out of distributable profits have been able to hold up to 10% of
the nominal value of their issued share capital in treasury, rather than having to cancel them. Treasury shares can provide some
useful flexibility to companies as they may sell treasury shares in small amounts and without the need to incur the costs of a new
share issue in order to raise additional capital. Consequential amendments have been made in the New Articles to reflect the
treasury shares regime.
Uncertificated Shares
The existing Articles do not contain detailed provisions dealing with the holding of shares in uncertificated form and the rules
governing the CREST uncertificated securities system set out in the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 (the “2001
Regulations”). Various provisions are therefore included in the New Articles to accommodate this matter (in particular, Articles 14
and 34). However, there is nothing in the New Articles which obliges shareholders to hold their shares through CREST and
shareholders may continue to hold their shares in certificated form should they so wish.
Electronic Communications and CREST
The New Articles contain a number of provisions designed to maximise the Company’s ability to use electronic systems for
communication with shareholders and for dealing in shares through CREST. Companies have been able to communicate with
shareholders by electronic means (i.e. email) in respect of certain types of information for some years. However, the 2006 Act
extends this to all shareholder information (including company notices, documents and other information) and enables a company
to invite shareholders to agree that information may be supplied by means of a website. The New Articles allow the Company to
take advantage of the changes in the 2006 Act which may lead to administrative cost savings in the future. The 2006 Act enables
the Company to use electronic communications with shareholders as the default position by placing documents on the Company’s
website unless shareholders expressly elect to receive hard copy documents. It is important to note that before implementing the
default position the Company is required to write to all shareholders to give them the opportunity to decide whether they would
prefer to receive documentation in hard copy form. Various provisions are included in the New Articles to allow the Company to
communicate with shareholders via electronic means and to give the Directors the discretion to use electronic communications to
distribute notices of meetings, annual reports, accounts and summary financial statements. The New Articles also reflect the 2001
Regulations and the 2006 Act by permitting members holding uncertificated shares to appoint, instruct, amend and revoke proxy
appointments using the CREST system.
In addition, the New Articles simplify procedures for transacting the business of the Board by permitting the convening of meetings,
serving of notice of resignation, appointment of alternates and execution of Directors’ resolutions by electronic means.
Form of resolutions
The existing Articles contain provisions referring to “extraordinary” resolutions and “extraordinary” general meetings. These
concepts have been abolished under the 2006 Act. Meetings of shareholders other than annual general meetings are referred to
simply as “general meetings”. Any resolution requiring a 75% majority will be a “special” resolution. Where for any purpose an
ordinary resolution is required a special resolution shall also be effective.
Convening of general meetings and annual general meetings
The provisions of the existing Articles dealing with the convening of general meetings and annual general meetings and the length
of notice required to convene such meetings are amended in the New Articles to conform to the new provisions of the 2006 Act. In
particular, general meetings to consider special resolutions can now be convened on 14 clear days’ notice whereas previously 21
clear days’ notice was required. An annual general meeting still requires 21 clear days’ notice. shanks. annual report 2008 91
Votes of members
Under the 2006 Act proxies are entitled to vote on a show of hands whereas under the existing Articles proxies are only entitled to
vote on a poll. The time limits for the appointment of proxies have also been altered by the 2006 Act so that weekends and bank
holidays do not need to be counted in determining the time limits for lodging of proxies. Multiple proxies may be appointed provided
that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or class of shares held by the shareholder.
Corporate representatives
The 2006 Act permits a corporate shareholder to appoint multiple corporate representatives who can attend, speak, vote and count
towards a quorum at any general meeting. However, where multiple corporate representatives exercise votes in different ways, the
2006 Act provides that no votes have been exercised. The New Articles reflect the provisions of the 2006 Act.
Age restriction on directors
The existing Articles provide that no person shall be appointed or reappointed to the Board once they have attained the age of 65
years and any person attaining such age shall vacate his or her office at the next annual general meeting held after his or her 65th
birthday. This has been deleted in the New Articles as it may fall foul of age discrimination legislation.
Retirement of directors by rotation
The Combined Code on Corporate Governance recommends that all Directors must submit themselves for election at every third
annual general meeting following the meeting at which they were elected or last re-elected. The New Articles reflect this position
and delete reference to retirement by rotation.
Conflicts of interest
The New Articles retain the provisions of the existing Articles in relation to Directors’ conflicts of interest. However, it is intended
that with effect from 1 October 2008 these provisions will be amended to reflect new provisions of the 2006 Act in relation to
Directors’ conflicts of interests which are expected to come into force on that date. The 2006 Act sets out Directors’ general duties
which largely codify the existing law but with some changes. Under the 2006 Act, from 1 October 2008 a Director must avoid a
situation where he has, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or may conflict, with the Company’s interests. The
requirement is very broad and could apply, for example, if a Director becomes a Director of another company or a trustee of another
organisation. The 2006 Act allows Directors of public companies to authorise conflicts and potential conflicts, where appropriate,
insofar as the articles of association contain a provision to this effect. The 2006 Act also allows articles to contain other provisions
for dealing with Directors’ conflicts of interest to avoid a breach of duty. There are safeguards which will apply when Directors
decide whether to authorise a conflict or potential conflict. First, only Directors who have no interest in the matter being considered
will be able to take the relevant decision, and secondly, in taking the decision, the Directors must act in a way they consider, in
good faith, will be most likely to promote the Company’s success. The Directors will be able to impose limits or conditions when
giving authorisation if they think this is appropriate. It is also proposed that the New Articles should contain provisions relating to
confidential information, attendance at Board meetings and the availability of Board papers to protect a Director being in breach of
duty if a conflict of interest or a potential conflict of interest arises. Resolution 11 proposes that the New Articles will, with effect
from 1 October 2008, contain provisions giving the Directors authority to approve situations involving Directors’ conflicts of interest
and to allow conflicts of interest to be dealt with by the Board.
Borrowing Powers
The New Articles contain (at Article 101) a provision regulating the Board’s authority to authorise the Company to borrow money. It
permits borrowing of up to 3 times the level of the Company’s “adjusted capital and reserves” without further shareholder approval.
A similar provision is set out in the current Articles. However, the method of calculating the “adjusted capital and reserves” and the
definition of “borrowings” has been updated in the New Articles to reflect current practice. The updates are generally of a technical
nature although there are some commercial changes. For example, in calculating the reserves no account will be taken of any
retirement scheme surplus or deficit. The calculation of the limit of borrowings is also adjusted so that items such as cash in hand,
cash deposits, short term assets and any security deposit in the nature of cash or short term assets lodged in security of the
obligations of a member of the Group are credited against the amount of borrowings when determining whether the relevant limit
has been exceeded. 92 shanks. annual report 2008

Indemnity
The 2006 Act allows companies to indemnify their Directors and other officers and to provide to their Directors funds to cover the
costs of defending legal proceedings brought against them on an “as incurred” basis. In addition, a company may indemnify the
Directors of an associated company (including directors of an associated company that is a trustee of an occupational pension
scheme in respect of any liability incurred by the Director in connection with the company’s activities as trustee of the scheme).
Since Directors are increasingly being added as defendants in actions against companies and litigation is often very lengthy and
expensive, the Board believes the risk of Directors being placed under significant financial strain is increasing. This may impact on
the ability of the Company to recruit and retain members of the Board of an appropriate calibre. Accordingly, the New Articles take
advantage of the new law. The Board believes that the power of the Company to indemnify its Directors in the manner described
above is fair and reasonable and introduces a more appropriate balance of risk and reward.
Political donations (Resolution 12)
The majority of the Companies Act 2006 provisions on political donations, sections 362-379, came into force on 1 October 2007.
As with the Companies Act 1985, a company may not make a political donation or incur political expenditure unless it has been
authorised by ordinary resolution or the political donation does not exceed £5,000 when aggregated with all Group political
donations in the past twelve months. Whilst it remains the Company’s policy not to make political donations or to incur political
expenditure the terms “political donation”, “political parties”, “independent election candidates”, “political organisation” and
“political expenditure” are widely defined in the Companies Act 2006, and it is possible that the definitions may include
activities which the Company might carry on in the ordinary course of its business, such as participation in functions attended by
politicians or participation in review of Governmental policy or law reform. Therefore, in common with other companies, the Company
is seeking shareholder approval, on a precautionary basis and to avoid unwitting contravention of the Companies Act 2006, to incur
a level of expenditure to cover these activities. Any donations made or expenditure incurred under the authority will be disclosed in
the Company’s next annual report.
Notes:
1. Members are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of their rights to attend and to speak and vote on their behalf at
the meeting. A shareholder may appoint more than one proxy provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights
attached to a different share or shares held by that shareholder. A proxy need not be a shareholder of the Company. A member
present in person or by proxy shall have one vote on a show of hands and on a poll every member present in person or by
proxy shall have one vote for every ordinary share of which he/she is the holder. A form of proxy for use by shareholders in
connection with the meeting is enclosed with this document. The form of proxy should be deposited with the Company’s
registrar, Computershare Investors Services PLC at PO Box 82, The Pavilions, Bridgwater Road, Bristol, BS99 6ZZ no later than
11.00 am on 22 July 2008.
2. The return of a completed form of proxy will not prevent a member from attending and voting in person at the meeting should
he/she so wish.
3. Any person to whom this notice is sent who is a person nominated under section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 to enjoy
information rights (a “Nominated Person”) may, under an agreement between him/her and the shareholder by whom he/she
was nominated, have a right to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy for the Annual General Meeting. If
a Nominated Person has no such proxy appointment right or does not wish to exercise it, he/she may, under any such
agreement, have a right to give instructions to the shareholder as to the exercise of voting rights.
4. The statement of the rights of shareholders in relation to the appointment of proxies in note 1 above does not apply to
Nominated Persons.
5. To be entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting, and for the purpose of the determination by the Company of
the votes they may cast, shareholders must be registered in the Register of Members of the Company by 6.00pm on 22 July
2008 (or, in the event of any adjournment, 6pm on the date which is two days before the time of the adjourned meeting).
Changes to the Register of Members after the relevant deadline shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to
attend and vote at the meeting. shanks. annual report 2008 93
6. In order to facilitate voting by corporate representatives at the meeting, arrangements will be put in place at the meeting so
that (i) if a corporate shareholder has appointed the chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative with instructions
to vote on a poll in accordance with the directions of all of the other corporate representatives for that corporate shareholder
present at the meeting then, on a poll, those corporate representatives will give voting directions to the chairman of the
meeting and the chairman will vote (or withhold a vote) as corporate representative in accordance with those directions; and (ii)
if more than one corporate representative for the same corporate shareholder attends the meeting but the corporate
shareholder has not appointed the chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative a designated corporate
representative will be nominated, from those corporate representatives who attend, who will vote on a poll and the other
corporate representatives will give voting directions to that designated corporate representative. Corporate shareholders are
referred to the guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators on proxies and corporate
representatives (www.icsa.org.uk) for further details of this procedure. The guidance includes a sample form of representation
letter if the chairman is being appointed as described in (i) above.
7. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for
the annual general meeting to be held on 24 July 2008 and any adjournment(s) thereof by using the procedures described in
the CREST Manual. CREST Personal Members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have
appointed a voting service provide(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service providers, who will be able to take
appropriate action on their behalf. In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid,
the appropriate CREST message (a “CREST Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with CRESTCo’s
specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The
message, regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a
previously appointed proxy, must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (ID 3RA50) by
the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments specified in the notice of meeting. For this purpose, the time of receipt will
be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which
the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any
change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means.
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that CRESTCo does not
make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore
apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take or, if
the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s), to
procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) takes such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a
message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular times. In this connection, CREST members and,
where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST
Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy
Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.
8. As at 27 May 2008 (being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this document), the Company’s issued capital
consisted of 236,928,379 ordinary shares, carrying one vote each. Therefore, the total number of voting rights in the Company
as at 27 May 2008 was 236,928,379 votes.

Shareholder warning – unsolicited mail
In recent years many companies have become aware that their shareholders have received unsolicited telephone calls or
correspondence concerning investment matters. These are typically from overseas based ‘brokers’ who target UK shareholders
offering to sell them what often turns out to be worthless or high risk shares in US or UK investments. They can be very persistent
and extremely persuasive. It is not just the novice investor that has been duped in this way; many of the victims had been
successfully investing for several years. Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at
a discount or offer of free company reports. shanks. annual report 2008 95
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice:
•
make sure you get the correct name of the person and organisation and make a record of any information they give you;
•
check that they are properly authorised by the FSA before getting involved. You can check at www.fsa.gov.uk/register;
•
the FSA also maintains on its website a list of unauthorised overseas firms who are targeting, or have targeted UK investors.
Any approach from such an organisation should be reported to the FSA so that this list can be kept up to date and any other
appropriate action can be considered. If you deal with an unauthorised firm, you would not be eligible to receive payment under
the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. The FSA can be contacted by completing an online form at
www.fsa.gov.uk/pages/doing/regulated/law/alerts/form.shtml or if you do not have internet access, on 0845 606 1234; and
•
inform our Registrars on 0870 707 1290.

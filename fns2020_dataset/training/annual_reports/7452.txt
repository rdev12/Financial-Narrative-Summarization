THE CHALLENGE – AN EVOLVING TRAVEL MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY
increasing market complexity gives HRg an opportunity to both
add value and save costs for our clients
Content fragmentation – growing complexity of different fare
types, access to different travel modes like rail and taxi, and client
deals with airlines and hotels all need to be placed in front of the
travel counsellor.
Integration – More integration into client networks and access to
different travel tools require ongoing support and management.
Global servicing – c onsistent service, access to content and
accurate data regardless of the geographical location.
Data collection and delivery – c orporate responsibility and focus
on the travel budget requires more complex data collection and
reporting solutions.
IN RESPONSE –HRG HAS DEVELOPED A FLEXIBLE, MODULAR TRAVEL
TECHNOLOGY WORKSPACE
Flexibility – We have developed a business platform that positions
us for any changes in distribution processes and to the existing
service model.
Evolution – We are rolling out a point of sale application to give
our travel counsellors access to different distribution sources
and have developed a self-service booking tool, HRg o nline™,
integrated into our client networks though our HRg i-suite™ portal.

location becomes less important than the ability to access the
most appropriate person with the appropriate content.

reporting suite, HRg Reporting™, gives a full online view of
traveller for security and budgetary purposes.

In the face of many
challenges, it has been an
excellent year which we
should all celebrate.
I am very pleased to be able to report on
a year of significant financial progress for
your Company. Revenues are up and
profits are well ahead of last year and as
a result we are very confident in
recommending an increase in the
dividend for the year of 25%.
The global economy is slowly recovering
from the financial crisis of the last few years
and HRG’s services are increasingly in
demand. Last year’s restructuring within the
Group and its impact on the cost base has
further underpinned our results and we look
forward now to another year of improved
performance. Our challenge is to continue
to provide the very best service to our
clients whilst managing effectively the cost
of that service. Success on these two fronts
will deliver a growing business with good
financial results and will give us the ability to
reward both staff and shareholders in a way
that reflects the success that comes from
delivering client satisfaction.
Our strategy remains to strengthen our
position as one of the world’s leading
service providers working within the
corporate travel market and maintain a
sustainable business which delivers value to
all stakeholders. Like all businesses we face
some risks in delivering this strategy, not
least coping with any effects of increasing
fuel prices on business travel activity and
any possible effects on the global economy
of recent natural disasters and political
upheaval. We have a strong track record of
coping well with short-term disruptions,
especially during the last two years, and
therefore retain a positive outlook for
business performance in the longer term.
A more detailed review of the business 
can be found on pages 4 to 18, which 
includes the report given by Chief Executive
David Radcliffe, but I would like to draw
shareholders’ attention to the growth in
underlying earnings per share this year
of 16% to 7.3p. This has encouraged the
Board to propose a final distribution to
shareholders of 1.0p which, together with
the interim of 0.5p represents a payout ratio
of 21% of underlying earnings per share. 
I said in my report last year that we aspired
to a progressive dividend policy and 
this year we started to deliver it. We aim to
continue to do so with the rate of increase 
in dividend being dependent on the
increase in earnings and cash flow.
Our principal borrowing facilities were
successfully renegotiated in November
2010 for a further four years at competitive
rates. However, following the financial
crisis, lenders have sought to increase their
margins and we have been no exception
to this trend. As a result, cash generation
and debt levels continue to be a key area
of focus for us. Year-end net debt again
reflects the benefit of management actions
but shareholders should be aware that
average net debt levels through last year
were again somewhat higher than
at the year end.
Last year I drew shareholders’ attention to
the volatility in the Group’s pension deficit.
This year the deficit has fallen by 9% to
£115m as a result of improved asset values
and contributions in the year partially
offset by changes in actuarial assumptions
about inflation rates. The UK scheme has
been closed to new members since 2003
and we continue to monitor the situation
carefully having regard to the interests of
shareholders and past and present
members of the scheme.
Corporate governance is as important to
smaller companies as it is to large ones.
At Hogg Robinson Group, we aim to
optimise the benefits of good governance
whilst carefully managing the cost of
delivering it. Your Board has complied in
full with the spirit of the UK Corporate
Governance Code and will continue to do
so. In this regard we plan to have an
externally facilitated review of the Board in
the coming year and I will report in due
course on the results of that review.
Sadly, George Battersby, one of our non-
executive Board colleagues, passed away
last year. He was a director from the time
of the IPO in 2006 and provided valuable
insight and challenge as the Company
developed in the spotlight of the public
market. George was a valued colleague
who gave great service to the Company
and was a good friend to all of us. He will
be sorely missed.
We have a new non-executive director,
Paul Williams, who joined the board on
1 April 2011. Paul has held senior executive
positions in a number of blue-chip FTSE
100 companies in his career and we look
forward to working with him.
I am also pleased to welcome Kevin Ruffles
to the Board as Chief Operating Officer.
Kevin has worked for HRG for 38 years in a
number of roles and we will continue to
benefit from his extensive experience.
My final words as always are to thank all
those who have contributed to the
Company’s success this year. In the face of
many challenges, it has been an excellent
year which we should all celebrate. To my
Board, executive and staff colleagues,
thank you for all the hard work. I hope
you agree it has been worth it and I look
forward with you to another year of
commitment and delivery as we build
the value of the Company.

It is often at times of
crisis and severe disruption
that our clients come to
appreciate the true
meaning of ‘travel
management’ and the
high quality of our service.
Overview
I am delighted to report on another good
year for HRG, one marked by strong
growth in revenue and earnings, on the
back of a good recovery in activity levels.
For the year ended 31 March 2011, client
travel activity increased by 17%
(1)
and spend
by 23%
(1)
. Our full-year revenue rose by 10%
and underlying operating profit by 19%.
In my statement this time last year,
I referred to the fact that, for most of us
involved in the travel industry, the key
question was how quickly corporate travel
would recover. According to the World
Travel & Tourism Council, global business
travel spend rose by an estimated 7.4% in
calendar 2010; the National Business Travel
Association estimate was 6.2%, so the
picture is broadly similar for both.
In our case, we noted the earliest signs of
an improvement during the autumn of
2009. Since then, we have seen a steady
recovery across all regions, though the
growth in corporate travel activity amongst
our clients has been strongest in Asia
Pacific and North America. Europe overall
has shown some recovery though the
pace of recovery has varied by country.
In the past year, the industry has had to
cope with a number of significant events
ranging from fuel duty rises and severe
winter weather to earthquakes, floods and
a volcanic eruption that have disrupted
travel and heightened anxiety for those
involved. Our strategy remains centred on
delivering value through excellent service
that is tailored to the specific needs of
each client. It is often at times of crisis
and severe disruption that our clients
come to appreciate the true meaning
of ‘travel management’ and the high
quality of our service.
Our clients remain focused on optimising
their travel expenditure and reducing costs.
Many of their cost-saving changes that
were imposed during the financial crisis are
still being applied. It is also fair to say that
many have moved away from the simple
mantra of cost reduction to balance value-
adding services with total cost. As a full
service provider, our technology platform
has delivered real value in the eyes of our
clients. Good examples of this are the
increasing use of online self-booking tools
and the introduction of mobile applications.
Financial results
Revenue of £358m was up 10% as
reported, or up 7% at constant exchange
rates. Underlying operating profit, which
is before the amortisation of acquired
intangibles and exceptional items, was up
by 19% to £41.9m, representing a margin
improvement from 10.8% to 11.7%.
Underlying profit before tax was up by
16% to £32.9m, and underlying EPS
increased by 16% from 6.3p to 7.3p.
After including the amortisation of acquired
intangibles and prior-year exceptional
items, reported operating profit was up by
35%, profit before tax was up by 36% and
EPS increased by 43%.
In recent years, our focus has necessarily
been on the reduction of our operating
costs as our clients reduced their travel
activity. As activity recovered, we were
careful not to add costs back into the
business until we were confident that
the trends were likely to be sustained,
and we began adding capacity in the
second half of the year (albeit at a slower
rate than we removed it) to ensure that
we could continue to deliver excellent
service and to support our continuing
growth. As a result of this disciplined
approach, average revenue per head
rose by 7% at constant currency.
As a result of strong management, year-end
net debt reduced by £16.4m to £61.1m
and represented 1.2x underlying EBITDA
(2010: 1.7x), with net external interest cover

of 11.2x (2010: 13.9x). Reducing net debt
has been a key focus of the group over the
last three years and the net debt has now
been reduced by £49.3m from the peak
year-end position of £110.4m in 2008.
During the second half of the financial year,
we completed a full refinancing of our
£220m credit lines, with £190m committed
until November 2014 and £30m repayable
by November 2018. Our terms are very
competitive in the current market, but the
higher lenders’ margins have contributed to
the increase of £1.4m in our net external
interest costs in the current year and are
expected to add around £4m for a full year.
The Board is recommending a final
dividend of 1.0p per share resulting in a full-
year dividend of 1.5p per share, an increase
of 25% on the prior year. Our dividend is
covered 4.9x (2010: 5.3x) by underlying EPS.
The final dividend will be paid on 1 August
2011 to shareholders on the register at the
close of business on 1 July 2011.
Current trading and outlook
We expect that the positive momentum
that we have seen will continue. Since the
year end we have continued to trade ahead
of last year and expect to make further
progress through the rest of the year.

Client service: 
Case studies
Client service:
Our competitive advantage
Partnership,
consolidation 
and savings
This global technology client was split
into five divisions, each of which
operated independently, including the
choice of their Travel Management
Company.  As each division negotiated
its own deals, and adopted its own
payment method, this imposed limits
on the travel programme including:
• Insufficient data
• Little control over travel
expenditure
• Leakage – many travellers booked
direct on the internet
• Missed savings opportunities
Recognising this, our client opted 
for a ‘big bang’ consolidation in over 
40 countries and HRG secured the
contract to consolidate service on 
a global scale.
HRG created a service platform that
combined in-country local service
with a number of regional centres
(including North America, Middle East
and Eastern Europe) and by using a
carefully managed communication
plan we secured support for the
consolidation initiative, and reduced
the impact of change.
The benefits 
In the 18 months since consolidation,
our client has experienced service
consistency across all markets. In
addition, we have delivered significant
savings, improved the pre-trip
approval process and standardised
the client’s payment methodology.
And by using HRG’s traveller tracking
tool, HRG TravelWatch™, within HRG
Security Suite™, the client is now
fulfilling its Duty of Care obligations.

technology solutions, from meetings
management to consulting (including
benchmarking and analytics), and

warehousing
Our client portfolio
One of our key strengths is the breadth
of our client portfolio. We serve some
of the largest multinational
corporations in the world as well as
many smaller national organisations.
Our clients represent all major sectors
including Banking & Finance, Retail 
& Consumer, Pharmaceuticals &
Healthcare, Manufacturing and
Consulting.  We also have a strong
presence in the public sector.
We work closely with travel suppliers
such as airlines, rail operators, hotels
and car hire companies. For the most
part these relationships are governed
by service level agreements that
include data provision, promotional
support and distribution methods.  
We are also working closely with the
Global Distribution Systems (GDS)
providers to introduce common
industry standards.
Client service is of paramount
importance to us. Our goal is to deliver
a world-class service that meets the
unique requirements of each and every
one of our clients and which exceeds
their expectations. By providing the
very best standards of service through
the delivery of bespoke products and
innovative solutions, we are rewarded
with high client loyalty that is the envy
of our peers. HRG Annual Report 2011 9
Reducing 
cancellation 
charges
This public sector client booked long
stay group accommodation, valued at
£90,000, directly with a hotel in India.
For operational reasons the booking
needed to be cancelled at short notice,
leading to the liability of a 100%
cancellation fee. The client approached
HRG to enlist our support in reducing
these costs.
HRG’s Hotels & Groups service
identified what accommodation could
be reused for another of this client’s
groups or replaced with business 
from other HRG clients. Following
negotiations with the hotel
management, its Regional Sales Office
and colleagues at HRG India, the
cancellation charge was reduced 
by 80% to £18,500, saving the 
client £71,500.
“A stunningly successful outcome,
particularly as you were handed
this poisoned chalice at such short
notice.  Please accept our thanks
and appreciation for the time and
effort you and your staff have put
into this problem. ” 
The incident highlighted to the client
the value that HRG brings to the
booking and contracting process,
including pre-negotiation of
cancellation terms, which has resulted
in more group bookings being made
through HRG.

In a world that has experienced a
number of natural disasters and
growing instances of political unrest,
the issue of crisis management is never
far from a travel manager’s mind. At
HRG we are proud of our achievements
in ensuring the safety, security and
repatriation of our clients’ travellers
who find themselves stranded in 
such situations.
Secure solutions
Particularly in the midst of any crisis,
HRG’s focus is on our clients and their
travellers. We do everything possible to
ensure their safety and mitigate their
inconvenience. The priority is to locate
and repatriate travellers as quickly as
we can. Our management information
and security data comes into its own in
providing our clients with corporate
and individual traveller information.  
We work to ensure that we know
exactly where their employees are
located and that they are safe. This is
made possible because of the exacting
data strategies we implement with
every client: we urge clients to be
flexible so that they have the authority
to adjust their travel policy as necessary.
For example, extracting staff via charter
aircraft, arranging accommodation in
hotels that are perhaps off policy and,
of course, that travellers in affected
areas have adequate extended credit
on their expense cards. 
The most important element is
communication and a human voice. 
All of our affected clients have
dedicated points of contact available
24/7. We are able to pull together staff
from international hubs to enable us to
work across time zones so that our clients
are provided with the latest information
and updated progress reports.  
International network
Thanks to the scale and strength 
of our network, and without
compromising our contingency
services, we are able to ensure that
our normal, day-to-day business
travel management services are 
not compromised by any crisis
situation such as a natural disaster 
or political conflict.
Results
With tensions in the Middle East, HRG
has worked tirelessly to extract and
repatriate clients’ travellers.  
“We cannot thank you enough 
for the service provided tonight.  
We had a long trip and we were 
very tired so we really appreciate
your work and the speed in which 
it was all done. Thank you so 
much from all of us. ”
“The European Head of Security
wanted me to pass on his thanks
to your 24/7 Support team for
their assistance in getting our
travellers out of Bahrain last week.
He actually said they did a superb
job.  Please pass this message on
to let them know their assistance
was much appreciated. ”
As the Pacific Rim recovered from
several earthquakes across the region,
HRG received praise for its efforts in
securing the safety of travellers. 
“I would like to express my deep
appreciation for all your help in
assisting our staff home safely 
in a time of confusion and crisis. 
Y our ability to work with our 
team in the office and get things
organised on the ground for the
team in Christchurch was just
outstanding ... particularly finding
the bus driver, coordinating
accommodation and booking
flights out of New Zealand, 
and getting clearance through
immigration. I have spoken with
our returned staff today and all
have expressed gratitude for the
work that was done to get them
home safely and with as little
hassle as possible. ”

DIRECTORS’ REPORT – BUSINESS REVIEW
Our focus on delivering
bespoke travel
management solutions,
which lies at the heart of
our business model, has
resulted in our enjoying
another successful year
of client retention and
new business. 
Market overview
The improvement in market conditions,
first seen towards the end of calendar year
2009, marked the start of a steady recovery
in global corporate travel that has been
sustained through 2010 and 2011 to date. For
us, that recovery was seen first in Asia Pacific
and has since spread into North America
and Europe, although the recovery for our
European business has varied by country.
Generally, macro indicators point to a
continuing improvement in market
conditions and, importantly, an increase in
business confidence. While no one data set
correlates directly with our business, the
general trends in the data released by the
International Monetary Fund, the
International Air Transport Association
(IATA) and STR Global correspond with
our own experience during the year.
IMF global growth forecasts for calendar
year 2011 have been increased to about
5%, with a similar rate of growth predicted
for 2012. The forecasts vary by region with,
for example, China showing a figure close
to 10% compared to 2% for the UK.
Airline passenger numbers have clearly
benefited from that turnaround. IATA
figures show that January 2011 volumes
were 18% higher than the low point of
early 2009 and 6% higher than the pre-
recession peak of early 2008. For premium
traffic, which is often taken as a measure of
business confidence, volumes were almost
20% higher than the low point of mid 2009
but are still around 10% below their pre-
recession levels.
For hotels, recent data from STR Global
show a similar recovery. Globally, the year-
on-year growth in monthly revenue per
available room averaged approximately
10% during the year ending March 2011
compared to a decline of the same
magnitude for the previous year. As with
the airlines, there are regional variations
with the strongest growth in Asia Pacific.
Client activity
During the year, client travel spend rose
by 23% or 20% at constant currency
compared to falls of 12% and 17%
respectively in the prior year, while travel
booking activity rose by 17% compared to
a fall of 3% in 2010.
Online self booking of simpler travel
itineraries continues to appeal particularly for
clients in North America, Australia and certain
European countries, and the proportion of
online bookings grew year-on-year.
Following the austerity of the last 18 months,
we have seen increasing evidence of some
companies starting to increase activity levels,
although there is continuing focus on cost
control and compliance. Clients continue to
review and consolidate service models that
drive improvement in quality of service and
provide greater data to their business. The
trend for consolidation of multi-country
operations into single-point service locations
is increasing as clients look to strengthen
compliance and improve passenger security
while achieving economies of scale. We have
responded by further extending our multi-
country servicing capability. Anticipating this
consolidation trend, we invested in
telephone call-switching technology and
implemented more home working, which
allowed us to further rationalise our branch
network with focus on a smaller number of
core ‘hub’ and ‘specialist’ locations.
There were several occasions during the
year when our clients’ travel patterns were
disrupted as a consequence of factors
beyond their control. These included the
closing of European airspace as a result of
the ash emitted by Iceland’s Eyjafjallajökull
volcano, the severe weather conditions in
Europe and North America, the natural
disasters that occurred in New Zealand,
Australia and Japan, and the events unfolding
in the Middle East and North Africa. All these
events have led to an increased focus on
passenger security. They have also served to
highlight the value that our clients place
on the breadth and depth of the travel
management service that they receive from
HRG as our staff work tirelessly to help
manage difficult situations and to provide
alternative travel itineraries wherever possible.
Our focus on delivering bespoke travel
management solutions, which lies at the
heart of our business model, has resulted
in our enjoying another successful year of
client retention and new business. Like any
global business, we lost some clients
during the year. Nevertheless, we have
maintained our managed client retention
rate above 90% and grown our business
with net new business wins.
(1) References to client travel transaction activity
and client travel spend in the Operational Review
on pages 12 to 18 are unaudited. Amongst many new clients that we
welcomed during the year were Aviva,
Avon, Bank of America Merrill Lynch Asia,
Direct Energy, Grant Thornton and Noble
Energy. We also secured expanded
contracts with existing clients such as
Agilent, Ericsson, Novartis, Rolls Royce,
SGS Group, Syngenta and Volkswagen.
We are delighted to have secured
contract renewals with, amongst others,
Bilfinger Berger, Bombardier, Diageo,
Foreign & Commonwealth Office,
GlaxoSmithKline, KPMG, Ministry of
Defence, National Australia Bank, Patheon,
Procter & Gamble, Roche, Schlumberger,
UBS, Weatherford and Willis.
Our sales pipeline remains strong across many
different sectors. One of our key strengths is
the breadth of our client portfolio, which
spans a range of industries, with no single
client accounting for a significant share of
client revenue.

Revenue was up by 6.1% at constant
currency. Underlying operating profit rose
by £2.7m, including a £0.6m benefit from
currency movements. Client travel spend
increased by 18% year-on-year at constant
currency and travel activity rose by 13%.
Our focus on large multinational managed
clients means that we are managing our
business increasingly on a pan-European
and even global basis rather than through
individual countries, as the trend amongst
our larger clients to consolidate their travel
spend through fewer locations continues.
We continued to rationalise our service
network in Europe during the year to focus,
where appropriate, on fewer service points
or strategic hubs. We continue to look for
further service and cost efficiencies
without reducing the quality of our service.
Over 300 of our people now work from
home which allows us to further
consolidate our branch network.
Online, self-booking adoption rates
continued to grow and now account for
25% of all European travel bookings, up
from 17% last year. The branch network
consolidation, increasing flexibility from
telephony call-flow switching, and the
growing number and proportion of our
travel consultants working from home
have all helped us to continue to be price
competitive whilst maintaining our margins.
Our UK business produced another robust
performance. The inevitable reduction in
travel activity by our Government clients
was offset by increases in other sectors
and we achieved an overall increase in
travel spend.
In Germany, there was further evidence of
clients returning to pre-recession levels and
this allowed a return to normal working
patterns following the reduced working-
time initiative introduced by the German
Government in March 2009. In October, we
initiated service for Volkswagen, a major
client won last financial year.
Our Swiss business showed notable year-
on-year growth as key clients increased
their travel significantly. We also began to
benefit from trading with several new
clients including Novartis. Here too, last
year’s reduced working hours initiative
was discontinued.

Market conditions in North America
improved steadily through the year.
Following the restructuring of HRG’s North
American operations in recent years the
strong growth in revenue, combined with
operational gearing, improved the
underlying operating margin to a level
comparable with our European business.
Domestic travel in North America is well
suited to online self booking, which now
represents more than half of all corporate
air transactions. The North American travel
market remains highly competitive and
our investment in efficient systems enables
us to handle large numbers of lower price
transactions.

travel activity rose by 37%.
In Australia, our largest market in the region,
we benefitted from a strong recovery in
travel spend and activity. The first full year of
adoption of our fully-integrated travel and
expense management system for the
Queensland Government contributed to a
strong result. We were also very pleased to
be appointed to the panel of preferred
suppliers to the Australian Federal
Government during the year and believe
that this should offer further growth
opportunities. With online self booking now
accounting for around half of all bookings,
we have consolidated our e-fulfilment and
e-support teams to support this trend.
Singapore also saw a strong recovery during
the year with many clients returning to pre-
recession levels. This was especially true in
the financial sectors which were the first to
show recovery. Singapore is becoming a
natural key hub for client travel consolidation
in the region and we opened a new regional
service centre to provide a multi-country
service consolidation for one of our larger
Manufacturing clients as the first phase in
our plans for regional consolidation.
HRG’s joint ventures in Hong Kong and
mainland China also delivered strong
growth. As associates, their results are not

Spendvision provides transaction
management solutions including end-to-
end expense management. Its online
technology automates expense claims
processing for employees while offering a
company enhanced control and visibility
of its indirect expenses. The platform also
delivers a payables management system to
banks and their corporate customers, with
the ability to improve the purchase-to-pay
(P2P) process. Spendvision’s platform is
accessed from customers in nearly 130
countries and is available in 16 languages.
The utilisation of the Visa IntelliLink Spend
Management product, a white-label
version of Spendvision’s platform, is
continuing as issuing banks convert from
Visa’s existing system. The worldwide roll-
out of the Spendvision platform to Rio
Tinto is also continuing and we have won
new UK business in the University and
Local Government sectors, building on our
developing position in these markets.
Spendvision has a strong pipeline of new
business opportunities, with particular
focus on banking.
Technology
Travel management in the modern era is
heavily reliant on data and analysis, with
technology recognised as a critical success
factor. HRG’s systems allow us to offer a
wide variety of proprietary applications and
products but are also compatible with third-
party offerings. We believe that our long-
held commitment to the development of
in-house technology gives us a competitive
advantage over those who are reliant on
third-party providers with off-the-shelf
products. Nonetheless, we also retain a full
capability to work with client designated
third-party suppliers when necessary.
Our systems provide access to travel
itineraries, alternative pricing, policy
compliance, online self-booking tools and
security tracking of passengers. They also
allow our staff to access information from
multiple sources, regardless of data source,
thereby ensuring that we can provide an
efficient, rapid and cost-effective service.
During the year we released upgrades to
all of our major technology products,
including HRG i-Suite™, our travel portal
which is a customisable gateway and
single source for all our clients’ travel
information, products, tools and services,
andHRG Online™, our online booking
tool, adding a new module that displays
savings on UK rail costs.
We also launched a number of new
products:
–HRG Security Suite™ delivers a whole
range of security services from pre-trip
destination intelligence, traveller
tracking and security training to
international emergency response
services in association with global
security experts, red24. In view of recent
geo-political events in certain regions
of the world, this solution is proving
attractive to many of our clients.
We are frequently able to alert travellers
to situations and offer alternative
arrangements, before their own
corporations are aware of the need.
– Our first point of sale application,
linking HRG with suppliers and global
distribution systems using our own
technology interface, became live in
the UK.
We commenced development of a white-
label version of HRG Online™, which
enables clients to make air, hotel, rail and
ground transport reservations quickly and
efficiently. This followed an agreement
signed last year with Travelport which
enables it to market a fully-branded
version of HRG’s booking tool to its
corporate clients. This is a very exciting
initiative as it broadens the reach of one of
our principal products and is testament to
the quality of our technology.
Mobile use is a fast-growing aspect of
business life, and most business travellers
now carry a smartphone mobile device.
HRG’s Universal Super Platform, our
proprietary technology platform upon
which all our travel-booking applications
sit, is built on the Microsoft BizTalk platform
and supports communication with internal
and third-party systems via the internet.
We are developing mobile solutions that
add real value to our clients. Last summer,
we announced a mobile technology
partnership with Sabre Travel Network
enabling HRG to offer its clients TripCase, a
mobile itinerary management application.
Towards the end of the financial year we
delivered access to HRG i-Suite™ and
HRG Online™ through a mobile enabled
website and an application for the
Microsoft Windows 7 smartphone, and
we plan to roll out delivery for BlackBerry,
Android and Apple iPhone and iPad
devices in the near future.
Technology allows companies to manage
their travel programmes efficiently while
enhancing the traveller experience.
We believe HRG’s technology is leading
the way amongst global travel
management companies.
Additional Financial Disclosure
Revenue
Reported revenue increased by 9.5% to
£358.0m, comprised of an increase of
7.0% at constant exchange rates and
an increase of 2.5% from favourable
currency translation.
Revenue per employee
Reported revenue per employee
increased by 9.9% from £61.4k to £67.5k.
At constant exchange rates this was an
increase of 7.3%.
Operating expenses
Reported operating expenses increased
by 7.1% to £320.1m.
Underlying operating expenses, which are
before amortisation of acquired intangibles
and exceptional items, increased by 8.4%
from £291.6m to £316.1m, or by 6.0% at
constant exchange rates. This increase is
comprised of 6.5% for staff costs and 5.0%
for other expenses.
The increase of 6.5% in staff costs
reflects higher costs for staff incentives
and UK pensions.
Underlying operating profit
Underlying operating profit, which is
before amortisation of acquired intangibles
and exceptional items, increased by 19.0%
from £35.2m to £41.9m, including a
benefit of £1.2m from favourable currency
movements. The underlying operating
profit margin, which has not been affected
by currency movements, increased from
10.8% to 11.7%.
DIRECTORS’ REPORT – BUSINESS REVIEW HRG Annual Report 2011 17
Exceptional items
There were no exceptional items reported
in the period. A £3.3m charge was reported
in the prior year relating to cost reduction
programmes in Europe.
Net finance costs
Net finance costs increased by £2.0m to
£9.0m as a result of the November 2010
debt refinancing described below. The
increase reflects higher interest costs and
accelerated amortisation of debt issue
costs relating to the previous facilities.
Following the refinancing, higher lenders’
margins contributed to the increase of
£1.4m in net external interest costs for
the year and are expected to add around
£4m for a full year.
Net external interest costs of £4.6m were
covered  11.2 times by EBITDA (2010: 13.9x).
The IAS 19 pension charge, which increased
to £3.3m for the year, is expected to
decrease by £0.9m in the year to 
31 March 2012.
Taxation
The tax charge for the year represents
an overall effective tax rate (ETR) of
31.5% of the reported profit before tax
(2010: 32.5%). The current year ETR
includes a £0.5m charge relating to the
impact on deferred tax assets of a
reduction in the UK corporation tax rate
from 28% to 26%. An additional charge
of £2.1m is reflected in the Consolidated
Statement of Comprehensive Income
in respect of deferred tax assets on
pension liabilities. We anticipate an ETR 
of around 30% in future years.
Return on capital employed
Return on capital employed is
calculated by dividing underlying
operating profit plus net share of the
results of associates and joint ventures
by average net assets. Average net assets
are based on the 12 month ends for the
financial year and exclude net debt,
pension deficits and tax provisions.
Average net assets amounted to
£216.4m (2010: £209.4m) compared
with £162.5m at the year end (2010:
£165.9m). The return for the year was
19.4% (2010: 16.9%).
Cash flow
Free cash flow, which is the change in net
debt before acquisitions and disposals,
dividends and the impact of foreign
exchange movements on net debt
balances, was £21.4m (2010: £16.2m) with
the increase being consistent with the
improved profit for the year.
Working capital increased by £1.8m,
primarily due to a reduction in the active
working capital programme described
below.  The cash outflow related to
borrowings was £6.8m (2010: £2.8m),
including £3.6m of fees associated with the
refinancing. Tax paid in cash was £9.3m
(2010: £5.1m) and capital expenditure,
which is primarily internal software
development and office equipment, was
£8.7m (2010: £11.1m). Cash costs for
additional pension funding reduced to
£6.1m (2010: £7.6m).
In addition to free cash flow, the other
major cash flow items are related to
dividends paid to shareholders during
the year, which were £3.9m in the
current year compared to £1.2m in the
prior year when only an interim dividend
was paid in cash.
Funding and net debt
The Group completed the full refinancing
of its credit lines in November 2010. The
Group’s principal borrowing is from a
£190m multi-currency revolving credit
facility (RCF) that is committed until
November 2014. The RCF is used for loans,
letters of credit and guarantees with
interest based on LIBOR/EURIBOR plus a
margin and costs. In addition, the Group
has secured a £30m fixed rate loan which is
repayable by 2018 and also has retained
uncommitted facilities, amounting to
around £24m at the year end, which are
used for local flexibility.
The principal banking covenants for the
RCF continue to be measured twice each
year, at the end of March and the end of
September, against EBITDA. The covenants
require that net debt is less than 3.0 times
EBITDA and net external interest is covered
at least 4.0 times by EBITDA. The definition
of EBITDA for covenant purposes is not
materially different from the definition
used in these financial statements.
Net debt at year end reduced by £16.4m to
£61.1m, and was equivalent to 1.2 times
EBITDA (2010: 1.7x). This translates into
gearing of 36% (2010: 45%), or 74% (2010:
99%) including the pension deficits and
related deferred tax assets. The Group has
an active programme to reduce working
capital requirements at the end of each
half-year reporting period. This programme
reduced working capital by approximately
£31m at the year end compared to £35m
in March 2010. The average net debt,
measured on a weekly basis, reduced by
£11m during the year.
Pensions
The Group’s pension deficits under IAS 19
have decreased by £11.7m to £114.7m
before tax.
The UK scheme deficit decreased by
£11.8m to £104.1m. The scheme assets
increased by £16.8m and the scheme
liabilities increased by £5.0m. The major
changes were due to a lower inflation rate
assumption (£2.7m) and a change in
inflation index from RPI to CPI (£4.5m).
Annual cash contributions amounted to
15.2% of pensionable salaries plus a deficit
reduction payment of £6.6m per annum.
The total charge against profits increased
by £1.6m to £5.8m. The next actuarial
valuation will be effective from April 2011
and discussions have already commenced
with Trustees.
The overseas schemes are primarily in
Germany and Switzerland, where the year-
end deficit increased by £0.1m to £10.6m.
At the year end, there was a deferred tax
asset of £27.0m (2010: £32.4m) relating to
the UK deficit and a liability of £0.9m
(2010: £0.4m) relating to the overseas
schemes. The change in UK deferred tax
is due to the reduction in the headline
rate of UK corporation tax.
Share price
The closing mid-market price at the year
end was 58p (2010: 31.5p). During the
year, the price ranged from 26p to 60.75p
per share.

BOARD OF DIREC TORS AND EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT TEAM
20 HRG Annual Report 2011
DIRECTORS’ REPORT – GOVERNANCE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
HRG Annual Report 2011 21
Overview Business review Governance Financial statements
Statement of compliance
The Board has at all times been guided by the Combined Code on
Corporate Governance (‘the Code’) in seeking to achieve the
highest standards of business integrity, ethics, and professionalism
across all of the Company’s activities. This report sets out the
manner in which the main and supporting principles of Section 1
of the Code have been applied. Except as noted below, HRG has
complied with the Code throughout the year and is committed to
maintaining such compliance with the June 2010 edition of the
UK Corporate Governance Code in the future. 
It was with great sadness that the Company announced the
death on 30 August 2010 of George Battersby. Following Mr
Battersby’s death and prior to the appointment of Paul Williams
as an additional Non-Executive Director on 1 April 2011, voting
procedures were adopted to ensure that the Board and its
committees continued to comply with the spirit of the Code.
Board of Directors
The Board has six members: the Chairman, two further Non-
Executive Directors and three Executive Directors. The
effectiveness of the Board is underpinned by a balance between
Executive and Non-Executive Directors and the Board believes
that this brings together the appropriate skills and experience
necessary to provide effective leadership and control of the
Company. The biographies of the Directors appear on page 20.
Board responsibilities, balance and effectiveness
Collectively, the Board is responsible to shareholders for setting the
direction of the business and monitoring the Group’s performance.
It is also responsible for ensuring that an effective internal control
environment exists, and that the risks associated with the business
are appropriately managed. It defines and sets the strategic
objectives of the Group, ensuring that sufficient financial and
human resources are in place to meet those objectives. The Board
meets its commitment to the strategic direction and control of the
Group by meeting regularly throughout the year. In addition to a
schedule of regular meetings, the Board also meets on an
unscheduled basis as the need arises.
The executive element of the Board is balanced by independent
Non-Executive Directors, such that no individual or group of
individuals can dominate the Board’s decision making. The
Group’s Non-Executive Directors are regarded as independent
and free from any business or other relationship that could
materially interfere with their judgement.
The Company has been below the FTSE 350 throughout the year
immediately prior to the reporting year and, in accordance with
paragraph A.3.2 of the Code, the Company has two independent
non-executive directors. Following the appointment of Kevin
Ruffles as a third Executive Director in October 2010, the Board
adopted, and intends to retain, voting procedures which provide
that the votes of the Executive Directors cannot outvote the
combined votes of the Independent Non-Executive Directors.
The provisions of the Companies Act 2006 relating to Directors’
conflicts are incorporated into the Company’s Articles of
Association. No conflicts of interest have been noted or
authorised by the Board during the year.
Directors’ indemnity arrangements
The Company has purchased and maintained throughout the
year Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance in respect of itself
and its Directors, whether in their capacity as directors of the
company or associated companies. The Directors also have the
benefit of indemnity provisions in the Company’s Articles of
Association. These provisions are qualifying third party indemnity
provisions as defined in section 234 of the Companies Act 2006.
The conduct of business
The Company has established business values and standards for
the Group, which provide a framework for the corporate social
responsibility which the Board expects the Company to observe in
balancing the interests of all its stakeholders in the conduct of
business. The Company has reviewed this framework in the light of
the Bribery Act 2010, and has adopted procedures which follow the
guidelines published by the Ministry of Justice in March 2011. These
values and standards are available on the Company’s website
(www.hoggrobinsongroup.com).
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the Chairman
and Chief Executive. The Chairman has overall responsibility for
the Board, which has a formal schedule of matters specifically
reserved to it for decision including the Group’s business
strategy, annual budget, annual and half-yearly financial results,
dividends, and major corporate activities, such as the making of
investments, acquisitions and disposals. The Board also considers
regular reports from the Chief Executive, Group Finance Director,
Chief Operating Officer and operating reports from individual
divisions or functions. Complete, timely and relevant information
is provided to the Board to ensure that informed judgements are
made in pursuit of the Group’s objectives. The Board also reviews
the performance of management in meeting business
objectives, plans the succession of key executives through the
Nominations Committee, and determines appropriate
remuneration levels through the Remuneration Committee.
The operational management of the Group is delegated to the
Chief Executive who manages this through an Executive
Management Team which meets according to a regular schedule
and also on an ad hoc basis as the need arises. The composition
of the Executive Management Team is set out on page 20.
Non-Executive Directors and their function
The Non-Executive Directors provide an independent and
constructive challenge to the business development plans
that are proposed by executive management. Through their
membership of the Board’s committees they also have
responsibility for:
– overseeing that the systems of internal control and risk
management are appropriate and effective;
– managing the relationship with the external auditors;
– evaluating the performance of the management teams in
meeting targets and objectives;
– setting the remuneration of Executive Directors and approving
the Chief Executive’s recommendations as to the remuneration
of the Executive Management Team; and
– planning senior management succession. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
CONTINUED
22 HRG Annual Report 2011
The Senior Independent Non-Executive Director is Tony Isaac. In
this capacity, he is an additional contact point for shareholders
should they feel that their concerns are not being addressed
through normal channels.
Board development and training
Newly appointed Directors receive a comprehensive induction
programme, and training is provided for Directors on their roles
and legal obligations to ensure that they are fully conversant
with their responsibilities as Directors.
Directors are also kept informed of changes to relevant regulatory
regimes, and new institutional investor guidelines. All of the Directors
have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary
and also to external independent advice should they so wish.
Performance of the Board
The Board conducted an internal review of its efficiency during
the year and, overall, remains satisfied that the current Board
systems and structures are appropriate to the needs of the
business. The Board had also intended that an externally
moderated review of its efficiency would be conducted during
the year, but this was deferred pending the appointment of a
new Non-Executive Director following the death of George
Battersby. An externally moderated review will now be
conducted prior to the end of the current financial year.
During the year, the Non-Executive Directors conducted a
performance evaluation of the Chairman, taking into account
the views of the Executive Directors. The Chairman also met the
other Non-Executive Directors, without the Executive Directors
being present, in order to review the operation of the Board.
In addition, the Chairman held a meeting with the other Non-
Executive Directors to review their contribution to the Board.
The table below sets out the number of Board meetings during
the year and the activity of its Committees, together with the
attendance record of the relevant Directors.
Board membership
In accordance with the Code and the Company’s Articles of
Association, all Directors submit themselves for re-election on
a rotational basis every three years and newly appointed
Directors are subject to election by the shareholders at the first
AGM after their appointment.
Board Committees
The Company has established an Audit Committee, a
Remuneration Committee and a Nominations Committee. No
person other than a committee member is entitled to attend the
meetings of these Committees, except at the invitation of the
Committee. The terms of reference of the Committees are available
on the Company’s website (www.hoggrobinsongroup.com).
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises Tony Isaac, Paul Williams, (both
of whom are Independent Non-Executive Directors) and John
Coombe. John Coombe was appointed to the Committee on
8 September 2010 following the death of George Battersby and,
from that date until the appointment of Paul Williams, voting
procedures were adopted to ensure that the Committee
continued to comply with the spirit of the Code. The Committee
is chaired by Tony Isaac, who has significant and recent relevant
financial experience. In addition to the members of the
Committee, regular attendees at Audit Committee meetings at
the invitation of the Committee have included the Chairman
(prior to his appointment as a member of the Committee), the
CEO, the Group Finance Director, representatives of the external
auditors, the head of internal audit, the head of financial
reporting and the Company Secretary.
The Audit Committee meets not less than three times a year and
at such other times as the Chairman of the Committee requires.
The Audit Committee reviewed a wide range of financial
reporting and related matters at its meetings during the year,
including the Company’s results prior to their submission to
the Board. The Committee focused in particular on critical
accounting policies and practices adopted by the Group and
any significant areas of judgement that may materially impact
reported results. It also monitored the internal controls that are
operated by management to ensure the integrity of information
reported to shareholders. The Committee provides a forum for
reporting by the Group’s external auditors. It has advised the
Board on the appointment, independence, and objectivity of the
external auditors and on their remuneration for both statutory
audit and non-audit work. It also discussed the nature, scope and
timing of the statutory audit with the external auditors. The Audit
Committee carries out an independent assessment of the
suitability and performance of the external auditors in making its
recommendation to the Board for their reappointment.

Overview Business review Governance Financial statements
The Committee reviewed the appropriateness of the annual
internal audit plan for the Group, to ensure that the internal audit
function is adequately sponsored and resourced. Its terms of
reference also provide for it to review the whistle-blowing
arrangements for staff.
At the meeting to review the 2011 Annual Report and Financial
Statements, the Committee considered the level of non-audit services
being provided by the Group’s external auditors in order to satisfy
itself that the objectivity and independence of the external auditors
is safeguarded. The lead audit partner is rotated every five years.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises the Chairman, John
Coombe and the two Non-Executive Directors, Tony Isaac and
Paul Williams, and is chaired by Paul Williams. George Battersby
was the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee until his
death on 30 August 2010 and, prior to the appointment of
Paul Williams, the Committee was chaired by Tony Isaac.
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for monitoring the
performance of the Executive Directors of the Company and
other senior executives of the Group against targets and for
making recommendations to the Board on remuneration.
During the year, the Remuneration Committee has taken advice
on remuneration from Kepler Associates in relation to overall
remuneration strategy, and also in relation to the design and
structure of share-based incentive schemes. Details of the
activities of the Remuneration Committee are given in the
Remuneration Report on page 24 to 29.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee is responsible for matters of Board
structure, management succession and the identification and
appointment of Directors. The Committee comprises the
Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors of the Company.
The Chairman of the Committee is John Coombe.
Communication with shareholders
The Board attaches importance to the effectiveness of its
communications with shareholders. The Board has initiated
dialogue with institutional shareholders and the financial
community. This has included presentations of the preliminary
and half-year results, and also includes regular meetings with
major shareholders and industry analysts. All shareholders and
potential shareholders can gain access to the Annual Report
and other significant information about HRG on the Company’s
website (www.hoggrobinsongroup.com).
Shareholders are encouraged to attend the Company’s AGM
which, this year, is to be held on 25 July 2011, where they will have
the opportunity to receive comprehensive information on the
Group’s business activities and to question senior management
about business issues and prospects. The Chairmen of the Audit,
Remuneration, and Nominations Committees will be available to
answer any questions on the work of the Committees. All
shareholders will be entitled to vote on the resolutions put to the
AGM. All proxy votes will be counted and the level of proxy votes
lodged for each resolution will be reported at the AGM and on the
Company’s website (www.hoggrobinsongroup.com).
Internal control
The Board is ultimately responsible for the Group’s system of
internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness in
safeguarding shareholders’ interests and the Group’s assets.
Such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the
risks associated with the achievement of business objectives,
and can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance
against material misstatement or loss.
Within the Group, managers are responsible for the identification
and evaluation of significant risks applicable to their areas of
operation together with the design and operation of
appropriate mitigation. In particular, with regard to regular
financial reporting and preparing Consolidated Financial
Statements, Group Finance participates in the control self-
assessment and policy compliance elements of risk
management. Group Finance also contains a consolidation team
and reviews external technical developments and detailed
reporting and accounting policy issues. In addition, Group
Finance maintains an up-to-date Group Accounting Policies
Manual and sets formal requirements with business unit finance
functions specifying the reports and approvals needed.
Risk management software is used at all major sites and for key
central functions and is readily accessible by management.
The Executive Management Team regularly reviews the risk
management and control process and considers:
– the authority, resources, and coordination of those involved in
the identification, assessment and management of significant
risks faced by the Group
– the response to the significant risks which have been
identified by management and others and
– the maintenance of a control environment directed towards
the proper management of risk
A process of self-certification is used within the Group to
provide a documented and auditable trail of accountability for
the operation of the system of internal control. This is
complemented by the activities of the internal audit function,
which provides a degree of assurance as to the system of
internal control that takes account of the major risks identified
by the Executive Management Team.
The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the system of
internal control that has been in operation during the year
ended 31 March 2011. The Executive Management Team has
reviewed and updated its evaluation of significant risks affecting
the business and the manner in which they are managed.
The results of this exercise have been reviewed and endorsed
by the Audit Committee and the Board, and are commented
on in more detail in the Risk Management section set out on
pages 10 and 11. REMUNERATION REPOR T
24 HRG Annual Report 2011
Membership and terms of reference
During the year under review, the Remuneration Committee
(‘the Committee’) comprised the independent Non-Executive
Directors, George Battersby (chairman of the Committee until
August 2010) and Tony Isaac (chairman of the Committee from
August 2010 to 31 March 2011), together with the Chairman of
the Company, John Coombe. For the year ending 31 March 2012,
the Committee will comprise Tony Isaac, John Coombe and Paul
Williams (chairman of the Committee since his appointment to
the Board on 1 April 2011).
The Committee is responsible for monitoring the performance of
the Executive Directors and the Executive Management Team
(collectively ‘Key Management’) of the Company against targets,
and for making recommendations to the Board on remuneration
policy generally. The Chief Executive and Group Finance Director
are invited to attend meetings except when their own
remuneration is being discussed.
During the year, the Committee was advised by Kepler
Associates on remuneration strategy, incentive design and
market data. Kepler Associates were appointed by the
Committee in 2006 and provide no other services to the Group.
Remuneration policy
When deciding appropriate levels of salary and other forms of
remuneration, the Committee takes into account:
– the annual and continuing performance of each Director
within his sphere of operation;
– the requirement to ensure that executive remuneration is
aligned with the interests of shareholders;
– the Company’s need to provide sufficiently attractive
remuneration packages for the recruitment and retention of
Executives able to provide direction and motivation; and
– appropriate market rates. In judging appropriate market
salaries, the Committee considers external benchmarking
research undertaken for them by Kepler Associates.
There is a formal and transparent procedure for developing
policy on executive remuneration and for fixing the
remuneration packages of individual Directors. The Committee’s
objective is to ensure that at least 40% of each Executive
Director’s potential remuneration is variable and linked to
performance. Fixed pay includes salary and contributions
towards pension arrangements; the variable element of pay
comprises annual bonus and long term incentives. No Director
is involved in deciding his own remuneration.
Elements of remuneration
Basic salaries
Individual basic salaries are reviewed annually by the Committee
taking into account market rates, personal performance and any
changes in responsibility. Salary reviews also consider the
remuneration levels that are being set across the rest of the
Company. The Committee has determined that a salary increase
of 2.5% is appropriate for Key Management (other than David
Radcliffe) in April 2011. After considering a benchmarking review
of the CEO’s salary, the Committee has determined that it is
appropriate to increase David Radcliffe’s salary by 3.8% with effect
from 1 April 2011. The base salaries of the Executive Directors for
the year ending 31 March 2012 will therefore be as follows:
David Radcliffe £420,000
Julian Steadman £291,612
Kevin Ruffles £281,875
Non-cash benefits (other than pensions)
The Company also provides a package of employment benefits
for Key Management. Principal elements include a fully expensed
company car (or the cash equivalent), life insurance, private
health insurance, personal accident insurance and permanent
disability insurance, none of which are pensionable.
Elements of remuneration linked to performance
In addition to salary, Key Management are eligible for an annual
performance-related bonus, which is non-pensionable, and
longer term awards under the Company’s share incentive
schemes, the Performance Share Plan (PSP) and the Company
Share Option Plan (CSOP). The Committee believes that it is
important that Key Management have a substantial part of their
annual remuneration based on performance.
Annual bonus plan
For the year under review, Key Management (including
Executive Directors) were eligible to participate in an annual
bonus plan. The maximum opportunity was 80% of base salary,
with 40% of base salary payable for on-target achievements. 80%
of any bonus opportunity is judged against a combination of
financial targets (principally based on measures of profitability),
with the balance judged against personal performance
objectives. In determining whether bonuses are payable in
respect of any year, the Committee also has regard to the
quality of earnings.
The annual bonuses payable to Executive Directors for
performance over the year under review are summarised in
Table 1 at the end of this report.
For the year ending 31 March 2012, the Committee has
determined that the annual bonus plan will be broadly
unchanged from the previous year, but that the maximum
bonus opportunity be increased to 100% of base salary for
Key Management to help ensure that the plan is competitive.
Accordingly, it has been agreed that a bonus of 50% of base
salary (2011: 40%) will be payable to Key Management for
on-target achievement judged against a combination of financial
targets (principally based on measures of profitability) and
personal performance objectives. At least 80% of these targets
are based on financial performance. The maximum bonus
DIRECTORS’ REPORT – GOVERNANCE HRG Annual Report 2011 25
Overview Business review Governance Financial statements
payable will be 100% of base salary (2010: 80%) for out-
performance of such targets by levels which the Committee
regards as appropriately stretching. The Committee believes this
increase will help reinforce its remuneration policy and ensure
that the Company remains able to attract, motivate and retain
the talent it needs to realise its business strategy.
Mindful of aligning Key Management’s interests with those of
shareholders, the Committee has agreed with management’s
recommendation that this amendment should be implemented
at the same time as adopting a policy that Key Management are
required to build a holding in the Company’s shares equal to at
least their annual salary. Until such time as that guideline is met,
any bonus earned in excess of 80% of salary (net of tax) must be
invested in Company shares which are held until this guideline is
achieved. The Company has already engaged with its major
investors on this change to the bonus plan and has received
overwhelming support.
Pensions
David Radcliffe, Julian Steadman and Kevin Ruffles have a direct
pension contribution arrangement under which they receive a
non-pensionable payment of 22%, 30% and 22% of their base
salary respectively. Details are set out in Tables 1 and 2 at the
end of this report.
Directors’ Service Agreements
Executive Directors
The Executive Directors have continuing service contracts with
the Company which are subject to termination by the Company
giving not less than 12 months’ written notice or by the
Executive Director giving not less than 12 months’ written notice
(in the case of Mr Radcliffe) or 6 months’ written notice (in the
case of Mr Steadman and Mr Ruffles).
Details of the salary and benefits paid to the Executive Directors
are set out in Tables 1-3 at the end of this report.
No member of Key Management has a notice period which is
longer than 12 months. Service contracts include a liquidated
damages clause which is applicable for a maximum period of
12 months in the event of the Company terminating the role or
employment of a member of Key Management following a
takeover of the Company.
Non-Executive Directors
a) John Coombe entered into a letter of appointment with the
Company dated 7 June 2006 for an initial three-year term.
This appointment was extended on 27 May 2009 for a further
term of three years expiring at the 2012 Annual General
Meeting. He receives an annual fee of £125,000 and the
reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses. If the Company
elects to terminate Mr Coombe’s appointment before the
expiry of his appointment, he would be entitled to one
month’s notice and fees during that period.
b) Tony Isaac entered into a letter of appointment with the
Company dated 7 September 2006 for an initial three-year
term. This appointment was extended on 27 May 2009 for a
further term of three years expiring on 11 September 2012.
For the year under review, he received an annual fee of
£30,000, a fee of £5,000 for his role as Chairman of the
Company’s Audit Committee, a fee of £5,000 for his role as
Senior Independent Director and the reimbursement of out-
of-pocket expenses. These fees have remained unchanged
since 2006. With effect from 1 April 2011, the Company has
determined that Mr Isaac’s annual fee should be increased to
£35,000. There is no change to the fees for his duties in relation
to any of the Board’s committees. Mr Isaac’s appointment is
subject to earlier termination by either party.
c) Paul Williams entered into a letter of appointment with the
Company dated 15 March 2011 for an initial three-year term
commencing 1 April 2011. He receives an annual fee of
£35,000, and a fee of £5,000 for his role as Chairman of the
Company’s Remuneration Committee and the reimbursement
of out-of-pocket expenses. Mr Williams’ appointment is subject
to earlier termination by either party.
Share Incentive Schemes
The Company has three share-based incentive schemes, namely
a Performance Share Plan (PSP), a Company Share Option Plan
(CSOP) and a Sharesave Scheme.
The following grants were made under these Schemes during
the year (the 2010 awards).
The PSP
Since the Company’s IPO in 2006, the Company’s granting policy
has been (and continues to be) that awards may be granted
under the PSP with a maximum face value of 75% of base salary.
Awards were made during the year to employees eligible under
the PSP to subscribe for a total of 6,091,372 (2010: 7,644,636)
Ordinary shares in the Company of 1p each (Ordinary shares).
Of these, 1,408,322 were awarded to eligible employees (not
being Key Management) of which 469,441 vest on 7 July 2011,
2012 and 2013 respectively. Awards made under the PSP are
exercisable without payment of an exercise price but, in respect
of the additional 4,683,050 of these awards (2010: 6,301,136),
being those made to Key Management on 21 June 2010 they
vest on 21 June 2013 and are also subject to the achievement of
certain performance criteria which the Remuneration Committee
regards as appropriate and stretching. Details of the performance
targets are set out below together with details of options which
have lapsed or became exercisable during the year.
The CSOP
Since the Company’s IPO in 2006, the Company’s granting policy
has been (and continues to be) that awards may be granted
under the CSOP with a maximum face value of 150% of base
salary. On 21 June 2010, options were granted to Key REMUNERATION REPOR T
CONTINUED
26 HRG Annual Report 2011
Management to subscribe for 5,619,660 (2010: 12,602,269)
Ordinary shares vesting on 1 June 2013. The options are
exercisable at an exercise price of 29.25p, but are also subject
to the achievement of certain performance criteria which the
Remuneration Committee regards as appropriate and
stretching. Details of the performance targets are set out
below together with details of options which have lapsed
or became exercisable during the year.
Performance Criteria in respect of the PSP and the CSOP
In respect of both the PSP and CSOP , half of each award made
to Key Management is based on the satisfaction of performance
conditions based on total shareholder return (TSR), with the
balance being subject to a performance condition based on
real growth in underlying earnings per share (EPS).
Awards subject to TSR targets will vest in full in the event the TSR
of the Company over the 3-year performance period exceeds the
performance of 80% of the companies in the FTSE 350 Support
Services Index. In the event of the Company’s TSR-performance
equalling the median performing company of the index, 25% of
the TSR based award will vest, with vesting calculated on a
straight-line basis between these two points.
Awards subject to EPS targets which were made in 2007 and
2008 will vest in full in the event the Company’s underlying EPS
increases by 15% per annum above the percentage change in
the RPI over the 3-year performance period. In the event the
Company’s underlying EPS increases by 5% per annum above
the percentage change in the RPI, 25% of the EPS based award
will vest, with vesting calculated on a straight-line basis between
these two points.
EPS awards made to Key Management in 2009 and 2010 under
either the PSP or CSOP are measured on cumulative underlying
EPS rather than on a point-to-point basis. The 2010 awards will
vest in full in the event the Company’s cumulative underlying
EPS over the 3-year performance period exceeds 23p (2009
awards: 20p). In the event that Company’s cumulative underlying
EPS over the period is 18p (2009 awards: 15p), 25% of the EPS
award will vest, with vesting calculated on a straight-line basis
between these two points. The committee intends to use this
cumulative approach in measuring EPS performance criteria for
any future awards to Key Management.
The Sharesave Scheme
No options were granted to employees under the Sharesave
Scheme during the year.
Policy on satisfying awards under the PSP and CSOP
All outstanding awards under the CSOP are structured as equity-
settled share appreciation rights. Awards made under the PSP
will be satisfied by market-purchase shares to the extent that
such awards vest in due course. Funding of awards through new
issue shares is subject to an overall dilution limit of 10% of issued
share capital in any 10 year period. Of this, 5% may be used in
connection with the Group’s discretionary share schemes (being
the PSP and CSOP).
The Directors’ interests in the PSP , the CSOP and the Sharesave
Scheme are set out in Table 3.
Chart 1: Total shareholder return on £100 invested
in HRG shares at flotation
Notes to Chart 1:
(i) TSR is calculated in pounds Sterling, based on spot share prices and includes
dividends reinvested on their ex-dividend date. HRG’s opening share price on
12 October 2006 was 97.5p. The closing share price on 31 March 2011 was 58p.
(ii) The FTSE 350 Support Services Index has been chosen as a suitable comparator
against which to measure the Company’s return to shareholders on the basis of
it comprising companies in broadly similar business activities to the Company.

At the Annual General Meeting of the Company held on
26 July 2010, authority was given for the Company to purchase,
in the market, up to 30,776,288 Ordinary Shares of 1p each.
The Company did not use this authority to make any purchases
of its own shares during the period. At the Annual General
Meeting to be held on 25 July 2011, shareholders will be asked
to give a similar authority, details of which are contained in the
accompanying circular to shareholders. Details of the Company’s
interests in its own shares are set out in note 22 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 71 to 72.
Post balance sheet events
There have been no post balance sheet events.
Pensions
The Group accounts for pensions under IAS 19, Employee
Benefits. On this basis, the deficit in the Group’s pensions
schemes at 31 March 2011 has reduced to £114.7m (2010:
£126.4m). As with most pension schemes, assets are invested
for the long term to meet long term liabilities but the deficit
referred to above reflected market conditions as at 31 March
2011. Further details of pension matters are set out in note 21
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Employees
Employees are informed of the performance of the Group and of
any factors affecting their employment. Annual Reports are
made available to all staff and there is a comprehensive internal
communications programme through which management
communicate with employees, and employees are encouraged
to assist in the Group’s development.
Fair and full consideration is given to applications for
employment from disabled persons having regard to their
particular aptitudes and abilities. Efforts are made to continue
the employment of those who become disabled. Training, career
development and promotion opportunities are, as far as
practicable, identical for all employees. The Group consistently
seeks to recruit, develop and employ suitably qualified, capable
and experienced people in an environment of equal opportunity.
The Group aims to maintain a high standard of safe and healthy
working conditions comparable with the best practices in the
particular industry in which it operates.
Corporate social responsibility
The Board recognises its responsibility to conduct business in a
manner which engages positively so as to ensure that it reflects
the social standards of all HRG’s stakeholders.
The following is a summary of HRG’s approach to each of the
areas on which it has adopted detailed policies reflecting its
corporate social responsibility:
How we do business
We recognise that our shareholders have invested in our
business and the success of our business will directly influence
the value of their investment. We work cooperatively with our
suppliers and business partners, choosing those who share our
values and strive for mutual trust and benefit. We recognise the
importance of managing environmental, social and governance
risks through our business practices and work hard to maintain
our reputation for honesty, integrity and respect for people.
How we treat our employees
We respect our employees’ individuality and diversity, require
them to live up to our values and provide the encouragement
and opportunity to develop their careers. We recruit and
promote on suitability and merit and recognise the vital role our
people play in providing excellent client service. We are
committed to attracting, motivating and retaining the best
talent, and will maintain our reputation as a company of choice.
How we treat our clients
We constantly look to offer our clients superior products and
services that provide good value. We aim to give them the
highest quality service and strive to offer them the best
economic and environmental choices.
How we behave in our communities
We strive to behave as responsible corporate citizens globally
and good, supportive neighbours in our local communities.
How we deal with the environment
The Group’s trading activities have only a marginal direct impact
on the environment and contribute minimally to pollution. The
Group is committed to conducting its business in a manner that
shows responsibility towards the environment and in ensuring
high standards of health and safety for its employees. The Group
complies with statutory and mandatory requirements and where
practicable aims to exceed regulations applicable to its areas of
business. Working practices are routinely monitored as improved
techniques and technologies become available.
HRG strives to constantly develop its approach to corporate
social responsibility. Detailed copies of HRG’s current policies on
each of these areas and the way in which it seeks to implement
them are available on the Company’s website
(www.hoggrobinsongroup.com). OTHER STATUTORY INFORMATION

Donations
The Group has made charitable donations during the year
totalling £0.1m (2010: £0.1m). Of the total charitable donations
made in the year £0.01m (2010: £0.02m) was made by the Group
and the remainder was paid on behalf of employees. No political
donations were made during the year (2010: £nil).
Financial instruments
A statement of the Group’s policies in relation to financial
instruments is set out in note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
Policy for paying suppliers
The Group’s current policy concerning the payment of its trade
payables and other suppliers is to:
a) set the terms of payment with those suppliers when agreeing
the terms of each transaction;
b) ensure that those suppliers are made aware of the terms of
payment by inclusion of the relevant terms in contracts; and
c) pay in accordance with its contractual and other legal
obligations.
Wherever possible UK subsidiaries follow the same policy.
Overseas subsidiaries are encouraged to adopt similar policies by
applying local best practice. The figure for trade payables for the
Group at the end of the financial year represents 11 days
purchases (2010: 14 days). The Company has no trade payables.
Statement as to disclosure of information to auditors
Each Director of the Company confirms that (a) so far as he is
aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the
Company’s auditors are unaware; and (b) that he has taken all the
steps that he ought to have taken as a director in order to make
himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish
that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
Auditors
A resolution to re-appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as
auditors to the Company will be proposed at the Annual
General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting will be held on 25 July 2011. The
resolutions to be proposed at the AGM together with explanatory
notes are contained within the Notice of Meeting which has been
despatched to shareholders with this Annual Report.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT – GOVERNANCE HRG Annual Report 2011 33
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Financial statements... The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the
Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Consolidated Financial
Statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors
have prepared the Consolidated Financial Statements in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, and the Parent
Company Financial Statements in accordance with United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United
Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under
company law the Directors must not approve the Consolidated
and Parent Company Financial Statements unless they are
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of
the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the
Group for that period. In preparing these Consolidated and Parent
Company Financial Statements, the Directors are required to:
– select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
– make judgements and accounting estimates that are
reasonable and prudent;
– state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed,
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in
the Consolidated and Parent Company Financial Statements
respectively; and
– prepare the Consolidated and Parent Company Financial
Statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate
to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time
the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable
them to ensure that the Consolidated and Parent Company
Financial Statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report
comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group
Consolidated Financial Statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the
Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on
page 20 confirms that, to the best of his knowledge:
– the Group Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a
true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and
profit of the Group; and
– the Directors’ report contained in the Annual Report includes a
fair review of the development and performance of the
business and the position of the Group, together with a
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.

STATEMENT OF DIREC TORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
34 HRG Annual Report 2011
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS We have audited the Consolidated Financial Statements of Hogg
Robinson Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2011 which
comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated
Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Balance
Sheet, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the
Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and the related notes. The
financial reporting framework that has been applied in their
preparation is applicable law and International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities
Statement set out on page 34, the Directors are responsible for
the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and for
being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the
Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with applicable
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and
only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other
purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements sufficient to
give reasonable assurance that the Consolidated Financial
Statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused
by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances
and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the
Directors; and the overall presentation of the Consolidated
Financial Statements. In addition, we read all the financial and
non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify any
material inconsistencies with the audited Consolidated Financial
Statements. If we become aware of any apparent material
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications
for our report.
Opinion on Consolidated Financial Statements
In our opinion the Consolidated Financial Statements:
– give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as
at 31 March 2011 and of its profit and cash flows for the year
then ended;
– have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as
adopted by the European Union; and
– have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of
the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the lAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
– the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial
year for which the Consolidated Financial Statements are
prepared is consistent with the Consolidated Financial
Statements; and
– the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement
on pages 21 to 23 with respect to internal control and risk
management systems and about share capital structures is
consistent with the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you
if, in our opinion:
– certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law
are not made; or
– we have not received all the information and explanations we
require for our audit; or
– a Corporate Governance Statement has not been prepared by
the Parent Company.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
– the Directors’ statement in relation to going concern;
– the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the June
2008 Combined Code specified for our review; and
– certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on
Directors’ Remuneration.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Parent Company Financial
Statements of Hogg Robinson Group plc for the year ended
31 March 2011 and on the information in the Directors’
Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.

Notes:
(a) The maintenance and integrity of the Hogg Robinson Group plc website is the
responsibility of the Directors; the work carried out by the auditors does not
involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no
responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the Consolidated
Financial Statements since they were initially presented on the website.
(b) Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination
of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 31 MARCH 2011
HRG Annual Report 2011 41
Basis of preparation: International Financial Reporting Standards
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in
compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) as endorsed and adopted for use by the European Union,
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee
(IFRIC) interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act
2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The preparation of the IFRS financial statements requires the use
of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial
Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the year. Although these estimates are based on
management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or actions,
actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates, as noted
in the key management judgements policy on pages 47 to 48.
Basis of accounting
The Directors consider that, taking into account the assets,
revenue and financing facilities available to the Group, the Group
has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for
the foreseeable future. Accordingly the Directors adopt the going
concern basis for the Consolidated Financial Statements
contained in this Report.
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on
the historical cost basis of accounting except for the revaluation
of certain financial instruments and retirement benefit obligations.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all years
presented. No changes have been made to the accounting
policies by comparison with those applied in the Consolidated
Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2010 other
than as described below.
New and amended standards adopted by the Group
The following amended standards and interpretations to existing
standards are mandatory for the first time for the financial year
beginning 1 April 2010. The adoption of these amendments and
interpretations does not have a material impact on the
Consolidated Financial Statements:
– IAS 36 (amendment), Impairment of Assets, effective for
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2010.
The amendment clarifies that the largest cash-generating unit
(or group of units), to which goodwill should be allocated for
the purposes of impairment testing, is an operating segment,
as defined by paragraph 5 of IFRS 8, Operating Segments.
– IAS 38 (amendment), Intangible Assets, effective for accounting
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2010, clarifies
guidance in measuring the fair value of an intangible asset
acquired in a business combination and permits the grouping
of intangible assets as a single asset if each asset has similar
useful economic lives.
– IFRS 2 (amendments), Group cash-settled share-based
payments transactions, effective for accounting periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2010. The amendments expand
the guidance on the classification of group arrangements.
– IFRS 3 (amendment), Business combinations. Under the revised
standard, all payments to purchase a business are to be
recorded at fair value at the acquisition date with contingent
payments classified as debt subsequently re-measured through
the Consolidated Income Statement. All acquisition related
costs should be expensed. When a business is acquired in
which the Group previously held a non-controlling stake, the
existing stake is re-measured to fair value at the date of
acquisition. Any difference between fair value and carrying
value is taken to the Consolidated Income Statement.
– IFRIC 17, Distribution of Non-cash Assets to Owners, effective
for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009. The
interpretation was published in November 2008 and provides
guidance on accounting for arrangements whereby an entity
distributes non-cash assets to shareholders either as a
distribution of reserves or as dividends. IFRS 5 has also been
amended to require that assets are classified as held for
distribution only when they are available for distribution in
their present condition and the distribution is highly probable.
New and amended standards not currently relevant to the Group
The following amended standards and interpretations to existing
standards are mandatory for the first time for the financial year
beginning 1 April 2010, but are not currently relevant to the
Group (although they may affect the accounting for future
transactions and events):
– IAS 27 (revised), Consolidated and Separate Financial
Statements, effective for accounting periods beginning on or
after 1 July 2009. The revised standard requires the effect of all
transactions with non-controlling interests to be recorded in
equity if there is no change in control and these transactions
will no longer result in goodwill or gains and losses.
– IAS 32 (amendment), Classification of Rights Issues, effective for
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 February 2010,
addresses the accounting for rights issues that are
denominated in a currency other than the functional currency
of the issuer. Provided certain conditions are met, such rights
issues are now classified as equity regardless of the currency
in which the exercise price is denominated.
– IFRS 1 (amendment), Additional exemptions for first-time
adopters.
– IFRS 5 (amendment), Non-current Assets Held for Sale and
Discontinued Operations, clarifies that IFRS 5 specifies the
disclosures required in respect of non-current assets classified
as held for sale or discontinued operations. It also clarifies that
the general requirements of IAS 1 still apply, in particular
paragraph 15 (to achieve fair presentation) and paragraph 125
(sources of estimation of uncertainty) of IAS 1.
1 General information and summary of principal accounting policies
Overview Business review Governance Financial statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2011 – CONTINUED
42 HRG Annual Report 2011
– IFRIC 9, Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives and IAS 39,
Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, effective
for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009. This
amendment to IFRIC 9 requires an entity to assess whether an
embedded derivative should be separated from a host contract
when the entity reclassifies a hybrid financial asset out of the
‘fair value through profit or loss’ category.
– IFRIC 16, Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation,
effective for accounting periods beginning on or after
1 July 2009. This amendment states that, in a hedge of a net
investment in a foreign operation, qualifying hedging
instruments may be held by any entity or entities within the
Group, including the foreign operation itself, as long as the
designation, documentation and effectiveness requirements
of IAS 39 that relate to a net investment hedge are satisfied.
– IFRIC 18, Transfers of assets from customers, effective for transfer
of assets received on or after 1 July 2009. This interpretation
clarifies the requirements of IFRSs for agreements in which an
entity receives from a customer an item of property, plant and
equipment that the entity must then use either to connect the
customer to a network or to provide the customer with
ongoing access to a supply of goods or services.
Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing
standards that are not yet effective and have not been early
adopted by the Group
The following standards and amendments to existing standards
have been published and are mandatory for the Group’s
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2011 or later
periods, but the Group has not early adopted them. The Directors
anticipate that the adoption of amended standards will not have
a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements:
– IAS 12 (amendment), Deferred tax: Recovery of underlying
assets, effective for accounting periods on or after 1 January
2012, subject to endorsement by the EU. This amendment
introduces an exception to the existing principle for the
measurement of deferred tax assets or liabilities arising on
investment property measured at fair value.
– IAS 24 (revised), Related Party Disclosures, effective for
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011,
subject to endorsement by the EU. The revised standard
clarifies and simplifies the definition of a related party.
– IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, effective for accounting periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2013, subject to endorsement
by the EU. This standard is the first step in the process to
replace IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and
Measurement, and introduces new requirements for classifying
and measuring financial assets. This is likely to affect the Group’s
accounting for its financial assets, although the Group is yet to
assess IFRS 9’s full impact.
– IFRIC 14 (amendments), Prepayments of a Minimum Funding
Requirement, effective for accounting periods beginning on or
after 1 January 2011 and applied retrospectively to the earliest
comparative period presented. The amendments correct an
unintended consequence of IFRIC 14, IAS 19 – The Limit on a
Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and
their Interaction. Without the amendments, entities are not
permitted to recognise as an asset some voluntary
prepayments for minimum funding contributions.
– IFRIC 19, Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity
Instruments, effective for accounting periods beginning on
or after 1 July 2010, clarifies the accounting by an entity when
the terms of a financial liability are renegotiated and result in
the entity issuing equity instruments to a creditor of the
entity to extinguish all or part of the financial liability (debt
for equity swap).
Basis of consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the results and
net assets of Hogg Robinson Group Plc, (the Company), and its
subsidiaries. Together these form the Group.
All intragroup balances, transactions, income and expenses and
profits or losses, including unrealised profits arising from
intragroup transactions, have been eliminated on consolidation.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised
gains except that they are only eliminated to the extent that
there is no evidence of impairment.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to
govern the financial and operating policies in order to obtain
benefits from their activities. Control is presumed to exist where
the Group owns more than one half of the voting rights (which
does not always equate to percentage ownership) unless it can
be demonstrated that ownership does not constitute control.
Control does not exist where other parties hold veto rights over
significant operating and financial decisions or where the
Companies cannot obtain benefits from the activities of the
entities they have the power to govern. Similarly, the Group has
control where another party owns more than one half of the
voting rights of an entity but the Group can control those voting
rights through a contractual arrangement. In assessing control,
potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or
convertible are taken into account. The Consolidated Financial
Statements include all the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses
and cash flows of the Company and its subsidiaries after
eliminating intragroup transactions as noted above.
For partly owned subsidiaries, the allocation of net assets and net
earnings to outside shareholders is shown in the line ‘Attributable
to non-controlling interests’ on the face of the Consolidated
Income Statement and Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Associates and joint ventures
An associate is an entity, that is neither a subsidiary nor a joint
venture, over whose operating and financial policies the Group
1 General information and summary of principal accounting policies continued
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HRG Annual Report 2011 43
exercises significant influence. Significant influence is presumed to
exist where the Group has between 20 per cent and 50 per cent of
the voting rights, but can also arise where the Group holds less
than 20 per cent if it has the power to be actively involved and
influential in policy decisions affecting the entity. The Group’s share
of the net assets, post tax results and reserves of associates are
included in the Consolidated Financial Statements using the
equity accounting method. This involves recording the investment
initially at cost to the Group, which therefore includes any
goodwill on acquisition, and then, in subsequent periods,
adjusting the carrying amount of the investment to reflect the
Group’s share of the associates’ post-acquisition profits or losses,
which is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, and
its share of post-acquisition comprehensive income, which is
recognised within the line item ‘share of other comprehensive
income of equity accounted units’ in the Consolidated Statement
of Comprehensive Income. Unrealised gains on transactions
between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent
of the Group’s interest in the associates.
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby two or
more parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to
joint control. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of
control such that significant operating and financial decisions
require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. In
some situations, joint control exists even though the Group has
an ownership interest of more than 50 per cent because of the
veto rights held by joint venture partners.
Acquisitions
On the acquisition of a subsidiary, the acquisition method of
accounting is used whereby the purchase consideration is
allocated to the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities (identifiable net assets) of the subsidiary on the basis
of fair value at the date of acquisition. Provisional fair values
allocated at a reporting date are finalised within 12 months of
the acquisition date.
The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is
the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and
the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration
transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting
from a contingent consideration arrangement. Costs related to
the acquisition of a subsidiary are expensed as incurred. On an
acquisition by acquisition basis, the Group recognises any non-
controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the
non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s
net assets. Where the Group has a previously held interest in
the acquiree, this is remeasured to fair value at acquisition
with any gain or loss being recognised in the Consolidated
Income Statement.
The results of businesses acquired during the year are brought
into the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date on
which control, joint control or significant influence commences.
Disposals
Individual non-current assets or “disposal groups” (ie groups of
assets and liabilities) to be disposed of, by sale or otherwise in a
single transaction, are classified as “held for sale” if the following
criteria are met:
– the carrying amount will be recovered principally through a
sale transaction rather than through continuing use, and
– the disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present
condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary
for such sales, and the sale is highly probable.
Disposal groups held for sale are carried at the lower of their
carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and are presented
separately on the face of the Consolidated Balance Sheet with the
related assets and liabilities being presented as a single asset and
a single liability respectively. Comparative information is not
restated. Disposal groups acquired with a view to resale are held
at fair value determined at the acquisition date and no profits or
losses are recognised between acquisition date and disposal date,
unless there is a subsequent impairment.
For a disposal group held for sale that continues to be carried at
its carrying amount, the profit on disposal, calculated as net sales
proceeds less the carrying amount, is recognised in the
Consolidated Income Statement in the period during which
control passes to the buyer. Where the fair value less costs to sell
of a disposal group is lower than the carrying amount at the time
of classification as held for sale, the resulting charge is recognised
in the Consolidated Income Statement in that period. On
classification as held for sale, the assets are no longer depreciated.
When the fair value less costs to sell of a disposal group falls
below the carrying amount during the period in which it is
classified as held for sale, the charge is included in the
Consolidated Income Statement at that time.
If the disposal group or groups represent a separate major line of
business or geographical area of operations, or are part of a single
coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business
or geographical area of operations, or are subsidiaries acquired
exclusively with a view to resale, they are classified as
“discontinued operations” . The net results attributable to such
discontinued operations are shown separately and comparative
figures in the Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated
Cash Flow Statement are restated.
Non-controlling interests
The Group accounts for transactions with non-controlling
interests as transactions with equity owners of the Group.
For purchases from non-controlling interests, the difference
between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired
of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in
equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests
are also recorded in equity. The results of businesses are taken
1 General information and summary of principal accounting policies continued
Overview Business review Governance Financial statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2011 – CONTINUED
44 HRG Annual Report 2011
out of the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date on
which control, joint control or significant influence ceases. At this
point any retained interest in the entity is re-measured to its fair
value, with the change in carrying amount recognised in the
Consolidated Income Statement. The fair value is the initial
carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for
the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial
asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other
comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for
as if the Group had directly disposed of the appropriate share of
the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts
previously recognised in other Consolidated Statement of
Comprehensive Income are reclassified to the Consolidated
Income Statement.
Revenue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration
received or receivable for goods and services provided in the
normal course of business, net of discounts and rebates, value
added tax and other sales related taxes. Revenue does not
include transactions entered into by Group clients for which the
Group acts as agent.
Revenue represents service fees earned from clients,
management fees and revenue and commissions from suppliers.
Client service fees are earned by charging a transaction or
management fee for airline or other transactions, based on
contractual agreements with travel clients. Transaction revenue is
recognised at the time of ticketing of the travel arrangement with
the exception of hotel related income, which is recognised at the
time of booking. Management fees are recognised over the
period of time that the service is provided to the client.
Supplier revenues are earned under sales and marketing
agreements, incentive arrangements and distribution and system
usage agreements. In such cases, revenue is measured at each
balance sheet date as total anticipated income multiplied by the
percentage stage of completion of the contract.
Employee benefits
Pension obligations
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes
or amounts paid directly to the personal pension plans of
employees are charged as an expense as they fall due.
The assets of the defined benefit pension schemes are measured
at their fair value at the balance sheet date and compared to the
liabilities of those schemes at the same date, measured on an
actuarial basis using the projected unit credit method. The
discount rate used is the current rate of return on a high quality
corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liabilities.
Costs of defined benefit pension schemes arising from employee
service in the current period are charged to operating expenses.
The increase in the present value of pension scheme liabilities
relating to employee service in prior periods but arising in the
current period as a result of benefit improvements is charged
to operating expenses over the period during which such
improvements vest. The expected return on the schemes’
assets and the increase during the period in the present value
of the schemes’ liabilities arising from the passage of time are
included in other finance income. Actuarial gains and losses
are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of
Comprehensive Income.
Termination benefits
Termination benefits may be payable when employment is
terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or
whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in
exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises termination
benefits when it is demonstrably committed to either terminating
the employment of current employees according to a detailed
formal plan without possibility of withdrawal, or providing
termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage
voluntary redundancy.
Bonus plans
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses based
on a formula that takes into consideration the profit attributable to
the Company’s shareholders after certain adjustments. Bonuses are
recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the period a
contractual or constructive obligation arises.
Share-based incentives
The Group operates several equity-settled share-based incentive
schemes for employees. The fair value of the awards is calculated
at grant date and is recognised as an expense over the vesting
period. For awards with vesting conditions based on market
conditions (particularly, those based on total shareholder return
compared with external benchmarks), the likelihood of vesting
is assessed at the date of grant and is not subsequently amended
in arriving at the expense for each year in the vesting period.
All other awards are re-assessed at each balance sheet date, with
the expense recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement,
including the impact of changes of previous estimates of the
likelihood of vesting. The total expense for the year gives rise to
a corresponding credit to equity.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those significant items which due to their
size and/or nature are separately disclosed to provide a full
understanding of the Group’s financial performance.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the surplus of the purchase consideration
over the Group’s share of the fair value of the separable net assets
of the subsidiary or interest in the associate or joint venture
acquired. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in
intangible assets. Goodwill on acquisitions of interests in
associates and joint ventures is included in ‘investments
accounted for using the equity method’ and is tested for
1 General information and summary of principal accounting policies continued
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HRG Annual Report 2011 45
impairment as part of the Group’s total goodwill. Separately
recognised goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for
impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised
immediately in operating expenses in the Consolidated Income
Statement and is not subsequently reversed.
The review of impairment includes examination of anticipated
cash flows from the cash generating units to which goodwill
relates. Cash generating units are determined by geography.
Goodwill is written down to its estimated recoverable amount,
being the higher of:
– fair value, the amount obtainable from sale on an arm’s length
basis, less the costs of disposal; and
– the value in use, the net present value of future cash flows
expected to be generated from the business.
When a business is disposed of the carrying amount of goodwill
applicable is taken into account in determining the profit or loss
on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to
IFRS, 1 April 2003, has been retained at the previous UK GAAP
amounts subject to being tested for impairment since that date.
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets are identifiable non-monetary assets without
physical substance. They are stated at cost less accumulated
amortisation and impairment. Cost includes third party purchases,
the directly attributable costs of internally generated assets and
the fair value of identifiable intangible assets arising on
acquisitions since the date of transition to IFRS, 1 April 2003.
Amortisation is provided on the cost of all intangible assets, less
the estimated residual value, using the straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives as follows:
Computer software 3-10 years
Client relationships in acquired businesses 10 years
Amortisation is charged to operating expenses in the
Consolidated Income Statement.
Computer software includes the cost of internally generated
software which is capitalised when it is probable that economic
benefits will flow to the Group from the asset being developed,
and the cost of the asset can be reliably measured and technical
feasibility can be demonstrated. Capitalisation ceases when the
asset being developed is ready for use. Research expenditure
incurred is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement.
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether an asset
may be impaired. If any such indicator exists, impairment is
tested by estimating the recoverable amount. If the recoverable
amount is less than the carrying value of an asset an impairment
charge is made.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation and impairment. Cost is defined as expenditure that
is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Depreciation
is provided on the cost of all property, plant and equipment, less
the estimated residual value which is re-assessed annually, using
the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives as follows:
Property:
Long-term leaseholds 50 years
Short-term leaseholds and structural
leasehold improvements the lease term
Plant and equipment:
IT and office equipment 2-7 years
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether an asset
may be impaired. If any such indicator exists, impairment is
tested by estimating the recoverable amount. If the recoverable
amount is less than the carrying value of an asset an impairment
charge is made.
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are recorded initially at fair value net of
issue costs incurred. Subsequent measurement depends on the
designation of the instrument as follows:
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets as either at fair value
through profit or loss or loans and receivables. The classification
depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were
acquired. Management determines the classification of its
financial assets at initial recognition.
At fair value through profit or loss – Financial instruments at fair
value through profit or loss are financial instruments held for
trading. A financial instrument is classified in this category if
acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term.
Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless they are
designated as hedges. Financial instruments in this category are
classified as current assets or liabilities.
Loans and receivables – Loans and receivables are non-derivative
financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not
quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets,
except where expected maturity is greater than 12 months after
the balance sheet date which are classified as non-current assets.
The Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other
receivables and cash and cash equivalent assets in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on
the trade-date, the date on which the Group commits to
purchase or sell the asset. Investments are initially recognised at
1 General information and summary of principal accounting policies continued
Overview Business review Governance Financial statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2011 – CONTINUED
46 HRG Annual Report 2011
1 General information and summary of principal accounting policies continued
fair value for all financial assets not carried at fair value through
profit or loss. Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or
loss are initially recognised at fair value and transaction costs are
expensed in the Consolidated Income Statement. Financial assets
are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the
investments have expired or have been transferred and the Group
has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the
effective interest method.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss category are
presented in the Consolidated Income Statement in the period
in which they arise.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value with
subsequent provision for impairment. A provision for impairment
of trade receivables is established when there is objective
evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts
due according to the original terms of the receivables. Significant
financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will
enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or
delinquency in payments (more than 90 days overdue) are
considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. The
amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s
carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash
flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. The
carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of a
provision account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in
the Consolidated Income Statement. When a trade receivable is
not collectible, it is written off against the provision account for
trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously
written off are credited to the Consolidated Income Statement.
Financial liabilities
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method.
Borrowings are held at amortised cost and are classified as current
liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer
settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance
sheet date. Currency swaps are stated at fair value on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Exchange movements on foreign
currency borrowings are taken to reserves to the extent that the
borrowing is in the functional currency of the obligor and to the
Consolidated Income Statement to the extent it is not. Changes in
the fair value of currency swaps are taken to the Consolidated
Income Statement as they are acquired principally for the purpose
of selling in the short term. Net finance costs are recognised as an
expense in the year in which they are incurred. Debt issue costs
are amortised proportionally over the anticipated life of the
relevant debt facility, using the effective interest method.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according
to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual
interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its
liabilities. A financial liability is a contractual obligation to deliver
cash or another financial asset to a third party.
Other financial instruments are stated at fair value with
differences on valuation taken to reserves if hedge accounting
has been established for the particular instrument. Otherwise,
the differences on valuation are taken to the Consolidated
Income Statement. These include interest rate caps and amounts
receivable or payable in foreign currency together with the
forward foreign currency exchange contracts used to fix their
value. Fair values are derived from published financial data.
Foreign currency translation
Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of each of
the Group’s subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures and associates
are measured using the currency of the primary economic
environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency).
The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in sterling
which is the Company’s functional and presentational currency.
Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional
currency of the relevant entity using the exchange rates
prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange
gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such
transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates
of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement,
except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges or
qualifying net investment hedges.
Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures
and associates in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at
the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. The results
of foreign subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are translated
at the average rate of exchange for the year.
Exchange differences arising on the consolidation at closing rates
of net investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates,
together with those on foreign currency loans which finance
them, are taken to reserves and reported in the Consolidated
Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a
foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign
entity and translated at the closing rate. The Group has elected to
treat goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition
to IFRS (1 April 2003) as a sterling denominated asset.
Leasing
A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all
the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. Other leases are
classified as operating leases.
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HRG Annual Report 2011 47
1 General information and summary of principal accounting policies continued
Overview Business review Governance Financial statements
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase agreements
are included in property, plant and equipment and are
depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or their useful
economic life. Lease obligations are stated net of finance charges
attributable to future periods. Finance costs are allocated over the
period of the lease to give a constant rate of charge.
Operating lease rentals, net of any incentives received from the
lessor, are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement over
the life of the lease.
Taxation
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the
tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet
date in the countries where the Group’s subsidiaries, joint
ventures and associates operate and generate taxable income.
Management periodically evaluates the positions taken in tax
returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax
regulation is subject to interpretation and establishes provisions
where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid
to the tax authorities.
Deferred income tax is provided, using the liability method, on
temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Consolidated Financial
Statements. However, the deferred income tax is not accounted for
if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a
transaction other than a business combination that at the time of
the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that
have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet
date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income
tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is
probable that future taxable profit will be available against which
the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising
on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the
timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by
the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will
not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Dividend distributions
Interim dividends are recognised in the Consolidated Financial
Statements in the period in which they are paid.
Final dividends to the Company’s shareholders are recognised in
the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements in the period in
which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.
The amounts of dividends taken as shares instead of cash under
the scrip dividend scheme have been added back to reserves. The
nominal value of shares issued under the scheme has been
funded out of the share premium account.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when there is a present legal or
constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that
an outflow of resources will be necessary to settle the obligation and
the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions for restructuring
costs are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for
the restructuring that has been communicated to affected parties.
Provisions are discounted where the impact is material.
Cash and cash equivalents
For the purposes of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, cash
and cash equivalents includes bank balances and deposits with
original maturities of three months or less. It also includes bank
overdrafts which form an integral part of the Group’s cash
management and are likely to fluctuate from overdrawn to
positive balances. Bank overdrafts, where there is no right of set-
off, are shown as borrowings within current liabilities.
Share capital and share premium
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly
attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in
equity as a deduction from the proceeds.
The premium received on the issue of shares in excess of the
nominal value of shares is credited to the share premium account
and included within shareholders’ equity.
Employee Benefits Trust
Transactions, assets and liabilities of the Group sponsored
Employee Benefits Trust are included in the Consolidated
Financial Statements. In particular, the Trust’s purchases of shares
in the Company remain deducted from shareholders’ funds until
they vest unconditionally with employees.
Related party transactions
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption under IAS 24,
Related Party Disclosures, not to disclose transactions and balances
between Group entities that have been eliminated on consolidation.
Critical accounting estimates and key management judgements
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are
based on historical experience and other factors, including
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances.
The principal management judgements made in the preparation
of these Consolidated Financial Statements are:
– the assessment of the impairment of goodwill at each balance
sheet date (see note 10). This process depends on the
preparation of estimates of future cash flows expected to be
generated by each business in the Group;
– the valuation of client relationships included in intangible
assets at acquisition (see note 10). This process depends on the
preparation of estimates of future cash flows expected to be
generated by existing clients at acquisition; NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2011 – CONTINUED
48 HRG Annual Report 2011
– the capitalisation of internally generated intangible assets. This
process depends on it being probable that economic benefits
will flow to the Group from the asset being developed, the cost
of the asset being reliably measured and the technical
feasibility being demonstrated;
– the evaluation of the recoverability of deferred tax assets (see
note 20), which depends on the assessment of the probability
that there will be sufficient appropriate taxable profits available
in future against which to realise them;
– the evaluation of retirement benefit obligations. This depends
on the actuarial assumptions set out in note 21, including
estimates of future returns on scheme assets; and
– within revenue there are key judgements made by
management in terms of revenue recognition. The Group
uses a percentage of completion method to measure supplier
revenues earned under sales and marketing agreements,
incentive arrangements, and distribution and usage
agreements.
1 General information and summary of principal accounting policies continued
Risk management policy
The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the
unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise
potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance.
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department
(Group Treasury) under policies approved by the Board of
Directors. Group Treasury identifies, evaluates financial risks and
uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk
exposures. The Group’s treasury policy does not allow transactions
of a speculative nature.
The Group arranges central borrowing facilities and maintains
local banking relationships to enable it to meet payment
obligations as they fall due, taking into account information from
its cash forecasts and business plans. The amounts of unused
borrowing facilities are set out in note 17.
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard
the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern while
providing adequate returns for shareholders and benefits for
other stakeholders and to maintain a capital structure to
optimise the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may
adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return
capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce
debt. It may also increase debt provided that the funded venture
provides adequate returns so that the overall capital structure
remains supportable.
The Group uses an operational gearing ratio to manage net
debt(1) to ensure that covenants within banking arrangements
are complied with. Using a ratio of EBITDA(2) before exceptional
items to net debt, at 31 March 2011 the operational gearing
ratio was 1.2 (2010: 1.7). The definition of EBITDA for covenant
purposes is not materially different from the definition used in
these Consolidated Financial Statements.
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods
adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of
measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are
recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial
liability and equity instrument are disclosed within General
information and accounting policies (see note 1).
(1) Net debt is calculated as total borrowings (including current and non-current
borrowings as shown in the Consolidated Balance Sheet but excluding
unamortised loan issue costs) less cash and cash equivalent assets.
(2) Earnings before net finance costs, income taxes, depreciation, amortisation
and impairment.
Foreign currency risk
The translation of non-Sterling earnings, assets and liabilities of
the Group is affected by changes in exchange rates.
The Group uses short-term currency swaps linked to intercompany
lending as well as direct borrowing in non-Sterling currencies to
manage the currency profile of external borrowings.
Net debt at 31 March 2011 included £11.5m of non-Sterling debt
(2010: £28.9m) with changes in exchange rates, including the effect
of currency swaps, increasing the balance by £0.3m (2010: £5.8m).
The Group’s transaction exposure is limited, with the majority
of its transactions denominated in the currency of the country
of operation. In the few instances where there is exposure,
short-term hedges are taken once the exposure can be
accurately identified.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HRG Annual Report 2011 49
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
For the year ended 31 March 2011, if the average value of Sterling
had been 5% higher or lower relative to other currencies than
actual, the profit before tax of the Group would have been
reduced or increased by £1.1m compared to the actual result
(2010: £1.1m). The impact on equity would be a movement of
£6.4m (2010: £5.6m) mainly arising on foreign currency exchange
gains or losses on translation of net investment in foreign
subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.
Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on any borrowing at
floating interest rates. The interest rate on the Revolving Credit
Facility (RCF) is not currently fixed, although the Group keeps
this situation under review. The fixed rate loan has an interest
rate of 7.239%.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
For the year ended 31 March 2011, if interest rates in all
currencies in which the Group has borrowings had been higher
or lower by 1%, interest cost would have been increased or
reduced by £1.3m (2010: £1.4m).
Credit risk
The risk associated with deposits in commercial banks is
managed by diversifying with a number of well known financial
institutions together with a periodic review of ratings attributed
by major credit rating institutions.
The risk associated with clients and suppliers is not material based
on the current client and supplier concentration and based on
the large number of countries where the Group trades. The Group
makes widespread use of credit checks in respect of clients and
maintains a close working relationship with its key suppliers.
Liquidity risk
The RCF is committed until November 2014 and used for loans,
letters of credit and guarantees. The fixed rate sterling private
placement of debt is committed in full until November 2016 when
equal annual repayments begin until November 2018. In addition,
the Group has uncommitted facilities that are used for local flexibility.
Working capital requirements fluctuate significantly during the year,
with March and September typically being the lowest levels.
Liquidity and interest risk tables
The table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities including
future expected interest payable and net-settled derivative
financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the
remaining period at the balance sheet to the contractual maturity
date. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual
undiscounted cash flows. Balances due within 12 months equal
their carrying value as the impact of discounting is not significant:

3 Segment information
The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Executive Management Team, which reviews the Group’s internal
reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources. The Executive Management Team has determined the operating
segments based on these reports.
The Executive Management Team considers the business from the perspective of two core activities, Corporate Travel Management,
which is analysed into three distinct geographic segments, and Spendvision. The Group’s internal reporting processes do not
distinguish between the numerous sources of income that comprise revenue for Corporate Travel Management. The performance of
the operating segments is assessed based on a measure of operating profit excluding items of an exceptional nature. Interest income
and expenditure and income tax expense are not included in the result for each operating segment that is reviewed by the Executive
Management Team. Other information provided, except as noted below, to the Executive Management Team is measured in a
manner consistent with that in the financial statements.
Total segment assets exclude cash and cash equivalent assets, current tax assets and deferred tax assets which are managed on a
central basis. These are included as part of the reconciliation to total Consolidated Balance Sheet assets.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 10 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued
Impairment of goodwill
The recoverable amount used in the assessment of goodwill for all cash generating units comprises the higher of value in use and
net realisable value. During the year the Group reviewed its discount rate and long term growth rates and these have been applied in
the assessment. The value in use has been calculated by discounting at 10% per annum (2010: 8% per annum) the anticipated pre-tax
cash flows. The forecasts are prepared from management information taking into account historical trading performance and
anticipated changes in future market conditions. The detailed forecasts cover a period of three years from the balance sheet date;
cash flows are projected beyond that period based on market consensus for GDP growth of 2% (2010: 2%).
Goodwill consists of the following amounts related to cash generating units of the Group:

Europe 172.9 171.7

Asia Pacific 1.0 1.0
217.5 218.3
Spendvision 3.5 3.5
221.0 221.8
The key assumptions used in the impairment testing were as follows:
– Discount rates
– Rates of growth in cash generating units beyond 3 years
Discount rate
The discount rate reflects the management’s estimate of the post-tax cost of capital employed for the Group’s cash generating units
listed above. The same rate is applied to all cash generating units, and reflects the Group’s funding arrangements where all units have
equal access to the Group’s treasury functions and borrowing lines to fund their operations. None of the Group’s cash generating units
demonstrate levels of risks that are significantly different from those experienced by the Group generally, and all have similar funding
profiles and therefore the discount rate applied is deemed to be justified.
Rates of growth in cash generating units beyond 3 years
Management have reviewed Corporate Travel industry forecasts and consider that the market consensus for GDP growth of 2% is
reasonable for the purposes of the assessment of goodwill.
Goodwill impairment
Management believes that no reasonable change in the key assumptions would cause any of the identified cash generating units to
become impaired.

HRG Annual Report 2011 67
Overview Business review Governance Financial statements 20 Deferred tax continued
The UK Government reduced the rate of corporation tax from 28% to 26% with effect from 1 April 2011. Based on the UK deferred tax
balances as at 31 March 2010, this has led to a reduction in deferred tax assets of £2.6m, of which £2.1m is recognised in the
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and £0.5m is in the Consolidated Income Statement. Further proposals to reduce
the UK rate by 1% per annum to 23% by April 2014 had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, are
not reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Of the total tax losses at 31 March 2011, £0.2m is scheduled to expire by 31 March 2021.
No deferred tax is recognised on the undistributed profits of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates as they are reinvested by the
Group and no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future. Since acquisition, subsidiaries have made profits of
£58.3m (2010: £44.0m) that have not been remitted to the Company.
21 Retirement benefit obligations
Defined benefit pension arrangements
The Group’s principal defined benefit pension arrangement is the Hogg Robinson (1987) Pension Scheme (the UK Scheme). The UK
Scheme was available to most UK employees until it was closed to new members in March 2003, with benefits based on final pensionable
salary. The increase in final pensionable salary since 31 March 2003 is limited to the lower of the increase in the Retail Prices Index and 5%
per annum. The latest actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out at 6 April 2008 by an independent qualified actuary.
The Group also operates defined benefit schemes in Norway, Switzerland, Germany, Italy and France.
The following amounts have been included in the Consolidated Income Statement in respect of all defined benefit pension arrangements:

Debt instruments 4.50% 4.50% 6.70%
Property 8.00% 8.00% 7.20%
Other assets 4.90% 4.40% 5.00%
The assumptions for the schemes in Norway, Switzerland, Germany, Italy and France do not produce materially different results from
the assumptions used for the UK Scheme.
The expected rates of return have been set taking into account current market returns for each category of asset at the balance sheet dates.
The net present value of the defined benefit obligations of the UK Scheme is sensitive to both the actuarial assumptions used and to
market conditions. If the discount rate assumption was 0.5% lower, the obligations would be expected to increase by £37.4m and if it
was 0.5% higher, they would be expected to decrease by £32.1m. If the inflation assumption was 0.5% lower, the obligations would be
expected to decrease by £13.2m and if it was 0.5% higher, they would be expected to increase by £14.9m.
The impact of the change in inflation index from RPI to CPI can be found in the Additional Financial Disclosure within the
Operational Review on page 17.
The mortality assumptions for the UK Scheme are based on PMA/FA92 tables with ‘medium cohort’ projections and a 1% underpin in
the rate of future improvements in mortality. Life expectancy at the age of 65 is assumed to be:
Years ended 31 March
2011 2010
Current Pensioners
Male 22.8 22.7
Female 26.1 26.0
Future retirements
Male 24.8 24.7
Female 28.2 28.1
The UK liability is based on the assumption that active and deferred members will take 25% of the value of their pension as a lump
sum on retirement.
The net present value of the defined benefit obligations of the UK Scheme are sensitive to the life expectancy assumption. If there
was an increase of one year to this assumption the obligations would be expected to increase by £9.6m.

The schedule of contributions for the UK Scheme, agreed with the Trustees at 15.2% of pensionable salaries plus £6.6m per annum
with effect from April 2008, was intended to eliminate the deficit over 10 years from April 2006. During the year ended 31 March
2011, contributions amounting to £8.5m were made and, based on this schedule, would remain at this level for the year ending

Overview Business review Governance Financial statements 26 Contingent liabilities and contingent assets
In 1994 Compagnie Dens Ocean NV (CDO), an indirectly owned subsidiary, received a claim from the Belgian Customs authorities
resulting in a liquidator being appointed in 1995. Civil litigation is in process with criminal proceedings being considered pending the
final outcome of the civil action. The liquidator is defending the civil action vigorously and has received strong legal advice on the
strength of CDO’s case. The Directors continue to believe, on the basis of such advice, that any future impact on the net assets of the
Group would not be material.

30 Share-based incentives
The Group operates equity-settled share-based incentive schemes as follows:
Performance Share Plan (PSP)
The PSP is applicable to senior executives including Key Management. Shares are awarded which vest for no consideration after a
three year period. Option holders are not entitled to receive dividends during the vesting period.
For Key Management, each award has two discrete elements with performance conditions based on total shareholder return
(TSR) and on basic earnings per share (EPS).
The extent to which the TSR portion of the scheme will vest is subject to the Company’s TSR performance over a three year period
relative to the TSR performance of the companies in the FTSE 350 Support Service Index. Full vesting will take place for a top 20%
ranking, 25% vesting for a median ranking and no award if TSR falls below the median.
The extent to which the EPS portion of any award will vest is subject to the underlying EPS of the Company increasing over a three
year period.
– For awards made during the year ended 31 March 2009, full vesting will take place if the increase in underlying EPS is at least 15%
per annum greater than the increase in RPI over the same period, 25% vesting if the increase over RPI is 5% per annum greater and
no award if underlying EPS falls below this 5% increase over RPI. Vesting is calculated on a straight-line basis between these points.
The performance period for these awards is the three financial years ending on 31 March 2011.
– For awards made during the year ended 31 March 2010, full vesting takes place in the event that the Company’s underlying EPS
cumulatively equals or is greater than 20p over the performance period, 25% if in the event that the Company’s underlying EPS
cumulatively equals or is greater than 15p over the performance period and no award if underlying EPS falls below this. Vesting is
calculated on a straight-line basis between these points. The performance period for these awards is the three financial years
ending on 31 March 2012.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2011 – CONTINUED
76 HRG Annual Report 2011
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 30 Share-based incentives continued
– For awards made during the year ended 31 March 2011, full vesting takes place in the event that the Company’s underlying EPS
cumulatively equals or is greater than 23p over the performance period, 25% if in the event that the Company’s underlying EPS
cumulatively equals or is greater than 18p over the performance period and no award if underlying EPS falls below this. Vesting is
calculated on a straight-line basis between these points. The performance period for these awards is the three financial years
ending on 31 March 2013.
Awards to certain senior executives (other than Key Management) are not subject to TSR or EPS performance conditions.
– For awards made during the years ended 31 March 2009 and 31 March 2010, 25% of such awards vest two years after the grant
date, with the remaining 75% vesting one year later.
– For awards made during the year ended 31 March 2011, one third of such awards vest on each anniversary of the Deed of Grant.
If performance conditions are met then shares will be issued up to six months after the vesting date. Participants who leave as a
result of a qualifying reason (generally retirement or involuntary redundancy) will receive a pro-rata entitlement. The awards for other
participants who leave prior to vesting will lapse.
Company Share Option Plan (CSOP)
The CSOP is applicable to senior executives including Key Management. Share options are awarded which vest after a three year
period subject to performance conditions. The exercise price of the options is the market price of shares immediately prior to the
award. Each award has two discrete elements with performance conditions based on total shareholder return (TSR) and on earnings
per share (EPS). The performance conditions and arrangements for leavers are the same as for the PSP scheme. Options can be
exercised for a period of seven years following the end of the vesting period. Option holders are not entitled to receive dividends
during the vesting period.
Sharesave schemes
Sharesave schemes have been established in most countries in which the Group has operations and are applicable to all employees.
Options are issued linked to savings contracts of up to £250 per month (or equivalent amounts overseas) for periods of three or five
years (two years in the USA) with a six month exercise period. Options are issued at a discount of up to 20% of the market price
immediately preceding the date of invitation to apply.
Charge for the year
The Group’s charge for equity-settled share-based incentives for the year of £2.2m (2010: £1.1m) has been included in operating
expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement.

The fair value of awards granted in the year is estimated as at the date of grant using the following valuation models:
Valuation model
Grants subject to TSR conditions Monte Carlo
Grants subject to EPS and service conditions and Sharesave schemes Black-Scholes
Key assumptions used in valuing share-based incentives were:
Expected life (years) 3.25 – 6.5
Vesting period (years) 1 – 3
Expected and historic volatility (%) 86
Risk free rate of return (%) 4
Expected dividend yield (%) 5
In the year ended 31 March 2011, volatility was derived directly from the Group’s share price over the period from listing. In previous
years, the expected volatility was based upon the historical volatility over the expected life of the schemes for a comparator group of
similar companies.

which comprise the Parent Company Balance Sheet and the
related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been
applied in their preparation is applicable law and United
Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice).
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities
Statement set out on page 34 the Directors are responsible for
the preparation of the Parent Company Financial Statements
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the
Parent Company Financial Statements in accordance with
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and
only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other

responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the Financial Statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts
and disclosures in the Financial Statements sufficient to give
reasonable assurance that the Financial Statements are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies
are appropriate to the Parent Company’s circumstances and
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by
the Directors; and the overall presentation of the Financial
Statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-
financial information in the Annual Report to identify any
material inconsistencies with the audited Financial Statements.
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on Financial Statements 
In our opinion the Parent Company Financial Statements: 
– give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs
as at 31 March 2011;
– have been properly prepared in accordance with United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and 
– have been prepared in accordance with the requirements
of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion: 
– the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited
has been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 2006; and 
– the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial
year for which the Parent Company Financial Statements are
prepared is consistent with the Parent Company Financial
Statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if,
in our opinion: 
– adequate accounting records have not been kept by the
Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not
been received from branches not visited by us; or 
– the Parent Company Financial Statements and the part of
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
– certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by
law are not made; or 
– we have not received all the information and explanations
we require for our audit. 
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Consolidated Financial
Statements of Hogg Robinson Group plc for the year ended
31 March 2011.

Overview Business review Governance Financial statements NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2011
Basis of accounting
The Parent Company Financial Statements have been prepared
under the historical cost convention, in accordance with the
Companies Act 2006, and conform with applicable United
Kingdom accounting standards. The Directors consider that the
accounting policies set out below are suitable, have been
consistently applied and are supported by reasonable and
prudent judgements and estimates.
Investments
Investments in subsidiary companies are stated at cost less any
provision for impairment in value.
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are recorded initially at fair value net of
issue costs incurred. Subsequent measurement depends on the
designation of the instruments as follows:
Borrowings are held at amortised cost and are classified as
current liabilities unless the Company has an unconditional right
to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after
the balance sheet date. Borrowing costs are recognised as an
expense in the period in which they are incurred.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value with
subsequent provision for impairment.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified
according to the substance of the contractual arrangements
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences
a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting
all of its liabilities. A financial liability is a contractual obligation to
deliver cash or another financial asset to a third party.
Taxation and deferred taxation
Any charge for taxation is based on the profit or loss for the
period and takes into account deferred taxation. Full provision is
made where required by FRS 19, Deferred Taxation for deferred
taxation on all timing differences, which have arisen but have not
reversed at the balance sheet date. Deferred taxation assets and
liabilities are not discounted.
Dividend distributions
Interim dividends are recognised in the Parent Company
Financial Statements in the period in which they are paid.
Final dividends to the Company’s shareholders are recognised in
the Parent Company Financial Statements in the period in which
the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.
The amounts of dividends taken as shares instead of cash under
the scrip dividend scheme have been added back to reserves.
The nominal value of shares issued under the scheme has been
funded out of the share premium account.
Share capital and share premium
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly
attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in
equity as a deduction from the proceeds.
The premium received on the issue of shares in excess of the
nominal value of shares is credited to the share premium
account and included within shareholders’ equity.
Share-based incentives
The Company operates several equity-settled share-based
incentive schemes for Group employees. The fair value of the
awards is calculated at grant date and is recognised as an
expense over the vesting period. For awards with vesting
conditions based on market conditions (particularly, those based
on total shareholder return compared with external benchmarks),
the likelihood of vesting is assessed at the date of grant and is not
subsequently amended in arriving at the expense for each year in
the vesting period. All other awards are re-assessed at each
balance sheet date, with the expense charged to the Profit and
Loss Account including the impact of changes of previous
estimates of the likelihood of vesting. The total expense for the
year gives rise to a corresponding credit to equity.
Employee Benefits Trust
Transactions, assets and liabilities of the Group-sponsored
Employee Benefits Trust are included in the Financial Statements.
In particular, the Trust’s purchases of shares in the Company
remain deducted from shareholders’ funds until they vest
unconditionally with employees.
Management judgement
In the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies,
management has made a number of judgements, none of which
are considered to have a significant effect on the amounts
recognised in the Parent Company Financial Statements.
In accordance with the exemption under FRS 1, the Company’s
Cash Flow Statement has not been separately presented in these
Parent Company Financial Statements. The Company is also exempt
under the terms of FRS 8 from disclosing related party transactions
with entities that are part of Hogg Robinson Group plc or wholly
owned investees of Hogg Robinson Group plc. The Directors of
Hogg Robinson plc occasionally use the services of Group
companies for their personal travel needs. These transactions are
not material to either party and hence do not warrant further
disclosure in these Parent Company Financial Statements.

THE CHALLENGE – AN EVOLVING TRAVEL MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY
increasing market complexity gives HRg an opportunity to both
add value and save costs for our clients
Content fragmentation – growing complexity of different fare
types, access to different travel modes like rail and taxi, and client
deals with airlines and hotels all need to be placed in front of the
travel counsellor.
Integration – More integration into client networks and access to
different travel tools require ongoing support and management.
Global servicing – c onsistent service, access to content and
accurate data regardless of the geographical location.
Data collection and delivery – c orporate responsibility and focus
on the travel budget requires more complex data collection and
reporting solutions.
IN RESPONSE –HRG HAS DEVELOPED A FLEXIBLE, MODULAR TRAVEL
TECHNOLOGY WORKSPACE
Flexibility – We have developed a business platform that positions
us for any changes in distribution processes and to the existing
service model.
Evolution – We are rolling out a point of sale application to give
our travel counsellors access to different distribution sources
and have developed a self-service booking tool, HRg o nline™,
integrated into our client networks though our HRg i-suite™ portal.
Virtualisation – o ur core infrastructure enables a world where
location becomes less important than the ability to access the
most appropriate person with the appropriate content.
Information – o ur in-house data collection warehouse and
reporting suite, HRg Reporting™, gives a full online view of
traveller for security and budgetary purposes.

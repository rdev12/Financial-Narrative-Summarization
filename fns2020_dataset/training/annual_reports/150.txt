Welcome!
My name is Molly, I’m the resident Abcam mascot and 
appear on all our packaging and branded materials.
A lot of researchers ask where we got the idea for Molly  
the sheep. It was simply because Dolly the sheep was  
making headline news at the time, so we created the  
body out of a molecular space fill model and gave her  
antibody legs, and thus the molecular Dolly became  
Abcam’s Molly. 2005

Our Business
at a Glance
Our vision is to build the largest 
online antibody resource in the 
world while also ensuring that 
the antibodies are of high quality 
and commercially viable.
The idea for Abcam came early 
in  998 out of a laboratory in 
the University of Cambridge, 
UK. The principal founder, 
Jonathan Milner, was working 
as a post-doctoral researcher 
studying the newly discovered 
breast cancer protein BRCA2 in 
Professor Tony Kouzarides’ 
laboratory. The project slowed 
because of problems finding 
quality antibody reagents that 
had honest and up-to-date 
information about their uses 
and limitations. It was frustrating.
How we 
work
1 We source and develop
We make our own antibodies 
and source other excellent 
antibodies from institutes, 
academic laboratories and 
primary manufacturers.
Abcam now has an online 
catalogue of more than 44,000 
antibodies and related products 
(such as proteins, peptides and 
kits). An increasing number of 
products are produced in-
house at our new high 
throughput production facility in 
Cambridge, UK and the 
percentage of total sales 
represented by such products 
is expected to grow as the 
facility comes fully on stream. 
Other products are supplied by  
more than 250 leading OEM 
partners and sold under the 
Abcam Brand.
2 We add value
Our scientists have built a 
catalogue of the best antibodies 
in the world and provide technical 
support on all of our products to 
enable our customers to achieve 
the result they expect.
The unique relationship Abcam 
has with the scientists who use 
our products means that we can 
obtain a wide range of testing 
data from their feedback and 
enquiries. We publish this 
information in the form of 
Abreviews
SM
 , which report the 
purchasing decisions of 
researchers looking for 
reagents. Taken across the 
catalogue average sales per 
product continue to increase the 
longer they have been on our 
catalogue, a trend we attribute 
in part to the sheer quantity of 
information that we are able to 
gather and publish over time.
Following an in-depth study of 
the market, Abcam has chosen 
8 Core Focus Areas (CFAs), 
each of which represents a 
research area with high market 
demand. We have vertically 
integrated our business 
development, manufacturing, 
marketing sales and technical 
support teams around these 
areas and expect to add a 
further two CFAs by June 2009.
3 We deliver
Our systems enable us to 
process orders quickly and 
accurately and we ship across 
the globe using our fully 
automated web-enabled stock-
management system. Our size 
means that we can invest in 
state-of-the art storage and 
handling facilities, which have 
enabled us to speed up shipping 
times and increase our output. 
We are able to operate at high-
levels of efficiency and with low 
handling costs.
Abcam plc is a producer and distributor of 
research-grade antibodies and associated 
products.
Where we operate
Abcam is headquartered in Cambridge, UK and continues to 
benefit from close links to the University of Cambridge, from which 
a large number of our PhD recruits are drawn.
Our US office has made a substantial, increasing contribution  
to sales since it was opened four years ago, serving our largest 
single market.
We opened an office in Tokyo, Japan in December 2006 and this 
has enabled us to radically improve the quality of the service we 
provide to customers in the form of technical support and speed  
of delivery.
We are also continuing to build our distributor network in order to 
improve our geographic reach in parts of the world where an  
e-commerce model has yet to be fully embraced.  Abcam plc

Customers can directly access 
the website to find the status of 
their orders so they can plan 
their experiments more 
effectively.
4 We support
Our products come with an 
Abpromise
SM
, giving customers 
the reassurance of knowing 
that:
 Our antibodies are of the 
highest quality and are 
backed up by an expert 
technical team, who are  
able to assist in initial  
product selection;
•
 Customers can, at  
any time, contact other  
customers using  
the same antibody  
via our unique  
Abreviews
SM
 system;
 If, after optimisation, any 
product does not perform as 
described on the datasheet, 
customers can contact our 
expert team to ask for advice 
assistance; and
 In the unlikely event that a 
product is faulty, we will 
replace or provide a full 
refund if reported within  
 20 days of purchase.
•
•
•
Our 
products
Abcam has over 44,000 
products in its catalogue and 
the number is still growing.
Our team not only adds new 
products to our catalogue every 
day but also regularly modifies 
the datasheets for our existing 
products. These modifications 
are based on our own testing 
and research in addition to the 
feedback of our suppliers and 
customers.
 For our customers, this means:
more antibody targets
more product types
more choice
•
•
•
Products sold by Abcam but 
not manufactured on our 
premises are supplied by more 
than 250 leading OEM partners 
around the world.
As it comes fully on stream,  
our new production facility will 
enable us to devote substantially 
more resources to in-house 
product development. In 
particular, this year has seen  
an increase in the levels of 
quality of characterisation 
which we can now provide  
with all our products. This  
is a key driver of growth.
Our people
Strength through brilliant people
We take enormous pride in the calibre of our employees. Since its 
launch in  998, Abcam has had tremendous success in attracting 
highly skilled people to its business and now boasts an impressive 
intellectual capital base.
Abcam now employs  84 full-time staff, a large proportion of who 
have PhDs. In the UK we are able to draw on our close links with the 
University of Cambridge from where many of our PhD recruits come.
Abcam remains fully committed to enhancing the abilities of its team 
members through its programme of staff training and development.
The strength our staff bring is demonstrable in the enthusiasm and 
creativity which drives the Group. Abcam plc

Our Internet
Platform
For many customers, the 
Internet is the most convenient 
and comprehensive method of 
finding the product they need. 
As such, search engine 
optimisation is important to 
ensure that Abcam products 
feature prominently in the 
organic (non-sponsored) 
results. Regular monitoring and 
expert design lead to 
progressively better search 
engine rankings; currently 97% 
of our catalogue is represented 
in Google. The goal for Abcam 
is for every one of its products 
to be represented in the top 
ranking positions on the major 
search engines.
The user experience, starting 
from the moment the customer 
clicks on a link to the Abcam 
website, is very important to us. 
A page request rapidly crosses 
the Internet to our data centre 
and is inspected by our security 
perimeter before being passed 
to our specialised website load 
balancer. In just a few 
milliseconds the load balancer 
has selected one of our many 
webservers, which dynamically 
creates the page and sends the 
response back to the customer 
via an optimised path through 
the Internet as determined by 
our content delivery network 
(CDN). Abcam is proud to say 
that the technical strength 
required to deliver the Abcam 
website has been built from  
the ground up by the expert  
IT team employed at Abcam. 
This in-house expertise gives 
us the ability to constantly fine-
tune our infrastructure and 
leverage specific technologies 
to our benefit.
The time it takes for a webpage 
to appear in the browser is 
constantly monitored by software 
that records the response time 
for every single page request by 
customers anywhere in the 
world. We record everything 
from the customer’s location to 
their browser type, how long the 
page took to appear on their 
screen and what speed 
broadband they are using. 
Through a combination of using 
clustered, high-powered 
webservers and the world’s 
leading CDN we deliver our 
website to customers in the USA 
in  .3 seconds, in Japan in  .4 
seconds and in Europe in  .5 
seconds. A sub-2-second 
response time worldwide is 
our benchmark.
As well as the speed of 
delivery, our IT systems also 
help to ensure that the content 
received by the user is fresh 
and constantly updated with 
images, reviews and customer 
feedback as well as pricing and 
stock availability. In order to 
show the most relevant and 
useful data, we test our website 
usability both in face-to-face 
sessions with scientists and 
using automated testing 
techniques. This enables us to 
achieve the optimal structure 
and content for the pages.
In addition to providing an 
optimal web experience to  
our users, we have invested 
heavily in our internal systems. 
Being a web-based company, 
geographical barriers are 
technically easy to deal with.  
A single database serves the 
company intranet across our 
three offices where staff can 
access all the same internal 
applications and the database 
links directly to our customer 
relationship management 
(CRM), order fulfilment and 
stock inventory systems. As with 
our web infrastructure, the 
software for these systems is 
developed in-house, meaning 
that we can react quickly to new 
requirements and tailor systems 
specifically to the job at hand. 
Our software development team 
work around the clock to 
increase the effectiveness of  
our IT systems and for each 
improvement the benefits are 
immediately realised across  
all offices. 
Finding ways of improving 
efficiency is a passion at 
Abcam; continually refining 
operational processes with 
tightly integrated in-house IT 
systems is one of the ways 
Abcam has scaled so 
effectively. In the USA, for 
instance, we have been able to 
scale to fulfilling an increase in 
orders of 38% (year on year) 
but at the same time shorten 
customer shipping times from 
several days to next-day and in 
many cases same-day delivery.
While our website is regularly 
serving millions of pageviews 
per month and operational 
systems are taking care of 
customer orders, product 
specialists add valuable data to 
our online datasheets. These 
feed automated systems that 
tailor personalised marketing 
emails to our extensive 
customer base – reminding 
them that Abcam has the 
largest online catalogue of the 
best antibodies in the world.
IT systems and the Internet underpin our 
business at Abcam. Our culture is based  
on strong technical foundations and the  
data-rich characteristics of our products  
mean that they are ideally suited to selling  
in the online marketplace.  Abcam plc

Chairman’s
Review
Abcam has recently celebrated its tenth 
anniversary and I am delighted to report on 
another outstanding year as the Group 
continues to go from strength to strength. 
Demand for research antibodies 
has never been higher, nor has 
our reputation. Our highly 
developed e-commerce 
platform, offering targeted 
information and easy access  
to products, has become the 
destination of choice for 
increasing numbers of 
researchers across the world. 
Our intention is to consistently 
deliver robust growth whilst at 
the same time investing in the 
future of the business, thus 
ensuring that we have a solid 
and sustainable foundation for 
long-term development. This 
has been achieved this year 
and the business is well set for 
continued success.
We have achieved strong 
growth in all the regions in 
which we operate: sales in the 
year increased by 49.7% to 
£36.7m (49. % on a constant 
currency basis), whilst gross 
margins increased from 59. % 
to 60.8%. This outstanding 
performance is a testimony  
to the quality of the products 
and support we offer, the 
scalability of our operation and 
Abcam’s growing reputation as 
a quality supplier to the world 
scientific community. 
A key driver of our success is 
our wealth of product data. This 
set of data is a tremendous 
asset and includes technical 
information, application specific 
information, user-generated 
reviews and how our products 
have been used in published 
experiments. Using this 
relevant, easily accessible 
information, research scientists 
can identify and purchase the 
products best suited for their 
requirements. During the year, 
our catalogue increased by 
more than  0,000 products, 
from 33,900 at the end of the 
last financial year to over 
44,000 at the end of June 2008. 
Sales of individual products 
tend to increase the longer they 
are listed and as more data is 
gathered. New products 
contributed £3.2m to sales in 
the year and we expect sales 
from these new launches to 
increase in future years. 
Our investments in the year 
included the continued 
development of the high-
throughput production (HTP) 
facility. The HTP facility has 
taken on the production of new 
and existing polyclonal 
antibodies and been very 
successful in adding 
characterisation data, which is 
an important driver of growth, 
to our existing catalogue. A 
priority for this year has been 
increasing production 
efficiencies and managing 
costs. We have also continued 
development work on our 
automated monoclonal 
development programme. The 
initial level of sales of the 
monoclonal antibodies added 
to the catalogue during the year 
has been well ahead of 
David Cleevely

expectations and we will 
continue to prudently manage 
monoclonal production levels in 
line with the development of our 
production process. 
Our offices in the USA and 
Japan have both grown 
significantly in the year and our 
commitment to optimising the 
user experience has driven 
further investment in our 
website infrastructure, and the 
establishment of a dedicated  
e-commerce team. We are also 
continuing to build our 
distributor network in order to 
improve our geographic reach 
in parts of the world where an 
e-commerce model has yet to 
be fully embraced. 
We have continued to attract 
staff of the highest calibre to 
ensure that our growth is 
targeted and well managed. A 
high proportion of our staff have 
PhDs and we aim to blend a 
depth of technical knowledge 
with strong commercial 
acumen. In November 2007 we 
appointed Jeff Iliffe as Chief 
Financial Officer and, with the 
extremely valuable 
contributions from the non-
executive directors, we have a 
strong and effective Board.
Our aim is to continue 
delivering value to both our 
customers and our 
shareholders and I would like to 
thank them for their continued 
support. I would also like to 
extend thanks to our growing 
number of suppliers and finally 
to our dedicated and talented 
staff, who make these 
achievements possible. 
Dividends
The Board’s policy is to 
distribute 33% of profit after tax 
as dividends. This was 
increased from 25% last year, in 
line with the strong cashflow 
and growing success of the 
Group. An interim dividend of 
 .04p per share was paid in 
April 2008 and the Directors 
are therefore recommending a 
final dividend of 4.56p per 
share, making a total for the 
year of 5.60p. Subject to 
shareholder approval at the 
Annual General Meeting in 
November, this dividend will be 
paid on 28 November 2008 to 
shareholders on the register on 
7 November 2008.
Outlook
Our track record demonstrates 
the strength of the combination 
of our highly developed  
e-commerce platform, wealth  
of product data, extensive 
range of antibodies and high-
calibre staff. We have built an 
attractive position in an exciting 
market and the Board looks to 
the future with confidence.

Chief
Executive 
Officer’s Review
We have built a truly international reputation in 
the research community for the reliability of our 
products and the support we offer. 
The development of our 
systems and the power of the 
internet enable us to focus our 
marketing effectively and to 
provide a targeted, high-value 
service at the individual 
researcher level. At the same 
time, our product range has 
expanded to more than 44,000 
products and sales have 
increased by 49.7% to £36.7m. 
We continue to strike a balance 
between current year growth 
and investment for the future. 
Even so, profit before taxation 
increased by 48.2% from £5.5m 
to £8.2m before charging 
£250k in costs associated  
with the potential offer process 
last summer. 
What is also very exciting is the 
29.8% growth achieved in the 
number of products in the 
catalogue and the breadth 
covered by the new products. 
One of the strengths of the 
team that sources externally 
manufactured antibodies from 
original equipment 
manufacturers (OEMs) is the 
diversity of deals that they can 
cover in building the catalogue. 
This year, deals range from one 
adding almost 3,000 antibodies 
immediately to those on 
individual products from niche 
researchers. It is encouraging 
also that we have built a 
sufficient market share such 
that the desirability of pursuing 
exclusive product line 
acquisition (PLA) deals has 
reduced. We do not rule out 
doing more PLA deals in the 
future, if the deals are lucrative; 
however as a source of growth 
and capturing market share 
their role and importance has 
diminished. Overall, we are now 
managing relationships with 
more than 250 suppliers and 
see growth both from new 
products that our established 
suppliers bring to us and from 
the continued addition of new 
suppliers. We are also 
expanding the breadth of 
antibody-related reagents that 
we can cover, giving us access 
to new markets; for example, 
this year we have almost 
doubled our proteins range.
Our HTP facility is now well 
established in its new building. 
The production levels of 
polyclonal antibodies now 
exceed the levels achieved in 
our old facility, with the capacity 
to increase this in line with 
market demand. We are also 
seeing the monoclonal 
antibodies coming out of the 
developmental stages of the 
facility, and showing good initial 
sales. 
A further, particularly satisfying 
achievement is the introduction 
of high-throughput screening 
assays into the HTP facility, 
leading to increased levels and 
quality of characterisation 
which we can now provide with 
all our products. This is a key 
driver of our growth and we are 
delighted with the amount of 
characterisation data that is 
being generated.  
Both our OEM product sourcing 
strategies and HTP product 
development are driven by our 
approach to the segmentation 
of the research market into 
Core Focus Areas (CFAs). This 
year we have continued to build 
our CFA strategy through the 
development and integration of 
product, marketing, events and 
support teams within each CFA. 
We have found that the CFA 
approach is very effective in 
capturing market share and 
continue to add further CFAs in 
order to maintain this momentum. 
We started the year with six 
CFAs and we added two further 
to take our total number to eight 
fully established CFAs. 
A key area of development 
based around the CFAs is in the 
activities of the scientific events 
team, which organises and runs 
conferences and seminars. To 
help across all our CFAs we 
have also been developing an 
expert system – the Target 
Selection Database (TSDB) – to 
help in the quality of candidate 
targets that we can select. The 
TSDB is a powerful data-mining 
tool that integrates both internal 
and external scientific data 
sources to provide a 
comprehensive profile of the 
commercial potential of a target 
in half the time taken previously.
We have a highly efficient 
business, with end-to-end 
systems linking the public 
website directly through to 
product ordering, inventory 
management, logistics and 
accounting. The resulting real-
time data gives us strong 
operational and financial 
control and enables us to adopt 
an agile and responsive 
approach to the management of 
the business.
Since the creation of the 
company ten years ago our 
strong focus has been on 
serving the researcher and our 
business philosophy and 
processes are all based around 
their needs and the 
achievement of their objectives. 
During that time our products 
have been used in ground-
breaking research and 
referenced in thousands of 
publications, thus enhancing 
our international reputation. 
This commitment is also core to 
our future as through the 
development of our systems we 
build on our relationships, 
offering an ever more relevant 
service to each individual as 
our product range and 
geographic reach expand.

The development of our 
systems and the power of the 
internet enable us to focus our 
marketing effectively and to 
provide a targeted, high-value 
service at the individual 
researcher level. At the same 
time, our product range has 
expanded to more than 44,000 
products and sales have 
increased by 49.7% to £36.7m. 
We continue to strike a balance 
between current year growth 
and investment for the future. 
Even so, profit before taxation 
increased by 48.2% from £5.5m 
to £8.2m before charging 
£250k in costs associated  
with the potential offer process 
last summer. 
What is also very exciting is the 
29.8% growth achieved in the 
number of products in the 
catalogue and the breadth 
covered by the new products. 
One of the strengths of the 
team that sources externally 
manufactured antibodies from 
original equipment 
manufacturers (OEMs) is the 
diversity of deals that they can 
cover in building the catalogue. 
This year, deals range from one 
adding almost 3,000 antibodies 
immediately to those on 
individual products from niche 
researchers. It is encouraging 
also that we have built a 
sufficient market share such 
that the desirability of pursuing 
exclusive product line 
acquisition (PLA) deals has 
reduced. We do not rule out 
doing more PLA deals in the 
future, if the deals are lucrative; 
however as a source of growth 
and capturing market share 
their role and importance has 
diminished. Overall, we are now 
managing relationships with 
more than 250 suppliers and 
see growth both from new 
products that our established 
suppliers bring to us and from 
the continued addition of new 
suppliers. We are also 
expanding the breadth of 
antibody-related reagents that 
we can cover, giving us access 
to new markets; for example, 
this year we have almost 
doubled our proteins range.
Our HTP facility is now well 
established in its new building. 
The production levels of 
polyclonal antibodies now 
exceed the levels achieved in 
our old facility, with the capacity 
to increase this in line with 
market demand. We are also 
seeing the monoclonal 
antibodies coming out of the 
developmental stages of the 
facility, and showing good initial 
sales. 
A further, particularly satisfying 
achievement is the introduction 
of high-throughput screening 
assays into the HTP facility, 
leading to increased levels and 
quality of characterisation 
which we can now provide with 
all our products. This is a key 
driver of our growth and we are 
delighted with the amount of 
characterisation data that is 
being generated.

Review
Our strong performance this year is  
again a tribute to the enthusiasm and 
commitment of our staff. 
Our new HTP manufacturing 
facility in Cambridge UK has 
been open for just over a year 
and the move from our existing 
facility has gone well. The 
production processes for 
polyclonal antibodies are now 
established and the 
development programme for our 
own monoclonal manufacturing 
is well underway. During the 
year we have been 
commissioning the major pieces 
of automation equipment from 
Beckman Coulter needed for 
scaled-up production of 
monoclonals. The last of these – 
the freeze-down workstation for 
long-term storage of the clones 
– is scheduled to be 
commissioned before the end of 
this calendar year.
This year has marked an 
important transition for our 
Tokyo office, which since  
January 2008 has moved from 
transacting the majority of our 
business through our original 
distributor, to dealing directly 
with our major sub-dealers in 
the Japanese market. This 
enables us both to provide 
better support to our customers 
by shortening the communication 
chain to them and to improve 
the margin we can realise from 
selling our products. This 
transition was always part of the 
strategy for developing the 
Tokyo office but I am delighted 
to report that we have achieved 
this whilst still delivering 67.4% 
growth in sales from ¥ 59.8m 
(£0.7m) to ¥267.5m (£ .3m), 
comparing the second half of 
this financial year with the same 
period last year.
This year has also seen us 
continuing our strategy of 
developing our European  
sales through our ‘virtual 
offices’ based out of our 
Cambridge UK office,  
enabling European customers 
to contact us directly in their 
own language. The results  
have been very pleasing, 
particularly in Germany and 
France. A combination of 
targeted marketing campaigns 
and amendments to our 
discount structure in Europe 
has meant we have increased 
sales by 65.5% from €8.9m 
to € 4.7m. 
As well as contributing to our 
overall sales, the strength in 
growth of our European sales 
has contributed to the margin 
improvements we have seen 
this year.
Our North American sales 
based out of our office in 
Cambridge MA have also 
continued to grow from $24.7m 
to $33.8m, an increase of 
36.9%. We have been fortunate 
to be able to take on an 
additional 4,500 square feet of 
adjoining space that has 
become vacant at our One 
Kendall Square address. This 
will enable us to implement 
smoothly the planned 
expansion of our operations in 
North America without the 
inconvenience of relocating and 
should provide sufficient space 
to accommodate up to three 
years of projected growth.
An area which is fast maturing 
into an important cornerstone of 
our business is our scientific 
events team. We organise and 
run conferences and seminars 
in our CFAs, both as part of our 
core marketing strategy and to 
build brand awareness and 
keep us in touch with our 
customers and the scientific 
community. We have gradually 
built up our capability and 
reputation in the biological 
events arena, from running two 
major events in 2006–07 
(around Chromatin and Stem 
Cells) to four in 2007–08. In 
addition, we have run twenty 
smaller, one-day events and 
seminars this year and will 
expand these further in  
2008–09.
Our strong performance this 
year is again a tribute to the 
enthusiasm and commitment of 
our staff. We aim to provide a 
rewarding and progressive 
environment for our employees 
and we are always seeking 
ways to improve our overall 
benefits package for all our 
staff. For example, this year in 
the UK, despite still being a 
relatively small company, we 
are offering a class-leading 
self-service flexible benefits 
system where staff can choose 
from a variety of benefits, 
ranging from health care and 
pensions to cycle-to-work 
schemes, and take best 
advantage of the tax 
concessions available via 
salary sacrifice. We believe that 
continuing to develop the 
creative and innovative 
individuals who have grown up 
through a young 
entrepreneurial culture will 
enable us to grow successfully 
over the coming years. This is 
achieved by being open to both 
interdepartmental transfers and 
the career aspirations of staff, 
together with active training 
and development programmes 
utilising local initiatives and 
other opportunities open to staff.

Review
During the year our Business Development  
and Marketing teams introduced a number  
of strategies to improve sales and manage  
cost increases.
Sales
Sales increased in the year by 
49.7% to £36.7m or 49. % on a 
constant currency basis i.e. if 
foreign currency exchange 
rates had remained unchanged 
from 2007. (Average exchange 
rate applied to sales: 2008  
£ : $ .997: € .374: ¥220.05 ; 
2007 £ : $ .925: € .48 : ¥229.699.)
Gross margin
Gross margins reported for the 
period under review are 60.8% 
compared with 59. % for the 
previous year. The increase of 
 .7% is attributable to improved 
pricing which more than 
compensated for price 
increases from suppliers 
(0.7%); higher sales of products 
acquired under the exclusive 
product line acquisitions 
(0.4%); and from the benefit of 
the stronger Euro during the 
period, since a relatively small 
proportion of our product costs 
are denominated in Euros (0.6%).
During the year our Business 
Development and Marketing 
teams combined to actively 
manage the margin achieved 
on sales and introduced a 
number of strategies aimed at 
working with suppliers to 
improve sales and manage cost 
increases.
Administrative 
expenses
Administrative expenses rose 
from £7.7m to £ 2.5m. This 
increase reflects the 37.2% 
growth in the average 
headcount to  66; the first full 
year of operation of the HTP 
facility; and the Japanese 
office. During the year a net 
impairment charge of £442k 
was taken to the income 
statement relating to the 
reduction in the carrying value 
of one of the exclusive product 
line acquisition deals, following 
an assessment of future 
prospects under the deal. 
The bad debt provision 
increased from £224k to £59 k 
during the year, largely as a 
result of an overseas distributor 
having financial difficulties after 
becoming involved in a local 
court action, meaning that 
recovery of the balance due is 
now considered doubtful.
Research and 
development 
expenditure
Research and Development 
expenditure increased by 
39.8%, reflecting an increase in 
investment in the development 
of the monoclonal production 
process and new polyclonal 
production development. The 
level of expenditure is expected 
to continue to increase in future 
as the level of new product 
polyclonal production grows 
and the monoclonal 
development programme 
scales-up. 
Profit
Operating profits increased by 
5 .3% from £5.0m in the year 
ended June 2007 to £7.6m after 
adding back costs of £250k 
relating to a potential offer for 
the Group as announced to the 
market in July 2007. This 
represents an increase in 
operating profit as a 
percentage of sales from 20.5% 
to 20.8% despite the impact of 
the additional costs outlined 
above.
Interest income rose as the 
Company benefited from strong 
cash generation during the year.
Tax
The consolidated tax charge for 
the year was £2. m or 25.9% of 
profit before tax reflecting the 
tax credits arising from the 
increased amount of research 
and development undertaken. 
A credit of £ 4k was also 
received for research and 
development activities

undertaken in prior years. The 
effective tax charge for the year 
was 25.9%, 2007: 26.6%. 
The tax charge for 2007 was 
£ .5m having been restated 
from £ .6m following the 
adoption of International 
Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS). The consolidated tax 
charge will benefit in future from 
a full year’s impact of the 
reduction in corporation tax in 
the UK from 30% to 28% and 
an increased level of research 
and development.
Inventories
The Group manages stock 
levels closely by monitoring the 
expectations of future sales for 
every product in the catalogue, 
and the time taken to restock 
either from our own production 
or from OEM suppliers. As a 
result, stock levels have 
increased less than the growth 
in sales during the course of the 
year. Over time the Group 
expects the levels of stock to 
increase relative to sales since 
Abcam products developed in-
house, involve batch sizes 
larger than required for 
immediate sale.
Debtors
A main focus for the year has 
been on debtor control and 
debtor days at the year end 
were 34.4 (2007 44.3). The 
majority of sales continue to be 
on credit and we would expect 
some increase in debtor days 
over time in line with practice in 
local markets as the geographic 
spread of sales widens.
Creditors
Current liabilities rose from 
£3.4m to £4.8m primarily 
resulting from a 33.8% increase 
in trade and other payables, 
which is slightly less than the 
increase in sales. Non-current 
liabilities fell from £0.6m to 
£0.2m, being the net effect of a 
decrease in deferred tax 
balances due to the level of 
expenditure during the year on 
capital equipment relating to 
the HTP facility and a reduction 
in the estimated amount due as 
deferred settlement on a 
product line acquisition 
concluded in 2006.
Cashflow
The Group’s cashflow continues 
to be strong, with £7. m (2007: 
£3.4m) generated from trading 
in the year. Consequently, 
despite spending £2.5m on 
facilities and equipment and 
£0.3m on acquiring distribution 
rights, the Group’s cash and 
short term investment balances 
increased by £3.8m.
Accounting standards
These are the first full year’s 
results of the Group to be 
stated under IFRS and 
consequently there are a 
number of changes to both 
presentation and content of 
these financial statements. The 
effects of the adjustments are 
explained in note 30, the 
material changes being the 
inclusion of derivative 
instruments at fair value, giving 
rise to a charge to profit and 
loss of £ 97k (2007: charge of 
£ 68k) and the recognition of a 
deferred tax asset relating to 
unexercised share options, of 
£224k (2007: liability of £46k).
EPS
The number of shares issued 
during the year for the exercise 
of share options was relatively 
small at 443,397 (2007:  58,800), 
meaning that as post tax profit 
grew by 43.7% (2007:  5.5%) 
the growth in basic EPS was 
43.8% (2007: 5.7%) and diluted 
EPS was 44.9% (2007: 6.5%). 
Currency exposure
The Group continues to 
generate significant amounts 
of dollars and euros in excess 
of payments in these currencies, 
and has hedging arrangements 
in place to reduce the exposure. 
During the year to 30 June 2008 
the Group had forward 
exchange contracts in place to 
sell $ 2.4m and € .9m at 
average rates of £ to $  .9356 
and £ to € .4054 respectively. 
Of these, contracts for $4.2m 
and €4.5m were still 
outstanding at the year end.
For the year ending 30 June 
2009 the Group has forward 
exchange contracts in place to 
sell $9.0m and €8. m at 
average rates of £ to $  .924 
and € .294.

Directors’ Report
The Directors present their annual report on the affairs of the 
Group, together with the financial statements and auditors’ report, 
for the year ended 30 June 2008.
Principal activities and future developments
The Group’s activities consist of the development, marketing and 
selling of antibodies and closely related products. The Group sells 
through the internet to customers in most countries of the world. The 
Group operates through its parent company Abcam plc and 
through its wholly owned subsidiaries Abcam Inc. and Abcam KK.
The Company is also increasing its own manufacturing capability 
through continued investment in a high-throughput production 
(“HTP”) laboratory. 
Future developments are addressed in the individual director’s 
reviews at the front of this annual report.
Business review
The Group’s management uses key performance indicators (KPIs) 
to monitor the progress of the business. Important KPIs are:
 30 June  30 June 30 June
 2008 2007 2006
Number of products published 44,000 33,900 23,200
Sales per employee £000 221 203 223
Profit before tax to sales 22.3%
1
 22.6% 24.9%
Number of debtor days at  
 year end 34 44 45
Sales increased by 49.7% in the year (49.1% on a constant 
exchange rate basis) as a result of the launch of new products and 
continued increases in sales from the existing catalogue. The 
Group continued to generate strong margins, and pre-tax profits 
increased by 48.2%
1
, reflecting the cost of investments made in the 
year and higher levels of research and development expenditure.
1  after adding back £0.25m costs relating to the potential offer process 
undertaken in the summer of 2007
The Group’s cash and short term deposits remained at a strong 
level at £14.5m (2007: £10.7m).
The Directors are confident that the Group has a solid basis for growth. 
An overview of the business is set out in the chief executive officer’s 
and managing director’s reviews together with the financial review.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The Group faces the competitive and strategic risks that are 
inherent in a rapidly growing market, and the Board and executive 
management keep future strategy under regular review.
The Group has an exposure to exchange rates, in particular the 
strength of sterling relative to the US dollar and the Euro. Although 
there are significant natural hedges in place due to the fact that the 
Group is able to utilise a large proportion of its dollar and euro 
income to pay for outgoings in those currencies, the Group 
generates surpluses of both currencies. The Board’s policy for 
dealing with these is to sell forward some of the expected surplus 
currencies in order to reduce the short term exposure. However if 
there are longer term movements in the relative strength of sterling 
then these will impact the Group’s profits. For further details of the 
Group’s risk management strategy see note 26.
The Group’s activities involve importing and exporting its products 
across many international borders. Any changes to the regulations 
covering such movements might have an effect on the Group’s 
trading activities.
The Company has made qualifying third party indemnity provisions 
for the benefit of its Directors which were made during the reporting 
period and remain in force at the date of this report.
Research and development
The Group undertakes research and development in areas related 
to its principal activities and this is discussed in the individual 
Director’s reviews at the front of this annual report. During the year 
the Group spent £2.4m (2007: £1.7m) on research and 
development. 
Dividends
The Directors propose paying a final dividend of 4.56p (2007: 
3.19p) per ordinary share, to be paid on 28 November 2008 to 
shareholders on the register on 7 November 2008. Together with 
the interim dividend of 1.04p paid on 18 April 2008, this makes a 
combined dividend for the year of 5.60p (2007: 3.99p)
Capital structure
Details of the authorised and issued share capital, together with 
details of the movements in the Company’s issued share capital 
during the year are shown in notes 23 and 24. The Company has 
one class of ordinary shares which carries no right to fixed income. 
Each share carries the right to one vote at general meetings of the 
Company.
There are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding nor on the 
transfer of shares, which are both governed by the general 
provisions of the Articles of Association and prevailing legislation.
With regard to the appointment and replacement of directors, the 
Company is governed by the Articles of Association, the Combined 
Code, the Companies Act and related legislation.
Directors
The interests of the Directors in the share capital of the Company at 
30 June 2008, other than with respect to share options (which are 
detailed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report), were as follows:
  1p ordinary 1p ordinary 
  shares on shares on 
   30 June 2008 30 June 2007

Governance, David Cleevely and Tony Kouzarides, who have each 
been Directors of the Company since April 1998, will offer themselves 
for re-election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. At the 
meeting Jim Warwick will also stand for re-election, as will Jeff Iliffe 
who was appointed as a Director during the year. Abcam plc

Supplier payment policy
It is the Group’s policy that payments to suppliers are made in 
accordance with the terms and conditions agreed with them, 
provided that the supplier has provided the goods or services in 
accordance with the agreed terms and conditions.
On 30 June 2008, the Group had an average of 30 days of 
purchases (2007: 55) outstanding in trade creditors.
Charitable and political donations and 
community support
Abcam participates actively in the community of entrepreneurial 
businesses clustered around Cambridge. Abcam supports both  
the Cambridge Network and the University of Cambridge and the 
Judge Business School both by giving talks and presentations on 
our business as well as hosting projects for MBA students. Abcam 
takes students from secondary education on work-experience 
programmes as well as occasional international exchange students 
on placement. 
The Company encourages employees to get involved in local 
charitable activities; we allocate 0.1% of pre-tax profit for charitable 
donations, which are split between the US, UK and Japanese 
offices. These are allocated by a committee of staff volunteers 
working within guidelines set down by the Directors. 
The Group made no political donations (2007: nil) and made £4,272 
charitable donations (2007: £1,907).
Substantial shareholdings
Other than Directors’ interests which are set out above, at 28 August 
2008 shareholders with a greater than 3% interest in the issued 
share capital of the Company were:
Standard Life Investments Limited 11.87%
Artemis Investment Management 7.67%
BlackRock Investment Management 5.90%
Morley Fund Management 4.17% 
UBS Zurich 3.42% 
Fidelity Investments 3.22%
Corporate, social and ethical policies
Abcam recognises the importance of balancing the interests of all 
our key stakeholders – our customers, shareholders, employees, 
suppliers and the communities in which we operate. Management 
of the environmental and social issues that play a part in our 
business is a key factor in our strategy for success and in the 
practice of good corporate governance. 
The Group places considerable value on the involvement of its 
employees and has continued to keep them informed of the various 
factors affecting the performance of the Group. This is achieved 
through formal and informal meetings. Equity based incentives are 
made available to all employees of the Group. In addition, there is a 
profit sharing scheme based on the overall profitability of the 
Group.
Applications for employment by disabled persons are always fully 
considered, bearing in mind the aptitudes of the applicant 
concerned. It is the policy of the Group that the training, career 
development and promotion of disabled employees should, as far 
as possible, be identical to that of other employees. The Group 
needs highly-qualified staff and does not see age, colour, disability, 
ethnic origin, gender, political or other opinion as a barrier to 
employment.
The Group aspires to carry out its business to the highest of ethical 
standards treating employees, suppliers and customers in a 
professional, courteous and honest manner. The Group has an 
ethical policy which is reviewed by the Board and which we apply 
to our products. This includes reviewing and, where appropriate, 
visiting our suppliers to check the standards they follow in their 
products and services. 
Health & Safety and environment
Abcam seeks to provide and maintain safe and healthy working 
conditions, equipment and systems for all our employees as far as 
is reasonably practicable and to provide such information, training 
and supervision as may be needed for this purpose. 
The Group complies with legislation, however where best practice 
demands higher standards, it endeavours to apply these wherever 
reasonably practicable. 
Health & Safety (H&S) in the Group is ultimately the responsibility of 
the CEO and is run by a Health & Safety Co-ordinator as chair of the 
H&S committee; this committee uses appropriate advice from 
external H&S specialist consultants. 
Abcam seeks wherever possible to minimise its impact on the 
environment for the benefit of its staff and the public at large. The 
Group is committed to complying with environmental regulations 
and encourage and support staff in waste recycling within our 
offices.
Going concern
The Directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources 
to continue its operations for the foreseeable future, and for this 
reason they continue to prepare the financial statements on a 
going-concern basis.
Auditors
In the case of each of the Directors of the Company at the date on 
which this report was approved:
 As far as each of the Directors is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information (as defined in the Companies Act 1985) of which the 
Company’s auditors are unaware.
 Each of the Directors has taken all the steps that he ought to have 
taken as a Director to make himself aware of any relevant audit 
information (as defined) and to establish that the Company’s 
auditors are aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance 
with the provision of S234ZA of the Companies Act 1985.
Deloitte & Touche LLP have expressed their willingness to continue 
in office as auditors and a resolution to reappoint them will be 
proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

Directors’ Report
continued Abcam plc
Annual report and accounts 
30 June 2008
19
Corporate Governance
Although not required to do so by the AIM listing rules, the Directors 
have chosen to provide selected corporate governance disclosures 
with this report, which they consider valuable to the readers.
The Directors believe that effective corporate governance, 
appropriate to the Group considering its size and stage of 
development, will assist in the delivery of corporate strategy, the 
generation of shareholder value and the safeguarding of 
shareholders’ long-term interests. The Directors are committed 
therefore, wherever it is reasonably practicable, to ensure that the 
Group is managed in accordance with the principles set out in the 
revised Combined Code on Corporate Governance (“the Code”).
The role and composition of the Board
The Board comprises a Non-Executive Chairman, who is not 
deemed to be independent because of his shareholding, three  
full-time Executive Directors and four other Non-Executive 
Directors, two of whom are deemed not to be independent: Tony 
Kouzarides because of the size of his shareholding and Mark 
Webster because he has been employed in an executive capacity 
during the last five years. 
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are vested in separate 
individuals, each with clear allocation of accountability and 
responsibility. The Chairman has prime responsibility for running 
the Board and the Chief Executive Officer has executive 
responsibilities for the Company’s strategic development, 
operations and results. 
The structure of the Board and the integrity of each Director 
ensures that there is no one individual or group dominating the 
decision making process.
The Board holds full meetings every second month. The principal 
matters that it considers are as follows:
 Monthly management accounts, key performance indicators and 
performance against budget;
 Regular reviews of R&D, operations and product line acquisitions;
 An annual review of strategic objectives and Group priorities;
 The Group budget;
 Reporting including statutory accounts, dividend policy, dividend 
payments and the AGM;
 Performance of the Board and sub-Committees;
 Reports of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees;
 An annual review of risk-management strategy and controls and 
a six-monthly review of the risk register;
 Matters relating to the Company’s obligations as a listed 
Company; and
 Management of funds and major capital expenditure, including 
proposals for mergers or acquisitions of other companies or 
product lines.
In those months when the Board does not meet, members continue 
to be informed on a formal reporting basis of financial results and 
key issues. The Board is supplied with information in a timely 
manner, and in a form and of a quality appropriate to enable it to 
discharge its duties. Directors receive appropriate induction on 
joining the Board and regularly update their skills and knowledge.
The Board has a policy to set out which matters are reserved for the 
decision of the Board, and to clarify those matters which the 
Executive Directors need not refer for approval. 
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
This policy also identifies those matters regarding which full 
delegation to a Board Committee is not normally permitted because 
a final decision on the matter is required to be taken by the whole 
Board. The terms and conditions for the appointment of non-
executive Directors are available for inspection. Matters which the 
Board considers suitable for delegation are contained in the terms 
of reference of its Committees.
The Board has established the following three committees:
The Audit Committee;
The Nomination Committee; and
The Remuneration Committee.
The membership and role of each committee is described in more 
detail below.
The Audit Committee
The Committee is made up of three Non-Executive Directors one of 
whom, the Chairman, is considered to be independent. The 
Chairman is Peter Keen, who is a Chartered Accountant, with David 
Cleevely and Tony Kouzarides being the other Directors on the 
Committee.
The Committee has responsibility for the following matters:
 To review the accounts and the key judgements and policies 
underlying them in relation to the interim and annual financial 
statements before they are submitted to the Board for final 
approval;
 To review the management’s reports on internal controls;
 To review the Group’s risk-management process, including the 
adequacy of insurance cover;
 To review the appointment of the external auditors together with 
the audit fee; and
 To monitor the audit and non-audit work of the external auditors, 
including reviewing any management letters and the Company’s 
response.
As part of its procedures, the Committee discusses the interim and 
annual financial statements with the external auditors. When 
appropriate, non-Committee members are invited to attend. During 
the period the Committee has met twice on a formal basis and a 
number of times informally. The Committee is expected to continue 
to meet formally twice a year.
The Nomination Committee
During the year under review the Committee was made up of three 
Non-Executive Directors, one of whom was considered to be 
independent: David Cleevely was the Chairman, and Peter Keen 
and Tony Kouzarides were the other Directors on the Committee. 
From 1 September 2008 Tim Dye, an independent director, took 
over as Chairman with David Cleevely remaining as a member of 
the Committee.
 The Committee is responsible for the following matters:
 To identify and nominate suitable candidates to fill vacancies on 
the Board; and
 To review succession planning for both Directors and the 
management team.

The Remuneration Committee 
The Committee is made up of three Non-Executive Directors, two of 
whom are deemed to be independent including the Chairman: Peter 
Keen is the Chairman, and David Cleevely and Tim Dye are 
members.
The Committee is responsible for the following matters:
 Setting the basic pay of Executive Directors and the remuneration 
of the Chairman;
 Setting a performance-related bonus plan for the Executive 
Directors;
 Agreeing the allocation and term for the granting of share based 
incentives to Executive Directors;
 Determining the Executive Directors’ pension contributions; and
 Overseeing the overall annual pay review for the Group.
The Committee aims to set levels of remuneration for Executive 
Directors that are appropriate for the size and complexity of the 
Group. It aims to see that a significant proportion of their 
remuneration package is performance-related. 
The Committee is also responsible for overseeing the Company’s 
profit share and its equity based incentive schemes, which are 
reviewed each year.
Internal control 
The Board acknowledges its responsibility for safeguarding the 
shareholders’ investment and the Group’s assets. In applying this 
principle, the Board recognises that it has overall responsibility for 
ensuring that the Group maintains a system of internal control to 
provide it with reasonable assurance regarding effective and 
efficient operation, internal financial control and compliance with 
laws and regulations. 
Through the Audit Committee, the Directors have reviewed the 
effectiveness of the internal controls, and taken steps to ensure that 
the Group has an appropriate control environment for its size and 
complexity. The management team will ensure that the internal 
control environment develops with the size of the Company, with 
respect to the identification, evaluation and monitoring of risk. 
•
•
•
•
•
Such systems, which are designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, will provide 
reasonable, though not absolute, assurance against material loss or 
misstatement.
The Board is committed to transparency in financial reporting, 
internal control and external audit as demonstrated, amongst other 
things, by its reviewing of the Group’s arrangements for its 
employees to raise concerns, in confidence, about possible 
wrongdoing in these areas, which are formalised in a 
“whistleblowing” policy circulated to all employees, and through the 
adoption of its policies and procedures for financial reporting.
Board performance evaluation
The Board has recently undertaken an evaluation of its own 
performance. The review involved detailed interviews with each 
Director and the Company Secretary and covered the functioning of 
the Board as a whole, and the operation of each of the committees. 
The review confirmed the high level of commitment and 
professionalism exercised by the Board in the strategic and 
commercial leadership of the Group. It also concluded that the 
Board and its individual members continue to perform effectively 
and operate within a framework of sound governance and 
practices, which wherever it is reasonably practicable, are 
consistent with the principles set out in the Code.
All Directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first 
Annual General Meeting after their appointment, and to re-election 
thereafter at intervals of no more than three years.
Dialogue with shareholders
The Board believes it is important to have open communications 
with shareholders. To this end, the Chief Executive Officer and 
Chief Financial Officer, working in consultation with the Company’s 
corporate and PR advisors, make themselves available and expect 
to meet with shareholders at least twice a year. The Board intends 
to give a presentation on the Group’s progress at the forthcoming 
AGM in November.

Directors’ Remuneration  
Report
Unaudited information:
Remuneration report
Although not required by the AIM listing rules, the Directors have 
chosen to provide directors remuneration disclosures in this report 
which they consider valuable to the readers.
The Group has a Remuneration Committee (“the Committee”) 
which, wherever possible, is constituted in accordance with the 
recommendations of the Code.
During the course of the year independent consultants were 
retained to advise on remuneration policy and to benchmark the 
Executive Directors’ remuneration against that of a comparator 
group of companies with similar characteristics to Abcam in terms 
of their size, nature of operations, historic growth achieved and 
market capitalisation.
Its recommendations on salary were implemented during the year 
and those on revised bonus arrangements have been implemented 
for the 2008/09 financial year. A long term incentive plan for senior 
management, including the Executive Directors, is to be put to 
shareholders at the forthcoming AGM.
The review also covered the all employee share schemes and a 
share based incentive plan for all employees based in the UK will 
be adopted during the course of the current financial year, details  
of which are set out below. Amendments are also proposed to the 
share option scheme for US based employees to make it more tax 
efficient for them, which will also be put to shareholders at the AGM. 
Remuneration policy
The four main elements of the remuneration package for the 
Executive Directors during the year were as follows:
Basic annual salary;
A performance based bonus; 
Equity based incentives; and
Pension contributions
The Group’s policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration 
of the Executive Directors should be performance-related. 
For future years the Committee will ensure that:-
 It maintains a competitive package of total compensation, 
commensurate with comparable packages available in similar 
companies; and
 The interests of the Executive Directors are closely aligned with 
those of the Company’s shareholders through the provision of 
share based incentives.
Basic salary
An Executive Director’s basic salary is determined by the 
Committee and normally reviewed on 1 July each year. Following 
the independent review, adjustments were made to the then 
existing salary levels during the year and annual increases were 
made with effect from 1 July 2008, in line with the recommendations 
of the review. Executive Directors’ service contracts, which include 
details of remuneration, will be available for inspection at the AGM.

Performance-related payments
The bonus payable to Executive Directors is based on the financial 
performance of the Group and the achievement of individual 
performance targets related to the strategic objectives for each 
individual. In the 2007/08 financial year the financial performance 
based element was paid under the Abcam Profit Share Scheme 
(PSS). Under this scheme an amount is allocated to employees on a 
points based system. For the year under review the amount to be 
paid through PSS was dependent on the level of pre-tax profit 
achieved, the amount allocated varying depending on the level of 
profitability. 
The PSS payment was not capped, and payments on account from 
the PSS were made each quarter, although at no stage did they 
exceed 85% of the amount due until the audited accounts were 
approved. The scheme applied to all staff, including Executive 
Directors, and bonuses were pensionable up to the “on target” 
profit level. 
If financial and personal targets were met the bonus payable to 
Executive Directors was 50% of basic salary, paid in cash.
In the 2008/09 financial year these arrangements have been 
amended and the total “on target” bonus for Executive Directors will 
be 37.5% of basic salary, paid in cash in a single payment once the 
audited accounts are approved. 80% of the bonus is based on the 
achievement of a target profit figure and 20% on achievement of 
individual strategic objectives. No payment is due under the profit 
based bonus if performance is less than 90% of target and the 
maximum payment is due at 105% of target. The total bonus is 
capped at 75% of basic salary and none of the bonus is 
pensionable. 
The PSS scheme will operate for the 2008/09 financial year for all 
other employees of the Group on the same basis as the year under 
review, with increased profit targets. The amount payable under 
PSS is no longer pensionable.
Equity based incentives
Existing arrangements
The principal form of equity based incentive used by the Group 
since its flotation in November 2005 has been the Abcam plc 2005 
plan. All options granted under the plan since flotation have been 
based on out-performance of the FTSE AIM index measured on the 
third anniversary of the date of grant. If the target is achieved, then 
options will be exercisable during the next seven years, subject to 
the rules of the scheme. If the target is not met at the third 
anniversary, then it will be monitored on certain dates over the next 
12 months. If the target is met on any of those dates, then the 
options become exercisable. If the target is not met on any of those 
dates, the options will lapse on the fourth anniversary. 
In the year under review options were granted under the Abcam plc 
2005 plan to the Executive Directors. Abcam plc

The Company has also established a non-discretionary Inland 
Revenue-approved SAYE scheme in which the Executive Directors 
could participate. Under this scheme, employees could contract to 
save any amount, up to a maximum of £250 per month, of their post-
tax earnings for a period of either three or five years. At the time of 
entering the contract the Company offered the employee the option 
to acquire shares, using the money that has been saved over the 
life of the contract. The price at which the shares could be 
purchased will be the market value of the shares on the date 
immediately preceding the offer at a discount of 20%. The recent 
take-up under the scheme has not been high since many employees 
are already at the allowable investment limits and it is not proposed 
to make any further offers to employees under this scheme.
There were no options granted to Executive Directors under this 
scheme in the year under review.
New arrangements
It is the intention to grant additional equity based incentives on a 
regular basis to the Executive Directors. 
For the 2008/09 financial year it is proposed that a long term 
incentive plan (“LTIP”) be introduced for senior executives 
including the Executive Directors, with performance conditions 
which comply with guidelines and best practice governing the grant 
of share-based incentives in a listed company, to the extent to 
which the Committee considers such practice to be appropriate to 
the Group. 
As part of the process to define the LTIP a consultation exercise has 
been undertaken with major shareholders to seek their views.
Under the LTIP, awards will take the form of “nil paid” options and 
are subject to the achievement over three years of the following 
performance conditions:-
 50% of the award will depend on the Company’s total 
shareholder return (“TSR”) as compared to a comparator group 
of companies. Where the Company’s TSR is below the fiftieth 
percentile, the option or award will not vest. Where the 
Company’s TSR is at the seventy fifth percentile or higher of the 
Comparator Group, the option or award will vest in its entirety. 
Where the Company’s TSR is between the fiftieth and the 
seventy-fifth percentile, a proportion of the option or award will 
•
vest, starting with 30% at the fiftieth percentile and rising 
proportionally to 100% at the seventy-fifth percentile.
 50% of the award will depend on growth in earnings per share. At 
an average of less than 25% growth per annum, equating to 
95.3% growth over the period, the amount vesting under the 
award will be nil. At average growth per annum of 33%, equating 
to total growth of 135.3%, the award will vest in full. At growth 
rates between these two figures, the award will vest proportionately. 
More information on the LTIP can be found in the Notice convening 
the Annual General Meeting in November, at which shareholders 
will be asked to approve the adoption of the plan and award to 
Executive Directors.
Share incentive plan 
An HMRC approved share incentive plan (“SIP”) will be introduced 
in October this year for all UK employees. Under the plan awards 
will be made as follows:-
Share award
It is intended that annual awards will be made to UK based staff to 
a market value of up to £3,000 each. Awards will take the form of an 
option with a nil exercise price and will vest after three years 
employment with the Company.
Partnership shares
All UK based employees will be given the opportunity to invest up to 
£1,500 per annum to acquire new shares in the Company at market 
value. If these shares are held for three years and the employee 
remains with the Company during that time then they will also receive 
an additional share for each share acquired. The total market value of 
the investment from employees will be capped at £90,000.
The Abcam plc 2005 Plan
Options will also be granted under the existing Abcam plc 2005 
Plan to certain senior employees in the UK excluding the Executive 
Directors where the HMRC limits on the SIP are not considered to 
provide appropriate levels of incentive. 
It is also intended that the plan will also be amended to make it 
more tax efficient for US based employees. To comply with US 
legislation, these amendments will be put before shareholders at 
the Annual General Meeting in November. 
In the period since listing on AIM, no equity based incentives have 
been granted to Non-Executive Directors and there are no plans for 
any such grants in the future.
Pension arrangements
In the UK, all employees, including Executive Directors, are invited 
to participate in the Group Personal Pension Plan, which is money-
purchase in nature. The pensionable element of remuneration in the 
year under review was basic salary plus on-target earnings from the 
PSS. During the year, the Group contributed 6% of on-target 
earnings, excluding the individual performance bonus, to a Group 
personal pension scheme in the name of each Executive Director. 
From 2008/09 onwards payments due under the PSS to all 
employees are no longer pensionable and the contribution to be 
made to the Group personal pension scheme will be 12% of basic 
salary for each Executive Director.
A flexible benefits scheme was introduced on 1 July 2007 for all 
employees of the Company, including Executive Directors, under 
which the option to switch part of their basic pay into additional 
pension contributions or other benefits is available.

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. The Directors are required by the IAS 
Regulation to prepare the group financial statements under 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted  
by the European Union and have also elected to prepare the parent 
company financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union. The financial statements are also required 
by law to be properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial 
statements present fairly for each financial year the company’s 
financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This 
requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, 
other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and 
recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set 
out in the International Accounting Standards Board’s “Framework 
for the preparation and presentation of financial statements”. In 
virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by 
compliance with all applicable IFRSs. However, directors are also 
required to:
properly select and apply accounting policies;
 present information, including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; and 
 provide additional disclosures when compliance with the  
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable  
users to understand the impact of particular transactions,  
other events and conditions on the entity’s financial  
position and financial performance.
•
•
•
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the company and enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities Abcam plc
Annual report and accounts 
30 June 2008

We have audited the Group and Parent Company financial 
statements (the “financial statements”) of Abcam plc for the year 
ended 30 June 2008 which comprise the Group Income Statement, 
the Group statement of recognised income and expense, the Group 
and Parent Company Balance Sheets, the Group and Parent 
Company Cash Flow Statements, and the related notes 1 to 30. 
These financial statements have been prepared under the 
accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the 
information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described 
as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body,  
in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
company’s members those matters we are required to state to  
them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest 
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as 
a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors  
and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union 
are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in accordance 
with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements 
give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and 
the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
1985 and, as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of  
the IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether in our opinion  
the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the 
financial statements.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not 
kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the 
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if 
information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and 
other transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report as 
described in the contents section and consider whether it is 
consistent with the audited financial statements. The other 
information comprises only the Directors’ Report, the Chairman’s 
Review, the CEO’s review, the Managing Director’s review and the 
Financial Review. We consider the implications for our report if we 
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material 
inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities 
do not extend to any further information outside the Annual Report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International  
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of 
evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to  
be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant 
estimates and judgments made by the Directors in the preparation 
of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies 
are appropriate to the group’s and company’s circumstances, 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the 
information and explanations which we considered necessary in 
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are free from  
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other  
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the 
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial 
statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to  
be audited. 
Opinion
In our opinion:
 the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union,  
of the state of the group’s affairs as at 30 June 2008 and of its 
profit for the year then ended;
 the Parent Company financial statements give a true and fair 
view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 1985, of the state of the Parent company’s affairs 
as at 30 June 2008; 
 the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly  
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and, as 
regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation; and
 the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with 
the financial statements.

Notes to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements
For the year ended 30 June 2008
1. General information
Abcam plc is a company incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act 1985. The address of the registered office is 332 
Cambridge Science Park, Milton Road, Cambridge, CB4 0FW, United Kingdom.
The Group’s activities consist of the development, marketing and selling of antibodies and closely related products. The Group sells through 
the internet to customers in most countries of the world. The Group operates through its parent company Abcam plc and through its wholly 
owned subsidiaries Abcam Inc. and Abcam KK.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the 
Group operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.
2. Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for the first time. The 
disclosures required by IFRS 1 concerning the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS are given in note 30.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these 
financial statements were in issue but not yet effective:
IFRS 8 Operating segments
IFRIC 12 Service concession arrangements
IFRIC 13 Customer loyalty programmes
IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The limit of a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction.
IFRS 2 Share based payment (amendment)
IFRS 3 Business combination (amendment)
IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations (amendment)
IAS1 Presentation of Financial Statements (amendment)
IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment (amendment)
IAS 19 Employee benefits (amendment)
IAS 20 Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosures of Government Assistance (amendment)
IAS 23 Borrowing costs (amendment)
IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (amendment)
IAS 28 Investments in Associates (amendment)
IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies (amendment)
IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures (amendment)

IAS 36 Impairment of Assets (amendment)
IAS 38 Intangible Assets (amendment)
IAS 39 Financial Instruments and Measurement (amendment)
IAS 40 Investment Property (amendment)
IAS 41 Agriculture (amendment)
The directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the 
financial statements of the Group except for additional disclosures on capital and financial instruments when the relevant standards come 
into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 April 2008.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments. 
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company made 
up to 30 June each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an 
investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided at cost in equal 
instalments over the estimated lives of the fixed assets. Abcam plc
Annual report and accounts 
30 June 2008

2. Significant accounting policies continued
The depreciation rates applied are shown below: 
Office equipment, fixtures and fittings 20% per annum
Laboratory equipment 20% per annum
Computer equipment 33% per annum 
Hybridomas 33% per annum
Depreciation is accelerated if assets are deemed to have been impaired or there is a change in the residual economic life. The remaining 
useful lives of assets are re-assessed at each balance sheet date.
Intangible assets
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Payments made to acquire distribution rights from third parties are capitalised and are amortised over the period of the agreement.
These assets are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated minimum useful lives of 3 years.
Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment both annually and when there is an indication that an asset may be impaired when events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The assets’ residual values, useful lives, and methods of 
valuation are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each financial year end.
Investments
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision for any impairment in value.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is calculated using the actual cost of the product when acquired  
or manufactured.
The cost of Abcam own manufactured inventory includes material, direct labour and an attributable portion of production overheads based 
on normal levels of activity and is calculated using the standard cost method.
Net realisable value is based on the estimated selling price less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal. Provision 
is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items where appropriate.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are 
recognised in the income statement when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. When a trade receivable is considered 
uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against 
the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in the income statement.
Derivative financial instruments
Forward contracts are used by the Group to manage its exposure to the risk associated with the variability in cash flows in relation to both 
recognised assets or liabilities and forecast transactions. All derivative financial instruments are measured at the balance sheet date at their 
fair value.
Where derivative financial instruments are not designated as or not determined to be effective hedges, any gain or loss on the 
remeasurement of the fair value of the instrument at the balance sheet date is taken to the income statement.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, 
along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the 
hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is effective in 
offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the profit and loss immediately, 
together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk. 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in equity. 
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss. Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in 
profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss. Abcam plc

2. Significant accounting policies continued
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated 
or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. The adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item arising from the 
hedged risk is amortised to the income statement from that date. Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time remains in 
equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no 
longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately in the income statement.
A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months 
and is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets or liabilities.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes some items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are 
never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the 
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the calculation of the taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance 
sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be 
utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the 
initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the 
income statement, except where it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in 
equity.
Pensions
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme in the UK, which is open to all employees and directors of the company. 
The amount charged to the income statement in respect of pension costs is the contribution payable in the year. 
Any differences between contributions payable in the year, and contributions actually paid are shown either as accruals or prepayments in 
the balance sheet.
The amount included in the income statement in the year in respect of the pension scheme was £815,000 (2007: £253,000). The amounts 
included in creditors at 30 June 2008 in relation to the pension scheme is £65,000 (2007: £38,000).
Leases
Leases are classified as financial leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Benefits received 
and receivable under an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum 
lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as 
a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to 
achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly against income. Abcam plc

2. Significant accounting policies continued
Foreign exchange
The individual financial statements of each group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it 
operates (its functional currency). For the purposes of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each group 
company are expressed in pounds sterling which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the 
consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency 
(foreign currencies) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary 
assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated to the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-
monetary items carried at fair value are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary 
items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the results of the operations of the Company’s overseas subsidiaries, 
Abcam Inc and Abcam KK, are translated at the average rate of exchange during the period and their balance sheets at the rates ruling at 
the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on the translation of the opening net assets and results of operations are classified as 
equity and recognised in the Group’s foreign currency translation reserve.
The treatment of exchange differences on transactions entered into to hedge certain foreign currency risks is detailed under derivative 
financial instruments above.
All other differences are included in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Share based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based payment. In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been 
applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested at 1 July 2006.
The Group issues equity-settled share based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share based payments are measured at the 
fair value (excluding the effect of non-market based vesting conditions) at the date of the grant. The fair value determined at the grant date 
of the equity-settled share based payments is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of 
the number of shares that will eventually vest. There are both market and non-market based performance conditions attached to the vesting 
and exercising of equity instruments. Fair value is measured by the use of the Monte Carlo Simulation. The expected life used in the model 
has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of the non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural 
considerations. Charges made to the income statement in respect of share-based payments are credited to retained earnings.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and 
services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes.
Sales of goods are recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short term highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receiveables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for 
estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be 
required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material. Abcam plc

3. Critical accounting judgements and estimates
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 2, the Directors are required to make estimates and 
assumptions, in accordance with IFRS, that affect the amounts reported as assets and liabilities as at the date of reporting the financial 
statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenditure during the year. In preparation of the consolidated financial statements, 
estimates and assumptions have been made by the Directors concerning the fair value of share options, the estimated useful lives of fixed 
assets, accruals and provisions required, the carrying value of investments, the recoverability of deferred tax assets, the carrying value of 
intangible assets and other similar evaluations. Actual amounts that result could differ from those estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision 
affects both current and future periods.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future and other sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a risk of 
causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities or the most significant effect on the amounts recognised  
in financial statements are:
Impairment of intangibles
During the year, management renegotiated a product line acquisition deal. Consequently, it was considered that the carrying value of the 
intangible was overstated and it was adjusted to take account of the anticipated future sales and the risk associated with the contract.
Fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments
As described in Note 26, the Directors use their judgement in selecting an appropriate valuation technique for financial instruments not 
quoted in an active market. Valuation techniques commonly used by market practitioners are applied. For derivative financial instruments, 
assumptions are made based on quoted market rates adjusted for specific features of the instrument. Other financial instruments are valued 
using a discounted cash flow analysis based on assumptions supported, where possible, by observable market prices or rates.
Valuation of own manufactured inventory
The standard costs used for the valuation of own manufactured inventory require a number of assumptions concerning the allocation of 
overheads. These assumptions are based primarily on management’s estimates of time spent in each relevant area of activity.
Provision for obsolete stock
The provision for obsolete stock is based on management’s estimation of the commercial life of inventory lines and is applied on a prudent 
basis. In assessing this, management takes in to consideration the sales history of products and the length of time that they have been 
available for resale.
4. Income statement for the Company
The profit for the financial year dealt with in the financial statements of the Company was £5,126,000 (2007: £3,687,000).
5. Business and geographical segments
Geographical segments
The Group’s operations are located in the UK, USA and Japan.
Business segments
The Directors consider that there are no identifiable business segments that are engaged in providing individual products or services or a 
group of related products and services that are subject to risks and returns that are different to the core business. Abcam plc

      £000 £000

 Share options      671,614 943,674
Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of diluted earnings per share  35,574,152 35,516,484
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of 
shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share is calculated on the same basis as the basic earnings per share but with a 
further adjustment for the weighted average shares in issue to reflect the effect of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. The number of 
dilutive potential ordinary shares is derived from the number of share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than 
the average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the year.

The average credit period taken for sales is 34.4 days (2007: 44.3 days). No interest is charged on the receivables. Trade receivables are 
provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts determined by reference to past default experience. The Group and Company have 
provided fully for all amounts over 120 days because historical experience is such that receivables that are past due 120 days are not 
generally recoverable. Trade receivables between 30 days and 120 days are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts from 
the sale of goods determined by reference to past default experience.
Credit limits for each customer are reviewed on a monthly basis. There are no customers who represent more than 5% of the total balance 
of trade receivables.
The analysis below show the balances included in debtors which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group or Company has 
not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable. Abcam plc

Impairment losses recognised    367 215 139 152
Balance at the end of the year    591 413 224 198
In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group and Company consider any change in the credit quality of the receivable 
from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being 
large and unrelated. Accordingly the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for 
doubtful debts.
Included in the allowance for doubtful debts are individually impaired trade receivables with a balance of £289,000 (2007: £121,000) 
relating to companies in financial difficulties. The impairment recognised represents the difference between the carrying amount of these 
trade receivables and the present value of the expected litigation proceeds. Neither the Group or the Company hold collateral over these 
balances.

At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributable earnings of subsidiaries for 
which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised is £1,028,000 (2007: £595,000). No liability has been recognised in respect of these 
differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of temporary differences and it is probable that such 
differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Abcam plc

Trade creditors and accruals principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing costs. The average credit period 
taken for trade purchases is 17 days (2007: 32 days). At the end of the previous financial year, it was decided that suppliers should be paid 
on a more frequent basis.
Most suppliers do not charge interest for the first 60 days of the invoice. The Group has financial risk management policies in place to 
ensure that all payables are paid within the credit time frame.
The deferred creditor represents the earn-out payable on sales of products under a distribution agreement (see note 14). The portion 
payable in more than 12 months is included in non-current liabilities. (2008: £109,000 2007: £386,000)
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of the trade and other payables approximates to their fair value.

25. Share-based payments
Equity-settled share option scheme
The Company operates a number of share option schemes for certain employees of the Group. The share based compensation charge is 
made up from option awards from the EMI plan, Unapproved share option plan, the US employees share option plan and the SAYE plan. 
Option grants under each scheme have been aggregated.
The vesting period is from one to three years other than for those options with performance criteria, which vest when the criteria are met. If 
the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant the options expire. Options are forfeited if the employee 
leaves the Group before the options vest. The fair value of the options at the date of grant is the market price.
The volatility of the options is based on the long term average volatility in the share price of five quoted companies that are considered to 
have a reasonable comparability with Abcam plc. The dividend yield is based on Abcam’s actual dividend yield in the past.
The risk free rate is the yield on UK Government Gilts at each date of grant.
The employee exercise multiple is based on published statistics for a portfolio of companies.
The employee exit rate is based on management’s expectations and, in accordance with IFRS 2, is applied after vesting.
Details of the share options outstanding during the year are as follows:
Summary of all schemes
Options outstanding as at 30 June 2008 had an exercise price of between 10p and 413p (2007: 10p and 280p). The weighted average 
remaining contractual life is 8.12 years (2007:5.92 years). The weighted average fair value of the options outstanding at the end of the year 
was 65.24p (2007: 46.27p). The group recorded total expenses of £192,000 (2007: 162,000).

Risk in relation to the use of financial instruments
Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group or the 
Company. Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers spread across diverse geographical areas. The Group does not have 
any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty. Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts 
receivable and consideration is given as to whether there is any impairment in the value of any amounts owing.
The standard payment terms for receivables other than intragroup balances are 30 days. Any variation in these terms requires authorisation 
by senior management. Year end debtor days are 34.4 (2007: 44.3). All overdue debts are provided for where collectability is considered 
doubtful or the value of the debt is impaired. Objective evidence of impairment could include the Group’s past experience of collecting 
payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average credit period of 34.4 days, as well as 
observable changes in international or local economic conditions.
The standard payment terms for intragroup receivables is 45 days. There is not considered to be any risk of impairment of these receivables 
unless the financial assets of the entity holding the corresponding liability are impaired.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings 
assigned by international credit-rating agencies. Funds are split between at least two institutions.
Market risk
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Group 
enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on the sales of goods and services denominated in Dollars 
and Euros.
Foreign currency risk management
The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The Group’s policy is to maintain natural hedges, where 
possible, by matching foreign currency revenue and expenditure. Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy 
parameters utilising forward exchange contracts.
The carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities at the reporting date are as follows:
      
 Liabilities  Assets 
 
    30/6/08 30/6/07 30/6/08 30/6/07
    £000 £000 £000 £000
Euros    79 79 1,655 1,183
Dollars    821 752 3,886 1,511
Yen    17 32 539 455
    917 863 6,080 3,149
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The Group’s principal functional currency is pound sterling. The Group is mainly exposed to US dollars and Euros but has an increasing 
exposure to Japanese Yen. The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to an 8% increase and decrease in Sterling against the 
relevant foreign currencies. 8% is considered by management to be a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates after giving 
consideration to changes in exchange rates over the last 12 months. 
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated financial assets and liabilities and the cash flow hedging 
reserve and adjusts their translation at the period end for an 8% change in foreign exchange rates. The analysis below shows the increase 
or decrease in profit and the change in equity when the Sterling weakens or strengthens 8% against the relevant currency. Abcam plc

Impact of 8% weakening
– foreign currency financial assets and liabilities   137  96  266  66 
– Cash flow hedging reserve     – (396)  – (562)
The Group’s sensitivity to foreign currency has increased during the period due to increased sales levels. This increase has been 
proportionately more than the increase in US dollar purchases. In management’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis is representative of the 
inherent foreign exchange risk at year end. The Group’s policy is to maintain natural hedges, where possible, by matching US dollar 
revenue with US dollar expenditure.
Forward exchange contracts
It is the policy of the Group to enter into forward exchange contracts to manage the risk associated with anticipated sales transactions 
within 30% to 80% of the exposure generated.
The Group uses a rolling hedging strategy with contracts with terms up to 12 months. Upon maturity of a forward contract, the Group may 
enter in to a new contract designated as a separate hedging relationship.
Foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates matching maturities of the contracts.

At 30 June 2007, all of the contracts were held as cash flow hedges. At 30 June 2008, none of the contracts were held as cash flow hedges.
Liquidity risk management
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk 
management framework for the management of the Group’s short-, medium- and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements. 
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities by continuously monitoring cash flows and 
matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
The Group and Company hold cash deposits at call or with a maturity of up to 12 months. At 30 June 2008, the average maturity of 
balances was 35 days of fixed rate deposits not sensitive to changes in interest rates.
All funds are readily available to the Company to meet operational requirements.
The amount owing from subsidiaries is payable on demand and is classified as being payable within 1 month. Trade payables are normally 
payable within 30 days of invoice. Abcam plc

Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis
An increase of 1% in the average interest rate during the year would have resulted in an increase in interest received by the Group of 
£113,000 (2007: £111,000) and by the Company of £103,000 (2007: £111,000).
A decrease of 1% in the average interest rate during the year would have resulted in an equal and opposite impact on interest received by 
the Group and the Company as described above.
Fair value of financial instruments
The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are determined as follows:
Foreign exchange contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and the yield curves derived from quoted interest rates 
matching maturities of these contracts.
The Directors consider there to be no material difference between the book value and the fair value of the Group’s financial assets and 
liabilities at the balance sheet date. This is because most of the financial assets and liabilities are short term. Abcam plc

30. Explanation of the transition to IFRS
This is the first year that the Company has presented its financial statements under IFRS. The following disclosures are required in the year 
of transition. The last financial statements under UK GAAP were for the year ended 30 June 2007 and the date of transition to IFRS was 
therefore 1 July 2006.
The principal impact of IFRS on these financial statements has been in relation to the following:
a. The scope of IAS 32 and IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Presentation and Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
measurement respectively
IAS 32 and IAS 39 require the company to recognise derivative financial instruments at their fair value on the balance sheet (under UK 
GAAP, these were off balance sheet items). There may also be a corresponding hedging reserve within equity on the balance sheet if 
hedge accounting is applied. 
The Group designates foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges and has implemented hedge accounting.
b. The scope of IAS 12: Income taxes
Under IAS 12, a deferred tax asset arises on the unexercised share options issued to employees. Under UK GAAP the tax charge is only 
recognised in the income statement when the tax becomes payable. Abcam plc

Our vision is to build the largest 
online antibody resource in the 
world while also ensuring that 
the antibodies are of excellent 
quality and commercial viability.
Welcome!
My name is Molly, I’m the resident Abcam mascot and 
appear on all our packaging and branded materials.
A lot of researchers ask where we got the idea for Molly  
the sheep. It was simply because Dolly the sheep was  
making headline news at the time, so we created the  
body out of a molecular space fill model and gave her  
antibody legs, and thus the molecular Dolly became  
Abcam’s Molly. Annual report

Group Directory IBC
The year saw strong turnover growth as a result of a
number of new products being introduced into growing
markets.  Photographic continues to benefit from an
increase in demand for digital SLR cameras, whilst the
Broadcast market is slowly improving.
We start 2005 in a much stronger position than at the
same time last year, with higher order books and rising
volumes. Going forward, Vitec remains exposed to
fluctuations in the US dollar, but, as a result of
restructuring actions taken in recent years, the Group
is now in better shape. Overall the Board views the
outlook for 2005 with cautious optimism.

The Vitec Group
Having joined the Board of Vitec in June, I succeeded Alison
Carnwath as Chairman in November. Alison retired from the
Board at the end of the year after almost nine years service and
we thank her for her contribution to the development of the
Group. The initiatives taken under Alison’s stewardship are
bearing fruit and I look forward to building on them.
I have visited many of the Group’s facilities, met key staff and
have been impressed by the skill and effort they are bringing to
tackling the issues which face the Group. I would like to take the
opportunity of thanking all our employees for their contribution
to the many changes and improvements they have made - the
underlying progress of the business is beginning to show
through.
The Board has conducted a review of Group strategy with the
Company’s new advisers and we are confident that the business
is on the right path to generate value for all shareholders. 
The results for 2004 are encouraging in terms of organic growth
from new product development and from improving markets.
We are also benefiting from the reorganisation initiatives that
have involved plant closures and significant structural change,
combined with improved financial control. As a result, revenues
from continuing operations grew 18% in constant currency
terms and profit before tax, exceptional items, goodwill
amortisation and impairment grew 30% in constant currency. 
Earnings per share, before exceptional items, goodwill
amortisation and impairment, were 22.9p (2003: 23.9p). As
announced at the half year, we continue to experience a high
underlying tax rate as all of the Group’s profits were earned
outside the UK. Nevertheless, tax payments in the year were
very low as the Group benefited from a significant tax credit
arising from the sale of the ALU business. The lowering of the
Group’s effective tax rate continues to be a priority.
Cash generation continued to be strong, with net cash inflow
from operating activities of £22.5 million (2003: £28.7 million).
Working capital increased as a result of the sales growth, but
stock and debtor ratios continued to improve.
Acquisition activity
To supplement the organic growth, two small businesses were
acquired in the year. As previously reported, our Photographic
Division strengthened its in-house distribution activities with the
acquisition of Multiblitz, its long-standing distributor in Germany,
in January 2004 for £1.4 million. Multiblitz is now integrated
and operates as part of Bogen Imaging. In March 2004 we
acquired the US assets of Charter Broadcast, a competitor in
the rental arena, for a nominal sum which, with transaction
costs, brought the total acquisition cost to £0.1 million. That
business was immediately integrated into our US network of
depots. Both acquisitions are performing well. We continue to
look for further acquisitions that will strengthen our existing
position or open up new avenues for growth in related areas.
Funding
On 25 January 2005 the Group agreed a new, enhanced loan
facility, which has a term of five years. The new facility, which is
for an increased amount of £100 million, compared to £55
million previously, is for Group companies’ current requirements
and for funding any potential future corporate activity.

Annual Report 2004
2004 dividend
In line with the policy outlined in March last year, which stated
that over a period of two to three years we would move towards
an average dividend cover level of around two times, the Board
is recommending a final dividend of 8.9p, giving a total dividend
for the year of 15p per share. Since last year, when our new
dividend policy was announced, foreign exchange has
weakened against us. However, subject to no further significant
weakening in the US dollar, it is our current intention to maintain
the current level of dividend per share for 2005 and to seek to
return to a dividend cover in line with our stated policy over the
next two to three years.
Outlook for 2005
We ended 2004 with the factory and structural reorganisations
substantially behind us. The benefits flowing from these, which
will continue to be delivered in 2005, have allowed higher
spending on R&D and marketing in particular, which in turn has
resulted in much stronger product ranges.
We started 2005 in a much stronger position than at the same
time last year, with higher order books and rising volumes.
Going forward, Vitec remains exposed to fluctuations in the US
dollar but, as a result of restructuring actions taken over recent
years, the Group is now in better shape. Overall the Board views
the outlook for 2005 with cautious optimism.

Chief Executive’s Review
The Vitec Group
2004 saw real progress in growing the business. For almost
three years we have been operating the ‘Consolidate-Leverage-
Grow’ strategy. 2002 and the first half of 2003 saw multiple
plant and facility closures at a time of static sales, while in the
second half of 2003 we began to see growth returning. In 2004
we delivered both operational improvements and significant
revenue growth, most of it organic, due to the multiple new
products and services that we have launched. While we expect
to see further benefits from the consolidation actions already
announced and implemented, the emphasis on delivery is
moving from ‘Consolidate’ and ‘Leverage’, to ‘Grow’.
Results
2004 saw revenues from continuing operations grow 18% in
constant currency terms, including a 4% contribution from
acquisitions. Profit before tax, exceptional items, goodwill
amortisation and impairment, grew 30% in constant currency
terms due to the volume increases and the benefits of the plant
closure programme and other cost control measures, despite
increases in UK pension costs.                                                 
Foreign currency is a major factor in the performance of a
worldwide business such as Vitec, and the fall in the US dollar,
particularly against the euro, continued to have a significant
effect, even after the hedging we have in place. 
In £ sterling terms the sales growth was still strong at 8.8%
(from £170.4 million to £185.4 million), while operating profit
before exceptional items, goodwill amortisation and impairment,
was £17.8 million (£17.8 million in 2003), after reflecting
adverse transactional and translational impacts of some £4.8
million.
After a slightly lower interest charge, profit before tax before
exceptional items, goodwill amortisation and impairment was
£16.2 million (£16.1 million in 2003). There was a net operating
exceptional charge of £2.1 million relating principally to the
previously announced restructuring of the commercial
operations within Broadcast Systems. 
Revenue Growth
The growth in revenue coming from a combination of new
products and market growth. In order to stimulate product sales
we have, in the last two years, launched new intercoms systems,
new studio camera pedestal and head products, new battery
systems, new photographic tripods, and new lighting truss
systems. Every brand has reinvigorated its product portfolio and
some have replaced their range completely. We continue to win
meaningful awards for these new products at trade shows and
in trade magazines, which is an encouraging indicator of future
prospects. Many of these new products are being patented
which, together with an ongoing R&D spend of roughly 5% of
non-rental sales, reinforces our market-leading positions. We
believe continued innovation is critical to Vitec’s future.

Annual Report 2004
With sales growth in constant
currency of 18%, the emphasis
on delivery is moving from
‘Consolidate’ and ‘Leverage’
to ‘Grow’.
The market for our photographic accessories continues to
expand, driven by the uptake of digital cameras, which is
particularly strong in the ‘35mm SLR’ segment, where we have
targeted products for the keen amateur. In our broadcast
market, many of the major networks have moved rapidly into
making programmes in ‘High Definition’ (HD), a digital format
that greatly enhances the clarity of video images, which is
particularly useful for sports coverage. The US rentals market is
reviving somewhat and our Broadcast Services Division has
developed greater capacity for HD productions in response. It
has also been active in coming forward with new service
offerings: in particular for complex ‘Reality TV’ shows. We also
generated growth by entering new markets, in particular Air
Traffic Control, where we have installed several large intercom
systems.
2004 also saw some major external and internal events that
boosted revenues. The presidential elections in the USA lifted
advertising expenditure, whilst the Athens Olympics saw
significant contracts for our rental business, as well as product
sales to broadcasters and freelancers. Internally, operational
improvements in Photographic reduced lead times to normal
levels, converting some backlog into sales. While there are no
major sporting events in 2005, most Vitec businesses entered
2005 with order books higher than at the start of 2004.
Restructuring Benefits
We continue to improve the operational efficiency of the Group,
exploiting our manufacturing and purchasing scale in both
product divisions, greatly reducing the negative effect of the
falling US dollar. The benefits from the restructuring of our
manufacturing, which although offset by mix changes and some
provisions for ageing stock, have underpinned the results for
2004. Our manufacturing operations are now focusing on
continuous improvement actions for 2005 and beyond, which
enabled us to announce in July the rationalisation of the
commercial side of the Broadcast Systems business. A cost of
£4 million to £5 million was anticipated, of which a net £2.1
million was charged in 2004. This process is also going well.
Ongoing cost control and better use of our rental asset base also
improved profitability in Broadcast Services.
It was encouraging that most of our businesses showed a
significant improvement in the second half of the year over the
first half, as the effects of earlier actions came through.
Executive team
During 2004 we strengthened the management team in the
Photographic business in Italy and we recently made several key
appointments within Broadcast Systems, further improving the
team there.
With the scaling up of our plant in Costa Rica behind us, Brian
McCluskie, formerly Operations Director, has left the Company
and we wish him well in his future career.
L3-586_Vitec_AR_2004_24-AMENDS  3/30/05  11:37 AM  Page 11 Photographic
Products for professional photographers
The Photographic Division saw strong volume growth during
2004. In constant currency terms, sales were up 23%, including
6% from the acquisition of Multiblitz. This underlying growth
was driven by the continuing launch of new products and the
demand for digital cameras, particularly in the digital SLR
segment. However the fall in the US dollar against the euro
reduced that growth to 12% in £ sterling terms, and also
adversely affected margins.
The market for accessories for the professional photographer
was stimulated by innovations such as the new joystick head,
whose ergonomically-shaped pistol grip allows the user to
position the camera and activate the shutter with one hand, and
the new 303SPH head which facilitates the composition of
panoramic shots, useful for capturing architectural images.
Manfrotto also has an important position at the lower end of the
video camera support market, catering to a different channel to
our Broadcast brands, where the new 519 Pro-video head
generated a lot of interest. Also in the professional arena, Litec
continued to develop its presence across Europe; its lighting
truss range was augmented with new tower systems to support
the Libera trusses launched last year.
The majority of the growth, however, came as a result of the
boom in affordable digital SLR cameras that are now being 
bought by keen amateur photographers. The new Neotec tripod,
which is targeted specifically at this user group, has been selling
well ahead of expectations, and there are other products
planned for this exciting segment.
Improvements in manufacturing operations have also helped
increase volume in 2004. The closure of the small plant at Nove
in Italy early in the year has simplified work flow; the IT systems,
now rolled out to all but one site across the division, have given
greater visibility to suppliers of our needs and, together with
efficiency improvements within the factories, allowed Manfrotto
to cut its lead-time substantially, converting several weeks of
backlog into sales. Manufacturing improvement activities are
now focused more on cost reduction actions and on further
improving the health and safety culture. 
Following the disposal of ALU at the end of 2003, the
management structure was changed, with several senior
vacancies being filled from outside the Group. The Campese
offices were renovated, generating sufficient space to centralise
the operations and administration functions previously dispersed
around the other plants. This has already driven improved
coordination and efficiency. In August a representative office
was established in Hong Kong in order to better support our
local third party distributors.

Products and systems primarily for broadcast applications
The Broadcast Systems Division also saw a year of growth, with
sales up 13% in constant currency, 6% in £ sterling. This was a
marked improvement following several years of stagnation due
to the decline in the broadcast market. Each unit has new
products to promote – the new Quattro-S pedestal from Vinten is
particularly encouraging as it, and the family of new
studio/outside broadcast control heads based on the Vector 900,
are generating sales in a part of the market where we already
enjoyed a significant market share. Our portable power
company, Anton/Bauer, continued to take market share in
Europe, winning orders from TFI in France and RAI in Italy.
The Olympics acted as a catalyst for several purchasers, with
many of the Group’s products used there and it was a strong
year for robotics products. 2004 saw the opening of a sales
office in Beijing, which will strengthen our position in China as
local broadcasters gear up for the 2006 Asian Games and the
2008 Olympics.
In addition, non-broadcast applications also grew. 2004 saw
significant shipments of support devices for surveillance
equipment, and of Air Traffic Control intercoms systems to
Korea, China and Vietnam, as well as the large contract for the
German Space Operations Centre. This will be used to monitor
the forthcoming Soyuz mission. Margins are improving in this
area, as we complete the product development work and are
able to be more selective about the projects to which we bid.
In September we announced that, with the manufacturing
restructuring bedding down, part of the commercial operations
of this division would be rationalised. The aim was to reduce
internal duplication while ensuring we could maintain the pace
of innovation for which our brands are known. These projects
are going well, they produced benefits in 2004 and are expected
to produce further benefits in 2005, on top of those flowing from
the plant closures. In Camera Support we are optimising many
of our back office operations in the USA and Europe, for which
the new IT systems are an important foundation.
In Communications the two main companies, Clear-Com and
Drake, have been integrated and the brand repositioning
exercise completed successfully. Both brands now have access
to all product families, and this has been well received by
customers. New distributors have switched from other suppliers
to join the Clear-Com network. As part of these changes, new
managing directors have been recruited for both the Camera
Support and Communications businesses.
During the year, Vinten celebrated 40 years on the site at Bury
St Edmunds, England, having moved from North London in
1964, and Sachtler relocated a short distance to new facilities at
Eching near Munich, where sales, marketing, customer service,
and most importantly R&D, will be based.

Rental services and technical support mainly for the broadcast market
Broadcast Services saw a 24% growth in US dollar sales, which
translated to a 10% growth in £ sterling. Many of the drivers of
this growth are expected to persist in 2005. The ongoing
strengthening of the market, first evident in the latter part of
2003, continued, buoyed by the backdrop of improving US
advertising spend, and we have benefited from the uptake of
High Definition (HD) programming. Operating margin grew from
breakeven to 5.4%, and the unit continued to generate cash
despite increased spend on new rental equipment.
Bexel has also captured an increasing number of reality shows
as the technical standards demanded by producers have
steadily risen; examples are Survivor, The Apprentice, The
Osbournes, and most recently the latest series of American Idol
and Brat Camp. Many of these shows have also needed
sophisticated audio systems from ASG, our high end audio
integrator. During the year, progress was also made to widen the
range of services offered; for example, Bexel can now help
clients fit-out facilities with fibre optic cabling that allows
subsequent events to be staged more efficiently.
The Charter acquisition has gone well, with additional contracts
for the depots in Chicago and Orlando that were taken over, as
well as gains from the elimination of surplus equipment. The
expanded network of 10 depots means that broadcasters can
rely on us to support them with assets and technical support
throughout the country. In 2004 this led to a ‘preferred supplier’
agreement being concluded with Disney, covering ABC and
ESPN as well. 
The second half saw the summer Olympics in Athens, with
contracts won for AOB (Athens Olympic Broadcasting) and with
two German broadcasters, ARD and ZDF. Both these prestigious
contracts went smoothly, a testament to the high levels of
technical service within Bexel that customers have come to rely
on. These contracts will not repeat in 2005, but we continue to
see underlying growth in rentals.
Asset management is a major determinant of success in any
rental business, and the division’s new IT systems have
facilitated the production of more sophisticated analyses of
contracts, asset acquisition costs and revenue generation, that
enable utilisation to be optimised. This is reflected in an
improved ratio of revenues to net assets, 2.4 in 2004 versus 1.7
in 2003. The application of these tools, and the continued use
of sub-rentals, has allowed higher levels of spending on new,
frequently High Definition, equipment than in the year before,
while still generating cash. The business entered 2005 with an
asset base level better aligned to its needs.
During the year the New York and Dallas facilities were
upgraded, and in December the main Burbank office relocated
from its old site with four small buildings, to new premises
where everyone is under one roof, which will yield cost and
efficiency benefits from 2005.

Turnover increased by £15.0 million (from £170.4 million to
£185.4 million) or 8.8% in the year. There was underlying
growth in all three divisions. Photographic and Broadcast
Services benefited from a contribution of £3.5 million and £1.8
million respectively from the acquisitions of the domestic
distribution activity of Multiblitz in Germany and Charter
Broadcast North America. Excluding the incremental effect of
those acquisitions, underlying sales growth was £22.6 million or
14%, but this was significantly reduced by the effects of adverse
foreign exchange rates on translation, £11.6 million, and
transaction, £2.1 million. The balance of growth, £0.8 million,
came from the full year effect of acquisitions made part-way
through 2003.
Gross profit margins fell from 43.6% to 41.3% reflecting a
change in mix in a number of businesses and the adverse effect
of foreign exchange transactions, particularly in the
Photographic Division. Gross profits were £0.3 million higher
than the prior year before a contribution of £1.9 million from
2004 acquisitions.
Net operating expenses, before exceptional items of £2.1
million and goodwill amortisation and impairment charges of
£1.8 million, increased by £2.2 million (3.9%) to £58.7 million.
£1.2 million of the total increase related to 2004 acquired
businesses, £4.1 million to existing businesses and there was an
offsetting foreign exchange translation benefit of £3.1 million.

amortisation and impairment charges was unchanged at £17.8
million, including contributions of £0.1 million and £0.6 million
from the acquisitions of Multiblitz and Charter Broadcast North
America respectively. Operating profit margins were 9.6%
compared to 10.4% in 2003. The year on year effect of
translating overseas profits was £0.9 million adverse and the
effect of exchange rate changes on transactions after hedging,
principally the weaker US dollar against the euro, was £3.9
million unfavourable.
There is a net operating exceptional charge of £2.1 million
relating principally to previously announced restructuring plans
within the Broadcast Systems Division which will enable the
Camera Support and Communications businesses to operate in
a more integrated manner. It is expected that the overall charge
will be between £4.0 million and £5.0 million, in line with
previous guidance.
Goodwill amortisation and impairment The charge was £1.8
million (2003: £3.4 million including £2.1 million impairment
charge against the goodwill of the US Systems Wireless
business).
Taxation The effective taxation rate on operating profit before
exceptional items, goodwill amortisation and impairment has
increased to 42.0% (2003 39.8%) and includes £1.6 million
(9.9% rate) of deferred tax. The tax charge is relatively high
because profits have arisen in high tax jurisdictions but the
Group has incurred net losses in the UK on which it has not
benefited from tax relief.
Cash flow and net debt Cash generation remained strong.
However, net debt increased slightly from £10.4 million to £11.3
million after £1.5 million acquisition costs and £2.7 million cash
cost of restructuring actions.
Net cash inflow from operating activities was £22.5 million
(2003: £28.7 million), equating to 55p per share (2003: 70p per
share). Cash outflow from an increase in working capital
(principally due to a £1.2 million decrease in creditors) was £1.4
million (2003: £4.0 million inflow). Capital expenditure and
financial investments were £10.0 million (2003: £10.2 million),
of which £4.8 million related to rental assets and £0.8 million to
IT projects, partly financed by the proceeds from asset disposals
of £1.6 million (2003: £2.4 million).
Working capital was increased by the effect of the two
acquisitions and higher volumes, partially offset by efficiency
programmes. Stocks decreased by £0.6 million to £32.6 million,

increased by £15.0 million (from
£170.4 million to £185.4 million) 
or 8.8% in the year.
whilst stock days decreased to 109 (2003: 126 excluding Retail
Display). Trade debtors at £26.2 million were £2.0 million lower
than last year with debtor days at 52 days (2003: 60 days
excluding Retail Display). Trade creditors at £15.7 million were
£0.7 million higher than last year (whereas other creditors were
£1.6 million lower). Amounts recoverable on long term contracts
increased by £1.1 million to £2.1 million.
Tax paid in 2004 of £1.4 million reduced considerably from
2003 (£10.8 million). The prior year included the settlement of
an historic tax claim of £1.4 million, whereas the current year
has benefited from Italian tax credits arising from the sale of the
Retail Display business in 2003.
Treasury Policy Financing, currency hedging and tax planning
are managed centrally. Hedging activities are designed to
protect profits, not to speculate. Substantial changes to the
financial structure of the Group or treasury practice are referred
to the Board. In 2003 the Board approved the use of option
contracts for hedging foreign currency receipts.
As in previous years, a portion of the transactions of subsidiaries
in foreign currencies is hedged 12 months forward. Forward
foreign exchange contracts at 31 December 2004 totalled £5.2
million (2003: £16.0 million). In addition, the Group had simple
option contracts, for the sale of dollars for euros over the period
January 2005 to December 2005 totalling £9.3 million (2003:
£8.4 million) and for the sale of dollars for £ sterling over the
period January 2005 to August 2005 totalling £0.9 million
(2003: £nil). Translation of foreign currency profits and interest
rates are not hedged. Foreign currency net assets are not
hedged other than by normal Group borrowings. 
The Group operates strict controls over all treasury transactions
involving dual signatures and appropriate authorisation limits. 
Financing Activities The average cost of borrowing for the year
was 4.8% (2003: 4.8%) with the upward trend in interest rates
being offset by the transfer of some of the Group’s £ sterling
loans into Euros and US dollars. Net interest cover (using profit
before exceptional items, goodwill amortisation and impairment)
remained high at 11 times (2003: 10 times). The Group's £55
million three-year bilateral credit facility agreements which were
due to expire in October 2005 were replaced on 25 January
2005 with a five-year £100 million multicurrency revolving credit
facility agreement involving five banks.

Annual Report 2004
UK pensions The Group contributes to two UK defined benefit
pension schemes. At the end of 2003 the Group closed both
schemes to new members, replacing them for 2004 onwards
with a Group personal pension plan, currently with Standard
Life. A full triennial actuarial valuation was undertaken as at
5 April 2004. At that date, the schemes had assets with a
combined market value of £28.3 million. On the basis of the
assumptions adopted, the value of the schemes’ assets was
equal to 94% of the value placed on the benefits that had
accrued to members allowing for expected future increases in
salaries. As a result of the valuation, and following the increase
of £0.1 million per annum in Company contributions from the
beginning of 2003, regular contributions were again increased
by £0.2 million per annum with effect from the date of valuation.
In addition, employees’ contributions were increased from
1 January 2005. The Group’s UK pension charge to the profit
and loss account under SSAP24 has increased from £0.9
million in 2003 to £1.5 million in 2004 after the effects of
accounting for moving from a previous surplus to a shortfall in
scheme assets when compared to accrued liabilities.
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) The
Group has completed its initial investigation into the impact of
adopting IFRS with effect from 1 January 2004. The areas
currently identified as most affecting the profit before tax and
shareholders’ funds are as a result of the adoption of IAS 19
Employee Benefits (in respect of pensions), IAS 38 Intangible
Assets (in respect of capitalising major development costs),
IFRS 3 Business Combinations (in respect of goodwill) and
IFRS 2 Share Based Payment and IAS 10 Events After the
Balance Sheet Date (in respect of the dividends declared after
the balance sheet date). The exact impact of adopting IFRS, as
well as a full analysis of the impact on the 2004 published
results, will be communicated in May 2005. The Interim Results
for the six months ending 30 June 2005 will be prepared in
accordance with IFRS.

the Group for the year ended 31 December 2004.
Review of the Group and its activities
The performance and activities of the Group during the year are
set out in the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s
Review, the Financial Review and the At a Glance pages. 
On 8 January 2004 the Group acquired the assets of the
distribution arm of Multiblitz for c1.9 million (£1.4 million) cash.
On 30 March 2004 the Group acquired the operating assets and
certain of the liabilities of Charter Broadcast North America Inc.
for £0.1 million, including acquisition expenses.
Results and dividends
The Group’s profit on ordinary activities before tax, exceptional
items, goodwill amortisation and impairment amounted to £16.2
million (2003: £16.1 million). Profit on ordinary activities before
tax but after exceptional items, goodwill amortisation and
impairment amounted to £12.3 million (2003: £7.8 million). 
The directors recommend a final dividend of 8.9p per share
(2003: 16.6p). If approved, the dividend per share for the year
will total 15p (2003: 22.7p). Subject to approval by
shareholders, the final dividend will be paid on 20 May 2005 to
shareholders on the register on 22 April 2005. 
Post balance sheet events
On 25 January 2005 the Group signed a five year £100 million
Multicurrency Revolving Credit Facility Agreement to replace the
two existing Multicurrency Revolving Credit Facility Agreements
which had termination dates of 28 October 2005. The first draw
down on this Facility was made on 31 January 2005.
Future development
The Group’s continuing strategy is to grow its businesses
through organic expansion and carefully planned acquisitions
principally in areas related to its existing businesses, customers,
markets and skills. 
Research, development and engineering
The management of the Group continues to recognise that new
products are essential to its long-term success and considerable
emphasis is placed on active product development programmes
in the manufacturing companies. In 2004 those companies
spent £7.9 million (2003: £8.8 million) on research,
development and engineering.

The Group’s report on social, environmental and ethical matters
is set out on pages 29 to 32. The Group has policies in respect
of the following key areas: risk and fraud, employment
(including employees and employee communication),
whistleblowing, environment, human rights, community impact
and involvement, relationships with suppliers, customers and
other stakeholders. 
Donations
In 2004, charitable donations were made by the Charity
Committee from its account with the Charities Aid Foundation
totalling £3,700 (2003: £7,000).  Following the tsunami disaster
in December 2004, the Group has offered equipment from its
range of Drake air traffic control VCS intercom systems to assist
in the aid effort to re-establish affected airports.  No donations
were made to any political party. For further information on
donations refer to the section on Community Impact and
Involvement set out in the Corporate Social Responsibility Report
on pages 29 to 32. 
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting for 2005 will be held on 18 May
2005 at the offices of Financial Dynamics, Holborn Gate, 26
Southampton Buildings, London WC2A 1PB. The notice of
meeting and a proxy card are enclosed. 
The Company will again be making use of the electronic voting
facility provided by its registrars, Capita Registrars. The facility
has now been extended to include CREST voting for members
holding their shares in uncertificated form.  For further
information please refer to the section in Online Services and
Electronic Voting set out on page 72. 
The business of the Annual General Meeting will include the
consideration by shareholders of the report and accounts for the
year ended 31 December 2004, the Remuneration Report, the
proposed dividend, election of a director, re-election of two
directors, the re-election of the auditors and the following further
items of business. 
A resolution to revise the Company’s Articles of Association to
reflect the changes in the law affecting the capacity of a
company to provide indemnities to its directors. The changes to
the Articles are set out in the notice of meeting.
Resolutions to approve two new share incentive plans. Further
details are set out in the Remuneration Report and in the notice
of meeting.
A resolution renewing the directors’ authority to allot shares for
cash, as if the pre-emption provisions of Section 89 of the
Companies Act 1985 did not apply, is set out in the notice of
meeting. The first part of the resolution deals with the allotment
of shares for cash under a rights issue, giving power to make
adjustments to deal with overseas shareholders, fractions of
shares and similar matters. The second part renews the power of
the directors to allot shares for cash, limited to 5% of the issued
share capital at 7 March 2005. The authority will expire at the
end of the Company’s next Annual General Meeting or, if earlier,
on 18 August 2006.
Your directors have no present intention of issuing or granting
rights over the unissued share capital, except in relation to the
Company’s adopted employee share incentive arrangements
and no share issue will be made which will effectively alter the
control of the Company without prior approval of the
shareholders in general meeting. 
Any shares held in treasury and used by the Company for the
purposes of or pursuant to the employee share schemes
operated by the Company will, so long as required under
institutional guidelines, count towards the limits on the number
of new shares that may be issued under the rules of such
employee share schemes. 
A resolution for a general authority for the Company to make
market purchases of its own shares was first passed at the
1998  Annual General Meeting and has been renewed by
shareholders at subsequent annual general meetings. The
directors believe it is desirable to have the power to make
market purchases in the event of suitable opportunities arising.
Accordingly, a resolution to again renew the authority will be
proposed at the Annual General Meeting. The authority to
purchase shares would only be exercised if there was a resultant
increase in earnings per share, and it would be in the best
interests of the Company. Should the directors exercise such
authority, any shares so purchased may be placed in treasury in
accordance with The Companies (Acquisition of Own
Shares)(Treasury Shares) Regulations 2003, as amended and
subsequently cancelled or transferred to satisfy awards arising
under the Company’s employee share schemes or issued for
cash as provided for by the Regulations. 
The Chairmen of the Board and of its Committees will be in
attendance at the Annual General Meeting to answer questions
from shareholders. 
Auditors
The auditors, KPMG Audit Plc, are willing to continue in office.
A resolution will be put to the Annual General Meeting to re-
appoint the auditors and to authorise the Board to agree their
remuneration.

L3-586_Vitec_AR_2004_24-AMENDS  3/30/05  11:39 AM  Page 23 Remuneration Report
This Report contains the information required under the Code
on Corporate Governance and under the Directors’
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002. A resolution to approve
the Report will be proposed at the 2005 Annual General
Meeting. The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee will be
available to answer questions about directors’ remuneration at
the Annual General Meeting. 
Remuneration Committee
At the commencement of 2004, the Remuneration Committee
comprised David Bell (Chairman of the Committee), Alison
Carnwath and John Potter.  During the year Alison Carnwath left
the Committee and Michael Harper, Nigel Moore and Will Wyatt
joined the Committee.  
Under its terms of reference, the Committee, on behalf of the
Board, determines the remuneration packages including bonus
arrangements, participation in incentive schemes, pension
contributions and all other benefits received by the executive
directors. In the event of the termination of employment of those
directors, the Committee would also determine any
compensation payments, after taking appropriate legal advice.
The Committee also makes recommendations to the Board,
within its terms of reference, on the framework of senior
executive remuneration including terms of service, pay
structure, bonus and share incentive arrangements and other
benefits. 
The Chief Executive, Gareth Rhys Williams, attends meetings by
invitation of the Committee but is not present when his
remuneration is being considered. The remuneration of the non-
executive directors is determined by the Board as a whole with
the relevant non-executive director abstaining when his or her
remuneration is considered. 
Remuneration policy
The executive directors’ remuneration comprises a basic salary
plus, under the Executive Bonus Scheme, company and/or
individual performance-related elements of up to 100% of
salary. Therefore, if they achieve maximum performance in
relation to the performance-related elements of their
remuneration, these elements would, in total, account for 50%
of their total cash remuneration. 
Remuneration packages are formulated to attract, retain and
motivate executive directors and senior executives of the quality
required, without being excessive, by reference to salary and
benefit surveys supplied by one or more external sources. They
take into account the responsibilities involved, remuneration
packages in comparable companies that have similar
international operations, relative performance and both internal
and external advice. Remuneration and benefits reflect
responsibility and market comparisons. 
The notice period by the Company under the service contracts
of the executive directors is 12 months. The normal retirement
age of executive directors is 60.  Executive directors’ service
contracts do not provide for pre-determined amounts of
compensation in the event of early termination by the 
Company. The Committee’s policy in the event of early
termination of employment is to mitigate compensation to 
the fullest extent practicable. 
The Committee believes that it is beneficial for an executive
director to take up one external, non-executive appointment.
Remuneration received by a director in respect of such an
external appointment would be retained by the director. 
The Committee currently has no intention of amending the
above stated policy for 2005 and future years, although it will be
reviewed from time to time. 
When reviewing and determining executive and non-executive
directors’ and senior management’s remuneration, advice is
sought and received from one or more external remuneration
and benefit consultants and their various surveys of
remuneration and fees and also internally from the Chief
Executive, Gareth Rhys Williams, and the Company Secretary,
Roland Peate. Towers Perrin, which was formally appointed in
early 2003, has, during the year, provided independent advice
to the Committee. The Committee has also received external
advice from Monks Partnership and Deloitte & Touche.
Chairman and the other non-executive directors
The Chairman and the other non-executive directors do not
have service contracts but have letters of appointment. The
initial period of their appointments is normally three years but
may, by mutual consent and with the approval of the
Nominations Committee and the Board, be extended for a
further three years. In exceptional circumstances appointments
may be extended beyond six years, by mutual consent and with
the approval of the Nominations Committee and the Board, if it
is in the interests of the Group to do so. 
Executive directors
Executive directors’ remuneration comprises basic salary, bonus,
share incentives, company vehicle or cash allowance, fuel where
a company vehicle is provided, medical health insurance,
membership of the Group’s Executive Pension Scheme, life
assurance and additionally, for Gareth Rhys Williams,
contributions towards a permanent health arrangement.
Contributions are also paid by the Company to a funded
unapproved retirement benefits scheme for Gareth Rhys
Williams of an amount equal to the difference between the
Inland Revenue earnings cap and his basic salary.
It is the Company’s policy to make provision for pensions for
executive directors through funded retirement benefit schemes.
Up to the maximum level permitted by Inland Revenue rules,
retirement benefits are provided through an approved retirement
benefit scheme.  For further information, see the table entitled
Pensions Related Remuneration on page 28.

L3-586_Vitec_AR_2004_24-AMENDS  3/30/05  11:39 AM  Page 24 Gareth Rhys Williams, Chief Executive, aged 43, is employed
under a service contract dated 23 November 2001. The notice
period by the Company under his contract is 12 months; notice
by the employee is six months. The Company may, in the event
of termination of employment, pay a sum in lieu of notice equal
to 12 months’ gross basic salary together with the gross value of
the other benefits that he is entitled to receive under his service
contract, but excluding pension contributions and any bonus.
The bonus arrangements for 2005 will be calculated on the
basis that 75% relates to the achievement of operating profit
targets and 25% relates to specific personal objectives. The
unexpired term of Gareth Rhys Williams’ service contract, to his
normal retirement date, is 17 years. 
Alastair Hewgill, Finance Director, aged 50, is employed under a
service contract dated 17 April 2002. The notice period by the
Company under his contract is 12 months; notice by the
employee is six months. The Company may, in the event of
termination of employment, pay a sum in lieu of notice equal to
12 months’ gross basic salary together with the gross value of
the other benefits that he is entitled to receive under his service
contract, but excluding pension contributions and any bonus.
The bonus arrangements for 2005 will also be calculated on the
basis that 75% relates to the achievement of operating profit
targets and 25% relates to specific personal objectives. The
unexpired term of Alastair Hewgill’s contract, to his normal
retirement date, is 10 years. 
Incentive arrangements
The policy of the Remuneration Committee over the last few
years has been to make annual awards under the Long Term
Incentive Plan to the executive directors and the other members
of the Executive Board.  Such awards were based on a
proportion of salary.  Grants of conventional share options were
also made annually to the Group’s senior management
immediately below the level of the Executive Board. Participation
in the Deferred Bonus Plan was open to those employees who
were members of the Group’s Executive Bonus Scheme and
who received a bonus.
An in-depth review of the Group’s incentive arrangements for
executive directors, other members of the Executive Board and
all other participants in the Group’s incentive arrangements has
been carried out by Deloitte and Touche. That review has
resulted in the overall package of incentives, including salary,
bonus scheme and share incentive arrangements being
restructured. The new arrangements, agreed by the
Remuneration Committee, have resulted in a new Deferred
Bonus Plan and a new Long Term Incentive Plan.  Approval by
shareholders of these new plans will be sought at the 2005
Annual General Meeting.
The new Deferred Bonus Plan will replace the current Deferred
Bonus Plan and will be used in conjunction with bonuses arising
from the Executive Bonus Scheme for 2005 and future years.
The new Long Term Incentive Plan will replace the current Long
Term Incentive Plan and will be used to make annual awards to
the executive directors and the other members of the Executive
Board, as at present, but also to the Group’s senior
management immediately below the level of the Executive
Board.
It is planned to make a grant of share options to the executive
directors and the other members of the Executive Board every
three years, starting in 2005.
Executive directors and the other members of the Executive
Board will now be required to build up, over a period, a
meaningful holding of shares in the Company.
There are currently no plans to make any further grants under
the Premium Option Plan. This policy is reviewed at least
annually and may be revised from time to time. Invitations under
the Group’s Sharesave arrangements are usually made annually
and these are planned to continue. Such awards and grants
take into account the overall and flow limits advised by the
Association of British Insurers. 
The performance conditions applicable to the Group’s new Long
Term Incentive Plan and to the matching element of the
Deferred Bonus Plan will relate to total shareholder return
against a comparator group (awards under the previous
Deferred Bonus Plan were not subject to any performance
targets). The performance conditions under the Group’s share
option schemes will continue to relate to increases in earnings
per share. The performance condition applicable to the
Premium Option Plan relates to a significant increase in the
Company’s share price.
The combination of awards with performance conditions using
total shareholder return and grants using increases in earnings
per share is considered the most appropriate way of aligning the
interests of senior management with those of shareholders.
There is no re-testing of performance in respect of grants or
awards. Monitoring and measuring of the performance
conditions take place following the end of each year when the
Company’s results have been audited and again at the time of
exercise of options and awards.

The Group currently has the following incentive schemes and
plans in place. For further details of the proposed new Long
Term Incentive Plan and Deferred Bonus Plan, refer to the
notice of meeting which contains a summary of the main terms. 
2002 Executive Share Option Scheme
This is an Inland Revenue approved scheme. Executive
directors and other senior employees are selected to receive
options over shares. Exercise of an option is subject to growth in
the Company’s earnings per share, excluding exceptional or
extraordinary items, exceeding the growth in the retail prices
index over a performance period. The percentage growth over
the retail prices index determines the proportion of the award
that may be exercised. Options are exercisable between the
third and the tenth anniversaries of their dates of grant. 
Performance condition: If the percentage growth in the adjusted
earnings per share of the Company exceeds the percentage
growth in the retail prices index over the three year performance
period by 3.0301% (the base target threshold), an option will
become exercisable in respect of one-third of the shares over
which it is held. Full vesting takes place when such growth over
the performance period is 9.2727% or greater. A sliding scale
operates for performance between the lower and upper
thresholds. Options lapse if the base target threshold is not
achieved. There is no re-testing of performance. 
2002 Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme
Executive directors and other senior employees are selected to
receive options over shares. As with the 2002 Executive Share
Option Scheme, exercise of an option is subject to growth in the
Company’s earnings per share, excluding exceptional or
extraordinary items, exceeding the growth in the retail prices
index over a performance period. Options are exercisable
between the third and the tenth anniversaries of their dates 
of grant. 
Performance condition: The performance condition is identical
in all respects to the performance condition of the 2002
Executive Share Option Scheme set out above. There is no re-
testing of performance. 
Long Term Incentive Plan
Under this plan, executive directors and other senior employees
are selected to receive awards over shares that vest in whole or
in part depending on the satisfaction of a performance condition
related to the growth in earnings per share compared to the
retail prices index over a performance period. 
Performance condition: The performance condition attaching to
awards under the plan relate to increase in earnings per share.
For an award to vest in its entirety, the increase in earnings per
share over the performance period of three years must be not
less than the increase in the retail prices index plus 36% or
more. For an award to vest at its lowest level of 25%, the growth
in earnings per share over the performance period must be
equal to the increase in the retail prices index plus 9%. Awards
lapse if the performance is below 9%. Where growth is between
9% and 36% awards are realisable on a straight-line basis. 
Premium Option Plan
Under this plan, selected executive directors and other senior
employees receive options over shares that are granted in the
form of two tiers. The exercise price of the first tier is set at 25%
in excess of the share price immediately prior to the date of
grant; the exercise price of the second tier is set at 50% in
excess of that same share price. 
Performance condition: First tier options are only exercisable if
the average middle market price of the Company’s shares
increases to, and remains in excess of, the option exercise price
for a minimum of 20 consecutive dealing days within three years
of the date of grant. Second tier options are only exercisable if
the average middle market price of the Company’s shares
increases to, and remains in excess of, the option exercise price
for a minimum of 20 consecutive dealing days within five years
of the date of grant. Each tier of options lapses if the share price
does not achieve the required threshold within the relevant
performance period. Subject to the share price reaching the
required threshold, options are exercisable between the third
and the tenth anniversaries of their dates of grant. 
Deferred Bonus Plan
Under the plan, an eligible executive may defer between 10%
and 50% of his or her cash bonus in exchange for receiving a
basic award over shares in the Company with a value
equivalent, at the date of award, to the amount of the deferred
bonus. A basic award may, in normal circumstances, be
exercised by a participant after two years. However, if exercise is
deferred until after three years and the executive remains
employed by the Group, the participant is entitled to receive a
matching award of additional shares equal in number to those
comprised in the basic award.  Shares comprising basic awards
are purchased in the market and held in trust by Mourant & Co
Trustees Limited until exercise.  Dividends are not paid on
shares until their exercise by participants.
Performance conditions: Bonuses received by participants, and
which may be deferred under the plan, are themselves subject
to demanding performance conditions linked to Company and/or
individual performance. The awards under the plan are not
subject to any further performance targets.
2002 Sharesave Scheme and International Plan
The Group also operates a savings related share option scheme
in the UK and a similar international plan in respect of overseas
employees in certain countries. The scheme and plan are open
to all the Group’s employees in those geographical areas who
have the necessary length of service. Under the scheme and
plan participants contract to save a set amount each month in
return for which they receive an option over a specified number
of shares. At the end of the savings period participants may
exercise their options to buy shares in the Company using their
savings. Exercise is not subject to any performance condition.

Notes
1. In November 2001, a share price related cash bonus scheme was adopted under which an award equivalent to an option over 142,857 shares, at a price
of £3.50 per share, was made to Gareth Rhys Williams.  This was replaced on 19 September 2002 by an equivalent option over 142,857 shares at the
same exercise price of £3.50 per share under the Rules of the (1996) Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme, the Scheme used as the comparable
for the cash bonus scheme. The total number of shares comprising the award were purchased in the market in September 2002.  These shares are being
held in trust by Mourant & Co Trustees Limited.  There is a transitional arrangement for the cash bonus scheme to run in tandem with the share option.
If, and to the extent that, the cash bonus is not triggered by Mr Rhys Williams prior to the first occasion upon which he becomes entitled to exercise the
share option granted on 19 September 2002, the cash bonus scheme will lapse and will be replaced by the share option.
2. Non-executive directors are not eligible to participate in the Company’s share option or share incentive schemes and consequently they do not hold any
share options or other share incentives.
3. The total gain on the exercise of options by the directors during 2004 was nil (2003: Nil) as no options were exercised.
4. The share price at the end of the year and the highest and lowest prices during the year are shown on page 72.

L3-586_Vitec_AR_2004_24-AMENDS  3/30/05  11:39 AM  Page 30 Corporate Social Responsibility Report
The Group published its first detailed Corporate Social
Responsibility Report in 2002 although it had been including an
environmental policy statement in its annual report for some
years. During 2004 the Group has further developed its social
responsibility awareness and internal reporting of statistics. We
plan to continue development, and the inclusion of an
environmental report, in the future.
The Group has for many years taken a caring and considerate
approach to social, environmental and ethical matters
throughout its operations worldwide and this has continued, and
will continue, into the future. The Group regards compliance
with all relevant laws and guidelines as important and socially
responsible.   During the year a number of enhancements were
made to the Group’s website to ensure compliance with Part III
of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, which covers access to
goods and services.  For full details of the enhancements,
please see the Accessibility Statement on the website
(http://www.vitecgroup.com/accessibility.aspx).
The Group’s current system of risk management and control,
which includes social responsibility matters, is led by the heads
of each of the Group’s operations. Those people are responsible
at local level for complying with the relevant environmental
regulations in all the geographical areas in which they operate.
They report to the Board on such issues through the Group’s
Finance Director, who has ultimate responsibility for such
matters, as part of the Group’s system of internal control and
risk management reporting.
Overall the Group continues to believe that it has limited
environmental impact. However, we recognise that we continue
to have a responsibility to understand the impact that our
activities have at local, national and global level. These have
been monitored and assessed locally and solutions have been
implemented as appropriate according to best practice, local
legal and other requirements. Over the last few years we have
developed and implemented a more consistent approach to
adopt sound policies throughout all our operations. As part of
the implementation programme, we have put in place more
formal systems and procedures for identifying, measuring,
reviewing and reporting on social, environmental and ethical
matters. Group policies are in place in the key areas of
employment, environment, human rights, community impact
and involvement and relationships with suppliers, customers
and other stakeholders. These policies have been implemented
at the centre and within each operating entity. Specific
responsibility for such matters has been assigned to designated
employees. Reviews by local management take place at each
Group location and reports are made of the major risks in these
areas. These reports identify risks, the current measures being
taken to control them and the steps being taken to eradicate or
minimise their effect in the future. The compilation of statistics
commenced in 2002 and they are being used for reporting
purposes and to monitor improvements.
1. Employment
Policy
To comply with all relevant legislation and codes of practice
relating to employment, health and safety and equal
opportunities. To provide good quality working environments and
facilities for employees and training and development
appropriate to each of their roles; not to discriminate in any way;
to take a flexible approach towards family responsibilities to
assist them in establishing an appropriate work/life balance; to
provide a competitive range of quality employee benefits. To
keep the workforce informed of major events and developments
within the Group.
Actions 
Employment policies throughout the Group already reflect the
policy set out above. 
We continue to recognise the importance of involvement,
motivation, training and development of our employees at all
levels. The importance of good communication and working
relationships is actively encouraged. During 2004 the Group’s
website was significantly enhanced by the inclusion of a
microsite containing the annual report.  It also provides a
gallery containing photographs of Group products. Other
enhancements to the website are also currently being
considered.  The aim is to help investors, potential investors and
employees alike to better understand the Group and view the
wide variety of products available from Group companies.
Our policy is to keep employees informed on matters relating to
their employment and on financial and economic factors
affecting the Group through management briefings, via the
Group’s website and by internal distribution of press releases
and internal announcements. This enables our employees to
gain a better understanding of our business objectives and their
roles in achieving them. Building and developing the skills,
competencies, motivation and teamwork of our people is key to
achieving our business objectives and to ensuring best practices
throughout the Group.
The Executive Board, the other senior executives of the Group,
the Chief Executive and the Finance Director, meet on a regular
basis. In addition, the managements of the operating units
employ a wide variety of consultation and briefing methods,
including conferences, joint committees, specific project teams
and briefing groups.
The Group operates in many countries and our employment
policies, which are designed to meet local conditions and
requirements, are established on the basis of the best practices
in each country in which we operate. The Group’s wide
geographical spread provides some opportunities for employees
to work either short term or on secondment for longer periods of
time at the Group’s various locations.
Annual Report 2004

L3-586_Vitec_AR_2004_24-AMENDS  3/30/05  11:39 AM  Page 31 Corporate Social Responsibility Report continued
Encouragement is given to all employees both in the UK and
overseas to participate in the Group’s savings related share
option schemes under which options over the Company’s shares
are granted to employees who enter into contracts to save
agreed amounts each month. Invitations under the UK and the
International schemes have been made each year since the
schemes were first introduced in 1984.
Ability and aptitude are the determining factors in the selection,
training, career development and promotion of all employees.
We understand our responsibility as employers under the
Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and we do not discriminate
against disabled people.  If an employee is, or becomes,
disabled during his or her period of employment, we will, if
necessary and to the extent possible, adapt the work
environment to enable the employee to continue in his or her
current position or retrain the employee for duties suited to that
employee’s abilities following disablement. It continues to be the
Group’s policy to consider applications for employment from
disabled people on the same basis as other potential employees.
Health and safety 
Health and safety training is part of the induction process for
new employees. Specific training is given, where relevant, for
forklift truck, crane and hoist operation and bottle gas usage as
well as fire safety and first aid training. 
Risk assessments were introduced during 2003 in various parts
of the Group and these have now been phased into the other
parts of the Group. Assessments are carried out on a regular
basis and also when new equipment or machinery is acquired
or new processes are introduced.
During 2003 the recording and reporting of accidents and
related lost time statistics became more formalised and now
forms the basis of regular reporting to the Executive Board.
In 2004 the gathering and reporting of accident statistics was
further refined and continues to be reported to, and monitored
by, the Executive Board. 
Workplace injuries and fatalities in 2004 
Rate of non-fatal over 3-day 
workplace injuries (Notes 1 and 2) 1,335*
Rate of fatal workplace injuries (Note 2) nil
*The rate in 2003 was 1,333.  The rate for 2004 includes the statistics in 
respect of the two acquisitions in the year. 
Notes 
1. Over 3-day workplace injury means an injury at work leading to an
absence from work of more than 3 days. 
2. The above rates are expressed per 100,000 employees per year, in line
with the normal reporting standard by the Health & Safety Executive. 
2. Environment
Policy
To promote and improve throughout the Group the benefits of
efficient usage of energy and water.
Actions
Recycling processes have been in use in the Group for many
years. Recycled materials and those that minimise negative
environmental impacts are used wherever possible. A steadily
increasing proportion of the packaging, paper, toner cartridges
and cartons used by the Group’s operations is recycled after use
and in many cases biodegradable packaging is used. 
It is in the interests of the environment and in the financial
interests of the Group to make the most efficient and
responsible use of energy. The practice of responsible resource
and energy management through reduced consumption and the
encouragement of energy and water efficiency is widespread
throughout the Group’s operations world-wide.
Developments during 2004 include:
Vinten continues to refine and develop its Environmental
Management System, taking into account appropriate best
practices. Vinten strives to improve consumption of materials in
all operations and to reduce, rather than have to dispose of,
waste wherever possible and to promote recycling and the use
of recycled materials. Vinten works in partnership with its
suppliers to minimise the impact of operations through a quality
purchasing policy and recycling through suppliers. They also
use a recycling system that covers paper, cans and plastic cups
and have an on-going water-efficiency programme.
Vinten has changed the protective finish on fasteners and
screws from zinc plate to an organic protective finish.  Soldering
fume extraction has been improved in robotics assembly areas
and trials in the use of lead free solder have been successfully
completed.  Waste paper recycling has been extended to the
whole of the Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk site and printer
cartridges are also recycled.  The viewing windows on machine
tools have been replaced to comply with imminent safety
regulations.  Vinten has also implemented a system of controlled
disposal of used electrical equipment.
In 2005 Vinten intends to maximise recycling opportunities via
an agreement with an external supplier who will manage all
waste disposal at the Bury St Edmunds site.  A documented,
and audited, Broadcast Camera Support ‘Environmental
Management System’ will be implemented at both the Bury St
Edmunds and the Costa Rica manufacturing sites.
In 2003 Drake introduced the use of standard thickness
packaging by switching from tri-wall to double-wall packing to
reduce cardboard use. The use of bespoke packaging also
reduced the use of bubble wrap and polystyrene chippings.
Drake has now further reduced the use of bubble wrap and
The Vitec Group
30
L3-586_Vitec_AR_2004_24-AMENDS  3/30/05  11:39 AM  Page 32 polystyrene chippings by increasing their use of bespoke
packaging. Cardboard, paper and toner cartridges are each
separately recycled. The building in Cambridge is generally
more energy efficient than its previous premises.
During 2004, Drake and Vinten in the UK commenced the
implementation of the EU Directives on Waste Electrical and
Electronic Equipment (WEEE), which must be in place by the
end of July 2005, and on the Restriction of Use of Certain
Hazardous Substances (ROHS), which comes into effect on 1
July 2006.  This has involved analysing in-house and third party
supplied components to ensure they contain increased use of
lead-free solder with the aim of phasing out, as quickly as
possible, the use of lead in solder and other components.
Clear-Com in the USA, although not covered by EU legislation, is
taking the same responsible approach to waste electrical and
electronic equipment and to restricting its use of certain
hazardous substances such as solder containing lead.
Cardboard and toner cartridges are also recycled by Clear-Com.
A cardboard only skip has been installed for cardboard
recycling.  Paper is recycled separately to cardboard.  Toner
cartridges are recycled either by The Roy Castle Lung Cancer
Foundation, a charity wholly dedicated to defeating lung cancer,
or through local vendors.  Further improvements necessary to
comply with WEEE and ROHS are planned for 2005.  There is a
continued reduction by Vitec Group Communications in the use
of bubble wrap and polystyrene chippings facilitated by the
increased use of bespoke packaging.
Anton/Bauer, Inc. continues to be an active member of the
battery recycling scheme in conjunction with the Rechargeable
Battery Recycling Corporation (RBRC).  Anton/Bauer pays
licensing fees to the RBRC, a non-profit public service
organization created to promote the recycling of portable
batteries, and places the RBRC seal on its products. In 2004
Anton/Bauer forwarded more than 35,000 pounds in weight of
nickel cadmium, lithium ion and nickel metal hydride batteries
returned to the company for recycling.  Anton/Bauer also is a
member of the PRBA (Portable Recharging Battery Association)
whose mission is to provide leadership in obtaining consistent
domestic and international solutions to environmental and other
selected issues affecting the use, recycling and disposal of small
sealed rechargeable batteries. 
OConnor continues to recycle the remnant ink from its printers
and photocopier, use energy saving light bulbs, use electronic
timers for heating and air conditioning units, and to recycle all of
its machine cutting chips and scrap metal. OConnor’s
hazardous waste materials and liquids are collected by a waste
management company for disposal. Deburr particles are
separated from process liquid by a cyclonic separator and
properly disposed of; the liquid is then reused. All of OConnor’s
product packaging is made of recycled materials.
At the manufacturing operation in Costa Rica we now use a high
proportion of bio-degradable packaging and have reduced the
use of cardboard.
Compared to 2003, the figures show an increase in the use of
electricity, gas and water. This is due to three factors; one, as a
result of increased activity levels by the Group, two, the
improved gathering process referred to earlier, particularly in
respect of overseas operating units, and three, the inclusion of
the energy consumed by the two businesses acquired in the
year.
3. Human rights
Policy
To comply with the laws and customs of each country in which
we operate. Not to use child labour. Not to discriminate in any
way and to give equal opportunities to all workers.
Actions
The above policy has been part of the Group’s approach for
many years. The Group’s operating companies are required to
include it as part of their employee policies and to comply.

4. Community impact and involvement
Policy
To contribute to local worthwhile causes and charities and to
ensure that the Group’s operations cause minimal negative
impact within the community.
Actions
For many years the Group has contributed to worthwhile causes.
Donations are usually, and have been in the past, made
primarily to children’s, cancer, police, fire brigade, drug
rehabilitation and other similar charities. The Group’s charity
committee reviews all written requests for donations and decides
on the level of donation and the charities to which donations are
made whilst taking into account its limited resources.
During 2004 donations were made to 22 charities. The amount
donated by the charity committee, from the Company’s Charities
Aid Foundation account, totalled £3,700 (2003: £7,000).  In
addition, the Company took part in the Christmas Carol Concert
at St Paul’s Cathedral held every two years in support of Cancer
Research UK for which the donation, including the
advertisement in the souvenir programme, totalled £4,000.
Like all companies, the Group has limited resources and the
amount of money available for charitable purposes varies from
time to time.
5. Relationships with suppliers, customers and other stakeholders
Policy
The Group recognises the obligations it has towards the parties
with whom it has business and other dealings such as its
customers, shareholders, employees, suppliers and advisers.
Dealings with those groups of people depend upon the honesty,
integrity and enthusiasm of its employees and every effort is
made to ensure that a high standard of expertise and business
principles is maintained in such dealings. Where appropriate,
training is given to maintain and to raise the standards.
Actions
As stated in the Directors’ Report, the Group’s policy with
suppliers is that individual subsidiary companies are responsible
for negotiating terms and conditions under which suppliers
operate. Once agreed, payments to suppliers are made in
accordance with those terms and conditions, subject always to
the supplier having complied with them. That policy has been in
place for a number of years and will continue for the financial
year ending 31 December 2005. We continue to review and
take action where appropriate to ensure the reliable and
consistent sources of quality materials from which our products
are made.
In all our dealings, honesty and integrity continue to be
paramount. The Group’s brands are a highly valuable asset and
every effort is made to enhance their reputation for high quality,
service and reliability. In 2005 we will have a common approach
to auditing ethical trading standards with suppliers.

The Listing Rules require a company to include in its annual
report and accounts a statement of how it has applied the main
and supporting principles set out in the Code of Best Practice
(the "Code") The Listing Rules also require a company to
include a statement as to whether or not it has complied
throughout the accounting period with the Code provisions. A
company that has not complied with the Code provisions, or
complied with only some of the Code provisions or (in the case
of provisions whose requirements are of a continuing nature)
complied for only part of an accounting period, must specify the
Code provisions with which it has not complied, and (where
relevant) for what part of the period such non-compliance
continued, and give reasons for such non-compliance.
Statement of compliance
The Board considers that it has complied with the Code
throughout the year ended 31 December 2004. The Company
regularly reviews and revises its procedures, as necessary, to
take account of the requirements of the Code.
The Board
The Board met six times during the year and there is a formal
schedule of matters and levels of authority which are delegated
to the executive directors, all other matters and powers being
reserved to the Board or to its Committees.
Throughout the year the Board comprised two executive
directors and four, and at certain times of the year five, non-
executive directors. All the non-executive directors are
considered to be independent. Gareth Rhys Williams was a
director and the Chief Executive throughout the year. Alastair
Hewgill was the Finance Director throughout the year. During
2004 all the directors attended all the Board meetings except for
Alison Carnwath who was unable to attend the December Board
meeting.
The directors bring independent character and judgement to
bear on strategic matters, the performance of the Group, the
adequacy of resources and standards of conduct. The roles of
the Chairman (who is non-executive) and of the Chief Executive
are separate and they each have a clear written division of
responsibilities approved by the Board. David Bell is the Senior
Independent Director. Outside of Board meetings, the non-
executive directors maintain regular contact with each other by
telephone and usually meet prior to Board meetings. The same
pattern of contact between Board meetings is planned to
continue throughout 2005.
Directors, having notified the Chairman, are able to take
independent professional advice at the Company’s expense in
furtherance of their duties. All new directors are given an
extensive introduction to the Group, including meeting with
senior executives and visiting the Group’s principal operations
both in the UK and overseas. All directors have access to the
advice and services of the Group Company Secretary.
The papers supplied for consideration by the Board are
provided on a timely basis and include budgets, strategy papers,
reviews of the Group’s financial position and operating
performance and annual and interim reports and accounts.
Further information is supplied from time to time as and when
requested by the Board.
The Board has an Audit Committee, a Remuneration Committee
and a Nominations Committee. Each Committee has formal
terms of reference which are available by request from the
Company Secretary or can be viewed on the Company’s website.
The terms of reference and the effectiveness of the Board and
of each Committee are regularly reviewed and changes made
where necessary.  During 2004, the points raised by the
members of each Committee were summarised and tabled at a
Board meeting at which they were discussed and an action plan
agreed.
Individual director performance evaluation has also taken place.
In the case of the executive directors this evaluation takes place
regularly throughout the year against achievement of specific
objectives. Evaluation of the Chairman was carried out by the
Senior Independent Director in 2003.  Alison Carnwath stepped
down as Chairman at the end of October 2004.  Michael Harper,
the new Chairman, had just two months in the role by the end
of the year and, therefore, only a brief evaluation of the
Chairman was carried out by the Senior Independent Director at
the end of 2004.  Evaluation of each of the other non-executive
directors was carried out by the Chairman prior to her stepping
down at the end of October 2004. Each evaluation has been
carried out by using written questionnaires and has been
discussed individually with each of the relevant non-executive
directors. Similar evaluations will take place each year in the
future.
Audit Committee
The Committee is chaired by Nigel Moore. The other members
of the Committee are David Bell, Michael Harper, John Potter
and Will Wyatt.  Each member of the Committee is required to
be, and is, independent. The Company’s external auditors are
invited to attend meetings of the Committee on a regular basis.
During 2004 the Committee met three times. At two of those
meetings the executive directors were not present for part of the
meeting so that members of the Committee could meet with the
auditors. The practice of the Committee meeting alone with the
auditors will continue in the future.
Duties of the Committee:
Financial Reporting
Monitoring the integrity of the financial statements of the
Company, including its annual and interim reports, preliminary
results’ announcements and any other formal announcement
relating to its financial performance, reviewing significant
financial reporting issues and judgements which they contain.

L3-586_Vitec_AR_2004_24-AMENDS  3/30/05  11:39 AM  Page 38 Appointments and re-elections to the Board
The Chairman and the other non-executive directors are
appointed for an initial period of three years which, with the
approval of the Nominations Committee and the Board, would
normally be extended for a further three years. In exceptional
circumstances, appointments of non-executive directors may be
extended beyond six years, with the approval of the Nominations
Committee, the Board and the individual director concerned, if it
is in the interests of the Group to do so.
Under the Company’s Articles of Association, each director is
required to be re-elected at the third Annual General Meeting
following that at which he or she was last elected or re-elected.
John Potter and Gareth Rhys Williams will retire and will be
proposed for re-election at the 2005 Annual General Meeting.
Two new non-executive directors were appointed during the
year, Nigel Moore, on 1 March 2004 and Michael Harper on 14
June 2004.  Mr Moore was appointed as a member of the Audit
Committee and he took over the chairmanship of that
Committee on 31 August 2004.  Mr Harper took over as
Chairman when Alison Carnwath stepped down at the end of
October 2004. Mr Moore’s appointment was approved by
shareholders at the 2004 Annual General Meeting.  Mr Harper
will be proposed for election at the 2005 Annual General
Meeting.  
Mr Potter has now completed six years service as a non-
executive director.  He has significant business experience and
detailed knowledge of the Group and has been asked, and has
agreed, to continue in his current role for a further period. At the
appropriate time, the Nominations Committee will undertake a
search for his successor.
Relations with Shareholders
The Board recognises the importance of maintaining regular
contact with its shareholders to ensure that its businesses,
strategy and remuneration policies are understood and that any
concerns are addressed in a constructive way. The Board
communicates with its shareholders through a combination of
public announcements through the Stock Exchange, analyst
briefings and press interviews at the time of the announcements
of the interim and the full year results and, when appropriate, at
other times in the year. The executive directors and the
Chairman also meet with investors from time to time during the
year. The annual general meeting offers a further opportunity for
the directors to meet with shareholders.
At meetings of shareholders, the level of proxy votes received,
together with the numbers of votes in favour, against and
withheld, is announced after each resolution has been dealt with
on a show of hands. Separate resolutions are proposed for each
issue upon which shareholders are asked to vote.  The Group’s
website is being expanded to contain details of the resolutions
and the voting thereon.
The Company has complied with the requirement set out in the
Code in respect of shareholders’ meetings to send the notice of
annual general meeting and related papers at least 20 working
days before the meeting. It will continue to comply with the
requirement.
Internal control and risk management
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal
control to safeguard shareholders’ investment and the
Company’s assets. As part of its responsibility, the Board
regularly, and at least annually, reviews the effectiveness of its
internal controls. The Group has systems and procedures for
internal control that are designed to provide reasonable control
over the activities of the Group and to enable the Board to fulfil
its legal responsibility for the keeping of proper accounting
records, safeguarding the assets of the Group and detecting
fraud and other irregularities. However, it is recognised that it is
in the nature of any business that business and commercial
risks must be taken and that for a business to succeed,
enterprise, initiative and the motivation of employees are key
elements that must not be unduly stifled. It is not the intention
of the Group to avoid all commercial risks and commercial
judgements will have to be made in the course of the
management of the business.
The Board has adopted a risk-based approach to establishing
the system of internal control. The application, and the process,
followed by the Board in reviewing the effectiveness of the
system of internal control during the year are as follows:
• operating company management is charged with the ongoing
responsibility for identifying risks facing each of the businesses
and for putting in place procedures to monitor and manage
risks.
• the responsibilities of the chief executive officer and chief
financial officer at each operating unit to manage risks within
their businesses are periodically reinforced by Group executive
management.
• major commercial, technological and financial risks to the
Group are formally assessed during the annual long-term
business planning process around mid-year. These plans and
the attendant risks to the Group are reviewed and considered
by the Board.
• large capital projects, product development projects and
acquisitions and disposals require Board approval.
• the process by which the Board reviews the effectiveness of
internal control has been agreed by the Board and
documented. This involves regular reviews by the Board, of
the major business risks of the Group together with the
controls in place to manage those risks as reported to the
Board by the chief executives of each division. In addition,
each year businesses formally review, in detail, all of their
business risks and their internal controls, including finance,
cash, IT, sales, purchasing and logistics. They then prepare
statements that describe the extent of their compliance with
control objectives. These statements are approved by the chief
executive officer and chief financial officer of each operating
unit and submitted to Group executive management for
review. Any significant matters arising from this review are
formally reported to the Board by the Finance Director. The
risk and control identification and certification process is
monitored and periodically reviewed by Group financial
management.

L3-586_Vitec_AR_2004_24-AMENDS  3/30/05  11:39 AM  Page 39 Corporate Governance continued
• A centralised database of risks facing the Group, as well as
each individual business, and an evaluation of the impact and
likelihood of those risks is maintained and updated regularly.
• The Board has established a control framework within 
which the Group operates. This contains the following 
key elements:
• organisational structure with clearly defined lines 
of responsibility, delegation of authority and 
reporting requirements.
• defined expenditure authorisation levels.
• on-site and telephone conferencing operations reviews
covering all aspects of each business are conducted by
Group executive management on a regular basis throughout
the year.
• comprehensive system of financial reporting. The annual
budget and long term plan of each operating company are
reviewed in detail and approved by the executive directors.
The Board approves the overall Group’s budget and plans.
Monthly actual results are reported against prior year and
monthly budgets. Forecasts are revised where necessary but
formally at least once every quarter. Any significant changes
and adverse variances are questioned by the Group
executive directors and remedial action is taken where
appropriate. Group tax and treasury is co-ordinated
centrally. There is weekly cash and treasury reporting to
Group financial management and periodic reporting to the
Board on the Group’s tax and treasury position. 
The Board considers that it has fully complied with the Code
during the year and up to the date of approval of the annual
report and accounts and that it accords with Turnbull guidance.
The Group does not have an internal audit function. However,
the need for such a function is regularly reviewed. The current
conclusion of the Board is that an internal audit function is not
required given the scale, diversity and complexity of the Group’s
activities. Where required, third party audit consultants,
independent from the companies’ external auditors, are used on
specific assignments. The Company believes it can access
professional internal audit support in the relevant country more
effectively than by having an internal department. Three such
outsourced audits took place in 2004. 
Going concern
The directors have made appropriate enquiries and consider
that the Group has adequate resources to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the
directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing
the accounts.
Statement of directors’ responsibilities
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial
statements for each financial year which give a true and fair
view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the Group and
of the profit or loss for that period. In preparing those financial
statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and
prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and
explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company and
the Group will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the company and to enable them to ensure
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act
1985. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as
are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the
Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.

L3-586_Vitec_AR_2004_24-AMENDS  3/30/05  11:39 AM  Page 40 Independent Auditors’ Report to the members
of The Vitec Group plc
We have audited the financial statements on pages 40 to 70.
We have also audited the information in the directors’
remuneration report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a
body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act
1985.  Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might
state to the company’s members those matters we are required
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or
assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and
the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report
and the directors’ remuneration report.   As described on page
38, this includes responsibility for preparing the financial
statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law
and accounting standards.  Our responsibilities, as independent
auditors, are established in the United Kingdom by statute, the
Auditing Practices Board, the Listing Rules of the Financial
Services Authority, and by our profession’s ethical guidance.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial
statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to
be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985.  We also report to you if, in our opinion,
the directors’ report is not consistent with the financial
statements, if the company has not kept proper accounting
records, if we have not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified
by law regarding directors’ remuneration and transactions with
the group is not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement on
pages 33 to 38 reflects the company’s compliance with the nine
provisions of the 2003 FRC Code specified for our review by the
Listing Rules, and we report if it does not.  We are not required
to consider whether the board’s statements on internal control
cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the
effectiveness of the group’s corporate governance procedures or
its risk and control procedures. 
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report,
including the corporate governance statement and the
unaudited part of the directors’ remuneration report, and
consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial
statements.  We consider the implications for our report if we
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the financial statements.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards
issued by the Auditing Practices Board.  An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the
part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited.  It also
includes an assessment of the significant estimates and
judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the
financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the group’s circumstances, consistently applied
and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements and the part of the
directors’ remuneration report to be audited are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error.  In forming our opinion we also evaluated
the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the
financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration
report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state
of affairs of the company and the group as at 31 December
2004 and of the profit of the group for the year then ended;
and
• the financial statements and the part of the directors’
remuneration report to be audited have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

L3-586_Vitec_AR_2004_24-AMENDS  3/30/05  11:39 AM  Page 45 Notes to the Accounts
1 Basis of presentation
The consolidated profit and loss account and balance sheets include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary
undertakings made up to 31 December 2004. The accounts have been prepared in accordance with all applicable accounting
standards under the historical cost convention modified to include the revaluation of certain land and buildings.
The Urgent Issues Task Force (UITF) Abstract 38 changes the presentation of an entity’s own shares held in an Employee Share
Ownership Plan (ESOP) Trust by requiring them to be deducted in arriving at the shareholders’ funds instead of showing them as
an asset. Accordingly, the prior periods’ balance sheets have been restated to show shares held in respect of grants under share
option schemes of £0.5 million as at 31 December 2004 and as at 31 December 2003 as a deduction from shareholders’ funds
instead of as a fixed asset investment.
2 Accounting policies
Basis of consolidation
The results of subsidiaries sold or acquired during the year are included in the accounts up to, or from, the date that control
passes, unless otherwise stated.
For acquisitions made prior to 1 January 1998, the differences between the fair value of the consideration paid for investments
in subsidiaries or businesses and the fair value of their net assets at the date of acquisition is treated as purchased goodwill and
is written off directly against reserves.
For acquisitions made on or after 1 January 1998, purchased goodwill arising from the differences between the fair value of the
consideration paid and the fair value of the net assets acquired as at the date of acquisition is capitalised in the balance sheet
as an intangible asset. Positive goodwill is being charged to the profit and loss account through amortisation on a straight-line
basis over its estimated useful life up to a maximum of 20 years. Negative goodwill is being recognised in the profit and loss
account in the periods in which the non-monetary assets are recovered, through depreciation or sale.
Impairment tests are carried out on the purchased goodwill arising on acquisitions that occurred in the preceding year or when a
triggering event occurs. Where necessary, provision is made for any impairment that has arisen.
Turnover
Turnover, which excludes value added tax and sales between Group companies, represents the value of products and services
sold. Other than for long term contracts, the treatment of which is set out separately below, revenue arising from product sales is
recognised when title passes to the customer.
Revenue arising from asset rental is recognised over the duration of the rental contract at the gross amount billed to the
customer, where we act as the principal in the rental transaction.
Long term contracts
The amount of profit attributable to the stage of completion of a long term contract is recognised when the outcome of the
contract can be forseen with reasonable certainty. Turnover for such contracts is stated at cost appropriate to the stage of
completion plus attributable profits, less amounts recognised in previous years. Provision is made for any losses as soon as they
are forseen.
Contract work in progress is stated at costs incurred, less those transferred to the profit and loss account, after deducting
forseeable losses and payments on account not matched with turnover.
Amounts recoverable on contracts are included in debtors and represent turnover recognised in excess of payments received on account.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies with overseas customers and suppliers are converted at the average rates for the months in
which transactions occur. Profits and losses arising from the difference between these rates and contracted rates on forward
exchange contracts, which are set up as hedges against such sales and purchases, are recorded in cost of sales. Foreign trading
profits and cash flows are translated at the average rates for the year. Monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the year-
end rates and the gains or losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account. Differences on translation of
investments in overseas companies are taken directly to reserves.
Research and development
Expenditure on the Group’s research and development projects is generally charged to the profit and loss account in the year in
which it is incurred. In certain specialised cases where a development project meets clearly defined criteria and the commercial
outcome can be assessed with reasonable certainty, development expenditure is capitalised. Such capitalised expenditure is
amortised over the life of the project.
The Vitec Group
44
L3-586_Vitec_AR_2004_24-AMENDS  3/30/05  11:39 AM  Page 46 Investments
Fixed asset investments are stated individually at cost less, where appropriate, provision for impairment in value. Current asset
investments are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes, where appropriate, accrued interest.
Fixed assets and depreciation
Depreciation is provided at rates estimated to write off the cost or valuation of the relevant assets less their estimated residual
values by equal annual amounts over their expected useful lives. No depreciation is provided on freehold land. Other fixed assets
are depreciated at the rates indicated below:
Freehold and long leasehold buildings 2
1
/ 2% – 5% on cost or valuation
Short leasehold property over the remaining period of the lease
Plant and machinery 12
1
/ 2% – 25% on cost
Motor vehicles 25% – 33 
1
/ 3% on cost
Equipment, fixtures & fittings 10% – 33 
1
/ 3% on cost
IT development costs 20% on cost
Rental equipment 20% on cost
Fixed assets are stated at cost except that, as allowed FRS 15 ‘Tangible Fixed Assets’, on adoption of that standard in the year
ending 31 December 2000 when the book amounts of revalued land and buildings were retained.  These book values are based
on the previous revaluation on 31 March 1989 and have not been subsequently revalued.
Stock and work in progress
Stock and work in progress is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, less progress payments. Cost includes
materials, direct labour and production overheads incurred in bringing stocks and work in progress to their present location and
condition.
Capital instruments
Capital instruments are stated in the balance sheet after the deduction of issue costs, which are charged to the profit and loss
account over the term of the debt.
Receipts and payments on interest rate instruments are recognised on an accruals basis over the life of the instrument. Cash
flows associated with derivative financial instruments are classified in the cash flow statement in a manner consistent with those
of the transactions being hedged.
Deferred tax
The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account tax deferred because of timing differences
between the treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. Full provision for deferred tax is made, on an un-
discounted basis, where there is an obligation to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, in the future. Deferred tax assets are
recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Pension costs
The costs of providing pensions for employees under defined benefit pension schemes are charged to the profit and loss account
over the working lives of the employees in accordance with the recommendations of qualified actuaries. Any funding surpluses or
deficits that may arise are amortised over the average working life of the employees but surpluses may first be used to improve
members’ benefits. The costs of providing pensions for employees under state and other defined contribution schemes are
expensed as incurred.
FRS 17 ‘Retirement Benefits’. This Standard replaces use of actuarial values for assets in a pension scheme in favour of a
market-based approach. In order to cope with the volatility inherent in this measurement basis, the Standard requires that the
profit and loss account shows the relatively stable ongoing service cost, interest cost and expected return on assets. Fluctuations
in market values and changes in actuarial assumptions are reflected in the statement of total recognised gains and losses. The
Group has continued to account for pensions and other post employment benefits in accordance with SSAP 24 but has complied
with the transitional disclosure requirements of FRS 17.
Employee share schemes
The costs of awards to employees that take the form of shares or rights to shares (including conditional rights) are recognised
over the periods to which the employees’ performance relates. No cost is recognised in respect of SAYE schemes that are offered
on similar terms to all or substantially all employees.
Leases
Rentals under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis.
Assets held for short-term rental are recorded as plant and machinery within fixed assets and depreciated over their estimated
useful lives. Rental income from these assets is recognised as earned on a straight-line basis over the rental period.

The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on profit after tax of £6.4 million (2003: £5.5 million) and on the weighted
average number of shares in issue during the year of 41,062,429 (2003: 41,034,098).
Adjusted basic earnings per share is presented as the directors consider that this gives a useful additional indication of the
ongoing earnings performance of the Group.
This calculation is based on profit after tax but before exceptional items and amortisation and impairment of goodwill. In 2004
this profit was £9.4 million (2003: £9.7 million).

d) Foreign exchange hedging
Cost of sales include net gains of £1.5 million (2003: £2.9 million) arising from the difference between the exchange rates at which
foreign currency transactions are converted and the contracted rates on the forward exchange rate contracts set up as hedges against
such transactions. When compared with their values at the exchange rates on the forward contracts in effect on 31 December 2004, the
cumulative unrecognised aggregate gain on the forward exchange contracts as of 31 December 2004 is £0.3 million (2003: £1.6
million). All of these unrecognised gains relate to the year 2005. Because these contracts are put in place to hedge a portion of the
underlying transactions, any net gain or loss that may arise on these contracts over the forthcoming year will be more than compensated
by the corresponding transactional gains or losses.
During 2003 and 2004 forward option contracts selling US Dollars and purchasing Euros were taken out to cover anticipated US Dollar
currency receipts covering the period January 2005 to December 2005. These forward option contracts totalled £9.3 million (2003:
£8.4 million) and the unrecognised gains on all these options at 31 December 2004, based on the exchange rates on that date, were
£1.1 million (2003: £0.7 million). The Group’s foreign exchange hedging policy is set out in the Financial Review.
During the year forward option contracts selling US Dollars and purchasing Sterling were taken out to cover anticipated US Dollar
currency receipts covering the period January 2005 to August 2005. These totalled £0.9 million and the unrecognised gains on these
options at 31 December 2004, based on the exchange rates on that date, were £nil.
e) Currency profile
The main functional (or “operating’’) currencies of the Group are Sterling, US$ and Euro. The following analysis of net monetary assets
and liabilities, excluding cash and borrowings, shows the Group’s currency exposures after applying the effects of forward contracts used
to manage currency exposure. Such net positions comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in
the functional currency of the operating units involved.

On 30 March 2004 the Group acquired the operating assets and certain liabilities of Charter Broadcast North America Inc., a
provider of broadcast rental equipment in the United States and Canada, for a nominal sum which, with transaction costs,
brought the total acquisition cost to US$0.1 million cash (£0.1 million). Based on a provisional assessment of fair values,
negative goodwill of £0.6 million arose on acquisition.
The acquisition was funded from existing cash resources and has been accounted for using the acquisition method of
accounting.

At 31 December 2004 the Group had the following annual commitments under operating leases
25 Pension commitments
During the year, the Group operated two funded defined benefit pension schemes set up under separate trusts. The Group pays
contributions to the funds in order to provide security for existing pensions and the accrued benefits of current and former
employees. At the end of 2003 the Group closed both schemes to new members, and pension provision for new employees is via
a defined contribution plan. The disclosures below relate to the defined benefit schemes only.
SSAP24
The adequacy of the schemes to meet the projected benefits is assessed by independent qualified actuaries at regular intervals.
The most recent actuarial valuations of the schemes, based on the projected unit method, were as at 5 April 2004. The schemes
had assets with a combined market value (excluding the value of insurance policies) of £28.3 million at that date. On the
assumptions adopted, the value of the schemes’ assets was equal to 94% of the value placed on the accrued benefits assessed
on an ongoing basis allowing for expected future increases in salaries. Under SSAP24 the deficits arising are being spread over
14 years by way of variation from regular cost using the straight-line method.
The most significant actuarial assumptions were: investment return of 7.5% per annum in respect of the period pre-retirement,
and 5.0-5.5% per annum in respect of the period post-retirement; price inflation of 3.0% per annum; general salary inflation of
5.0% per annum and pension increases of 3.0-3.25% per annum.
Company contributions to the schemes amounted to £1.0 million (2003: £0.8 million) for the year. The pension charge for 2004
in respect of these defined benefit schemes is £1.5 million (2003: £0.9 million). There is a prepayment of £0.3 million (2003:
£0.8 million) included in the balance sheet being the excess of the accumulated company pension contributions paid to the
schemes over the amount charged to the profit and loss account.
FRS 17
The disclosures required in relation to the transitional arrangements within FRS 17 ‘Retirement Benefits’ have been based on
the most recent formal actuarial valuation as at 5 April 2004 updated to 31 December 2004, but using the following financial
assumptions for the purpose of FRS 17:
Price inflation 2.8 2.75 2.25
General salary and wage inflation 4.8 4.75 4.25
Increases to pensions in payment (in excess of GMPs) 2.8 2.75 2.25

Vitec Group Executive Pension Scheme include an amount of £0.6 million (2003: £0.5 million) in respect of certain insurance
policies which meet part of the benefit entitlement for some pensioners of the Scheme. The value placed on these insurance
policies is in addition to the value of the Scheme’s investments. The present value of the schemes’ liabilities are derived from
cash flow projections over long time periods and thus are inherently uncertain.

Chairman’s statement
Delivering performance
This has been another year of excellent 
progress for the Group, delivering 
significantly improved financial returns, a 
consistently strong operating performance 
and continuing to invest in a disciplined 
way to underpin future growth. 
It has also been a year of Board changes 
for us, successfully managing the 
succession of David Thomas as our new 
Chief Executive, and the appointment 
of Neil Cooper as Chief Financial 
Officer Designate. 
The market for new homes remains 
strong across Britain, with demand 
continuing to exceed supply. The mortgage 
market has continued to improve both 
in terms of availability and rates, as well 
as Government support for the new 
build market. 
Against this strong market backdrop we 
are delivering ongoing improvements in 
our own performance across all aspects of 
our operations. 
We continue to focus on a rapid asset turn 
business model that is successfully driving 
up returns. 
Our production capability was underlined 
as we increased completions by 11% to 
16,447 during the year, overcoming a 
number of well publicised housing market 
challenges, particularly labour shortages. 
The fact that we delivered our highest 
completion volumes for seven years whilst 
continuing to lead the industry in terms of 
quality and customer service standards, is 
a great testament to the resilience of our 
operating model, our build programme 
and the dedication of our people. 
For the sixth consecutive year over 90% of 
our home buyers would recommend us to 
a friend – an outstanding achievement. 
As a result of the excellent operating 
performance, we were able to increase 
profit before tax by 45% and we finished 
the year with a net cash balance of 
£186.5m. We are well on the way to hitting 
our FY17 targets of a gross margin of at 
least 20%, and a ROCE of at least 25%.

Investing for the future
At the same time as delivering an excellent 
financial performance, we have continued 
to invest for the future. The land market 
has remained attractive in all regions and 
during the year we approved £957m of 
operational land commitments for 16,956 
plots. All of our land approvals continue 
to meet or exceed our investment hurdle 
rates of a 20% gross margin and a 25% 
site ROCE.
During the year we have also made good 
progress in securing a stronger pipeline  
of longer term strategic land. 
Promoting housebuilding
The UK Government recognises the 
importance of additional housing as a 
public policy objective. 
Help to Buy (Equity Loan) in England 
will be continued through to 2020 which 
provides good visibility in terms of our land 
investment strategy. The Government has 
increased it’s land release programme and 
measures to improve the planning system 
are being systematically implemented. 
We will continue to work with the 
Government on their Starter Home 
Scheme that is aimed at supporting 
200,000 homes over the next five years. 
By building more homes we are not only 
helping to address the housing shortage 
but also generating substantial economic 
activity. During the year we estimate that 
we supported 53,000 jobs either directly, 
indirectly or induced. 
Improving returns for our shareholders
The Board is pleased to propose a final 
dividend of 10.3 pence per share (2014: 7.1 
pence per share). Under our Capital Return 
Plan, special cash payments are proposed 
in addition to ordinary dividends with the 
first special cash payment of £100m to be 
paid in November 2015, which equates to 
10.0 pence per share. 
The total proposed capital return for the 
year is therefore 25.1 pence per share 
(2014: 10.3 pence per share).  
Our employees
The outstanding progress made during 
the year would not have been possible 
without the capability and dedication of 
our employees. 
I am delighted that so many of our team 
now share in our success through our 
Share Save scheme. 
Our site managers were awarded 81 NHBC 
Pride in the Job Awards. This is the 11th 
year in succession that we have secured 
more Pride in the Job Awards than any 
other housebuilder. 
We are also reliant for our success on 
over 12,000 subcontractors and suppliers. 
However , a shortage of high quality, skilled 
labour continues to test the industry and 
limit its output. We remain committed to 
investing in the skills and capability of our own 
employees and working with the industry, 
particularly our subcontractors, to address the 
longer term skill shortages the industry faces. 
The Board
During the year there have been a number 
of significant changes to the Board. 
Bob Lawson who led the Group with 
distinction as Chairman for six years 
retired from the Board on 12 November 
2014. We would like to thank him for his 
excellent service. 
Mark Clare, who had been Group Chief 
Executive since 2006, decided that after 
nearly nine years he wished to retire 
from executive life and develop his non-
executive career. The Board is grateful 
to Mark for the legacy he leaves in terms 
of the financial strength and operational 
capability of the Group; we wish him well 
for the future. Mark was succeeded as 
Chief Executive on 1 July 2015 by David 
Thomas, who joined us as Group Finance 
Director in 2009. We were pleased to have 
such a strong successor in place.
Neil Cooper has been appointed to  
succeed David and will join the Board  
on 23 November 2015 as Chief Financial 
Officer (‘CFO’). Neil is currently Group 
Finance Director of William Hill PLC 
and was Group Finance Director of 
Bovis Homes Group PLC from 2007 
until 2010, so he has a strong CFO track 
record as well as good knowledge of the 
housebuilding sector. 
The Board is confident that the Executive 
Directors – David Thomas, Steven Boyes 
and Neil Cooper – supported by an 
exceptional senior management team,  
will lead the Group effectively. 
The future
The market outlook is strong, we 
have a clear strategy in place and the 
management and operational capability 
to continue delivering improved returns. 
We look forward to another year of 
outstanding performance.

Strategic Report
Key aspects of our market
The market for new homes remains strong across 
Britain, with the housing market as a whole being 
characterised by continued demand and under supply.
The UK economy and housing market
The UK economy continued to grow in 
the 12 months to 30 June 2015, with 
most economic indicators showing 
improvements on the prior year. 
The UK housing market has continued 
to show strength with UK residential 
housing transactions for the year to 
30 June 2015 increasing by 1% on the prior 
year to 1.2 million transactions (source: 
HM Revenue & Customs (‘HMRC’)
3
). 
The market for new homes remains strong 
across Britain with the housing market as 
a whole being characterised by continued 
demand and under supply.
Housing supply
The supply of new housing has decreased 
slightly, with 136,320 new housing starts 
in the year to 30 June 2015 in England, a 
decrease of 1% on the prior year (source: 
Department for Communities and Local 
Government (‘DCLG’)), although housing 
completions were up 15% on the previous 
year to 131,060 (2014: 114,060)
1
. Whilst this 
represents a positive move, new housing 
starts remain over 40,000 lower than 
the pre-downturn peak and significantly 
lower than that required to meet demand. 
DCLG estimates that 221,000 homes need 
to be built per annum until 2021 to meet 
the demand from new household creation. 
Obtaining planning permission continues 
to be a constraint for new build 
developments. A number of amendments 
have been made to the planning system 
in recent years, with an increase of 15% in 
planning approvals to 227,374 in the year to 
March 2015 across Great Britain (source: 
Home Builders Federation (‘HBF’)
4
).
Help to Buy and mortgage availability
Help to Buy (Equity Loan) continues 
to be an important enabler for new 
housebuilding, supporting 22,222 
purchases in England in the ten months 
to April 2015 with 78% of purchasers 
using the scheme being first time buyers 
(source: DCLG). However, the scheme 
has had a limited impact on the wider 
housing market in the UK as it represented 
only 2.6%
5
 of HMRC residential housing 
transactions in England for the 
same period. 
Average quoted household interest rates 
remain at affordable levels and mortgage 
transaction volumes have remained 
broadly constant over the last year. 
The number of mortgage approvals for 
house purchases fell by 5% to 756,540

House prices
The shortfall in the supply of housing 
stock and a continued availability of 
mortgage finance at low interest rates 
meant that house prices rose in the year. 
The ONS house price index rose by an 
average of 5.7% per annum across the 
UK in the year to June 2015
7
. The increase 
was particularly marked in the East and 
the South East of England, where the 
ONS house price index rose by 9.2% and 
7.7% respectively in the year to June 
2015. Outside of London and the South 
East, the ONS house price index rose by 
5.2%. According to the Halifax, the UK 
average house price in June 2015 was 
£200,280, which was £17,100 higher than at 
June 2014.
Housing outlook
The underlying demand for new housing 
is expected to remain strong as supply is 
unlikely to meet demand in the medium 
term. We are committed to do our part to 
help address the existing undersupply in 
the market. 
The Government is committed to 
increasing the supply of new homes, we 
have greater clarity on housing policy, and 
in particular believe the extension of the 
Help to Buy (Equity Loan) scheme through 
to 2020 in England will support an increase 
in new housing supply.

Our results 
This has been another very successful financial year for the Group and we have delivered 
strong improvement across all our key financial metrics.
We increased profit before tax by 44.8% to £565.5m and our operating margin improved 
by 230 basis points to 15.3%. ROCE was up by 440 basis points to 23.9% as we continued

Our businesses
Our improved financial results have 
been driven by a strong and disciplined 
operational performance in both 
our housebuilding and commercial 
developments businesses. 
Housebuilding
With a good level of demand for new 
homes across all six of our operating 
regions, our housebuilding business has 
focused on optimising sales volumes, 
getting the best prices for the homes 
we build, thereby driving financial 
performance. The sales rate for the 
year was 0.64 (2014: 0.69) net private 
reservations per active site per week, 
with a sales rate in the second half of 0.70 
(2014: 0.71) net private reservations per 
active site per week.
There was strength across all regional 
markets, and in particular our Northern 
region delivered a year on year uplift in 
sales rate in the second half, despite a 
strong prior year performance. 
We achieved a significant uplift in the 
rate of new site openings in the financial 
year. In total, the Group launched 176 
(2014: 136) new developments including 
JV’s and at 30 June was operating from 
9% more sites with 399 (2014: 366) active 
sites (including JV’s). Looking ahead, we 
expect to see further controlled growth in 
site numbers in FY16 of around 3%.
Completions for the full year including 
JV’s were up 11% at 16,447 (2014: 14,838). 
Private completions increased by 7% 
to 12,746 (2014: 11,936), affordable 
completions were 2,853 (2014: 2,255), 
and JV completions in which the Group 
had an interest were 848 (2014: 647). 
This represents our highest level of 
completions in seven years, and Barratt 
London completed a record volume of 
1,965 units including JV’s. 
We continue to increase the proportion 
of completions that are on more recently 
acquired higher margin land and these 
accounted for 76% (2014: 65%) of the total 
in the year. We have also continued to 
take advantage of the stronger market 
conditions to increase the rate of sale on 
older lower margin sites. This will bring 
forward our exit from these sites and help 
to drive up returns in the medium term. 
Help to Buy (Equity Loan) has provided 
a very attractive opportunity for our 
customers, especially for first time buyers. 
During the year 31% (2014: 31%) of our 
total completions (excluding JV’s) used the 
scheme. The contribution from investor 
sales, which are predominantly in our 
London region, fell slightly in the year to 
11% (2014: 12%) of total completions.
Our total average selling price 
(‘ASP’) increased by 7% to £235,000 
(2014: £219,900) in the financial year 
with our private average selling 
price increasing by 9% to £262,500 
(2014: £241,600). This year on year 
increase reflects both further mix changes 
and underlying house price inflation. 
We expect to see some further increase 
in ASP driven by changes in mix in FY16, 
with the total ASP in our owned land bank 
increasing to £252,000 as at 30 June 2015 
(2014: £227,000).
Affordable average selling price increased 
by 7% to £112,300 (2014: £105,300) 
reflecting changes in mix, with affordable 
completions increasing to 18% (2014: 16%) 
of total completions.
Our JV’s have performed well and our 
share of profits from JV’s in FY15 for 
the housebuilding business increased 
to £45.6m (2014: £40.8m). As at 30 June 
2015 we were selling from 16 (2014: 8) JV 
sites and expect the share of profits from 
JV’s to increase to around £60m in FY16. 
For our London region, the proportion of 
completions from JV sites versus non-JV 
sites is expected to increase significantly in 
FY16, in particular driven by completions 
from Fulham Riverside in Fulham, Enderby 
Wharf in Greenwich and Nine Elms Point 
in Vauxhall.
Targeted land buying
A key driver of the transformation of our 
business in recent years has been our 
land investment strategy. Since 2009 
we have approved the investment of 
£4.8bn in land for new homes and this 
has boosted returns and led to increased 
completion volumes.
During the year conditions in the land 
market remained encouraging in terms 
of the availability of attractive high return 
sites across all regions. We successfully 
continued our investment strategy of 
targeting high quality operational land 
that meets or exceeds our minimum 
hurdle rates set on acquisition; a 20% 
gross margin and a 25% site ROCE. In the 
year we committed to land expenditure of 
£957.0m (2014: £1,198.1m) covering 16,956 
plots (2014: 21,478 plots), the appropriate 
level to maintain our controlled land bank 
at our target of c. 4.5 years. As at 30 June 
2015 our owned and controlled land bank 
stood at 70,523 plots equating to 4.5 years 
of production.

Fulham Riverside,  
a development of 472 flats

Public land remains an excellent source of 
land for the Group. The Government has 
increased its commitment to releasing 
public sector land with 150,000 plots to be 
delivered by 2020. In the more competitive 
South East and London land markets, 
public land is an important alternative 
source of land supply. Barratt is very well 
positioned to maximise this opportunity 
with our unique public sector land team 
and membership of all HCA Delivery 
Partner Panels. We have the expertise 
and the capability to secure and deliver 
what are often large and highly complex 
developments. Our track record 
demonstrates this with 70% of bids 
won over the past year. Our public land 
developments achieve at least 20% hurdle 
rate gross margin with ROCE generally 
significantly higher than our 25% hurdle 
rate, reflecting the attractive deferred 
payment terms often available.
As we progress the transformation of 
our operational land bank, the Group is 
focused on securing our longer term land 
supply. Through the acquisition of options 
over strategic land we are focused on 
securing our land pipeline out to 2020 and 
beyond, whilst minimising risk and capital 
employed. We made further good progress 
in the year, with a strategic portfolio of 
71,600 plots (2014: 69,200 plots) equating 
to 284 sites (2014: 260 sites). We have 
seen a significant step up in the delivery 
of strategic land, with 17% (2014: 10%) of 
total completions being delivered from 
strategically sourced land in the year, 
progressing towards our target of 20% 
in FY17.
We have been encouraged by the capability 
of our business to bring forward land 
through the planning system within the 
context of the National Planning Policy 
Framework. We now have full or outline 
planning permission in place for all of our 
expected completions in FY16 and 89% of 
expected production in FY17. 
Improving efficiency and reducing costs
Improving the efficiency of our operations 
and controlling costs has continued to be a 
high priority for the Group in a recovering 
market. We are pleased that overall build 
cost inflation for FY15 has been limited to 
c. 3.5%, in line with expectations, and for 
FY16 we expect build costs to increase by a 
similar amount. 
We have a robust and carefully managed 
supply chain with 85% of our build 
materials sourced through our centralised 
procurement function. We have effectively 
sourced the raw materials required to 
underpin our controlled volume growth 
and over 90% of our material costs are 
now fixed until the end of FY16. 
On labour, whilst we have seen an increase 
in the supply of skilled subcontractors 
over the past year, there remains an 
industry shortage, with increases in 
labour costs remaining the largest driver 
of overall build cost inflation. We are 
well placed and continue to have the 
necessary labour to meet our operational 
and quality requirements. We are also 
seeking to increase efficiency through 
the use of timber frame on some of our 
sites and the use of alternative off-site 
manufacturing options, including closed 
panel roof solutions.  
More generally on costs, we have 
continued to focus on the broader 
efficiency of our business with process 
reviews being undertaken in the areas of 
commercial, sales and marketing. 
Commercial developments
Outside London and the South East, the 
commercial occupier market is showing 
signs of increasing confidence. Since the 
downturn, demand has been mainly 
satisfied by the availability of second-hand 
space and with this accommodation now 
largely filled, occupiers have turned their 
attention to new commercial build. This is 
presenting cost challenges as a result 
of the reduction in construction capacity 
following the downturn.  Barratt Developments PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
15
Strategic Report Governance Other Information Financial Statements
Demand is currently driven by 
e-commerce logistics requirements 
and in the last 12 months we have seen 
the return of institutional funding to 
this sector. We have used institutional 
funding for 600,000 sq. ft. of logistics 
buildings, with a further 200,000 sq. ft. 
in the immediate pipeline. Wilson Bowden 
Developments is also now focusing 
on mixed use residential and leisure 
schemes, such as in Hounslow, where 
together with Barratt London, it has 
entered into a conditional contract with 
the Local Authority to deliver 120,000 sq. 
ft. of commercial leisure facilities and 
530 flats.
Commercial development revenue was 
£57.2m (2014: £14.4m) with an operating 
profit of £6.1m (2014: loss of £1.0m). 
Our Hinckley scheme, which comprises 
200,000 sq. ft. of retail and leisure space, 
achieved completion of the foodstore 
element during the year with full project 
completion due in FY16 along with our 
Derby development, which comprises a 
hotel and 46 flats. 
Going forward our commercial division 
will work closely with our housebuilding 
business to develop mixed-use schemes, 
and will seek to develop independent 
commercial schemes where they can 
be forward funded by third parties prior 
to commencement.
Our objectives
Our strategic objectives remain clear – to 
continue to build the Group’s profitability, 
drive return on capital employed and 
maintain an appropriate capital structure, 
whilst offering attractive cash returns to 
our shareholders. 
We have made further good progress 
against these objectives in the year with 
gross margin increasing by 220 basis 
points to 19.0% (2014: 16.8%) and ROCE 
increasing by 440 basis points to 23.9% 
(2014: 19.5%). The Group ended the year 
with net cash of £186.5m (2014: net 
cash £73.1m) and land creditors at 35% 
(2014: 33%) of the owned land bank.
We continue to make very good progress 
towards achieving our FY17 targets of at 
least 20% gross margin and at least 25% 
ROCE and are committed to delivering 
them as early as possible. In particular, 
the run-down of the Group’s low or 
zero margin legacy assets will drive 
improvements in ROCE.
This strong financial performance 
supports the Group’s Capital Return Plan 
and dividend policy. We are delighted to 
propose a final dividend of 10.3 pence 
per share (2014: 7.1 pence per share) 
resulting in a total ordinary dividend 
for the year up 46.6% to 15.1 pence per 
share (2014: 10.3 pence per share) and 
the first of our special cash payments 
totalling £100m, equivalent to 10.0 pence 
per share, payable in November 2015. 
This reflects our ordinary dividend policy 
of the dividend being covered three times 
by earnings, supplemented by the special 
cash payments to November 2017 totalling 
£400m.
Health and safety
Increased activity levels across the industry 
in terms of site openings and production 
volumes combined with shortages of skilled 
staff has increased the risks of accidents on 
sites. In the twelve months to 30 June 2015 
we had 381 (2014: 379) reportable incidents 
per 100,000 employees. We remain focused 
on continuing to enhance health and 
safety performance across our business. 
We have established a Board level Safety, 
Health and Environment Committee in the 
year, had our safety management status 
independently assessed by the British 
Safety Council which awarded us five star 
status, and introduced a number of new 
initiatives including our ‘Five Steps to Safety’ 
programme to promote the importance  
of a safe working environment.
Our priorities 
To continue to deliver leading financial 
performance and maximise sustainable 
returns for our shareholders by focusing 
upon our clear set of priorities – Customer 
First, Great Places, Leading Construction 
and Investing in our People. 
Each of these priorities has a work 
plan to drive improvements across the 
business and they are supported by 
a set of principles that underpin all of 
our operations. 
Customer first
We place customers at the heart of our 
business by building outstanding homes 
and anticipating the changing needs of 
home buyers. 
We are the only major national 
housebuilder to achieve the Home Builders 
Federation Five Star quality status for 
six consecutive years, with over 90% of 
customers being prepared to recommend 
us to a friend. 
We are continuing to improve the quality 
and efficiency of the way in which we deal 
with customers through the sales process. 
During the year new customer service 
systems were rolled out to divisions to 
speed up and improve the efficiency of our 
service and a new customer contact centre 
was put in place. 
We have introduced a ‘Future Homes’ 
project to inform design direction in terms 
of customer trends and preferences. 
As well as carefully defining customer 
segments and their design preferences, 
we are working with The Architects’ 
Journal to select new house design 
features to meet these requirements. 
Great places
A key focus of the organisation continues to 
be building relationships with landowners 
to ensure that we can acquire the right 
land and then create outstanding places 
to live. Our objective is to be the partner of 
choice for landowners by demonstrating 
our ability to achieve planning permission 
and create value. 
During the year we made significant 
progress in terms of securing the right 
operational land, continued our success in 
winning public sector land and increased 
investment in longer term strategic sites.
We are now using the Design Council/
CABE Building for Life process extensively 
and are winning more design awards than 
any other major housebuilder. We have 
now achieved Building for Life awards on 
33 sites.  Barratt Developments PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2015

Strategic Report – Chief Executive’s statement continued
Leading construction 
We are focused on a ‘right first time’ 
approach as the most efficient way 
of operating across all aspects of our 
building processes with a continuous 
focus on improving build quality. 
During the year we analysed thousands 
of comments from our customers and 
used them to identify where we needed to 
enhance the quality of some components. 
This ‘ getting it right first time’ approach 
will drive improved efficiency through 
reducing remedial costs and improve 
customer satisfaction. 
We are implementing a number of  
quick wins in terms of lowering build 
costs, for example we expect to build  
c. 1,300 timber frame homes in FY16. 
Other innovations in the build process 
implemented during the year include  
new roofing and flooring solutions  
and we have started to trial other  
new products having assessed over  
100 off-site construction suppliers. 
We are also looking to embrace the best 
methods of on and off-site construction  
to increase efficiency.
Our site managers continue to lead  
the industry and during the year we  
won 81 NHBC Pride in the Job awards. 
This was the 11
th
 year in succession that 
our site managers have won more of 
these awards than any other company. 
Investing in our people
The building and construction industry 
continues to face a shortage of skilled 
workers and attracting and retaining the 
best people is an important priority for 
the business. We aim to have a diverse 
workforce that reflects the communities in 
which we operate, delivering excellence for 
our customers and business by drawing on a 
diverse range of talent, skills and experience.  
We have continued with our graduate 
and apprentice programmes and have 
recruited our largest ever intake of future 
talent. In addition, we have trained or 
are training 60 employees through our 
Foundation Degree Programme with 
Sheffield Hallam University. 
We are piloting a Regional Academy in 
our East region targeting a wider mix of 
potential employees and are continuing 
to support the wider industry focus on 
addressing the skills shortage. 
Current trading
The sales performance across the Group 
has been strong for the first 10 weeks 
of FY16, with net private reservations 
per week of 257 (FY15: 224), resulting in 
average net private reservations per active 
site per week of 0.68 (FY15: 0.62). 
Our total forward sales (including JV’s) 
as at 6 September 2015 were up 32.2% on 
the strong prior year figures at a value of 
£2,321.9m (7 September 2014: £1,755.7m), 
equating to 10,755 plots (7 September 
2014: 8,507 plots).
We expect FY 16 full year completion 
volumes for the Group to be around 
15,750, plus around 1,000 completions 
delivered through our JV portfolio giving 
total completions of around 16,750 
(FY15: 16,447) in line with our target of 
controlled volume growth.

Outlook
The fundamentals for the market 
remain very positive with strong 
demand for new housing across Britain. 
The lending environment is supportive 
with the borrowing rates on offer to our 
customers remaining at extremely low 
levels. The Government is committed to 
increasing the supply of new homes, we 
have greater clarity on housing policy, 
and in particular believe the extension 
of the Help to Buy (Equity Loan) Scheme 
through to 2020 in England will support an 
increase in new housing supply. The land 
market remains attractive and we continue 
to secure excellent new development 
opportunities across all regions that at 
least meet our minimum hurdle rates.
I am proud to lead our first class team 
and we are all determined to build 
on our outstanding operational and 
financial performance and to drive 
further efficiencies across the business. 
Current trading is strong, we are confident 
on the outlook, and expect to make further 
good progress in the current financial year.

growing demand in the market and 
continued undersupply of new homes. 
Home buyers are supported by an 
improving mortgage market in terms of 
both availability and rates, as well as the 
Government’s Help to Buy (Equity Loan) 
scheme in England. 
The industry is seeking to increase 
volumes, maintain customer satisfaction 
and build quality and at the same time 
address the constraint created by a 
shortage of skilled people. 
Affordability of homes and 
accessibility to home ownership
We build a wide range of product, 
from homes for first time buyers 
to larger family homes. Our private 
average selling price for the year was 
£262,500 (2014: £241,600); £246,800 
(2014: £222,200) outside of London. 
During the year the mortgage market has 
remained positive. Our customers have 
access to mortgage finance that allows 
them to buy with a 5% deposit in England 
through the Help to Buy (Equity Loan) 
scheme and there is also an increase in 
the range of higher loan to value products 
which do not use the Help to Buy scheme 
available. We continue to work with a 
broad set of lenders through our approved 
brokers to ensure that our customers have 
access to independent advice and a wide 
range of mortgage products. 
We delivered 2,853 (2014: 2,255)
affordable homes built for registered 
providers, equating to 18% (2014: 16%) of 
our total completions in the year. We have 
a team which engages with housing 
association partners at local, regional 
and national levels.

Customer satisfaction 
We place customers at the heart of 
everything we do, with their satisfaction 
being a key performance indicator at all 
levels of management. All of our team 
are responsible for delivering customer 
satisfaction and we have developed a 
Customer Service Academy comprising 
both classroom and online training to 
ensure that our employees understand 
how to deliver right first time, every 
time. During the year, 513 employees 
have participated in this programme. 
We have also launched a new Code 
of Conduct for our subcontractors to 
support customer satisfaction. 
We are pleased that we have increased 
our completions delivery, including 
JV’s, by 11% during the year whilst 
retaining our HBF 5 Star status for the 
sixth successive year, the only national 
housebuilder to do so. We regularly 
review the results from the NHBC 
customer survey with the insights gained 
being used to aid our decision making. 
We continue to drive customer 
service, investing in technology from 
developments to our customer service 
systems and our onsite systems to aid our 
quality control inspections. Each home we 
build is repeatedly inspected at key stages 
and, as a minimum, is approved by the site 
manager, contracts manager and sales 
staff before handover to our customers. 
Management throughout the business 
are responsible for customer service and 
monitor customer satisfaction survey 
performance on a weekly basis.
Increasing customer insight
To ensure that we continuously reflect our 
customers’ needs we have undertaken 
customer research in a number of areas 
during the year including demographics 
and home design. In response to our 
research we have launched a downsizer 
range to meet the needs of older property 
owners approaching retirement. We are 
considering current and future trends 
in home design to influence our design 
strategy and have also conducted a 
competition for architects with The 
Architects’ Journal to design future 
features for our homes.

Our success in buying land is based on 
the extensive local knowledge of our 
divisional land teams and strong local 
relationships with land owners, combined 
with detailed assessments of local market 
conditions. We target locations based on 
the availability of land, housing market 
conditions and the likelihood of obtaining 
planning consent.
We continue to target a regionally balanced 
land portfolio with a supply of owned and 
controlled land of approximately 4.5 years. 
As at 30 June 2015, we achieved our target 
with a 4.5 year land supply (excluding JV’s) 
comprising 3.3 years of owned land, and 
1.2 years of conditionally contracted land.

Our land bank
The transformation of our land bank 
from older low margin land to more 
recently acquired high margin land is 
well progressed. As at 30 June 2015, 
90% (2014: 84%) of our owned and 
controlled land is high margin, newer 
land. On sites completed to date that 
were acquired since 2009 we have 
generated a gross margin of 21% 
and a 38% site ROCE, demonstrating 
sustained delivery above our hurdle 
rates upon more recently acquired land. 
Whilst maintaining a first class 
operational land bank, we are also 
focused on securing a longer term 
land pipeline, in particular through the 
acquisition of options over strategic land. 
In the year, 5,239 plots (2014: 5,205 plots) 
were transferred from strategic land to 
our owned land bank. With 17% of FY15 
completions from strategically sourced 
land, we are on track to deliver our 
target of c. 20% of our completions to be 
delivered from strategic land in FY17. 
We use land creditors to defer payments 
for land acquisition where possible to 
drive a higher ROCE and as at 30 June 
2015, the land creditor position totalled 
£999.0m (30 June 2014: £779.4m) 
representing 35% (30 June 2014: 33%) of 
the owned land bank. We are targeting 
land creditors at around one third of the 
owned land bank for FY16. 
Effective planning permission
An important part of bringing land into 
production is the planning process. 
Following the implementation of the 
Government’s National Planning Policy 
Framework, we welcome the further 
measures put in place to ensure local 
authorities have a five-year land supply. 
This is leading to an improved dialogue 
between local authorities and our 
divisions. Nevertheless, the planning 
process remains a lengthy one and 
affects the speed at which housing supply 
can increase.
We have maintained good momentum in 
achieving planning consents, and during 
the year we secured planning on 17,092 
plots (2014: 21,004 plots). We now have full 
or outline planning permission in place 
for all of our expected completions in FY16 
and 89% of expected production in FY17.

developers who leave behind a legacy 
of design quality; and local people 
want developments that enhance their 
communities. We are focused upon 
placemaking throughout our business and 
use the Design Council/CABE Building 
for Life process in the design of all new 
developments, as well as our internal 
‘Great Places’ guidance and the expertise 
of our urban design team. We also review 
our development layouts to ensure they 
achieve both design quality and efficient

The challenge
The housing shortage has increased 
demand for the building of new homes, 
which has resulted in pressures upon 
the availability of materials and skilled 
labour and subcontractors. 
Delivering high quality homes
We put customer satisfaction at the 
heart of our construction processes with 
a focus upon getting it right first time, 
which also drives operating efficiencies 
in the build process. Our site managers 
continue to lead the industry, winning 81 
NHBC Pride in the Job Awards. This is 
the 11
th
 consecutive year that we have 
won more of these awards than any 
other housebuilder. 
Partnering with our supply chain
We have a centralised procurement 
team which has built long term 
relationships with our suppliers. 
This ensures the consistency of 
specification and technical performance 
of the materials used in our homes. 
Long term relationships have enabled 
us to ensure the continuous availability 
of materials as demand increased. 
We also use many local subcontractors 
in the construction of our homes, who 
our divisions partner with at a local level 
to ensure the availability of the skilled 
trades that we require.
We engage in continuous communication 
with our suppliers and hold regular 
performance and business reviews, 
training days and an annual supplier 
conference. We are a signatory of the 
Prompt Payment Code. 
We purchase substantial amounts 
of timber and have implemented a 
sustainable procurement and timber 
sourcing policy. Since December 2013,  
all timber and timber products that we  
use are FSC/PEFC certified and 
originate from well managed 
forestry sources.

Innovating to improve efficiency
We constantly review the latest 
available technologies to assist us 
in meeting evolving regulations, 
increases in predicted demand and 
material availability. 
The majority of our homes are built with 
traditional brick and block construction, 
although we are increasing the use of 
timber frame on some of our sites and 
expect to build c. 1,300 homes using this 
method during FY16. 
To increase efficiency we are also 
looking to embrace new construction 
methods and have assessed over 100 
off-site suppliers. An example of an 
innovation in the build process that we 
have implemented during the year is the 
use of closed panel roofs to replace attic 
trusses or traditional trusses on some 
sites. These have a number of benefits:
 > Health and safety – the amount 
of work carried out at height is 
significantly reduced;
 > Efficiency – the process reduces waste 
generated on site, helps to reduce 
on site traffic movements and is less 
impacted by inclement weather;
 > Speed – taking a roof from wall plate 
to watertight will generally take 
a day compared to a week using 
traditional means;
 > Quality – factory controlled quality 
assurance; and 
 > Extra floor space – additional space 
is created. 
We have engaged with our suppliers to 
find, understand and consider innovative 
products and services from across the 
supply chain. 
We are also researching smart 
technologies and their use in future 
homes to improve the ability of 
customers to save energy and are 
currently undertaking divisional pilots 
of smart thermostats, which give 
customers the ability to remotely control 
their heating systems.

The challenge
The building and construction industry 
continues to face a shortage of skilled 
workers and attracting and retaining 
the best people is a key priority for 
our business. 
Attracting people to our industry
Together with other housebuilders 
we are working with the HBF and the 
Construction Industry Training Board to 
improve the image of housebuilding as 
a career choice and promote the career 
opportunities in the sector through the 
recruitment of experienced workers, 
targeted online resources, a regional 
academy pilot and by becoming a patron of 
the West Midlands Construction Industry 
University Technical College. 
Employee retention
During the year staff turnover increased 
to 19% (2014: 16%) reflecting the 
demand and opportunities for skilled 
employees. We therefore continue to 
focus upon developing talent within our 
business, including succession planning, 
to ensure that we have the necessary 
skills within our business for continued 
operational delivery. 
Developing talent
We are committed to the development of 
our people and assisting in increasing the 
housebuilding skills base in order to drive 
our success. We offer both vocational 
and leadership training programmes, 
as well as in-house schemes promoting 
employee development, engagement 
and recognition.
The Barratt Academy continues to 
provide structured, bespoke training to 
support individual development across 
three separate disciplines; apprentices, 
site managers and technical/commercial 
roles. Courses combine professional 
training (on site and in the classroom) 
with industry recognised qualifications.
We continue to invest in and develop our 
‘Future Talent’ strategy. In February 2014, 
we targeted the recruitment of 1,100 
graduates, apprentices and paid interns 
over three years. Whilst we have not yet 
achieved this target, we have made good 
progress having recruited 792 including 
those who will join us during FY16.
Our apprentice scheme was externally 
recognised through the award of the 
2014 National Apprenticeship scheme BT

in 2014. 
We offer a number of entry level 
programmes in addition to our award 
winning graduate and apprentice 
programmes. Our paid undergraduate 
internship programme supports 
students studying relevant degrees 
through a 48-week industrial 
placement. During the programme, 
interns complete ‘mini rotations’ 
to learn about our business before 
specialising in one area for the 
remainder of the year. Those who 
perform well are offered a permanent 
position with us upon completion of 
their degree. 
We also have ‘accelerated programmes’ 
in sales or construction for graduates 
who want to fast-track their learning in 
a job role, with the aim of progressing 
through to management positions in 
the future. 
Engaging our people
As a business we believe that an engaged 
workforce is critical to our success. 
We conduct an annual employee 
engagement survey in order to gain 
valuable insight into how our people feel 
about working for us. We are delighted 
that in our annual employee engagement 
survey we achieved our upper quartile 
target with an index of 78%, which is 
above the UK employers’ norm of 72%. 
We develop and implement action plans 
following each survey to strengthen our 
business and to continue our position of 
being an employer of choice. 
We have a ‘Get Recognised’ programme 
which allows our people to be rewarded 
by colleagues for a job well done 
with instant awards of £100 cash or a 
days holiday. We also recognise the 
outstanding contributions of our people 
through quarterly awards for sales staff, 
apprentices and site managers as well as 
via individual and team excellence awards. 
Around 1,000 awards were made through 
these schemes in the last year.
Diversity and inclusion
We are committed to providing an inclusive 
working environment where everyone 
feels valued and respected. We aim to 
have a diverse workforce that reflects 
the communities in which we operate, 
delivering excellence for our customers 
and business by drawing on a diverse 
range of talents, skills and experience.

increased applications from, and the 
recruitment of, a more diverse workforce

year to help increase the diversity of 
our people.

The challenge and our response
Increased activity levels across the 
industry in terms of both site openings 
and production volumes combined with 
shortages of skilled staff has increased 
the risks of accidents on sites. We seek to 
maintain stringent safety standards and 
a continuous focus on health and safety 
issues. Getting the basics right, good 
leadership, and commitment to health 
and safety from all levels of management 
is what delivers good health and safety 
performance in our business. In order 
to enhance the leadership of health 
and safety in our business, a Board 
level Safety, Health and Environmental 
Committee was established in July 2014. 
Our Safety, Health and Environmental 
management system (‘SHE’) is subject 
to continuous review and improvement. 
All of our trading divisions are certified 
to OHSAS 18001 and adhere to our SHE 
guidelines with their ongoing compliance 
being verified by a programme of 
internal and external audits. During the 
year, we carried out 6,269 (2014: 5,788) 
monitoring visits and achieved an average 
compliance rate of 96% (2014: 96%).
Our overall aim is to have an injury free 
working environment, and whilst we 
believe that all injuries are avoidable, 
our objective for the year was to have 
an improvement in our reportable 
Injury Incidence Rate (‘IIR’). During the 
year, our IIR increased by 1% to 381 
(2014: 379) per 100,000 persons employed 
(including subcontractors). Whilst we are 
disappointed that our IIR has not reduced 
during the year, we have continued to 
introduce new initiatives to improve our 
health and safety performance including 
a ‘Five Steps to Safety’ programme for 
site workers. We also engaged the British 
Safety Council to conduct an Occupational 
Health and Safety Audit during the year, 
and following this we were awarded five 
star status. This audit highlighted the 
importance of a proactive approach to 
safety management and encouraging 
the promotion of outstanding individual 
site initiatives.

business partnerships with landowners, 
suppliers and subcontractors, is critical 
to our success. 
We continue to work with private 
landowners, operators and agents 
to identify and bring forward land for 
development. Divisional land teams 
continue to work hard to try and ensure 
we are regarded as the housebuilder 
of choice by the local landowning and 
agency community. 
We also form long term partnerships 
with the public sector and work to unlock 
challenging sites by finding solutions, 
sharing best practice and transferring 
knowledge. We have worked extensively 
with the Homes & Communities Agency 
(‘HCA’) and Greater London Authority 
(‘GLA’) to deliver new housing. In the 
period 2011-2015, we approved purchases 
of 22 sites from the HCA and GLA, which 
will accommodate c. 3,800 homes with a 
development value of c. £1.0bn.  
We have also acquired sites from many 
other Government departments, local 
authorities and NHS bodies. This year, 
3,950, 25% (2014: 3,928, 28%) of our 
housing completions were developed 
on public land. We have 5,113 plots 
(2014: 3,913) approved for purchase, 
representing a development value of  
c. £1.3bn (2014: c. £1.0bn). 
Our suppliers and subcontractors 
are critical to the delivery of our 
strategic objectives and we invest in 
our relationships with them. We hold 
a national supply chain conference 
and regular review meetings with our 
suppliers and seek to develop long term 
business relationships. We also work with 
our suppliers to help them to introduce 
the new technologies that we need to 
meet increasingly challenging building 
standards, and with our subcontractors to 
help them to improve their environmental 
and safety performance.
We build meaningful, long term 
relationships that make us the developer 
of choice for our partners. We are 
innovating with our supply chain to drive 
efficiency and meet our customers’ needs.

Strategic Report – Our principles continued
Building strong community relationships
We engage fully with local communities 
and customers when creating new 
developments. We seek to ensure that 
our work creates a positive legacy that 
helps local communities to thrive.
 > Estimated that our activities support 
around 53,000 jobs directly, indirectly or 
induced in the economy
 > Work closely with local authorities
 > Actively engage with local communities
The challenge and our response
Housebuilding has a direct impact 
upon local communities. It is therefore 
important that they are engaged in 
the creation process and that our 
development creates a positive legacy.
As a Group we contribute social and 
economic benefits to the communities 
in which we are working, which are far 
reaching and long lasting. By building 
more homes we are generating 
substantial amounts of economic activity 
and we estimate that during the year 
we supported around 53,000 jobs either 
directly, indirectly or induced. 
We work closely with local planning 
authorities to negotiate and deliver 
or fund social infrastructure such 
as highways and public transport 
improvements, new schools and 
school places, sports facilities and 
medical centres. 
Engagement with local communities 
to seek to address any impact that 
our developments may have on 
the environment is also important. 
By holding public consultations, 
we invite stakeholders to talk to our 
specialist planners and architects 
about their concerns and aspirations 
for our developments. We believe that 
a genuinely collaborative approach will 
deliver more land and housing. 54% 
(2014: 46%) of our active developments 
have held a public consultation.
Our research shows that homeowners 
in new build developments are more 
likely to socialise with their neighbours. 
We therefore support a range of local 
initiatives, community websites and 
resident days to strengthen these links 
on our developments and help members 
of new communities to get to know 
each other. 
We continue to support and promote 
a wide range of charitable giving and 
community volunteering initiatives with 
each division focusing on the charitable 
activities that best reflect the needs of 
their local community and the issues 
that impact upon their employees. 
Our graduates actively engage with 
communities across the UK through 
the Prince’s Trust and for the second 
consecutive year they have won the 
Million Makers award for innovation and 
entrepreneurship with their initiative to 
produce a ‘Building Careers Workshop’.

Safeguarding the environment
The challenges and our responses
Increasing the energy efficiency of the 
homes we build
We are committed to delivering 
energy efficient homes that are both 
economically and environmentally 
sustainable, providing real benefits 
to our customers and the community. 
During the year, we have continued to 
develop the sustainability features of our 
homes and developments. Our strategy 
for delivery remains ‘Fabric First, Fit 
and Forget’, minimising the need for 
complicated renewable technologies and 
helping our customers experience the 
benefits of energy and water efficiency 
with minimal complexities. 
Minimising our environmental impact
We seek to minimise the environmental 
impact of our operations by using 
resources efficiently and reducing 
waste and carbon in our construction 
processes. This year we have focused 
upon the waste and energy performance 
of our divisions with divisional 
sustainability action plans being created. 
We segregate waste for recycling as 
standard across our sites and have 
achieved a recycling rate of  
95% (2014: 94%) for the year. We remain 
focused on the quantity of waste 
generated, which disappointingly has 
increased to 6.63 tonnes (2014: 6.39 
tonnes) per legal completion this year. 
We have also developed a cross discipline 
Waste Reduction Plan to seek to reduce 
waste and are reviewing our waste policy. 
Our direct and indirect operational 
greenhouse gas emissions are shown 
in the table below. This is based on the 
energy used in our offices, on our live 
developments and for business travel.

Our operational greenhouse gas emissions 
per 1,000 sq. ft. have reduced to 2.36 
(2014: 2.78) tonnes of emissions per 1,000 
sq. ft. this year. We continue to drive 
awareness and seek to improve energy 
and greenhouse gas performance across 
our business.
Enhancing habitats, biodiversity 
and local environments across our 
developments
During the year we built 57% (2014: 63%) of 
our homes on brownfield sites. 
We have recruited a biodiversity adviser 
as part of our national partnership 
with the RSPB, the UK’s largest nature 
conservation charity. We have revised our 
internal landscape design guidance and 
our ‘Great Places’ guide for our operating 
divisions with ecology and biodiversity 
at its core, to help ensure that they are 
considered from project inception through 
to completion. During the year within our 
developments, 634 (2014: 611) hectares 
of open space were created and 554,819 
(2014: 866,819) trees or shrubs were 
planted or retained.
We strive to minimise the environmental 
impact of our operations and supply 
chain, which increases the energy 
and resource efficiency of our homes. 
We seek to enhance habitats, biodiversity 
and local environments across all of 
our developments.

Our performance
We aim to deliver sustainable shareholder 
value through the implementation of 
our priorities and the delivery of our key 
financial objectives of building the Group’s 
profitability, driving return on capital 
employed and maintaining an appropriate 
capital structure. We have made 
significant progress on these objectives 
during the year, achieving a 220 basis 
points increase in gross margin,  
a 44.8% increase in profit before tax  
and a 440 basis points improvement  
in ROCE to 23.9%. 
Profit for the year
The improved performance in both 
our housebuilding and commercial 
developments businesses resulted 
in an operating profit of £576.8m 
(2014: £409.8m) at an operating margin 
of 15.3% (2014: 13.0%).
The finance charge for the year was 
£57.0m (2014: £59.7m), consisting 
of a cash finance charge of £27.4m 
(2014: £26.7m) and £29.6m (2014: £33.0m) 
of non-cash charges.
a Our strategy
a KPI
a Key highlights
Profit before tax for the year was £565.5m 
(2014: £390.6m), the highest profit the 
Group has ever achieved. The increase 
of £174.9m was driven by increased 
completion volumes, a greater proportion 
of completions from more recently 
acquired land and some underlying house 
price inflation.
The tax charge for the year was £115.2m 
(2014: £85.2m). The rate of tax assessed 
for the year is slightly below the standard 
effective rate of corporation tax at 20.75% 
(2014: 22.5%). 
Profit after tax for the year was £450.3m 
(2014: £305.4m), and a basic earnings per 
share of 45.5p (2014: 31.2p). 
Return on capital employed
The Group’s fast asset turn model of a 
shorter consented land bank, deferred 
payment terms, standardised product, 
and the ability to sell through both our 
national brands on larger sites is focused 
on driving ROCE.
For FY15 ROCE increased by 440 basis 
points to 23.9% (2014: 19.5%), and we 
are confident of delivering further good 
progress on ROCE, and achieving our 
FY17 target of at least 25% ROCE, as we 
continue the transformation of the land 
bank, and run down the Group’s low or 
zero margin legacy assets.

Net cash and capital structure
We maintain an appropriate capital 
structure, with land and long term work 
in progress funded by shareholders’ 
funds and land creditors, and minimal 
net cash at our year end. During the year 
we generated £184.0m (2014: £242.3m) 
of cash from our operations resulting 
in net cash at 30 June 2015 of £186.5m 
(2014: £73.1m). At 30 June 2015 land 
creditors were 35% (2014: 33%) of the 
owned land bank.
On 17 December 2014 the Group amended 
its financing agreements relating to the 
£700m revolving credit facility (‘RCF’), 
£100m term loan and $80m (£48m) 
private placement notes. This resulted 
in slightly improved commercial terms 
than in the original agreements. The RCF 
now extends to 17 December 2019 
(previously 14 May 2018) and the step 
down in the facility from £700m to £550m 
is now extended to 29 December 2017 
(previously 30 June 2016). Our covenant 
package is appropriate and our facilities 
provide appropriate headroom above our 
current forecast requirements.
As we make scheduled payments 
on agreed new land and build work 
in progress to deliver spring 2016 
completions, we expect net debt at 
31 December 2015 to be in line with 
normal seasonal trends (December 
2014: £134.2m). It remains our objective 
for FY16 to maintain an appropriate 
capital structure with minimal year end 
net cash and land creditors at around a 
third of the owned land bank. 
Capital Return Plan
The Board proposes to pay a final ordinary 
dividend of 10.3 pence (2014: 7.1 pence) 
per share for the financial year ended 
30 June 2015, which subject to shareholder 
approval, will be paid on 20 November 
2015 to shareholders on the register at 
the close of business on 30 October 2015. 
Together with the interim ordinary dividend 
of 4.8 pence per share, which was paid in 
the year, this gives a total ordinary dividend 
for the year of 15.1 pence per share 
(2014: 10.3 pence per share). The ordinary 
dividend was covered around three times 
by basic earnings per share. 
Under the special cash payment 
programme the Board is proposing a 
payment of £100m (10.0 pence per share), 
which subject to shareholder approval, will 
be paid by way of a special cash payment 
on 20 November 2015 to shareholders on 
the register at the close of business on 
30 October 2015. The Board anticipates 
further payments of £125m proposed with 
our FY16 results payable in November 
2016, and £175m proposed with our FY17 
results payable in November 2017. 
In combination, the Capital Return Plan 
is expected to return around £987m of 
cash through ordinary dividends (based 
on consensus earnings) and special cash 
payments to the Company’s shareholders 
over the three years ending November 2017.

Effective risk management is 
critical to the achievement of 
our strategic objectives. Risk 
management controls are 
integrated into all levels of our 
business and across all of our 
operations. We continually 
assess our exposure to risk 
and seek to ensure that risks 
are appropriately mitigated.
Roles and responsibilities
The Board is responsible for the overall stewardship of our 
system of risk management and internal control. It has 
established the level of risk that is appropriate for our business 
and acceptable in the pursuit of our strategic objectives and 
has set appropriate policies. It has also set delegated authority 
levels to provide the framework for assessing risks and 
ensuring that they are escalated to the appropriate levels of 
management, including up to the Board where appropriate, 
for consideration and approval.
The roles and responsibilities of the Board, its committees

fall in the demand for houses, which 
in turn could result in impairments of 
the Group’s inventories, goodwill and 
intangible assets.
The majority of homes built by the 
Group are purchased by individuals 
who rely on the availability of 
mortgages. The confidence of buyers 
and their ability to obtain mortgages or 
other forms of financing are impacted 
by the macroeconomic environment. 
Accordingly, customer demand is 
sensitive to changes in economic 
conditions.
The Group’s ability to grow its business 
partly depends on securing land or 
options over sites and having adequate 
resources to build sufficient homes to 
meet demand. The Group’s ability to do 
this can be impacted by cash and profit 
constraints which, in turn, would have 
an adverse effect upon net operating 
assets and net debt (see also the 
liquidity, land and construction risks 
sections below).

The UK economy continued to grow 
in the 12 months to 30 June 2015, with 
most economic indicators showing 
improvements on the prior year .
Average quoted household interest 
rates remain at affordable levels and 
mortgage transaction volumes have 
remained broadly constant over the 
last year . 
Government support for the UK 
housebuilding industry has remained 
strong. The Government has extended 
Help to Buy (Equity Loan) in England 
until 2020. We expect Help to Buy in 
England to remain a very attractive 
opportunity for our customers, 
particularly first time buyers. Help to 
Buy in Scotland has ended and Wales 
ends 2016.
      See pages 10 and 11
Land purchasing 
The ability to secure sufficient 
consented land and strategic land 
options at appropriate cost and quality 
to provide profitable growth.
The Group needs to purchase  
sufficient quantities of good quality, 
consented land at attractive prices in 
order to be in a position to achieve its 
annual construction forecasts and 
enhance the Group’s ability to deliver 
profit growth.
Acquiring poor quality or mispriced 
land would have an adverse impact on 
profitability and revenue.
 > All potential land acquisitions are 
subject to formal appraisal, approval 
by the Group’s Land Committee and 
must meet minimum hurdle rates of 
20% gross margin and 25% site ROCE
 > Divisional, regional and Group 
monthly analysis of land currently 
owned, committed and identified 
against requirements
 > Regular divisional land meetings
The Group continues to see a good 
range of opportunities for current 
and strategic land for investment in 
its targeted locations. This is without 
undue concentration and without 
relaxing the Group’s site hurdle rates of 
20% gross margin and 25% site ROCE. 
However, there remains a strong 
demand for conventional and low 
complexity sites particularly in London 
and the South East.
      See pages 22 to 25
Liquidity
Unavailability of sufficient borrowing 
facilities to enable the servicing of 
liabilities (including pension funding) 
and the inability to refinance facilities 
as they fall due, obtain surety bonds, 
or comply with borrowing covenants. 
Furthermore, there are risks to 
management of working capital such 
as conditional contracts, build costs, 
joint ventures and the cash flows 
related to them.
The Group maintains committed 
facilities of different duration that are 
designed to ensure that the Group 
has sufficient available funds for 
operations. The Group’s borrowings 
are cyclical during the financial year 
and peak around April/May and 
October/November each year . Due to 
our seasonal trends in income, these 
are the calendar points when the 
Group has the highest working capital 
requirements.
The Group maintains sufficient 
committed debt facility headroom 
and in addition has a number of trade 
finance and surety facilities that 
are designed to ensure the Group 
has sufficient funds available. The 
absence of appropriate headroom 
would limit the Group’s land buying 
and operational capability, adversely 
affecting profitability and the Group’s 
ability to deliver shareholder value.
 > Committed bank facilities and private 
placement notes of around £850m 
with maturities ranging from 2016 
to 2021
 > Regular forecasts including working 
capital, cash flow facility headroom, 
surety bond requirements and 
compliance with banking covenants
 > Group policies require maintaining 
facility headroom of up to £150m
The Group is in compliance with its 
borrowing covenants and, at the date 
of approval of the 2015 Annual Report 
and Accounts, the Group’s internal 
forecasts indicate that it will remain in 
compliance with these covenants for 
the foreseeable future, being at least 
12 months from the date of approval.
During the year the Group amended its 
financing arrangements relating to its 
£700m revolving credit facility, £100m 
term loan and c. £50m of US private 
placements notes. This has resulted in 
slightly improved commercial terms.

Changes in factors impacting  
on the risk in 2015
Attracting and retaining  
high-calibre employees *
Inability to recruit and/or retain 
employees with appropriate skill 
sets or sufficient numbers of such 
employees.
The Group aims to attract, retain 
and develop a sufficiently skilled and 
experienced workforce in order to 
maintain high standards of quality and 
customer service.
Not having employees with appropriate 
skill sets can lead to build delays, 
quality issues, reduced sales, 
poor customer care and reduced 
profitability.
 > Comprehensive Human Resources 
programme led by the Group Human 
Resources Director including 
apprenticeship schemes, a graduate 
development programme, succession 
planning and training academies 
tailored to each discipline
 > Monthly monitoring of employee 
statistics including turnover and 
absence
 > Exit interviews
 > Annual employee engagement survey 
 > Remuneration benchmarked against 
industry competitors
There continues to be high competition 
amongst employers in some regions, 
which has resulted in employee 
turnover increasing to 19% (2014: 
16%). We have continued to invest in 
the training and development of our 
workforce in order to assist in both 
retention and succession planning. 
To help the Group address the skill 
shortage in the building industry, 
we have recruited 792 apprentices, 
graduates and trainees from FY14 to 
FY16.
In addition, we have introduced a 
strategy to assist in addressing 
diversity across the Group. 
      See pages 30 to 33
Availability of raw materials, 
subcontractors and suppliers *
Shortages or increased costs of 
materials and skilled labour, the 
failure of a key supplier or the inability 
to secure supplies upon appropriate 
credit terms could increase costs and 
delay construction.
The Group relies upon affordable 
supplies of building materials from 
multiple sources and subcontractors to 
perform the majority of work on sites. 
This retains flexibility to commence 
work on new sites and enhances the 
Group’s build cost efficiency. Adverse 
management of these suppliers and/
or subcontractors could lead to build 
delays, cost increases and reduced 
profitability.
 > Centralised team led by the Group 
Procurement Director procures the 
majority of the Group’s materials from 
within the UK including subcontractor 
materials, ensuring consistent quality 
and costs and security of supply
 > All of our significant supply 
agreements are fixed in advance, 
usually for 12 months
 > Seek to establish and maintain long 
term supplier and subcontractor 
partnerships
 > Group policies include tendering, the 
requirement for multiple suppliers for 
both labour contracts and material 
supplies and establish contingency 
plans should any key supplier fail
 > Professional approach to site 
management
During the year we saw overall build 
cost inflation of c. 3.5%. We have a 
robust and carefully managed supply 
chain with 85% of our build materials 
sourced through our centralised 
procurement function. We have seen 
an increase in the supply of skilled 
subcontractors over the past year, 
however there remains an industry 
shortage, with increases in labour 
costs remaining the largest driver of 
overall build cost inflation.
We continue to renew our 
subcontractor and supplier 
agreements to ensure best pricing  
and the continuous availability of  
labour and materials.

Changes in factors impacting  
on the risk in 2015
Government regulation and  
planning policy *
Inability to adhere to the increasingly 
stringent and complex regulatory 
environment, including planning and 
technical requirements affecting 
the housing market and regulatory 
requirements more generally.
The Group’s land portfolio consists of 
land for the short and medium term as 
well as strategic land. Inability to obtain 
suitable consents, or unforeseen 
delays, could impact on the number 
or type of homes that we are able to 
build. We could also be required to 
fund higher than anticipated levels 
of planning obligations, or incur 
additional costs to meet increased 
regulatory requirements. All of these 
would have a detrimental impact on 
the contribution per plot. The Group 
seeks to meet regulatory and planning 
requirements to obtain the planning 
permission required to develop homes 
and communities.
 > Consultation with the Government 
both directly and through industry 
bodies to highlight potential issues
 > Considerable in-house technical 
and planning expertise devoted to 
complying with regulations and 
achieving implementable planning 
consents
 > Rigorous design standards for the 
homes and places we develop
 > Policies and technical guidance 
manuals for employees on regulatory 
compliance and the standards of 
business conduct expected
Following the implementation of the 
Government’s National Planning Policy 
Framework, we welcome the further 
measures put in place to ensure local 
authorities have a five-year land supply. 
This is leading to an improved dialogue 
between local authorities and our 
divisions. Nevertheless, the planning 
process remains a lengthy one and 
affects the speed at which housing 
supply can increase. 
      See page 25
Construction and new technologies *
Failure to identify and achieve key 
construction milestones, due to 
factors including the impact of adverse 
weather conditions, the failure to 
identify cost overruns promptly, design 
and construction defects, and exposure 
to environmental liabilities, which could 
delay construction, increase costs, 
reduce selling prices and result in 
litigation and uninsured losses. There 
are also risks associated with climate 
change and the use of new technology 
in the build process e.g. materials 
related to carbon reduction.
The Group builds homes and 
communities in Britain ranging 
from houses to large-scale flatted 
developments. In the event we did not 
do so efficiently, or new technologies 
result in quality issues, the Group’s 
profitability and ability to grow the 
business could be impacted negatively.
 > Executive Committee, regional and 
divisional weekly reviews of trading 
performance and key performance

 > Progress with development projects 
(including joint ventures and 
consortia) is monitored regularly 
by divisional management teams, 
including through monthly board

technical experts, including the 
NHBC, to ensure compliance with all 
building and other regulations
 > Quarterly site valuations and  
valuation reviews
 > Monitoring of environmental impact 
indicators 
 > Maintenance of appropriate  
insurance cover
The Group is continuing an assessment 
of various modern methods of offsite 
construction and considering their 
suitability for utilisation within the 
business to reduce the risks inherent in 
the construction process.

Changes in factors impacting  
on the risk in 2015
Joint ventures and consortia
Large development projects, some 
of which involve joint ventures or 
consortia arrangements and/or 
commercial developments, are 
complex and capital intensive and 
changes may negatively impact upon 
cash flows or returns.
Due to their scale, some projects may 
require joint venture or consortium 
arrangements. Failure of a joint 
venture or consortium partner to 
perform its financial and/or operational 
obligations can place additional capital 
or operational burdens upon the Group.
 > All potential joint ventures are subject 
to formal appraisal and approval by 
the Group’s Land Committee and the 
Board
 > Once operational, the performance 
of joint ventures and consortia 
arrangements are subject to regular 
operational and financial review
During the year, the Group has entered 
into one new joint venture.
      See page 13
Safety, health and environmental *
Health and safety or environmental 
breaches can result in injuries to 
employees, subcontractors and site 
visitors, delays in construction or 
increased costs, reputational damage, 
criminal prosecution and civil litigation.
Health and safety is a key issue in 
the housebuilding sector . Given the 
inherent risks, it is of paramount 
importance to the Group. Senior 
management and the Board review 
health and safety matters on a regular 
basis and seek to reduce injury 
incidence rates by implementing 
policies and procedures aimed  
at keeping staff and visitors free  
from injury.
In addition to the possibly tragic impact 
of an accident on-site, there is potential 
for legal proceedings, financial 
penalties, reputational damage and 
delays to the site’s progress.
 > Health and safety department, 
independent of the management of 
the operating divisions
 > Regular health and safety audits 
and development monitoring visits 
with reports produced for divisional, 
regional, Safety, Health and 
Environment Committee, Executive 
Committee and Board review
 > Group health and safety and 
environmental policies and 
procedures
During the year, the Group’s 
construction activity has continued 
at an increased level. The Group has 
invested in its health and safety team 
to retain the frequency of the audit 
and monitoring of developments. The 
Group has introduced an enhanced 
series of measures to draw awareness 
to site safety and to risks inherent in the 
construction process. 
The Group has also continued 
to develop its Safety, Health and 
Environmental systems and has 
established a Board Safety, Health and 
Environmental Committee.
      See page 34
IT
Failure of the Group’s IT systems 
(whether due to cyber attacks or other 
causes) in particular those relating 
to surveying and valuation, could 
adversely impact the performance of 
the Group.
The ability to optimise prices and 
ensure operational efficiency is 
essential to the Group’s performance. 
The Group’s integrated management 
systems enable the Group to maintain 
tight control, especially with regard to 
surveying and valuation.
Adverse IT performance could cause 
delays in build and have an adverse 
impact on operational efficiency 
and profit.
 > Centrally maintained IT systems
 > Fully-tested disaster recovery 
programme
 > Regular exercises completed to seek 
to reduce the risk of penetration 
through cyber attacks
The Group has continued to invest in its 
site based IT for sales and construction 
teams, customer websites, business 
systems and IT infrastructure.

Risk management and internal controls
Given the risks inherent with building and construction, 
there is appropriate awareness of risk amongst Directors. 
Board members are fully cognisant of the individual and collective 
responsibility of the Board to: (i) determine the nature and extent 
of the risks the Board is willing to take to achieve the Company’s 
strategic corporate objectives; and (ii) to review the effectiveness 
of the risk management systems and internal controls (in 
conjunction with the Audit Committee). The commentary on 
the management of risk and the review of principal risks and 
uncertainties on pages 40 to 45 contains an analysis of how the 
risks affecting the Group have changed in the financial year. 
Given the focus on continuously improving our health and safety 
performance, we established a Safety, Health and Environmental 
Board Committee (the ‘SHE Committee’), chaired by Richard 
Akers, at the beginning of the 2015 financial year to assist the 
Board with discharging its responsibilities in this area moving 
forward. Details of the work they have undertaken in their first 
year are set out on pages 73 to 74.
Shareholder engagement
As a Board we remain focused on delivering long term value to 
our shareholders, whilst ensuring that we continue to promote 
sustainable developments and homes. Accordingly, we place 
continuing importance upon maintaining strong relationships with 
our shareholders and other key stakeholders. Full details on how 
we engage with our shareholders are provided on pages 60 to 61. 
Fair, balanced and understandable
Having established a robust process for determining if the 
2014 Annual Report and Accounts were ‘fair, balanced and 
understandable’, the same process was adopted to the 
assessment of the 2015 Annual Report and Accounts. The process 
is detailed on page 69 and the Board’s formal statement on the 
Annual Report and Accounts is contained within the Directors’ 
Responsibility Statement on page 102.
The following pages set out our governance structures, 
processes and the work undertaken by the Board and its 
Committees during FY15. 
John Allan 
Chairman
8 September 2015
I am pleased to present my first corporate governance report for 
the Company since taking over as Chairman in November 2014. 
During the 2014/15 financial year your Company fully complied 
with the main and supporting principles of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the ‘Code’), issued in September 2012 
(a copy of which is available from www.frc.org.uk). We describe 
how we have applied the main principles throughout pages 51 
to 95. It has also made good progress towards achieving full 
compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code issued in 
September 2014 which will apply for FY16. The Company has 
also complied with the requirements under the Disclosure 
and Transparency Rules, the Listing Rules and the BIS 
Directors’ Remuneration Reporting regulations and narrative 
reporting requirements. 
The Board recognises that good corporate governance requires 
more than just awareness and adherence to the Code. It is 
focused on seeking to ensure that good governance is embedded 
in our culture and that high standards of corporate governance 
apply across all areas of the business to support the long term 
success of the Group. The Board receives regular updates on 
changes in corporate governance requirements and strives to 
respond to such changes in advance of mandatory application  
as and when it is practicable to do so. 
Retirements from the Board
As reported last year, Bob Lawson stepped down from his 
position as Chairman after six years’ service on 12 November 
2014. After nine years with the Company, Mark Clare stepped 
down from his position as Chief Executive on 30 June 2015 and 
from the Board on 31 July 2015.

Following Mark Clare’s informal indication that he was 
considering retiring, the Board, through its Nomination 
Committee, began the search for a new Chief Executive supported 
by an external search consultant. Candidates for the position 
were considered from both inside and outside the business. 
David Thomas, Group Finance Director of the Company, was 
identified as the most suitable candidate for the position. As a 
result, the search for a new Group Finance Director commenced 
using different external search consultants. On 18 June 2015, 
we announced the appointment of Neil Cooper to the position of 
Chief Financial Officer Designate. Full details of the recruitment 
process can be found on page 64. Until Neil Cooper commences 
his role as Chief Financial Officer, David Thomas will fulfil both 
this and the Chief Executive role. The Chairman and the Board 
are conscious of the need to maintain good governance practices 
throughout this period. They have, therefore, assessed the 
robustness and effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls and 
procedures to ensure that they remain appropriate to mitigate 
against any significant risks arising during the period David 
assumes this dual role. Barratt Developments PLC

Overview
a  Leadership
a  Accountability
a  Remuneration
a  Effectiveness
a  Relations with shareholders
Your Board is collectively responsible for the long term success 
of your Company. Accordingly, the Directors constructively 
challenge proposals relating to strategy, performance, 
responsibility and accountability. This seeks to ensure 
that all decisions are well considered, justified and of the 
highest quality.
This section details the structure and composition of the Board 
and its Committees, how responsibilities are divided amongst 
the Board, its Committees and individual directors, the main 
activities of the Board during FY15 and its main focus areas 
for FY16.
Your Board recognises the importance of maintaining open 
dialogue with its shareholders, both private and institutional. 
A number of events and communications take place on an 
annual basis to regularly communicate with shareholders 
and to encourage their participation.
This section summarises how the Board and individual 
Directors engaged with shareholders throughout FY15 and 
how the shareholders can communicate with the Company.
Your Board continuously reviews its balance of skills, 
experience, independence and knowledge to ensure that they 
remain appropriate to enable it to discharge its duties and 
responsibilities effectively. The Board undertakes an annual 
evaluation of its own effectiveness and that of its Committees 
and of individual Directors. 
This section outlines the Board evaluation process undertaken 
in FY15, the outcomes and progress made with the actions 
arising from the FY14 evaluation. It also sets out the induction 
process used for new directors.
Your Board is mindful of the risk environment in which it 
operates when making any decisions. It maintains sound risk 
management and internal control systems and regularly 
reviews the principal risks and assesses the appropriate 
appetite for risk in striving to achieve the Company’s 
strategic objectives.
This section provides details on the Board’s approach to risk 
management, its internal controls and risk management 
systems and its processes for evaluating reporting on the 
Company is fair, balanced and understandable.
The Board, through its Remuneration Committee, has 
established a formal and transparent procedure for 
developing its policy on executive remuneration. The Group’s 
Remuneration Policy was presented to, and approved by, 
shareholders at the 2014 AGM and is designed to promote the 
long term success of the Group. No changes are proposed to 
the policy for FY16. 
This section summarises the Group’s Remuneration Policy, 
how the policy operated during FY15 and how it will be applied 
in FY16.

Board balance
The names, responsibilities and other details of each of the 
Directors of the Board are set out on pages 46 and 47 with 
the composition of the Board on page 51. Currently, the Board 
believes that it has an appropriate balance of Executive and 
independent Non-Executive Directors having regard to the 
size and nature of the business. In addition, the combination 
of the experience and calibre of the Non-Executive Directors 
collectively, having regard to their diverse backgrounds and 
experience and their varying lengths of service, further enhances 
this balance thereby mitigating against the risk of ‘ group think’. 
Board independence
The Company recognises the importance of its Non-Executive 
Directors remaining independent throughout their appointment, 
which enables them to provide objective advice and guidance 
to the Executive Directors (and senior managers) through the 
use of their wide business, commercial experience and diverse 
backgrounds. The Non-Executive Directors are also able to 
constructively challenge and scrutinise the performance of the 
Executive Directors, assisting them to assess the integrity of the 
financial information considered by the Board and disclosed to 
the Company’s shareholders. In addition, their independence is of 
utmost importance when considering the appointment or removal 
of Executive Directors and in the determination of succession 
planning for the Board and other key individuals within the Group. 
All of the Non-Executive Directors remained independent during 
the financial year; they have no business or other relationships 
with the Group that might influence their independence or 
judgement (confirmed as part of the annual conflict of interests 
review) (see page 65). Details of their interests as shareholders 
are contained in Table 15 on page 88 of the Remuneration report. 
John Allan joined the Board in August 2014 and was appointed 
Non-Executive Chairman of the Company with effect from 
12 November 2014. He was considered to be independent on 
his appointment to the Board and subsequently as Chairman. 
During the year, the Nomination Committee considered John 
Allan’s other significant commitments, as set out on page 46. 
Taking into account John Allan’s decision to step down from the 
Boards of Dixons Carphone Plc in February 2015, Royal Mail and 
the DHL Foundation in April 2015 and as Chairman of Worldpay in 
September 2015, the Nomination Committee concluded that his 
remaining other commitments do not impinge upon his availability 
to fulfil his duties to the Company. His other commitments were 
also considered during the annual review of effectiveness of the 
Chairman led by the Senior Independent Director and the same 
conclusion was reached.

Board performance evaluation
In accordance with the Code, the Board is responsible for 
undertaking a formal and rigorous annual evaluation of its 
own performance and that of its Committees. The Chairman is 
responsible for carrying out the evaluation of individual Director's 
performance. An external consultant undertook the performance 
evaluation of the Board and its Committees for the 2012/13 
financial year. Accordingly, an internal process was used for the 
2014/15 evaluation. This was led by the Chairman supported by 
the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary. An externally 
facilitated evaluation will be undertaken in respect of the 2016 
financial year.
Evaluation of the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
In accordance with the requirements of the Code, the Chairman 
met with the Non-Executive Directors independently of the 
Executive Directors. The Non-Executive Directors, led by the 
Senior Independent Director, met without the Chairman being 
present, to assess the performance of the Chairman and 
provided feedback from the process. There were no issues of 
any substance arising from the Non-Executive Directors’ only 
review or from the review of the Chairman’s performance and 
there was unanimous support for him. In addition, the Chairman 
met with each Director individually to discuss their contribution 
to the Board and their performance during the year under 
review. In addition to these specific meetings the Non-Executive 
Directors also meet without the Executive Directors being present 
either immediately prior to or immediately following committee 
meetings, of which they are all members.
Information and support
The Chairman, with the assistance of the Group General Counsel 
and Company Secretary, ensures that the Board receives 
accurate, timely and clear information. Each Director is issued 
with an agenda, briefing papers and comprehensive operating 
and financial management reports for the period under review, 
generally five working days before any Board meeting. The Group 
General Counsel and Company Secretary attends all Board 
and Committee meetings and all Directors have access to his 
advice and, if necessary, to independent professional advice 
at the Company’s expense to assist with the discharge of their 
responsibilities as Directors.
All Directors are provided with a rolling three-year schedule of 
proposed meeting dates. Any Director who is unable to attend a 
meeting is invited to provide their views to the Chairman ahead 
of that meeting, having reviewed the agenda, briefing papers 
and management information. Reasons for non-attendance are 
recorded by the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary 
and either he or the Chairman will, thereafter, meet with any 
absent Director to go through any action points which are of 
relevance to that Director. Formal minutes of each Board meeting 
are prepared, circulated and submitted for approval at the 
next meeting.
Development
In January of each year the Board meets for a full day to review 
and develop the overall business strategy of the Group which 
includes presentations from Senior Management within the Group 
as well as external professionals. The areas of focus for this 
review are set out on page 54.
A number of internal presentations and updates were provided 
to Directors on matters impacting the business. These included 
modern methods of construction; best practice on assessing 
if a company’s report is fair, balanced and understandable; 
considering the approach to adopt when undertaking a longer 
term viability assessment in the context of the Company’s  
three-year plan; changes to the Code, model Code requirements 
in respect of share dealings by Directors; and other statutory 
and regulatory changes relevant to the business. The Chairman 
regularly reviews training requirements of, and annually agrees 
development needs with, individual Directors. Barratt Developments PLC

Induction 
On joining the Company, each new Director participates in a 
full and formal induction process. The aim of the induction is 
to assist the Director to familiarise himself with the business 
and the roles and responsibilities of the Board and members of 
Senior Management. John Allan took part in this process which 
included health and safety training, site visits, meetings with all 
Board members and the Group General Counsel and Company 
Secretary, key external advisers and Senior and Operational 
Management teams across the business. He was also provided 
with an induction pack containing general and specific information 
relating to his role such as a schedule of meetings, copies of 
Board minutes and various policies and procedures, details of his 
duties as a Director of a listed plc and other obligations under the 
various regulations governing the Company. 
As part of his induction, the new Chief Financial Officer Designate 
will undergo a tailored programme of presentations and meetings 
with management along with visits to key offices and sites 
throughout the business to gain a greater understanding of our 
products, processes and policies.

Accountability
Internal controls and risk management
In accordance with principle C.2.1. of the Code the Board regularly 
reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal 
controls, including those related to material financial, operational 
and compliance performance and the risk management systems 
(see the Audit Committee report on pages 66 to 72). A risk 
framework has been developed for all business processes by 
the internal audit function and approved by the Audit Committee. 
This framework forms the basis of the internal control audit 
plan for the year ahead, which tests if controls are being applied 
effectively in each operating division. Material issues identified 
during internal audits and follow-up action plans are reviewed 
by the Executive Directors and by the Board on a quarterly basis. 
Any necessary actions are immediately taken to remedy any 
significant failings in the internal control system.
The Group’s system of internal controls is designed to 
manage risks that may impede the achievement of the Group’s 
business objectives rather than to eliminate those risks 
entirely. The system of internal controls therefore provides 
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. The system of internal controls does, 
however, provide reasonable assurance that potential issues 
can be identified promptly and appropriate remedial action taken. 
Further details can be found in the Risk management section 
of the Strategic Report (pages 40 to 45). 
The Group operates internal controls to ensure that the 
Group’s Financial Statements are reconciled to the underlying 
financial ledgers. A review of the consolidated accounts 
and Financial Statements is completed by management to 
ensure that the financial position and results of the Group 
are appropriately reflected.
The Board has not identified nor been advised of any failings 
or weaknesses which it has determined to be significant. 
Therefore, a confirmation of necessary actions has not been 
considered appropriate.
Fair, balanced and understandable
As part of its considerations, the Board reflected upon the  
feedback shareholders provided in respect of our 2013/14 Annual  
Report and Accounts (including the Remuneration Policy). It  
established an appropriate timetable to provide adequate time  
to review and discuss significant areas of the 2014/15 Annual  
Report and Accounts. 
The Board also assessed the tone, balance and language of the 
documentation, being mindful of the requirements of the Code 
and the need for consistency between the narrative section of the 
Report and the Financial Statements in arriving at its conclusion 
in respect of fair, balanced and understandable. The Board’s 
formal statement on the Annual Report and Accounts being fair, 
balanced and understandable is contained within the Directors’ 
Responsibility Statement on page 102.

to assist the Board in assessing if the Annual Report and

Relations with shareholders
The Board recognises the importance of having an effective 
relationship with its shareholders and other stakeholders. 
The Group has arrangements in place which enable it to 
communicate effectively with shareholders in respect of matters 
such as business strategy, governance, remuneration and any 
senior management or Board changes. It also conducts regular 
institutional investor meetings after the release of the Annual 
and Interim results and following the publication of each interim 
management statement. 
In order to ensure that all Directors are aware of, and have a clear 
understanding of, the views of major shareholders, the Group 
Finance Director reports regularly to the Board on the Company’s 
investor relations activities. Additionally, the Company’s brokers 
presented an analysis of investor feedback to the July 2015 
board meeting. 
Any announcement published via the Regulatory Information 
Service including the interim and annual reports, interim 
management statements and trading updates and Company 
announcements can be found on the Company’s website at 
www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk/investors. 
The Group Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director 
meet regularly with investors and analysts in order to convey 
an understanding of the market and the Group’s operations 
and objectives. These meetings take place throughout the 
year but particularly after the annual and interim results

Appointment and re-appointment of Directors 
The Nomination Committee leads the process for appointments 
to the Board and makes recommendations to the Board when 
suitable candidates have been identified. When a vacancy arises 
the Nomination Committee evaluates the balance of skills, 
experience, independence and knowledge on the Board. It then 
prepares a description of the roles and capabilities required for 
that appointment. The search for Board candidates is carried 
out, and appointments are made, based on merit having regard 
to the need to maintain a balance of skills and experience on 
the Board, diversity and, where appropriate, refreshment of 
Board memberships. External recruitment consultants are 
used where appropriate.
Appointment of Chief Executive and Chief Financial  
Officer Designate
During the year the Nomination Committee undertook a process 
to identify a suitable candidate to take over as Chief Executive 
from Mark Clare when he retired from this position on 30 June 
2015. An informal meeting of the Non-Executive Directors took 
place in October 2014 to discuss succession planning in light of 
Mark Clare’s informal notification to the Chairman that he was 
considering stepping down as Chief Executive in 2015. As part of 
this meeting, the Non-Executive Directors assessed the skills  
and experience required to fulfil the Chief Executive’s role. 
Korn Ferry, an independent recruitment firm, was duly appointed 
to assist with the search for a new Chief Executive. A list of 
candidates of both genders was prepared and reviewed by the 
Nomination Committee in early 2015. At an additional meeting 
in March 2015, the Nomination Committee proceeded to arrive 
at a shortlist and after consideration unanimously concluded 
that David Thomas, then Group Finance Director, was the best 
candidate to succeed Mark Clare as the Chief Executive and to 
make such recommendation to the Board. 
Following this decision, the Nomination Committee proceeded 
to search for a new Group Finance Director. Russell Reynolds 
Associates, another leading executive research practice, were 
appointed as search consultants. A list of potential candidates, 
both internal and external, was created and filtered down into a 
short list. Interviews were initially conducted by David Thomas 
and Rob Tansey, the Group’s HR Director. The shortlisted 
candidates then met all members of the Nomination Committee 
and Steven Boyes. It was unanimously agreed by the Nomination 
Committee that the appointment of Neil Cooper as Chief Financial 
Officer Designate be recommended to the Board. 
Both appointments were recommended to, and unanimously 
approved by the Board. The Nomination Committee confirms 
that neither Korn Ferry nor Russell Reynolds have any other 
connections with the Company.
Re-appointment of Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors are appointed, subject to re-election 
by shareholders and statutory provisions relating to the removal 
of Directors, by the Board, for an initial three-year term and 
normally serve a second three-year term. Beyond this a third 
term of up to three years may be served subject to particularly 
rigorous review and taking into account the need for progressive 
refreshment of the Board. The Articles, in accordance with the 
Code, require any Non-Executive Director who has served nine 
years or more on the Board continuously to be subject to annual 
re-appointment. 
The letters of appointment of all Non-Executive Directors are 
available for inspection by any person at the Company’s registered 
office during normal office hours or via the Company’s website 
www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk, copies will also be available at 
the 2015 AGM for 15 minutes before and throughout the meeting. 
The letters of appointment clearly set out the time commitment 
expected from each Non-Executive Director to ensure they 
satisfactorily perform their duties. Each Non-Executive Director 
confirms that they are able to allocate the time commitment 
required at the time of their appointment and thereafter as part 
of their individual annual effectiveness review undertaken by 
the Chairman.
During the year, the Nomination Committee considered the 
re-appointment of Richard Akers (having served three years) 
and Tessa Bamford (who has served six years) to the Board. 
The Nomination Committee was satisfied that both Richard and 
Tessa, remained independent and would be able to continue to 
dedicate sufficient time to fulfil their roles as Non-Executive 
Directors of the Company. Accordingly, they were re-appointed 
for a further three-year term, being a second three-year term for 
Richard and a third three-year term for Tessa. Barratt Developments PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2015

Strategic Report Governance Other Information Financial Statements
Retirement and re-election of Directors
The Articles currently require Directors to submit themselves for 
re-election by shareholders at the first AGM following their initial 
appointment to the Board and thereafter at intervals of no more 
than three years. All Board members will, however, in accordance 
with the Code, stand for re-election by the shareholders at the 
2015 AGM irrespective of their date of appointment and length 
of service on the Board.
Biographical details of each of the Directors and supporting 
statements for their re-election are set out on pages 46 and 
47 of this report and in the Notice of the 2015 AGM. Details of 
the Executive Directors’ service contracts can be found in the 
Remuneration report on page 81. 
Each of the Directors has been subject to a formal performance 
evaluation process and the Nomination Committee, and the 
Board, are satisfied that they each continue to be effective 
in, and demonstrate commitment to, their respective roles. 
The Board, therefore, recommends that shareholders approve 
the resolutions to be put forward at the 2015 AGM relating to the 
re-election of all Directors.
Directors’ conflicts of interest
On 1 October 2008, the Companies Act 2006 (the ‘Act’) codified 
the duty to avoid conflicts of interest, by which Directors have a 
duty to avoid a situation in which they have, or may have, a direct 
or indirect conflict of interest or possible conflict of interest with 
the Company. This duty applies to the exploitation of any property, 
information or opportunity regardless of whether the Company 
could have taken advantage of it. The Articles were amended at 
the AGM held on 18 November 2008 to include a general power 
for the Board to authorise such conflicts. 
The Board has, in accordance with the Articles and best practice 
guidance, authorised the Nomination Committee to oversee the 
process for reviewing and making recommendations to the Board 
concerning any actual or potential conflicts of interest which arise 
or may arise in relation to each member of the Board, including 
details of any terms and conditions which it deems necessary to 
impose on any authorisation given. This process was carried out 
satisfactorily during the year in respect of all Directors, including 
Neil Cooper, prior to his appointment becoming effective. 
The Group General Counsel and Company Secretary maintains 
a register of Directors’ conflict of interests which is reviewed 
annually. Following this review he will make recommendations 
to the Board in respect of any changes to the authorisations, or 
terms and conditions applied, that may be required. Each Director 
is responsible for notifying, and is aware of their responsibility 
to notify, the Chairman and/or the Board of any new conflict or 
possible conflict and of any change in circumstances relating 
to authorisations already given. The Board, when authorising 
any conflict or possible conflict of interest, does not count in the 
quorum the Director whose conflict or possible conflict is being 
discussed and reserves the right to exclude a Director from a 
meeting whilst a conflict or possible conflict is being considered. 
The Board may revoke or vary any authorisation at any time.
Board gender diversity policy
During the year, the Nomination Committee reviewed the Group’s 
policy on Gender Diversity in light of the recommendations 
contained within Lord Davies’ report, ‘Women on Boards’, as part 
of its annual effectiveness exercise. This policy was in turn also 
considered by the Board. The Nomination Committee’s primary 
goal remains to identify the most appropriate candidates to join 
the Board and other senior positions within the Group. However, 
in accordance with its terms of reference it also seeks to ensure 
that in considering succession planning it has due regard to the 
benefits of diversity for the Board, including gender. Accordingly, 
the Board will continue to work only with recruitment search 
consultants who have adopted a voluntary code of conduct 
addressing gender diversity. The Board has agreed not to impose 
a quota regarding gender balance. The Nomination Committee 
and the Board do however recognise the need to ensure that the 
business reflects a diverse workforce, at all levels of seniority, 
when considering Board appointments and internal promotions, 
whilst always seeking to ensure that each post is offered strictly 
on merit to the best available candidate. Promoting diversity 
more generally at a Senior Management level and more generally 
within the workforce is an objective for the Chief Executive and 
HR Director.

skills and experience, including financial expertise, all Non-Executive 
Directors sit on the Audit Committee. I can confirm that, in accordance 
with Code provision C.3. 1, each of the members is considered to be

In addition to the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary,

attended each of the Audit Committee meetings. They met with 
members of the Audit Committee independently of management 
and the Chairman of the Board. The Chief Executive, the Group 
Finance Director and other members of Senior Management also 
attended meetings (or parts thereof), by invitation, as required. 
After each meeting, I have reported to the Board upon business 
undertaken to ensure that all Directors are informed of the Audit 
Committee’s work. 
The significant issues considered by the Audit Committee during the 
financial year and how each of them was addressed is as follows:
Going concern
The Audit Committee:
 > assessed the Group’s available facilities, headroom and 
banking covenants;
 > reviewed management’s detailed analysis, which included 
forecasts and scenarios considering potential downturns  
in the housing market; 
 > satisfied itself, and subsequently the Board, that the going 
concern basis of preparation continues to be appropriate in 
the context of the Group’s funding and liquidity position; and
 > considered the revised disclosure requirements on going 
concern under the Code.
Further details upon the Group’s going concern assessment 
can be found on page 112.
Financial reporting
The Audit Committee reviewed the integrity of the Financial 
Statements of the Group and the Company and all formal 
announcements relating to the Group’s and Company’s financial 
performance. This process included the assessment of the 
following primary areas of judgement and took into account 
the views of Deloitte LLP.
Significant financial judgements for 2015
Carrying value of land and work in progress Available for sale financial assets
Goodwill and intangible assets  
impairment review
Land and work in progress (‘WIP’) are the most 
significant assets of the Group and at 30 June 2015 were 
valued at £4,113.5m. We undertake housebuilding and 
commercial development and the majority of activity 
we carry out is not forward sold before we commence 
development. Accordingly, there is a risk that land and 
WIP may be held at a value more than the lower of cost 
and net realisable (sale) value. The Group conducts half 
yearly reviews of land and WIP carrying value and if the 
estimated net realisable value is lower than the carrying 
value, it impairs the land and WIP value.
The Group holds £107 .0m of available for sale financial 
assets which principally comprise interest free loans 
made to purchasers upon the sale of a property and 
secured by way of a second charge. These loans are 
held at fair value and the valuation of them requires a 
number of judgements including the expected market 
value of the property at the date of repayment, the date 
the loan will be repaid and the appropriate rate that 
should be used to discount the value of these loans. 
The Group has £792.2m of goodwill and £100.0m of 
intangible assets which arose upon the acquisition 
of Wilson Bowden. The Group reviews the carrying 
value of these assets on an annual basis to ensure 
that the present value of the future cash flows that 
the housebuilding business is expected to generate 
is greater than the carrying value of these assets. This 
review includes a number of judgements around the 
estimation of future cash flows and the determination 
of an appropriate rate to discount these cash flows. 
How the Audit Committee addressed those judgements
Carrying value of land and work in progress valuation Available for sale financial assets
Goodwill and intangible assets  
impairment review
The Audit Committee considered land and WIP 
accounting judgements papers at its February, June 
and September meetings. These outlined the review 
process undertaken and the judgements made with 
regards to the estimation of further sales process and 
further build costs. Deloitte LLP reported upon land and 
WIP valuation at the February and September meetings 
in the context of the half year review and year end audit. 
Following detailed consideration of the accounting 
judgements papers and the findings of Deloitte LLP , the 
Audit Committee agreed with the judgements made by 
management and concluded that the valuation of our 
land and WIP remains appropriate.
The Audit Committee considered available for sale

Fair, balanced and understandable
The Audit Committee also undertook a detailed process to 
consider whether the 2015 Annual Report and Accounts were 
fair, balanced and understandable. It considered the feedback 
provided by shareholders in respect of the 2014 Annual Report 
and Accounts, the Group’s trading updates and the information 
that the Board had received throughout the year. The Audit 
Committee received an early draft of the 2015 Annual Report 
and Accounts (including the risk management statement and 
principal risks disclosure) to allow itself sufficient time to review 
the disclosures therein. It also received a report from the Group 
General Counsel and Company Secretary which confirmed that: 
(i) the Annual Report and Accounts had been reviewed by the 
Group Executive Directors; and (ii) the Company had received 
confirmation from its external advisers, that the Annual Report 
and Accounts adhered to the requirements of the Code and 
relevant rules and regulations. The Audit Committee then 
assessed, at its September 2015 meeting, whether the Annual 
Report and Accounts were fair, balanced and understandable. 
It reviewed the processes underpinning the compilation and 
assurance of the Annual Report and Accounts, in relation to 
the financial and non-financial management information. It also 
reviewed the internal processes underpinning the Group’s 
reporting governance framework and the reviews and findings 
of the Group’s external legal advisers and the auditor. The Audit 
Committee concluded that the 2015 Annual Report and Accounts 
were fair, balanced and understandable and recommended as 
such to the Board. 
The effectiveness of internal controls and the risk 
management process 
The Audit Committee plays a vital role in managing the 
effectiveness of internal controls and the risk management 
process on behalf of the Board. The key aspects of the Group’s 
system of internal control and risk management framework are 
as follows:
i)  a clear organisational structure with defined levels of authority 
and responsibility for each operating division;
ii)  financial and management reporting systems under which 
financial and operating performance is consistently reviewed 
against budget and forecasts at divisional, regional and Group 
levels on a monthly basis;
iii)  identification and review of principal operational risk 
areas to ensure they are embedded in the Group’s 
monthly management reporting system. This is so that 
the identification and control of risk are a routine aspect 
of management responsibility. 
Amongst other matters, the risks reviewed by management, 
the Audit Committee and the Board include: 
>  economic environment, including housing demand and 
mortgage availability;
> land and strategic land option purchasing;
> liquidity;
> attracting and retaining high-calibre employees;
>  availability of raw materials, suppliers of products of the quality 
required and suitably qualified subcontractors and labourers;
> Government regulation, housebuilding and planning policy;
> construction and new technologies;
> joint ventures and consortia;
> safety, health and environmental; and
> IT.
Details of the management of risk system utilised and the 
principal risks and uncertainties and their relevance to the 
operations and financial performance of the Group are set out in 
Risk management on pages 40 to 45 of the Strategic Report; and
iv)  assessment of compliance with the internal control and 
risk management systems. This assessment is supported 
by the Group’s internal audit team which is responsible for 
undertaking an annual audit plan, ad hoc audits and reporting 
to the Audit Committee, and, if necessary, the Board, on the 
operation and effectiveness of those systems and any material 
failings with them. The planned programme of audit appraisals 
across Group operations is approved by the Audit Committee. 
It includes full divisional audits and targeted audits of key risk 
areas such as the land viability process, land acquisition cost 
controls and monitoring WIP and subcontractor payment 
controls. Where the internal audit team does not have the 
expertise or resources required to conduct complex audits 
they use external expertise.  Barratt Developments PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2015

Governance – Audit Committee report continued
The Group’s operations and financing arrangements expose it to 
a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in 
borrowing and debt profiles, government policy, market prices, 
credit risks, liquidity risks and interest rates. The most significant 
of these to the Group is liquidity risk. Accordingly, there is a 
regular, detailed system for the reporting and forecasting of cash 
flows from the operations to Group management to ensure that 
risks are promptly identified and appropriate mitigating actions 
taken. These forecasts are further stress tested at a Group level 
on a regular basis to ensure that adequate headroom within 
facilities and banking covenants is maintained. In addition, the 
Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks 
to limit the adverse effects of the other risks on its financial 
performance, in particular by using financial instruments, 
including debt and derivatives, to hedge interest and currency 
rates. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for 
speculative purposes. Activities are delegated, by the Board, to a 
centralised Treasury Operating Committee, which in turn reports 
to the Board. The treasury department implements guidelines 
that are established by the Board, in accordance with approved 
treasury policies, and the Treasury Operating Committee. 
During the year the Audit Committee:
 > reviewed the effectiveness of risk management and internal 
controls in relation to material financial risks; 
 > reviewed a number of process improvements and confirmed 
that the risk management and internal control systems had 
been in place throughout the year ended 30 June 2015 and that 
they and their effectiveness accord with the Code;
 > provided regular reports to the Board in respect of its 
findings on the effectiveness of the internal controls and risk 
management process, in order to assist the Board with its 
assessment that sound risk management and internal control 
systems have been maintained throughout the year which seek 
to safeguard shareholders’ investments as well as the Group’s 
assets (in accordance with principle C.2 of the Code); 
 > assisted the Board to determine the nature and extent of the 
significant risks that it is appropriate for the Group to take to 
achieve its strategic objectives and to be assured that Executive 
Directors and Senior Management continue to implement and 
maintain the Group’s internal control and risk management 
systems within the governance and policy framework approved 
by the Board;
 > spent time with management below Board level to understand 
risks and controls in a number of areas of the business 
including: cascading of internal control and risk management 
policies within the business; onsite IT systems; risk of 
cyber attacks to the business; supply chain risks; and the 
enhancement of financial control following the continued 
increase in volume of homes built;
 > reviewed in detail the output of the six monthly controls  
self-certification process from each of the divisions;
 > considered all whistleblowing and suspected fraud reports 
and actions;
 > reviewed all internal audit results and action plans;
 > received regular reports from the Risk Committee in respect 
of the work it had undertaken to review the effectiveness 
of the Group’s internal control policies and procedures for 
the identification, assessment and reporting of risks and for 
assessing individual key risks on a rolling basis;
 > reviewed the concurrency of the principal risks and the risk 
management framework to determine if the descriptions of 
their operation were up to date, the system of internal control 
remains effective and reported their findings to the Board 
when considering the draft interim and full year Financial 
Statements; assisted the Executive Committee to prioritise 
the risk framework by identifying the risks considered most 
significant to the Group and assessed their potential impact on 
the business of any risks identified; and 
 > assessed the structure deployed by the Group when assessing 
risks. This is set out in Risk management on pages 40 to 45 of 
the Strategic Report. 
The Audit Committee is pleased with the progress with its short 
and medium term work programmes to date, and recognises 
that work will need to be continued in these areas during the next 
financial year.
Review of accounting policies
The Audit Committee considered the impact of the accounting 
standards adopted in the year and reviewed the Group’s progress 
on projects to consider the impact of both IFRS 9 ‘Financial 
Instruments’ and IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with 
customers’ upon the Group’s accounting policies and financial 
statements. Further information on the impact of accounting 
standards is on page 118.  Barratt Developments PLC

External auditor
i) Re-appointment of auditor
The Audit Committee considered the re-appointment of Deloitte 
LLP as the auditor to the Company and whether to tender the 
external audit in respect of the 2015/16 financial year. In arriving 
at its conclusion, the Audit Committee took into account: 
>  feedback on the effectiveness of the external audit from 
divisional, regional and Group management who were closely 
involved in both the interim and year end reporting process;
>  the Code’s requirement to put the external audit out to tender 
every ten years. Deloitte LLP was appointed as the auditor of 
the Company through an external tender process in 2007; 
>  the appointment of Mark Goodey as the lead audit partner 
during FY13; 
>  FRC guidance and the Code which suggest that the 
tendering should normally align with the five-yearly cycle 
of partner rotation; 
>  Deloitte LLP’s objectivity and independence; 
>  Deloitte LLP’s performance against the audit plan for the 
2014/15 financial year; and 
>  the quality of advice and assistance brought to bear and 
received throughout the year.
The Audit Committee concluded that Deloitte LLP’s performance 
as auditor to the Company continues to be satisfactory and 
that it was not necessary to consider a tender process this 
year. Mark Goodey will continue to act in this capacity until the 
conclusion of the 2017 audit subject to satisfactory performance. 
The Audit Committee will assess its tendering arrangements 
towards the conclusion of Mark Goodey’s period in office, or 
earlier if it has reason to do so. Accordingly, it recommended 
to the Board that a resolution re-appointing Deloitte LLP as 
the auditor to the Company be proposed at the 2015 AGM. 
That recommendation was subsequently endorsed by the Board. 
There are no contractual obligations which restrict the Audit 
Committee’s choice of External Auditor.
ii) Audit effectiveness 
The Audit Committee assessed the effectiveness of the external 
audit and concluded that the audit process as a whole had been 
conducted robustly and that the team selected to undertake the 
audit had done so thoroughly and professionally. In coming to this 
conclusion the Audit Committee reviewed amongst other matters:
>  Deloitte LLP’s fulfilment of the agreed audit plan and the 
absence of any variations from it;
>  reports highlighting the material issues and accounting 
judgements that arose during the conduct of the audit;
>  feedback from Group and Regional management finance 
functions and the Chief Internal Auditor evaluating the 
performance of the audit; and
>  the report from the FRC’s Audit Quality Review Team.
iii) Auditor independence and non-audit fees policy
The Audit Committee formally reviewed the policy which the 
Company has implemented on Auditor Independence and Non-
Audit Fees (the ‘Policy’) during the year. The Policy sets out the 
duties of the Audit Committee and the limited range of services 
which the auditor may provide without requiring prior approval 
of the Audit Committee. Any services outside this scope must 
be approved by the Audit Committee in order to maintain auditor 
independence and to monitor non-audit fees incurred by the 
Group. The Policy also sets out a number of services which 
the External Auditor is excluded from providing to the Group. 
These include:
>  bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting records 
or Financial Statements;
>  financial information systems design and implementation 
relating to the Financial Statements or accounting records;
>  appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions, or 
contributions-in-kind;
>  actuarial services;
>  internal audit outsourcing services;
>  management functions or human resources;
>  broker or dealer, investment adviser, or investment 
banking services;
>  legal services and expert services unrelated to the audit; and
> executive recruiting.
Under the Policy the Company is required to, and does, obtain 
written confirmation from Deloitte LLP that they remain 
independent on an annual basis. Deloitte LLP have also provided 
a comprehensive report to the Audit Committee verifying that 
they have performed their audit and audit-related services in line 
with independence requirements and assessing why Deloitte 
LLP believe they remain independent within the requirements of 
the applicable regulations and their own professional standards, 
which were conclusions that the Audit Committee endorsed.  Barratt Developments PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
72
Governance – Audit Committee report continued
In reaching these conclusions the Audit Committee reviewed, 
amongst other matters:
>  a report from Deloitte LLP describing their arrangements 
to identify, report and manage any conflicts of interest; 
>  the extent of the non-audit services provided by Deloitte LLP; 
and
>  the ratio of audit to non-audit fees.
As part of its review of the policy, the Audit Committee took the 
opportunity to tighten the restrictions on the recruitment of 
employees from Deloitte LLP, so that no employee (at whatever 
level of seniority) involved in the Company’s audit for a two-year 
preceding period can be hired without the pre-approval of each 
of the Chairman of the Company, the Chair of the Audit Committee 
and the Chief Financial Officer.
iv) Non-audit services
The Audit Committee continually monitored the ratio between 
audit to non-audit fees to ensure that they remained within the 
1:1 ratio prescribed in the policy. At the end of FY15, non-audit 
fees represented 71% of audit fees. Further details of the audit 
(including audit-related) and non-audit fees incurred by the Group 
can be found on page 123. 
The Audit Committee noted that the majority of the non-
audit fees related to audit-related assurance services which 
principally comprise the review of the Group’s interim report, 
taxation compliance (for which Deloitte LLP were appointed 
on 1 December 2010 following a competitive tender process in 
which four of the leading audit firms took part), and also taxation 
advice on various land acquisitions and disposals during the 
year. Accordingly, the Audit Committee was satisfied that the 
work performed by Deloitte LLP was appropriate in the context 
of ensuring their independence as auditor, particularly given that 
the audit-related assurance services, relating to the review of 
the Group’s interim report, can only be conducted by the Group’s 
auditor and that the tax advisory services had been managed by 
a partner who has no involvement with the audit of the Group. 
Consequently, the Audit Committee concluded that the level of 
non-audit fees was justified and did not raise any concerns in 
terms of Deloitte LLP’s independence as auditor to the Group. 
Deloitte LLP have also confirmed, in writing, that they are in 
agreement with this conclusion.
The Audit Committee confirms that there are no independence 
issues in respect of the auditor and that the policy has been 
appropriately complied with throughout the year under review. 
Internal Audit function
During the year, the Audit Committee received reports from the 
Chief Internal Auditor on the findings of internal audits conducted 
throughout the business, together with details of the proposed 
actions to rectify any issues identified. In addition, the Audit 
Committee monitors and reviews the systems and processes 
adopted by the internal audit function to ensure that they remain 
fit for purpose.
Audit Committee effectiveness 
The Audit Committee successfully implemented the 
recommendations arising from its 2014 performance evaluation 
and once again, evaluated its own performance and that of its 
members through an internal process led by the Chairman 
of the Audit Committee. The outcome of the review was 
positive, particularly in respect of each member having a clear 
understanding of what is expected of them to undertake and 
discharge their responsibilities. The key area of focus identified 
related to succession planning for members of the Audit 
Committee, in particular, its Chairman.
Whistleblowing 
The Chief Internal Auditor updated the Audit Committee on new 
whistleblowing incidents, ongoing investigations and the outcome 
of any completed investigations. On the back of these updates 
the Audit Committee assessed the adequacy of the Group’s 
whistleblowing policy in accordance with the requirements of the 
Code. It reviewed the whistleblowing procedure adopted by the 
Group, including steps that can be taken to enhance awareness 
of it, to ensure it remains appropriate and adequately allows 
individuals who become aware of possible improper, unethical or 
even illegal behaviour to raise the matter with their manager or 
alternatively refer the matter to a confidential and independent 
telephone number (the ‘Whistleblowing Number’). 
The Whistleblowing Number is available to all employees 
(together with sub-contractors and suppliers) 24 hours a day, 
seven days a week. Any issues reported to the Whistleblowing 
Number are immediately brought to the attention of the 
Chief Internal Auditor. The Chief Internal Auditor reviews and 
investigates the issue, and at his sole discretion can seek 
guidance from appropriate individuals within the Group, such as 
the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, as and when 
he deems necessary.

There has been SHE Operations Committee in place for over 
five years, although, last year the Board decided that given the 
continuing increase in unit production, the turnover in sub-
contractors and a consequent increase experienced in our Injury 
Incident Rate (‘IIR’), that it should enhance the oversight and 
stewardship of SHE operational performance. Accordingly, the 
SHE Committee came into effect. Its primary role is to:
 > oversee the Group’s compliance with the SHE 
management system;
 > review any significant SHE risks or exposures and assess ways 
to mitigate against these;
 > establish and maintain policies in respect of all areas relating 
to safety, health and environment such as safety of employees, 
customers, contractors and the general public; and 
 > assess the outcome of annual SHE internal and external audits 
and agree necessary actions with the Group SHE Director.
The SHE Committee has agreed and implemented terms 
of reference which fully set out its duties and how the SHE 
Committee will operate.

Remuneration 
Committee Chairman
“ The remuneration outcomes for FY15 reflect the 
significant improvements made by the Group 
across all operating metrics. They also take 
into account the excellent progress made by the 
Executive Directors and Senior Management in 
delivering the Company’s strategy.” 
I am pleased to present the Remuneration report for the 
financial year ended 30 June 2015 on behalf of the Remuneration 
Committee. The Remuneration report comprises this statement, 
the Directors’ Remuneration Policy (the ‘Policy’) and the Annual 
report on remuneration. Each of these parts has been prepared 
in accordance with the requirements of the Large and Medium-
sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
(Amendments) Regulations 2013 and of the 2012 UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the ‘Code’). No changes are proposed to  
the Policy for FY16 and it will not, therefore, be re-presented  
to shareholders at this year’s AGM. The Annual report on 
remuneration (including this Annual Statement) will, as in 
previous years, be subject to an advisory vote.
The main role of the Committee is to design and implement a 
remuneration framework which is aligned to the interests of 
the shareholders and allows the Group to recruit and retain 
Executive Directors and Senior Management who are fully 
focused, and motivated, to achieve and deliver the key elements 
of the Company’s business strategy. The Committee operates 
within terms of reference (the ‘Terms of Reference’) and 
governance policies approved annually by the Board and in 
accordance with the Code.

Our performance and FY15 remuneration outcomes
As illustrated on page 76, the Group has once again seen 
significant improvements across all operating metrics. Given that 
management has continued to make excellent progress in 
delivering the Company’s strategy whilst maintaining a strong 
position for the future, the Committee has approved the following 
remuneration for Executive Directors in respect of FY15.
Annual bonus
In July 2014, the Committee established a profit before tax target 
level of £530m, with a minimum threshold for the bonus at £510m 
and a maximum threshold of £570m against a market consensus 
of £530m. Performance against each of the annual bonus targets, 
including profit before tax, is set out on page 86. Based on this 
performance, the Committee has approved a bonus award of 
139.8% of base salary (2014: 150%) for Executive Directors. 
The bonus earned in excess of 100% of base salary will be 
deferred into shares for a period of three years and will be subject 
to a continued employment condition.
Long Term Performance Plan
The performance period for the award made on 24 October 
2012 (the ‘2012/13 LTPP’) ended on 30 June 2015. Both the 
total shareholder return and earnings per share performance 
conditions applicable to this award were tested thereafter and 
100% of each element will vest on 24 October 2015. Details of the 
achievement against the specific targets can be found on page 
87. Each participant of the 2012/13 LTPP will therefore receive 
100% of the award granted to them in October 2012. The relevant 
number of shares (following settlement of any tax and national 
insurance liabilities) will be issued to each participant in 
October 2015.
Management changes
Following Mark Clare’s decision to retire from his position as 
Group Chief Executive with effect from 30 June 2015 and as an 
Executive Director as of 31 July 2015, the Committee discussed 
and approved his retirement arrangements. Details can be found 
on page 95. The Committee also considered the structure of the 
remuneration packages for David Thomas and Neil Cooper in 
respect of their appointments to the roles of Chief Executive and 
Chief Financial Officer Designate respectively. Full details are set 
out on pages 93 and 94. 
Our remuneration strategy
Our strategy is to ensure that Executive Directors’ remuneration 
(and that of Senior Management) is clearly linked to the delivery 
of sustainable shareholder value and that they are appropriately 
rewarded for performance against the Group’s key objectives.
Aims of our remuneration policy:
 > promote the long term success of the Company and be fully 
aligned with the performance and strategic objectives of the 
Group applicable for any financial year; 
 > reward the delivery of profit, the maintenance of an appropriate 
capital structure and the continued improvement of return on

Shareholding requirements 
Following feedback from shareholders, the shareholding 
requirements introduced on 1 July 2014 for Executive Directors 
and Senior Management have been further enhanced. 
Executive Directors must now retain a minimum percentage of 
‘owned shares’ and to be classified as a ‘ good leaver’ are required 
to hold shares for a period of two years after they leave the 
business. Details can be found on page 93.
Conclusion
Throughout the year, the Committee complied with those 
aspects of the Code relevant to its business. The Committee 
continues to demonstrate its accountability on executive 
remuneration to shareholders through this report and through 
regular dialogue. As in previous years, the Committee engaged 
with key institutional investors and shareholder representative 
bodies in respect of the intended application of the policy for 
Executive Directors and Senior Management for the forthcoming 
year. Feedback from this process and the remuneration 
guidelines and guidance issued by the Investment Association, the 
National Association of Pension Funds and Pensions Investment 
Research Consultants, were taken into account when setting 
Executive Directors’ remuneration. 
I would like to thank all shareholders for their support of our 
remuneration policy to date. I hope that you will continue to 
support the Remuneration report at this year’s AGM by voting 
in favour of the Annual report on remuneration.

Remuneration for FY16
Taking into account the continuing improvement in the business 
environment, the Company’s evolving strategy and feedback 
received from shareholders on the Company’s remuneration 
policy, the Committee undertook a detailed review of the 
remuneration for Executive Directors and Senior Management 
in December 2014. The key components of Executive Directors’ 
remuneration for FY16 are summarised below:
Base salaries 
Executive Directors’ salaries, including that of Steven Boyes, have 
been set so as to reflect the change of roles and responsibilities 
in light of the changes in management. See page 92 for 
further details.
Annual bonus
The maximum bonus potential has been maintained at 150% of 
base salary for any bonus earned in respect of FY16. Any bonus 
in excess of 100% will be deferred into shares in the Company for 
a period of three years and subject to a continued employment 
condition. The Committee has however revised the performance 
measures and their weightings by reducing the weighting of profit 
before tax, increasing the weighting of balance sheet items and 
personal objectives and by removing employee engagement. 
This reflects a significant simplification of the annual bonus 
structure for Executive Directors and Senior Management to 
improve its effectiveness as an incentivisation and retention tool. 
Full details of the FY16 bonus performance measures and their 
respective weightings are set out on page 93. 
2015/16 LTPP award
Consistent with the approach taken last year, the Committee 
intends to make awards to Executive Directors and Senior 
Management under the LTPP during FY16 (the ‘2015/16 LTPP’). 
The level of the award to be granted will continue to be no more 
than 200% of base salary for Executive Directors. The award 
will be subject to three performance targets: total shareholder 
return, absolute earnings per share and return on capital 
employed. Each element will represent one-third of the total 
award. The 2015/16 LTPP will also be subject to a two-year 
continued holding period, commencing from the completion of the 
performance period. Further details on the 2015/16 LTPP can be 
found on page 94. Barratt Developments PLC

Directors’ remuneration policy – summary
A description of how the Company implemented the Policy in FY15 
can be found on pages 84 to 92 and details of how the Policy is 
intended to be applied in FY16 are set out on pages 92 to 95.
The Policy is summarised in the tables below and on pages 81 to 
83. The Policy was approved by shareholders at the 2014 Annual 
General Meeting held on 12 November 2014. No changes are 
proposed to the Policy for FY16.
The full version of the Policy can be found on pages 64 to 74  
of the 2014 Annual Report and Accounts which is available  
on our website at www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk/investors/
results-reports-and-presentations/rp-2014. 
Element of pay How operated in practice Additional information
Base salary
To help promote the long term success of the Company, 
attract and retain high-calibre Executive Directors 
and reflect the roles and responsibilities of each of the 
Executive Directors.
Salaries are paid monthly in arrears. The aim is to 
provide a competitive salary relative to comparable 
companies in terms of size and complexity.
Normally reviewed annually and fixed for 12 months 
with effect from 1 July. 
See page 92 for Executive Directors’ salaries with effect 
from 1 July 2015.
Benefits (taxable)
To support the health and well-being of Executive 
Directors whilst they undertake their roles.
Benefits include:
 > company car;
 > annual medical screening;
 > private medical insurance;
 > some telephone costs; and 
 > contributions towards obtaining independent 
tax advice.
The Committee does have the discretion to offer 
other benefits, if it deems appropriate, to secure 
the appointment of a new Executive Director and to 
ensure that the benefits package for existing Executive 
Directors remains competitive in the market.
Pension
To assist Executive Directors plan for retirement. In accordance with legislation, Executive Directors 
are enrolled into a workplace pension. If Executive 
Directors choose to opt-out of the workplace pension 
they can elect to either: 
 > participate in the Company’s money purchase 
pension plan; or
 > receive a salary supplement.
Executive Directors are also eligible for an insured 
lump sum of up to five times pensionable salary on 
death in service.
The defined benefit section of the Group’s pension 
scheme closed to new entrants in 2001 and future 
accrual of defined benefits for current members ceased 
to be offered on 30 June 2009. Steven Boyes remains a 
member of this part of the scheme.
Each of the Executive Directors received a salary 
supplement equal to 30% of their salary for FY15. 
Annual bonus
To motivate and reward Executive Directors and Senior 
Management for the achievement of demanding 
financial objectives and key strategic measures over 
the financial year .
Executive Directors are eligible to an annual bonus 
which is discretionary and is not pensionable.
The level of bonus awarded to each Executive Director 
is dependent on the achievement of a number of Group 
and individual performance targets. 
Bonuses up to 100% of base salary are paid in cash. Any 
bonus earned in excess of this (up to a maximum of 50% 
of base salary) is compulsorily deferred into shares 
under the Deferred Bonus Plan (‘DBP’), see below.
When setting bonus targets, the Committee considers 
the effect of corporate performance on environmental, 
social and governance risks and sustainability issues 
generally to ensure that remuneration structures do not 
inadvertently motivate irresponsible behaviour .
The performance targets set are stretching whilst 
having regard to the nature and risk profile of the 
Company and the interests of its shareholders. 
Performance conditions are based on a mixture of 
financial and non-financial targets.
Performance against FY15 targets can be found on 
page 85.
Long T erm Performance Plan (‘LTPP’)
To motivate and reward Executive Directors and 
Senior Management for the delivery of the long term 
performance of the Group.
To facilitate share ownership by Executive Directors and 
Senior Management.
Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the 
Company’s LTPP . Annual LTPP awards can be equal to 
a maximum of 200% of base salary and are for a period 
of three years with a two-year continued holding period 
attached to the end of the performance period.
LTPP awards are usually granted in October each year . 
The Committee sets performance targets for each 
award and ensures that targets, whilst stretching, are: 
realistic and attainable; for the long term benefit of the 
Group; and do not encourage inappropriate business 
risks.
Performance so far against the targets for the awards 
made in FY15 can be found on page 86.
Details of the awards due to be granted in October 2015 
are set out on page 94. These awards will, as in previous 
years, be subject to performance conditions relating to 
EPS, TSR and ROCE. Barratt Developments PLC

Governance – Remuneration report – Directors’ remuneration policy – summary continued
Element of pay How operated in practice Additional information
Deferred Bonus Plan (‘DBP’)
To encourage long term focus and to further align 
interests of the Executive Directors and Senior 
Management with those of shareholders and 
discourage excessive risk taking.
Any annual bonus which is deferred into shares is held 
in this plan for a period of three years and is subject to a 
continued employment condition. 
Deferred shares may be forfeitable if an individual 
leaves prior to the release date. 
Deferred shares do not accrue dividends.
The Committee utilises the rules of the Group’s Co-
Investment Plan (the ‘CIP’) for the purposes of the DBP . 
Under these rules the Committee has a discretion 
which allows it to award matching shares (the ‘Matching 
Award’) should it deem appropriate to do so.
Details of any bonus deferred into shares for FY15 can 
be found on page 85.
Executive Share Option Scheme (‘ESOS’)
To encourage or facilitate the holding of shares in the 
Company by or for the benefit of bona fide employees 
and former employees of the Company and its 
subsidiaries.
No awards can be granted under the ESOS in the same 
financial year as an award is granted under the LTPP . 
The Committee retains the discretion to make future 
awards under the ESOS should market conditions 
dictate that it is more appropriate to grant under the 
ESOS than the LTPP .
The last award, made under the ESOS in December 
2009, vested in December 2012. Executive Directors 
have until 19 December 2019 to exercise their vested 
option, after which time it will lapse. Mark Clare and 
Steven Boyes exercised their ESOS options during the 
year . Details can be found on pages 87 and 88.
Savings Related Share Option Scheme  
(‘Sharesave’)
To promote long term share ownership amongst all 
employees of the Group in a tax-efficient way, linking 
employee benefits to the performance of the Group  
and to aid retention of staff.
Under the standard terms of the Sharesave, all 
employees with a minimum of six months’ service as 
at the invitation date are eligible to participate in the 
Sharesave.
Employees can elect to save between a minimum of £5 
and the maximum monthly savings limit as approved by 
the Committee and the Board, for a period of three or 
five years. At the end of the savings period the employee 
has six months in which to exercise their option.
The three-year Sharesave granted in March 2012 
matured on 1 June 2015. Mark Clare exercised 
his option during the year . Steven Boyes has until 
30 November 2015 to exercise his.
Steven Boyes was granted an option under the 2015 
Sharesave. Further information can be found on 
page 88.
Shareholding requirement
To further align the interests of Executive Directors and 
Senior Management to those of shareholders.
Executive Directors are required to build and retain a 
shareholding in the Company’s shares within five years 
of being appointed to the Board.
Shareholdings will be valued by reference to the higher 
of the share price paid on acquisition or vesting and 
the share price at the close of business of the London 
Stock Exchange on 30 June annually. The salary will be 
the participant’s salary applicable for the financial year 
under review.  
The Chief Executive and other Executive Directors are 
required to build up and retain a total shareholding in the 
Company’s shares equivalent to 200% and 150% of base 
salary respectively (the ‘Total Shareholding’).
Shares that qualify as ‘T otal Shareholdings’  
(included net of income tax except for 
Owned Shareholdings)
 > All ‘Owned Shareholdings’ (see page 93);
 > Shares held under a vested but unexercised option; 
 > Shares held under the Deferred Bonus Plan; and 
 > Vested shares under LTPPs subject to 
ongoing restrictions.
Clawback provisions apply to all short and long term variable remuneration in the event of material misconduct and/or material 
misstatement or error of financial results. For full details see page 83.

Governance – Remuneration report – Directors’ remuneration policy – summary continued
Executive Directors’ policy on payment on loss of office
Historically, there have been no specific provisions for 
compensation on early termination (except for payment in lieu of 
holidays accrued but untaken) or loss of office due to a change 
of ownership of the Company. The Committee also reserves the 
right to make additional payments where such payments are 
made in good faith: (a) in discharge of an existing legal obligation 
(or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation); or 
(b) by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in 
connection with the termination of an Executive Director’s office 
or employment. The Committee will apply mitigation against any 
contractual obligations as it deems fair and reasonable and will 
seek legal advice on the Company’s liability to pay compensation. 
It also seeks to reduce the level of any compensation payable and 
takes into account, amongst other factors, the individual’s and the 
Group’s performance; the Director’s obligation to mitigate their 
own loss; and the Director’s length of service when calculating 
termination payments. The Committee reserves the right to 
phase any such payments if it deems that it is appropriate to do 
so. Any amount that the Committee decides to pay an Executive 
Director will be based on the main elements of Executive 
Remuneration namely, base salary, annual bonus (subject to the 
Committee’s discretion), benefits and pension. 
The Committee also takes into account the rules of the annual 
bonus and LTPP Schemes when determining any payments for 
loss of office as follows:
Annual bonus – in terms of the annual bonus, in accordance 
with the provisions contained within the service contracts, 
Executive Directors are not usually entitled to any bonus payment 
(other than in circumstances where they are deemed by the 
Committee as a ‘ good leaver’, which includes but is not limited 
to redundancy, retirement, ill-health or disability or any other 
circumstance which the Committee may decide), unless they 
remain employed and are not under notice as at the payment 
date. Any bonus payment for a ‘ good leaver’ will be based on the 
individual performance of the Executive Director concerned, as 
well as the Company’s performance during the relevant period. 
Such payment will be pro-rated depending on the proportion of 
the bonus period worked by the relevant individual.
Deferred bonus – for any bonus deferred into shares, if the 
Executive Director is deemed to be a ‘ good leaver’ (as defined 
above), he will be entitled to retain the shares subject to settling 
any tax and national insurance liability that may become due on 
release of the shares. In all other cases, the shares will lapse 
immediately on the date that the Executive Director’s employment 
with the Company ends and there is no entitlement to any 
compensation for the loss of the shares.
Recruitment of Executive Directors 
The Committee will determine the remuneration for any new 
Executive Director in accordance with the Policy as set out in 
the Future Policy Table on pages 64 to 69 of the 2014 Annual 
Report and Accounts and will take into consideration each of the 
following elements:
Salary and benefits – the Committee will take into account: 
market data for the scope of the job; remuneration for the 
relevant role; salaries of, and benefits provided, to existing 
Executive Directors; and the new Executive Director’s experience, 
location and current base salary and benefits package. In the 
event an Executive Director is recruited at below market levels, 
their base salary may be re-aligned over a period of time (e.g. 
two to three years) subject to their performance in the role. 
The Committee may also agree to cover relocation costs, if it is 
deemed appropriate.
Pension – Executive Directors will be auto-enrolled from 
the date of recruitment unless they opt-out. If an Executive 
Director chooses to opt–out they may elect to receive a pension 
supplement in cash. The Committee has discretion to determine 
the level of pension supplement to be awarded to each Executive 
Director, up to a maximum of 30% of base salary, having regard 
to the pension supplement given to existing Executive Directors. 
Alternatively, the Executive Director may choose to join the 
defined contribution money purchase pension plan provided they 
meet all of the eligibility criteria. The Executive Director also has 
the option to receive some of their pension entitlement in cash and 
have the remainder contributed to the defined contribution money 
purchase pension plan, provided this does not, in aggregate, 
exceed 30% of base salary.
LTPP – new Executive Directors may be able to participate in the 
LTPP on terms to be considered by the Committee on a case by 
case basis. Any award made to the new Executive Director will 
usually be on the same terms as set out in the Policy. The level of 
the award will be no greater than that made to existing Executive 
Directors and will be pro-rated based on the remaining time span 
of the relevant performance period. 
The Committee may also consider buying out incentive awards 
which an individual would forfeit upon leaving their current 
employer, again this would be reviewed on a case by case basis. 
The Committee would however in all cases seek validation of 
the value of any potential incentive that is being forfeited and 
take into account the proportion of the performance period 
remaining of the award, the type of award (i.e. cash/shares) 
and the performance achieved (or likely to be achieved). 
Replacement share awards, if any, will be capped at the amount 
forfeited and will be subject to the performance conditions 
applicable under the terms of the Company’s Executive Director 
share scheme in operation at the time.
Where an individual is recruited internally to the position of 
Executive Director, the Company will honour any pre-existing 
contractual commitments. Barratt Developments PLC

Legacy arrangements
In approving the Policy, authority is given to the Company to 
honour any previously disclosed commitments entered into with 
current or former Directors including, but not limited to, payment 
of pensions or the vesting/exercise of past share awards.
Clawback 
Both the annual bonus (including any deferred bonus and any 
matching element) and the LTPP are subject to the Company’s 
power of clawback (the ‘Clawback’) for a period of two years 
following vesting. The Clawback is applicable in respect of any 
annual bonus paid/deferred and to any share awards granted 
under the LTPP or the ESOS from 30 June 2010 onwards, 
subject in the case of HMRC approved options, to such approval. 
In addition, Clawback will also apply to any awards granted under 
any Senior Management share schemes.
The Clawback can be invoked if: 
a)  it is necessary to restate the Group’s accounts used to 
calculate a participant’s entitlement to bonus or share awards 
in circumstances where the original over-statement has led 
to a bonus being paid/deferred or share awards being granted 
which would not otherwise have been paid or granted; or 
b)  the participant is found guilty of any criminal activity in 
connection with his or her employment and this related to an 
act which led to a bonus being paid/deferred or share awards 
being granted to him or her. 
In such circumstances, the Committee may determine that the 
bonus and/or share award will be retrospectively recalculated. 
If bonus monies have been paid, the participant will be required 
to reimburse the Company for an amount up to the total amount 
of the net bonus paid, less any bonus that the Committee 
determines would have been paid regardless of the event in 
question. If share awards have been granted, the number of 
awards or options granted will be reduced accordingly. If the 
award has vested and shares have been issued to the participant, 
the participant will be required to repay the value of the relevant 
number of shares based on the Company’s closing share price as 
at the date the shares were issued.
In the event any Matching Awards have been granted to the 
Executive Director, these will lapse immediately unless the 
individual is leaving for a ‘permitted reason’ (this includes, but 
is not limited to, redundancy, retirement, ill-health or disability). 
If the Executive Director is leaving for a permitted reason, the 
unvested award will become vested and the number of shares 
subject to the award will be pro-rated based on the remaining 
time span of the performance period that have been completed 
and the level of the performance conditions that have been met 
up to that date. 
LTPP – under the rules of the LTPP, unless the Executive Director 
is deemed by the Committee to be a ‘ good leaver’ (as previously 
defined) any LTPP awards held by him will lapse on cessation 
of his employment. If he is a ‘ good leaver’, the number of shares 
subject to the award will be pro-rated based on the remaining 
time span of the relevant performance period completed by him. 
No shares will, however, be released to the Executive Director, 
until the normal vesting date, being three years from the date 
of grant. During this time the shares will continue to be subject 
to the relevant performance conditions until the end of the 
performance period, at which point the Committee will test the 
performance conditions and determine how much, if any, of the 
remaining shares will vest.
Change of control – the rules of each share scheme operated by 
the Company contain provisions relating to a change of control. 
In the event that a change of control does occur any unvested 
options/awards will become vested on the date of the relevant 
event. However, the number of options/awards that vest will be 
pro-rated depending on the remaining time span of the relevant 
performance period and the level of performance conditions 
achieved during that period. Options/awards which have already 
vested as at the date of the relevant event may still be exercised 
within the prescribed timescales set out in the rules.
Non-Executive directorships 
Subject to Board approval, Executive Directors are permitted to 
accept one Non-Executive directorship outside the Company and 
retain any fees received from such a position. Executive Directors 
are not allowed to take on the Chairmanship of any FTSE 100 
company. Board approval will not be given for any non-executive 
position where such appointment would lead to a material conflict 
of interest or would have an adverse effect on the Director’s ability 
to perform their duties to the Company.
Gifts to Directors on leaving employment
The Committee reserves the discretion to approve gifts to long 
serving Directors who are retiring or who are ‘ good leavers’ 
e.g. those leaving office for any reason other than dismissal 
or misconduct. The value of the gift for any one Director shall

1  Following the Company’s refinancing during FY13, the Committee informed each participant of the 2012/13 LTPP that it would be adjusting the vesting levels, at the end of the plan period, 30 June 2015, 
to ensure that participants did not benefit from the expected positive impact upon EPS arising from the refinancing for the relevant parts of those plan periods. Accordingly, the EPS threshold and stretch 
targets were increased by 2 pence each from 18 pence and 26 pence respectively.
2  The actual earnings per share of 45.5 pence has been rebased using the corporation tax rate applicable at the date on which the 2012/13 LTPP targets were set, as the subsequent reduction to the rate of 
corporation tax was not performance related. The actual earnings per share has also been rebased using the same number of shares in issue as used in the 2012/13 LTPP targets. The rebased earnings per 
share used for the purpose of determining vesting, which is directly comparable to the 2012/13 LTPP targets, was 44.5 pence.
The Committee considered the underlying financial performance of the Group and was satisfied that given the continued 
improvement in the Group’s financial results as illustrated on page 76, the above level of vesting of the 2012/13 LTPP was justified. 
Accordingly, the award details for each of the Executive Directors are as follows:

The 2014/15 LTPP is subject to three performance conditions, one-third TSR, one-third EPS and one-third ROCE. The levels of 
vesting against TSR are measured over a three-year period commencing 1 July 2014, and against EPS and ROCE for the financial 
year ending 30 June 2017. Given the commercial sensitivity of the EPS and ROCE targets to the Group’s future strategy, the 
Committee agreed that it would not publish these targets prospectively but would set out performance against the targets on an 
annual basis. Accordingly, if the performance period of the 2014/15 LTPP was for one year, commencing 1 July 2014 and the award 
had vested on 30 June 2015, the level of vesting would be as follows:

All conditional awards and share options are subject to an overriding Committee discretion, in that the Committee must be 
satisfied that the underlying financial performance of the Group over the performance period warrants the level of vesting as 
determined by applying the relevant targets. If the Committee is not of this view, it has the authority to reduce the level of vesting 
as it deems appropriate.

The last full actuarial valuation of the Scheme as at 30 November 
2013 showed a deficit of £34.8m calculated on the basis of the 
Scheme’s technical provisions. The Company and the Trustees 
of the Scheme have agreed a plan to address the shortfall which 
requires the Company to continue to make deficit reduction 
payments of £13.3m per annum until 30 November 2015, followed 
by payments of £9.5m per annum from 1 December 2015 until 
31 December 2016. The Company will discuss the funding 
requirements of the Scheme with the Trustees if any material 
change in the Group’s financial circumstances is anticipated. 
The valuation for the Financial Statements was updated to 30 June 
2015 by a qualified independent actuary and a surplus of £5.3m 
(2014: surplus of £3.1m) is included in the Group Balance Sheet as 
shown in note 28 of the Financial Statements. 
Members of the Scheme are also eligible for an insured lump 
sum of up to five times pensionable salary on death in service. 
Current employees who were members of the defined benefit 
section of the Scheme at closure also retain their dependants’ 
pension entitlements. 
No excess retirement benefits have been paid to or are receivable 
by current and/or past directors in respect of their qualifying 
services during the financial year and there are no arrangements 
in place that guarantee pensions with limited or no abatement on 
severance or early retirement.
Payments to Directors leaving the Group (Audited)
The Board made a gross payment of £11,000 to Bob Lawson as a 
retirement gift. Further details can be found on page 84.)
No payments were made in respect of loss of office during  
the year ended 30 June 2015 (30 June 2014: £nil).

Chart 1, prepared in accordance with the BIS Regulations, shows 
the TSR performance over the last six years against the FTSE 250 
(excluding investment trusts) and against an unweighted index of 
listed housebuilders. The Board has chosen these comparative 
indices as the Group and its major competitors are constituents of 
one or both of these indices. The TSR has been calculated using a 
fair method in accordance with the BIS Regulations.
Dilution 
On maturity or vesting of any of its share incentive schemes the 
Company satisfies the awards through: a new issue of shares; 
market purchases; or the Employee Benefit Trust (the ‘EBT’). 
During the financial year ended 30 June 2015, the Company 
continued to satisfy all outstanding Executive options and awards 
under the LTPP, 2009/10 ESOS, the DBP and the Sharesave 
through a new issue of shares, subject to the dilution limits 
described below. Awards made to individuals below Senior 
Management level continued to be satisfied through shares 
currently held, or to be purchased in the market, by the EBT. 
The Company regularly monitors the number of shares issued 
under its schemes and the impact on dilution limits. The Company 
is satisfied that as at 30 June 2015 its usage of shares is compliant 
with the relevant dilution limits set by the Investment Association 
in respect of all share plans (10% of the Company’s issued share 
capital in any rolling ten-year period) and discretionary share 
plans (5% of the Company’s issued share capital in any rolling ten-
year period). In the event that the outstanding options under each 
of the schemes to be satisfied through a new issue of shares were 
to vest and had been exercised on 30 June 2015, the resulting 
issue of new shares would represent 2.5% of the Company’s 
issued share capital as at that date. 
Executive Directors’ pension arrangements 
The Company’s pension policy for Executive Directors is that 
on joining the Group they will be auto-enrolled unless they 
choose to opt-out. Upon opting-out, the Executive Director may 
choose to receive a cash supplement (which does not count for 
incentive purposes) and/or participate in the Company’s defined 
contribution money purchase pension plan. Each of the Executive 
Directors has opted to receive a cash supplement in lieu of 
pension, which for FY15 was equal to 30% of base salary (reducing 
to 25% for FY16). Only the base salary element of a Director’s 
remuneration is pensionable.
Defined benefit section
Steven Boyes was a deferred member of the defined benefit 
section of the Barratt Group Pension and Life Assurance Scheme 
(the ‘Scheme’) during the year ended 30 June 2015.
The Scheme was closed to new entrants in 2001 and on 30 June 
2009, the Company exercised its consent under the rules of the 
Scheme and agreed to cease offering future accrual of defined 
benefits for current members. Members of the Scheme became 
eligible to join the defined contribution money purchase section  
of the Scheme with effect from 1 July 2009.
Up until 30 June 2009, Steven Boyes was an active member of 
the defined benefit section of the Scheme. This entitlement was 
based on a 1/60 accrual rate and a normal retirement age of 65. 
Since 1 July 2009, Steven Boyes has been entitled to receive a 
cash supplement equal to 30% (25% from 1 July 2015) of his base 
salary per annum. Barratt Developments PLC

a special cash payment of 10.0 pence per share, value of which has been calculated on the number 
of shares in issue (excluding those held by the EBT) as at 30 June 2015. The final dividend and special 
cash payment, if approved by shareholders at the 2015 AGM, will be paid on 20 November 2015 to 
those shareholders on the register at the close of business on 30 October 2015.
Non-Executive directorships
During the year, Mark Clare received a total fee of £72,351 in 
respect of his positions as the Senior Independent Director and 
a Non-Executive Director of United Utilities Group PLC. He has 
retained this fee in full. Mark Clare is also a trustee of the BRE 
Trust and UK GBC Limited, a member of the Government’s 
Construction Leadership Council and he also sits on the CBI 
Construction Council. Mark Clare does not receive any fees for 
these positions. The time commitment (excluding travelling and 
pre-reading time) expected, in aggregate, for these positions is 
approximately 100 hours per annum. Neither David Thomas nor 
Steven Boyes held any Non-Executive directorships with other 
companies during the year.

Governance – Remuneration report – Annual report on remuneration continued
a  Statement of implementation of the 
Policy for FY16
Executive Directors’ remuneration for FY16 will be based on the 
Group’s remuneration strategy as set out on page 77 and will be 
implemented in accordance with the Policy as follows:
Base salary
With effect from 1 July 2015, David Thomas took over as Chief 
Executive from Mark Clare. Accordingly, to reflect the change 
in role, his salary was increased to £676,000 per annum. 
In addition, Steven Boyes’ annual salary was increased to 
£535,000 commencing 1 July 2015 to reflect the additional 
responsibilities that he has assumed. These include, but are not 
limited to, responsibility for the Group’s commercial business, 
Wilson Bowden Developments, health and safety and insurance. 
The latter two are as a consequence of Tom Keevil notifying the 
Board of his intention to retire from the Company in January 2016. 
No salary increase was awarded to Mark Clare, who stepped 
down from the Board on 31 July 2015 but remains employed by 
the Group up until 31 October 2015, to ensure an orderly handover. 
Following these increases, Executive Directors’ salaries 
remain appropriately within the range for the housebuilding 
sector and the wider population of similar sized companies. 
Executive Director salaries, with effect from 1 July 2015, 
are therefore as follows:
Table 19 – Executive Directors’ salary increases
Executive Director
Salary with 
effect from  
1 July 2014

effect from  
1 July 2015  
£000
Mark Clare 701 701
David Thomas 454 676
Steven Boyes 454 535
Pension
Each of the Executive Directors has opted to receive a cash salary 
supplement in lieu of a pension. The Executive Board changes 
provided the Committee with the opportunity to adjust the cash 
salary supplement for FY16 from 30% to 25%, which is in line with 
current market practice.
Advice/advisers 
In carrying out its principal responsibilities, the Committee 
has the authority to obtain the advice of external independent 
remuneration consultants and is solely responsible for their 
appointment, retention and termination. During the year, the 
Committee has taken advice from independent advisers, 
New Bridge Street (‘NBS’), a part of Aon plc. NBS was initially 
appointed by the Committee as its remuneration consultant in 
2008 and is a founder signatory to the Remuneration Consultants 
Group’s Code of Conduct. In addition to advising the Committee, 
NBS also provided the Company with advice on implementing 
decisions made by the Committee and remuneration 
benchmarking. NBS’s fees for providing such advice amounted 
to £54,344 (2014: £26,716) for the year ended 30 June 2015. 
In line with best practice, the Committee assesses, from time 
to time, whether the appointment remains appropriate or if it 
should be put out to tender as part of its effectiveness review. 
NBS’s appointment was reconfirmed by the Committee in June 
2015 after an annual review of the quality of the advice received 
and fees charged. The Committee is comfortable that the NBS 
engagement partner and team, which provide remuneration 
advice to the Committee, do not have any connections with the 
Company that may impair their independence or objectivity. 
The Committee reviewed the potential for conflicts of interest 
and judged that there were appropriate safeguards against 
such conflicts.
Aon plc also provided broking services to the Company in respect 
of private medical insurance, Death in Service benefits and Group 
Income Protection.
In addition, Slaughter and May, the Company’s corporate legal 
advisers, have also provided advice to the Committee as and 
when necessary.
The Committee also receives input into its decision-making from 
the Chief Executive, the Group General Counsel and Company 
Secretary and the Group Human Resources Director, none of 
whom were present at any time when their own remuneration 
was being considered. Barratt Developments PLC

Strategic Report Governance Other Information Financial Statements
The individual targets for each performance measure are commercially sensitive and therefore not disclosed in this year’s report. 
We will, however, provide full disclosure on the targets and performance against them in next year’s Annual report on remuneration.
The Group’s profitability remains a key measure, however, in order to drive sustainable value this must be achieved through an 
appropriate capital structure and in line with the risk profile of the business. The annual bonus performance measures have been 
reviewed against last year’s and the following changes have been made to align them with the Company’s strategy: 
 > the weighting of profit before tax has been reduced to give it a more appropriate focus relative to other measures; and 
 > the introduction of capital employed to further align the interests of Executive Directors with those of shareholders.
The Committee will continue to have an overriding discretion in respect of any bonus payment in accordance with its Remuneration 
Policy. In addition, any bonus awarded for FY16 will be subject to Clawback (see page 83).
Executive Directors’ shareholding requirement 
The Executive Directors’ shareholding requirement has been enhanced so that in addition to the Total Shareholding described on page 
80, the Chief Executive and other Executive Directors must also hold a minimum ‘owned’ level of shareholding (‘Owned Shareholdings’) 
as part of their Total Shareholdings. The Chief Executive must have an Owned Shareholding of 67% of salary and the other Executive 
Directors, 50% of salary.
The Chief Executive and other Executive Directors will be expected to reach these levels of holding no later than the fifth anniversary of 
them joining the Board, with progress being made throughout the period. Unless there are exceptional circumstances, that will need to 
be agreed by the Committee, they will not be allowed to sell shares unless they reach the levels specified. 
Shares that qualify as ‘Owned Shareholdings’
 > Shares held directly;
 > Shares held by a spouse, partner or children under 18;
 > Shares held in an ISA or PEP; and 
 > Shares held in a pension or trust arrangement.
All participants who have not built up the required level of ‘Owned and Total Shareholdings’ by the end of the defined period, will not be 
eligible for inclusion in future share-based incentive schemes, unless there are exceptional circumstances, which would need to be 
approved by the Remuneration Committee. 
To be classified as a ‘ good leaver’ from the Company, the Chief Executive and the other Executive Directors, will be required to commit 
to continue retaining a Total Shareholding of 100% and 75% respectively of the value of their final salary, in the Company’s shares for 
two years post their leaving date. 
Annual bonus
Executive Directors and Senior Management will participate in the Group’s annual bonus scheme in accordance with the Policy. 
The performance measures, the reasons for selecting these measures and the maximum bonus payment against each of them 
expressed as a percentage of salary for FY16 will be:

Governance – Remuneration report – Annual report on remuneration continued
LTPP
The level of the LTPP award to be granted to Executive Directors and Senior Management during FY16 will be in line with that set out 
in the Policy. The Committee is cognisant that such an award should be subject to performance targets which are stretching and 
challenging whilst aligned with the short and long term performance of the Group and total shareholder return. Accordingly, the 
Committee has agreed that the extent to which the LTPP award to be granted in FY16 (the ‘2015/16 LTPP’) will vest, will be dependent 
on three independent performance conditions as follows:
Performance condition Reason selected

EPS and ROCE performance targets
As per last year, the specific EPS and ROCE targets remain 
commercially sensitive in terms of the Group’s future strategy 
and therefore these targets have not been disclosed in this 
report. We will, however, provide an update on EPS and ROCE 
performance against targets on an annual basis in line with 
feedback that we receive from shareholders on the disclosure 
in respect of the 2014/15 LTPP. The specific target range for 
the 2015/16 LTPP will remain designed to incentivise significant 
performance improvement across the business, deliver a strong 
return to shareholders and represent a stretching target for 
Executive Directors and Senior Management. When setting 
the target range for the 2015/16 LTPP, the Committee has 
also taken into account the Board’s assessment of the optimal 
scale of business, the Group’s ROCE target and current 
market consensus.
Each of the above performance conditions will remain subject 
to an overriding Committee discretion as set out in the Policy. 
Clawback and the two-year continued holding period on 
any shares (net of any shares sold to satisfy tax and national 
insurance liabilities) vesting, will also apply.
Executive Directors’ policy on payment on loss of office
For new appointments to the Board, the terms of a Director’s 
service contract have been revised so that the Company can, at its 
discretion, terminate a Director’s appointment and pay them only 
a monthly salary for the 12 month notice period or until such time 
as the Director secures another job, whichever is the earlier. 
New Chief Financial Officer
On joining the Group, Neil Cooper, the new Chief Financial Officer 
Designate, will receive a salary of £454,000 per annum (pro-rata) 
for FY16. This is exactly the same as David Thomas’ salary prior 
to his appointment as Chief Executive. His remuneration package 
will be in line with the other Executive Directors as detailed above. 
Following advice from NBS, Neil’s long term incentives have been 
structured to replace those he is leaving behind at his previous 
employer, William Hill plc, and are in accordance with the Policy. 
Consequently, vesting dates, use of shares and performance 
linking will be preserved. Full details will be included in our FY16 
Annual Report and Accounts. Barratt Developments PLC

Arrangements with past directors (audited) 
Mark Clare stepped down from his position as Group Chief 
Executive on 30 June 2015 and subsequently from the Board 
on 31 July 2015. He will remain employed by the Group up to 
and including 31 October 2015. From 1 August until 31 October 
2015, his terms of employment will remain as per his existing 
service contract to ensure an orderly handover to his successor. 
All payments to him, including those made post-employment, will 
be made in accordance with the Policy. He continues to receive 
his base salary and benefits (holiday, pension contribution, life 
assurance and the other benefits) at pre-1 July 2015 levels. 
He also received an annual bonus totalling £979,892 in respect 
of FY15 but will not receive any payment in lieu of notice nor 
any annual bonus payment for FY16. He will not be granted any 
award under the LTPP during FY16, however the awards made 
in October 2012, 2013 and 2014 will subsist and will vest on a 
pro-rata basis on the normal dates, subject to the respective 
performance conditions and other rules applicable to the LTPP 
(including clawback provisions). The Committee has also agreed 
that the shares currently held for Mark under the Deferred Bonus 
Plan will be released to him (upon settlement of any tax and 
national insurance due) upon his retirement from the Company on 
31 October 2015. 
Any leaving gift to be awarded to Mark on his retirement on 
31 October 2015 will be valued at no more than £5,000 with any tax 
and national insurance due on this being settled by the Company. 
Full details of the actual payments made and shares released to 
Mark will be included in the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts. 
Non-Executive Directors’ fees 
The Board reviewed the fees for the Non-Executive Directors 
(including the Chairman) and concluded that no fee increase 
should be awarded to the Chairman. However, in respect of 
the Non-Executive Directors, given that they had not received 
an increase since 2012 and to ensure that the base fee level 
appropriately reflects the time commitment and responsibilities 
involved, it was agreed that base fees should be increased to 
£56,000 per annum with effect from 1 July 2015. The additional 
fees for the Chairmen of the Committees and to the Senior 
Independent Director remain the same. Accordingly, the annual

Subject to the Articles, the Act and any directions given by special 
resolution, the business of the Company is ultimately managed 
by the Board who may exercise all the powers of the Company, 
whether relating to the management of the business of the 
Company or otherwise. In particular, the Board may exercise all

the Company, together with those who have held or hold these 
positions as officers of other Group companies or of associate or 
affiliated companies and members of the Executive Committee, 
to the extent permitted by law and the Articles, against all 
liability arising in respect of any act or omission in the course 
of performing their duties. In addition, the Company maintains 
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance for each Director of the 
Group and its associated companies. 
No Director of the Company or of any associated company shall 
be accountable to the Company or the members for any benefit 
provided pursuant to the Articles and receipt of any such benefit 
shall not disqualify any person from being or becoming a Director 
of the Company.
Related party transactions
The Board and certain members of Senior Management are 
related parties within the definition of IAS 24 (Revised) ‘Related 
Party Disclosures’ (‘IAS 24’) and the Board are related parties 
within the definition of Chapter 11 of the UK Listing Rules 
(‘Chapter 11’). There is no difference between transactions 
with key personnel of the Company and transactions with key 
personnel of the Group.
During the year, the Company entered into the following 
transaction which, for the purposes of IAS 24, is considered to be 
a ‘related party transaction’: 
In August 2014, Mark Clare, then Group Chief Executive, reserved 
an apartment (including a car parking space) from Fulham Wharf 
LLP, a joint venture partnership between BDW Trading Limited 
(‘BDW’) (the Company’s main trading subsidiary) and London and 
Quadrant Housing Trust (L&Q), at a purchase price of £1,692,350. 
This purchase was conducted at a fair and reasonable market 
price based on four independent market valuations and similar 
comparable transactions at that time. An amount of £2,500 
was paid on reservation and a deposit of £166,735 was paid on 
13 October 2014. The remaining balance will become payable 
on legal completion, which is scheduled for December 2015, in 
accordance with the Group’s normal terms of trading.
Fulham Wharf LLP is not controlled by and is not a subsidiary 
undertaking of the Company.
On notification by Mark Clare of the above transaction, the Board 
sought advice from its legal advisers and corporate brokers 
in respect of the application of Chapter 11 and section 190 of 
the Act (Substantial Property Transactions) (‘section 190’) to 
the transactions. The advice received concluded that Chapter 
11 and section 190 did not extend to LLPs and therefore the 
provisions of Chapter 11 and section 190 did not apply to either of 
these transactions. Consequently, no shareholder approval was 
required for the transaction.
No other related party transactions that require disclosure, have 
been entered into during the year under review.
Disclosure of information to auditor 
So far as each of the Directors is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information (that is, information needed by the Company’s auditor 
in connection with preparing its report) of which the Company’s 
auditor is not aware.
Each of the Directors has taken all reasonable steps that they 
ought to have taken in accordance with their duty as a Director 
to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information 
and to ensure that the Company’s auditor is aware of that 
information. This confirmation is given and should be interpreted 
in accordance with the provisions of section 418(2) of the Act. Barratt Developments PLC

Governance – Other statutory disclosures continued
Political donations and expenditure
No political donations or expenditure were made or incurred 
during the year (2014: £nil). 
Offices
The Group had 27 offices (excluding those offices undertaking an 
administrative function only) located throughout Britain at the end 
of the financial year. The Group also has a representative office in 
Beijing, China. A full list of the Group’s offices and their locations 
can be obtained from the Group General Counsel and Company 
Secretary at the registered office of the Company or from the 
Company’s website www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk.
Capital structure
The Company has a single class of share capital which is divided 
into ordinary shares of 10 pence each. All issued shares are 
in registered form and are fully paid. Details of the Company’s 
issued share capital and of the movements in the share 
capital during the year can be found in note 29 to the Financial 
Statements on page 149.
Subject to the Articles, the Act and other shareholders’ rights, 
shares are at the disposal of the Board. At each AGM the Board 
seeks authorisation from its shareholders to allot shares. 
At the AGM held on 12 November 2014, the Directors were given 
authority to allot shares up to a nominal value of £32,838,204 
(representing one-third of the nominal value of the Company’s 
issued share capital as at 29 September 2014), such authority to 
remain valid until the end of the 2015 AGM or, if earlier, until the 
close of business on 11 February 2016. A resolution to renew this 
authority will be proposed at the 2015 AGM.
Rights and obligations attaching to shares
Subject to any rights attached to existing shares, shares may 
be issued with such rights and restrictions as the Company may 
by ordinary resolution decide, or (if there is no such resolution 
or so far as it does not make specific provision) as the Board 
may decide. 
Subject to the Act, the Articles specify that rights attached to 
any existing class of shares may be varied either with the written 
consent of the holders of not less than three-fourths in nominal 
value of the issued shares of that class (excluding any shares 
of that class held as treasury shares), or with the sanction of a 
special resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the 
holders of those shares. The rights conferred upon the holders 
of any shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided 
in the rights attaching to those shares, be deemed to be varied 
by the creation or issue of further shares ranking pari passu 
with them. 
Voting
Subject to any special terms as to voting upon any shares which 
may be issued or may at the relevant time be held, every member 
present in person or by proxy at a general meeting or class 
meeting has one vote upon a show of hands or, upon a poll vote, 
one vote for every share of which such member is a holder. In the 
case of joint holders of a share, the vote of the senior who tenders 
a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the 
exclusion of votes of the other joint holders and seniority shall be 
determined by the order in which the names stand in the register 
in respect of the joint holding. 
In accordance with the Act, each member is entitled to appoint 
one or more proxies, and in the case of corporations, more than 
one corporate representative to exercise all or any of their rights 
to attend, speak and vote on their behalf at a general meeting or 
class meeting. The timescales for appointing proxies are set out 
in the Notice of the 2015 AGM. 
No member shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting or 
class meeting in respect of any shares held by them if any call or 
other sum then payable by them in respect of that share remains 
unpaid or if they have been served with a restriction notice (as 
defined in the Articles) after failure to provide the Company with 
information concerning interests in those shares required to be 
provided under the Act. 
Transfer of shares
Shares in the Company may be in uncertificated or certificated 
form. Title to uncertificated shares may be transferred by 
means of a relevant system and certificated shares may be 
transferred by an instrument of transfer as approved by the 
Board. The transferor of a share is deemed to remain the holder 
until the transferee’s name is entered into the Company’s register 
of members.
There are no restrictions on the transfer of shares except as 
follows. The Board may, in its absolute discretion and without 
giving any reason, decline to register any transfer of any share 
which is not a fully paid share. Registration of a transfer of an 
uncertificated share may be refused in the circumstances set out 
in the uncertificated securities rules (as defined in the Articles) 
and where, in the case of a transfer to joint holders, the number of 
joint holders to whom the uncertificated share is to be transferred 
exceeds four. 
The Board may decline to register a transfer of a certificated 
share unless the instrument of transfer: (i) is duly stamped or 
certified or otherwise shown to the satisfaction of the Board to 
be exempt from stamp duty and is accompanied by the relevant 
share certificate and such other evidence of the right to transfer 
as the Board may reasonably require; (ii) is in respect of only one 
class of share; (iii) if joint transferees, is in favour of not more than  Barratt Developments PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2015

Strategic Report Governance Other Information Financial Statements
four such transferees; or (iv) where the transfer is requested by 
a person with a 0.25% interest (as defined in the Articles) if such 
a person has been served with a restriction notice after failure 
to provide the Company with information concerning interests in 
those shares required to be provided under the Act, unless the 
transfer is shown to the Board to be pursuant to an arm’s length 
sale (as defined in the Articles).
Shareholder authority for purchase of own shares 
At the Company’s AGM held on 12 November 2014, shareholders 
gave authority to the Company to buy back up to an aggregate of 
98,514,610 ordinary shares (representing 10% of the Company’s 
issued share capital). This authority is valid until the end of the 
2015 AGM or, if earlier, until the close of business on 11 February 
2016. Under the authority there is a minimum and maximum price 
to be paid for such shares. Any shares which are bought back 
may be held as treasury shares or, if not so held, will be cancelled 
immediately upon completion of the purchase, thereby reducing 
the Company’s issued share capital.
No purchases had been made under this authority as at the date 
of this Annual Report and Accounts. A resolution renewing the 
authority will be proposed at the 2015 AGM.
Dividends and distributions 
Subject to the provisions of the Act, the Company may by ordinary 
resolution from time to time declare dividends for payment to the 
holders of the ordinary shares of 10 pence each, of an amount 
which does not exceed the amount recommended by the Board. 
The Board may pay interim dividends, and also any fixed rate 
dividend, whenever the financial position of the Company, if in 
the opinion of the Board, circumstances justify their payment. 
If the Board acts in good faith, it is not liable to holders of shares 
with preferred or pari passu rights for losses arising from the 
payment of interim or fixed dividends on other shares. The Board 
may withhold payment of all or any part of any dividends or 
other monies payable in respect of the Company’s shares from 
a person with a 0.25% interest if such person has been served 
with a restriction notice after failure to provide the Company with 
information concerning interests in those shares required to be 
provided under the Act.
Shareholder arrangements to waive dividends 
The Barratt Developments Employee Benefit Trust (the ‘EBT’) 
holds ordinary shares in the Company for the purpose of 
satisfying options and awards that have been granted under the 
various employee share schemes operated by the Company. 
Details of the shares so held are set out in note 29 to the 
Financial Statements.
The EBT has agreed to waive all or any future right to dividend 
payments on shares held within the EBT and these shares do 
not count in the calculation of the weighted average number of 
shares used to calculate EPS until such time as they are vested 
to the relevant employee. 
The Trustees of the EBT may vote or abstain from voting on 
shares held in the EBT in any way they think fit and in doing so 
may take into account both financial and non-financial interests 
of the beneficiaries of the EBT or their dependants. 
Employee share schemes
Details of employee share schemes are set out in note 30 to the 
Financial Statements.
Employment policy and involvement
(i) Employment and diversity
The Group is committed to seeking to develop the talents of its 
employees so that they can maximise their career potential and 
providing rewarding careers in an atmosphere that engenders 
equal opportunities for all. Selection for employment and 
promotion is based on merit, following an objective assessment 
of ability and experience of candidates, after giving full and 
fair consideration to all applications (including individuals with 
disabilities). The Group is also committed to ensuring that its 
workplaces are free from discrimination. The Group strives to 
ensure that its policies and practices provide equal opportunities 
in respect of issues such as training, career development and 
promotion for all existing or potential staff irrespective of gender, 
race, ethnic origin, colour, religion, physical disability, marital 
status, sexual orientation or age. Every effort is made to retain 
and support employees who become disabled whilst working 
within the Group. 
(ii) Employee engagement
The Board recognises that appropriate employee engagement 
is a key factor in the long term success of the Group. It utilises a 
comprehensive employee engagement programme with the aim 
of creating a strong, shared culture. All employees are invited to 
take part in an online engagement survey each year. The results 
of this survey are fed back to each operating division who use 
the results to formulate plans for maintaining or improving 
engagement in the following year. 
(iii) Employee communications
A key part of effective employee engagement is communication. 
The Company seeks to ensure that all significant events, 
economic factors and financial updates and the impact of 
these on the performance of the Group are communicated 
to employees. This is mainly channelled through the Group’s 
intranet and the use of email alerts, core briefings and regular 
newsletters. Additionally, the Chief Executive regularly briefs  Barratt Developments PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
100
Governance – Other statutory disclosures continued
senior and middle management via conference calls and bulletins 
which gives them the opportunity to ask questions and enter into 
dialogue. Individually and collectively, the Board and the Executive 
Committee members visit operating divisions and sites frequently 
in order to assess operational performance, engage with 
employees on a one-to-one basis and gain first-hand experience 
of employees’ aspirations and concerns.
(iv) Future talent
The Group runs a number of programmes for new entrants 
through our ‘Future Talent Strategy’. The Group currently has 
71 graduates across our two-year and one-year schemes, 54 of 
which commenced their training in September 2014. In addition, 
60 delegates have commenced our bespoke Foundation Degree 
in Residential Development and Construction in partnership with 
Sheffield Hallam University. We are currently training 334 Trade, 
Technical and Commercial apprentices and 20 undergraduate 
students on a paid 12-month industrial placement programme. 
(v) Employee training and development
The Group has a suite of leadership and management 
development programmes aimed at all levels within the 
organisation. The programmes are designed and delivered 
internally and are tailored to the needs of the business.
The Group also offers the Barratt Academy, a staged programme 
to enable employee development from apprentice to site 
manager as well as within the areas of technical, commercial 
and sales. Succession planning is in place across the Group 
and the leadership programmes assist with the development of 
individuals as part of this process.
(vi) Employee Sharesave Scheme
In April 2015, the Company invited all eligible employees of the 
Group to participate in the seventh grant under the Savings 
Related Share Option Scheme (the ‘2015 Sharesave’) which was 
approved by shareholders at the Company’s Annual General 
Meeting (‘AGM’) held in November 2008. The invitations for 
the 2015 Sharesave allowed eligible employees to contribute 
a maximum of £500 per month in one or a combination of 
Sharesave schemes as per the previous year. This gave those 
individuals who had participated in previous grants under the 
Sharesave the opportunity to increase their savings and gave 
other employees (new and existing) the chance to participate 
in the 2015 Sharesave and become more involved in the 
Group’s performance. As at 30 June 2015, approximately 
45% of employees participate in one or more of the active 
Sharesave schemes. 
Articles of Association
The Company’s Articles of Association (the ‘Articles’) contain 
regulations which deal with matters such as the appointment 
and removal of Directors, Directors’ interests and proceedings 
at general and Board meetings. Any amendments to the Articles 
may be made in accordance with the provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006 by way of a special resolution at a general meeting.
Approach to tax and tax governance
For all taxes, it is the Group’s aim to ensure it accurately 
calculates and pays the tax that is due at the correct time. 
Whilst the Group does seek to minimise its tax liabilities through 
the use of legitimate routine tax planning, it does not participate 
in aggressive tax planning schemes. The Group also seeks to 
be transparent in its dealings with HM Revenue & Customs and 
has regular dialogue with its representatives to discuss both 
developments in the business and the ongoing tax position. 
The Group Finance Director retains overall responsibility for 
oversight of the tax affairs of the Group. He is the named Senior 
Accounting Officer and receives regular updates on the tax 
position. In addition, taxation is discussed by the Audit Committee 
at least annually. 
Significant agreements 
The following significant agreements contain provisions entitling 
the counterparties to exercise termination or other rights in the 
event of a change of control of the Company:
 > The revolving credit facility agreement dated 14 May 2013 (as 
amended on 17 December 2014) made between, amongst 
others, the Company, Lloyds Bank Plc (as the facility agent) 
and the banks and financial institutions named therein as 
lenders (the ‘Revolving Credit Facility Agreement’) contains a 
prepayment provision at the election of each lender on change 
of control. The Company must notify the facility agent promptly 
upon becoming aware of the change of control. After the 
occurrence of a change of control, the facility agent shall 
(if a lender so requests within 20 days of being notified of the 
change of control) by notice to the Company, on the date falling 
30 days after the change of control, cancel the commitment 
of such lender under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement 
and declare all amounts outstanding in respect of such lender 
under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement immediately 
due and payable. The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also 
contains a provision such that, following a change of control, a 
lender is not obliged to fund any further drawdown of the facility 
(other than rollover loans). For these purposes, a ‘change of 
control’ occurs if any person or group of persons ‘acting in 
concert’ (as defined in the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers) 
gains control (as defined in the Corporation Tax Act 2010) of 
the Company. 
 > Each of the note purchase agreements entered into in respect of 
the Group’s privately placed notes (being the US$80m of notes 
issued pursuant to the following note purchase agreements: 
(i) a note purchase agreement in respect of the issue of US$15m 
notes dated 10 May 2011 (as amended and restated on 14 May 
2013 and as amended on 17 December 2014); and (ii) a note 
purchase agreement in respect of the issue of US$65m notes 
also dated 10 May 2011 (as amended and restated on 14 May 
2013 and as amended on 17 December 2014)) contains a change 
of control prepayment provision. Each such control provision  Barratt Developments PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
101
Strategic Report Governance Other Information Financial Statements
provides that promptly after the Company becomes aware that a 
change of control has occurred, the Company shall notify all the 
holders of the notes of the same and give the noteholders the 
option to require the Company to prepay at par all outstanding 
amounts (principal and interest) under the notes. If a noteholder 
accepts such offer of prepayment, such prepayment shall take 
place on a business day that is not more than 90 days after the 
Company notified the noteholders of the change of control. 
For these purposes a ‘change of control’ means the acquisition 
by a person or a group of persons ‘acting in concert’ (as defined 
in the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers) such that they gain 
beneficial ownership of more than 50% of the issued share 
capital of the Company carrying voting rights. 
 > The £100m term facility agreement between, amongst others, 
the Company and Prudential/M&G UK Companies Financing 
Fund LP dated 10 May 2011 (as amended and restated on 14 May 
2013 and as amended on 17 December 2014) also contains a 
prepayment provision on a change of control at the election of 
each lender; such prepayment provision is the same as that 
described for the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (save for 
the fact that the term loan is fully drawn and so the restrictions 
on drawing described for the Revolving Credit Facility 
Agreement do not apply).
 > Each of the debt facility agreements (based on a proforma 
agreement agreed in October 2012) between the Company (as 
guarantor), BDW (as borrower and developer) and the Homes 
and Communities Agency (‘HCA’) (as lender), whereby the 
HCA has made up to £33m (in aggregate) of project financing 
available to fund up to 20 development sites, contains a 
provision requiring BDW to obtain the consent of the HCA 
on a change in control of the Company, BDW or any of their 
holding companies (if relevant). The HCA is entitled to withhold 
its consent to such a change in control if the new controller 
does not have sufficient reputation, financial standing or 
organisational standing and capacity. A failure to: (i) obtain the 
HCA’s consent to a change in control; and (ii) provide the HCA 
with notice of the change in control within a specified time 
period, is an event of default under each of these agreements. 
On such an event of default the HCA may, by notice in writing to 
BDW, terminate each debt facility agreement and require BDW 
to prepay the project financing. For these purposes a ‘change in 
control’ means the acquisition by a person or a group of persons 
acting together such that they gain beneficial ownership of 
more than 50% of the issued share capital or voting rights of the 
relevant company, have the right to appoint the majority of the 
Directors of the relevant company or otherwise control the votes 
at board meetings of the relevant company.
The note purchase agreements also impose upon the holders 
customary restrictions on resale or transfer of the notes, such as 
the transfer being subject to a de minimis amount.
Going concern
In determining the appropriate basis of preparation of the 
Financial Statements, the Directors are required to consider 
whether the Group can continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future.
The Group’s business activities, together with factors which the 
Directors consider are likely to affect its future development, 
financial performance and financial position are set out in the 
Strategic Report on pages 2 to 45. The material financial and 
operational risks and uncertainties that may have an impact upon 
the Group’s performance and their mitigation are outlined on 
pages 40 to 45 and financial risks including liquidity risk, market 
risk, credit risk and capital risk are outlined in note 27 to the 
Financial Statements.
The financial performance of the Group is dependent upon the 
wider economic environment in which the Group operates. 
As explained in the Managing Risk section on pages 40 to 45, 
factors that particularly affect the performance of the Group 
include changes in the macroeconomic environment including 
buyer confidence, availability of mortgage finance for the Group’s 
customers and interest rates.
The Group has total committed bank facilities and private 
placement notes of £848.3m. The final maturity of these 
facilities range from August 2017 to July 2021, with £150.0m 
of the revolving credit facility maturing in December 2017 and 
£550.0m of the revolving credit facility maturing in December 
2019. The committed facilities and private placement notes 
provide appropriate headroom above our current forecast 
debt requirements. 
In addition to these committed borrowing facilities, the Group has 
secured £27.9m of financing from the Government’s ‘Get Britain 
Building’ and ‘Growing Places Fund’ schemes. These funds 
are repayable between December 2015 and March 2018. 
Further committed loan facilities of £11.5m are available under 
agreements with local government which are due to be repaid 
between July 2015 and March 2020.
Accordingly, after making enquiries and having considered 
forecasts and appropriate sensitivities, the Directors have 
formed a judgement, at the time of approving the Financial 
Statements, that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group 
has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future, being at least 12 months from the date 
of these Financial Statements. For this reason, they continue 
to adopt the going concern basis in the preparation of these 
Financial Statements.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
Financial Statements and accounting records
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and Accounts including the Directors’ remuneration report and 
the Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. The Directors are required 
by the International Accounting Standards Regulation (the ‘IAS 
Regulation’) to prepare the Group Financial Statements under 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union (‘IFRS’) and have also elected to prepare the 
Parent Company Financial Statements in accordance with IFRS. 
The Financial Statements are also required by law to be properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and Article 
4 of the IAS Regulation. Under the Disclosure and Transparency 
Rules, the Directors must not approve the Accounts unless they 
are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for 
that period.
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that Financial 
Statements present fairly for each financial year the Company’s 
financial position, financial performance and cash flows. 
This requires the faithful representation of the effects of 
transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the 
definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income 
and expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards 
Board’s ‘Framework for the preparation and presentation 
of financial statements’. In virtually all circumstances, a fair 
presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable 
IFRS. Directors are also required to:
 > properly select and apply accounting policies;
 > present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
 > provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRS are insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and
 > make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the Financial Statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Fair, balanced and understandable
The Board considers, on the advice of the Audit Committee, 
that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, are fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.
Directors’ responsibility statement
The Directors confirm that, to the best of each person’s knowledge:
a)  the Group and Parent Company Financial Statements in this 
Annual Report and Accounts, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRS, Standing Interpretation Committee 
interpretations as adopted and endorsed by the European 
Union, International Financial Reporting Interpretations 
Committee interpretations and those parts of the Companies 
Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS, give 
a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position 
and profit or loss of the Company and of the Group taken as a 
whole; and
b)  the Annual Report and Accounts includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the position 
of the Company and the Group taken as a whole, together with 
a description of the principal risks and uncertainties they face.
The Directors of the Company and their functions are listed on 
pages 46 and 47.

Opinion on the financial statements of Barratt Developments PLC
In our opinion:
 > the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of 
the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 30 June 
2015 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
 > the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;
 > the Parent Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006; and
 > the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards 
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise the Consolidated income 
statement, the Group and Parent Company statements of 
comprehensive income, the Group and Parent Company 
statements of changes in shareholders’ equity, the Group and 
Parent Company balance sheets, the Group and Parent Company 
cash flow statements, the Accounting policies, the Impact of 
standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective, the 
Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation 
Uncertainty and the related notes 1 to 36. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable 
law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and, as 
regards the Parent Company financial statements, as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Going concern
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ 
statement contained within the Accounting policies on pages 112 
to 117 that the Group is a going concern. We confirm that:
 > we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going 
concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial 
statements is appropriate; and
 > we have not identified any material uncertainties that may 
cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below, 
which are the same risks as identified in the prior year, are 
those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the 
allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the 
engagement team. 
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Carrying value of land and work in progress – land £2,826.1m (2014: £2,348.4m), work in progress £1,287.4m (2014: £1,118.2m)
Refer to page 68 (Audit Committee statement), page 119 (Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty) and page 134 (financial statement disclosures)
The Group’s assessment of the carrying 
value of land and work in progress, being 
the lower of cost and net realisable value, 
is a judgemental process. This requires 
the estimation of selling prices, sales 
rates and costs to complete, determined 
on a site by site basis. These factors drive 
the gross margin for each site and hence 
the profit recognised at the point of sale. 
Revenue recognition on social housing 
developments accounted for under IAS 
11 ‘Construction Contracts’ requires 
additional judgement in calculating the 
revenue and profit to be recognised, 
estimating the total expected costs to 
complete each site and the percentage of 
completion at the balance sheet date.
Our work involved the following: 
 > We have tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of the Group’s controls relating to the 
determination of costs to complete as this is the most significant judgement applied to each site valuation. We attended a 
number of valuation meetings across all regions that review the carrying value of land and work in progress of individual 
sites. A sample of sites were also visited to enable us to verify how surveyors measure the degree of build completion of 
the developments against the costs incurred to date and to measure the subcontractor accruals at the year end. 
 > For multi-phased sites we have performed procedures to validate the appropriateness of actual and forecast margin 
maintained across the individual phases of the entire site.
 > We have reviewed the land acquisition appraisal process and viability assessment at acquisition and tested the design, 
implementation and operating effectiveness of the key controls.
 > We have sample tested and agreed certain costs incurred to date included within land and work in progress as well as 
reviewing the proportion of that expenditure recognised as a cost of sale in the year in respect of units sold.
 > We have used IT interrogation tools to test the model prepared by Management to calculate the net realisable value of 
sites to ascertain the mechanical accuracy of the formulae being applied to the inputs to specific sites. 
 > We have tested each of the key assumptions within Management’s model on forecast sales values, sales rates and costs 
to complete which support the basis of the carrying value of land and work in progress. We have compared the Group’s 
assumptions to external market forecasts for sales price inflation and build cost inflation and have tested a sample of 
sites to current market data on sales rates, sales prices and cost assumptions. We have also tested the accuracy of costs 
to complete assumptions on a sample basis.
 > We have performed independent sensitivity analysis, informed by external forecasts, to measure the impact on 
the carrying value of land and work in progress through possible deviations around the assumptions applied by 
management. 
 > A sample of construction contracts for social housing developments have been tested by verifying the costs incurred to 
date and recalculating the percentage of completion at the balance sheet date. A selection of these schemes have been 
reviewed with a sample of costs agreed to third party surveyors’ certificates, total sales values agreed to contracts, and 
the recognition formula verified to support revenue recognised.

Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Valuation of available for sale financial assets – £107.0m (2014: £122.4m)
Refer to page 68 (Audit Committee statement), page 119 (Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty) and page 133 (financial statement disclosures)
The Group’s available for sale financial 
assets, represented by shared equity 
properties, are held at fair value. The 
assets represent loans granted as part 
of housing sales transactions that are 
secured by way of a second charge on 
the respective property. The valuation, 
which determines the level of provision 
to be recorded against the gross value of 
the loans granted, requires the exercise 
of significant judgement. Significant 
judgements are made in estimating the 
timing and quantum of the future cash 
flows expected from the redemption of the 
loans, including an estimate of the market 
value of the property at the estimated time 
of repayment, and the determination of 
a suitable discount rate to calculate the 
present value of the cash flows.
Our work involved the following:
 > We have tested the design and implementation of the Group’s controls relating to Management’s redemption 
assumptions on value and timing as these are the most significant judgements applied within the valuation.  
 > The mathematical accuracy of the model has been reviewed through the use of IT interrogation tools to validate that the 
formulae and results are correctly applied and mapped to specific loans.
 > We have tested each of the key assumptions underpinning the fair value model through comparison to historic experience 
of the Group in terms of redemption values and defaults, tested the consistency of assumptions employed by the Group 
for forecast sales price inflation and compared the discount rate employed to the equivalent interest rate levied on a 
second charge loan of similar quantum and duration to the average loan issued by the Group. 
 > We have reviewed the forecast redemption profile for the various tranches of assets in line with the Group’s redemption 
experience and against the underlying terms of the agreement to which the customer is bound. We have performed 
an analysis of geographical spread of the borrowers to support Management’s expected redemption profile, including 
consideration of the dispersion of the assets in determining the appropriate level of sales price inflation, default rate and 
expected redemption date.
 > We have employed sensitivity analysis to the key assumptions to establish the quantum of the impact caused by flexing 
certain inputs to the model. 
 > We have reviewed the appropriateness of the disclosures provided in accordance with IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ 
and IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’, including the classification within the fair value hierarchy.
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets – £892.2m (2014: £892.2m)
Refer to page 68 (Audit Committee statement), page 119 (Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty) and pages 126 and 127 (financial statement disclosures)
The Group’s assessment of impairment 
of goodwill and intangible assets is a 
judgemental process which requires 
estimates concerning the forecast future 
cash flows associated with the goodwill 
and brand assets held, the discount rates 
and the growth rate of revenue and costs 
to be applied in determining the value in 
use.
Our work involved the following:
 > We have tested the design and implementation of the Group’s controls relating to Management’s impairment review of 
goodwill and intangible assets.  
 > We have tested the accuracy of the underlying model to assess whether the processes are applied to the correct input 
data and the outputs are mapped accurately.
 > We challenged each of the key assumptions employed in the annual goodwill impairment test. This included reference to 
our internal valuation specialists’ benchmarking of the weighted average cost of capital rate (‘WACC’) employed as the 
discount rate employed, including its methodology and constituent inputs, comparison to independent market forecasts 
of revenue and cost growth in the housebuilding sector and an assessment of the Group’s historic forecasting accuracy. 
 > We have tested Management’s sensitivity analysis in relation to the key inputs to the goodwill impairment test model, as 
well as performing our own sensitivity analysis which included changes to volume, margin and the discount rate applied.
 > We have reviewed the appropriateness of the disclosures provided in accordance with IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in 
the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and 
not to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. 
Our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with 
respect to any of the risks described above, and we do not express 
an opinion on these individual matters.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the 
financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be 
changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the 
scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work. 
We determined materiality for the Group to be £27.6m 
(2014: £24.0m), which is calculated based on 5.0% (2014: 6.1%) of 
statutory pre-tax profit. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report 
to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £0.55m 
(2014: £0.48m), as well as differences below that threshold 
that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters 
that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the 
financial statements. 
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the 
Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and 
assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. 
The entire Group is audited by one audit team, led by the Senior 
Statutory Auditor. The audit is performed centrally and comprises 
all of the divisions which comprise the Group’s housebuilding 
segment, the Group’s commercial developments segment and 
the head office consolidation. We choose to visit the Group’s three 
London housebuilding divisions each year, as well as five further 
non-London housebuilding divisions across each of the Group’s 
regions, selected on a rotational basis and with reference to size 
and complexity among other factors. We also visit Wilson Bowden 
Developments Limited on an annual basis, which constitutes the 
Group’s commercial developments segment. Barratt Developments PLC

Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 > the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and
 > the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
 > we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit; or
 > adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
 > the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in 
our opinion certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration have 
not been made or the part of the Directors’ remuneration report 
to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and 
returns. We have nothing to report arising from these matters.
Corporate governance statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of 
the Corporate governance statement relating to the Company’s 
compliance with ten provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we 
are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the 
Annual Report is:
 > materially inconsistent with the information in the audited 
financial statements; or
 > apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the 
course of performing our audit; or
 > otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have 
identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired 
during the audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider 
the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable and 
whether the Annual Report appropriately discloses those 
matters that we communicated to the Audit Committee which we 
consider should have been disclosed. We confirm that we have not 
identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express 
an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. We also 
comply with International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK 
and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure 
that our quality control procedures are effective, understood 
and applied. Our quality controls and systems include our 
dedicated professional standards review team and independent 
partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a 
body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies 
are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates 
made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and 
non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to 
identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect 
based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired 
by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware 
of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we 
consider the implications for our report.

Financial Statements
Accounting Policies
Year ended 30 June 2015
Basis of preparation
These Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’), International 
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) Interpretations 
and Standing Interpretations Committee (‘SIC’) interpretations as 
adopted and endorsed by the European Union (‘EU’) and with those 
parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting 
under IFRS and therefore the Group Financial Statements comply with 
Article 4 of the EU International Accounting Standards Regulation. 
The Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost 
convention as modified by the revaluation of available for sale financial 
assets, derivative financial instruments and share-based payments. 
A summary of the more significant Group accounting policies is set 
out below.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of 
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although these 
estimates are based on the Directors’ best knowledge of the amounts, 
actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates. The most 
significant estimates made by the Directors in these Financial 
Statements are set out in ‘Critical Accounting Judgements and Key 
Sources of Estimation Uncertainty’.
Going concern
In determining the appropriate basis of preparation of the Financial 
Statements, the Directors are required to consider whether the Group 
can continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
The Group’s business activities, together with factors which the 
Directors consider are likely to affect its future development, financial 
performance and financial position are set out in the Strategic Report 
on pages 2 to 45. The material financial and operational risks and 
uncertainties that may have an impact upon the Group’s performance 
and their mitigation are outlined on pages 40 to 45 and financial risks 
including liquidity risk, market risk, credit risk and capital risk are 
outlined in note 27 to the Financial Statements. 
The financial performance of the Group is dependent upon the wider 
economic environment in which the Group operates. As explained in 
the Risk management section on pages 40 to 45, factors that 
particularly affect the performance of the Group include changes in the 
macroeconomic environment including buyer confidence, availability of 
mortgage finance for the Group’s customers and interest rates. 
The Group has total committed bank facilities and private placement 
notes of £848.3m. The final maturity dates of these facilities range 
from August 2017 to July 2021, with £150.0m of the revolving credit 
facility maturing in December 2017 and £550.0m of the revolving credit 
facility maturing in December 2019. The committed facilities and 
private placement notes provide appropriate headroom above our 
current forecast debt requirements. 
In addition to these committed borrowing facilities the Group has 
£27.9m of financing from the Government’s ‘Get Britain Building’ and 
‘Growing Places Fund’ schemes. The outstanding funds are repayable 
between December 2015 and March 2018. Further committed loan 
facilities of £11.5m are available under agreements with local 
government which are due to be repaid between July 2015 and 
March 2020.  
Accordingly, after making enquiries and having considered forecasts 
and appropriate sensitivities, the Directors have formed a judgement, 
at the time of approving the Financial Statements, that there is a 
reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, being at 
least twelve months from the date of these Financial Statements. 
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in the 
preparation of these Financial Statements.
Adoption of new and revised standards
In the year ended 30 June 2015, the Group has adopted the following 
standards, amendments and interpretations, none of which have had a 
material impact on the Group:
• IFRS 10: Consolidated Financial Statements
• IFRS 11: Joint Arrangements
• IFRS 12: Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities
• IAS 27: Separate Financial Statements
• IAS 28: Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures
• IFRIC 21: Levies 
• Annual Improvements Cycle 2009 – 2011
•  Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12: Consolidated 
Financial Statements, Joint Arrangements and Disclosure of 
Interests in Other Entities – Transition Guidance
•  Amendments to IAS 32: Financial Instruments: Presentation 
– Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
•  Amendments to IAS 36: Recoverable Amount Disclosures for 
Non-Financial Assets
•  Amendments to IAS 39: Novation of Derivatives and Continuation 
of Hedge Accounting
The adoption of IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities’ has 
resulted in enhanced disclosures relating to the Group’s jointly 
controlled entities, jointly controlled operations and non-controlling 
interests (see notes 13, 14 and 16).
Basis of consolidation
The Group Financial Statements include the results of Barratt 
Developments PLC (the ‘Company’), incorporated in the UK, and all its 
subsidiary undertakings made up to 30 June. The financial statements 
of subsidiary undertakings are consolidated from the date when 
control passes to the Group using the purchase method of accounting 
and up to the date control ceases. All transactions with subsidiaries 
and intercompany profits or losses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations
All of the subsidiaries’ identifiable assets and liabilities, including 
contingent liabilities, existing at the date of acquisition are recorded at 
their fair values. All changes to those assets and liabilities and the 
resulting gains and losses that arise after the Group has gained control 
of the subsidiary are included in the post-acquisition income statement. Barratt Developments PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2015

Strategic Report Governance Other Information Financial Statements
Jointly controlled entities
A jointly controlled entity is an entity, including an unincorporated entity 
such as a partnership, in which the Group holds an interest with one or 
more other parties where a contractual arrangement has established 
joint control over the entity. Jointly controlled entities are accounted for 
using the equity method of accounting.
Jointly controlled operations
The Group enters into jointly controlled operations as part of its 
housebuilding and property development activities. The Group’s share 
of profits and losses from its investments in such jointly controlled 
operations is accounted for on a direct basis and is included in the 
Income Statement. The Group’s share of its investments, assets and 
liabilities is accounted for on a directly proportional basis in the Group’s 
Balance Sheet.
Associated entities
An associated entity is an entity, including an unincorporated entity 
such as a partnership, in which the Group holds a significant influence 
and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture. 
Associated entities are accounted for using the equity method 
of accounting.
Revenue
Revenue is recognised at legal completion in respect of the total 
proceeds of building and development. An appropriate proportion of 
revenue from construction contracts is recognised by reference to the 
stage of completion of contract activity. Revenue is measured at the fair 
value of consideration received or receivable and represents the 
amounts receivable for the property, net of discounts and VAT. The sale 
proceeds of part-exchange properties are not included in revenue.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal 
outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
Construction contracts
Revenue is only recognised on a construction contract where the 
outcome can be estimated reliably. Variations to, and claims arising in 
respect of, construction contracts, are included in revenue to the extent 
that they have been agreed with the customer. Revenue and costs are 
recognised by reference to the stage of completion of contract activity 
at the balance sheet date. This is normally measured by surveys of 
work performed to date. Contracts are only treated as construction 
contracts when they have been specifically negotiated for the 
construction of a development or property. When it is probable that the 
total costs on a construction contract will exceed total contract 
revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense in the Income 
Statement immediately.
Amounts recoverable on construction contracts are included in trade 
receivables and stated at cost plus attributable profit less any 
foreseeable losses. Payments received on account for construction 
contracts are deducted from amounts recoverable on 
construction contracts.
Payments received in excess of amounts recoverable on construction 
contracts are included in trade payables.
Exceptional items
Items that are material in size or unusual or infrequent in nature are 
presented as exceptional items in the Income Statement. The Directors 
are of the opinion that the separate presentation of exceptional items 
provides helpful information about the Group’s underlying business 
performance. Examples of events that, inter alia, may give rise to the 
classification of items as exceptional are the restructuring of existing 
and newly-acquired businesses, refinancing costs, gains or losses on 
the disposal of businesses or individual assets, pension scheme 
curtailments and asset impairments, including land, work in progress, 
goodwill and investments.
Profit from operations
Profit from operations includes all of the revenue and costs derived 
from the Group’s operating businesses. Profit from operations 
excludes finance costs, finance income, the Group’s share of profits or 
losses from joint ventures and associates and tax. 
Segmental reporting
The Group consists of two separate segments for internal reporting, 
regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to allocate 
resources to the segments and to assess their performance, being 
housebuilding and commercial developments. These segments 
therefore comprise the primary reporting segments within the 
Financial Statements. All of the Group’s operations are within Britain, 
which is one geographic market in the context of managing the 
Group’s activities.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the fair 
value of the consideration over the fair value of the separately 
identifiable net assets and liabilities acquired. 
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and 
businesses is capitalised as an asset but reviewed for impairment at 
least annually.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of 
the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the 
synergies of the combination at acquisition being housebuilding and 
commercial developments. Cash-generating units to which goodwill 
has been allocated are tested for impairment at least annually. If the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the 
carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to 
reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and 
then to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying 
amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss is recognised 
immediately in the Income Statement and is not subsequently reversed. Barratt Developments PLC

Financial Statements – Accounting Policies continued
Intangible assets
Brands
Internally generated brands are not capitalised. The Group has 
capitalised as intangible assets brands that have been acquired. 
Acquired brand values are calculated using discounted cash flows. 
Where a brand is considered to have a finite life, it is amortised over its 
useful life on a straight-line basis. Where a brand is capitalised with an 
indefinite life, it is not amortised. The factors that contribute to the 
durability of brands capitalised are that there are no material legal, 
regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that 
limit the useful life of these intangible assets.
The Group carries out an annual impairment review of indefinite life 
brands as part of the review of the carrying value of goodwill, by 
performing a value-in-use calculation, using a discount factor based 
upon the Group’s pre-tax weighted average cost of capital.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings
Interests in subsidiary undertakings are accounted for at cost less any 
provision for impairment.
Where share-based payments are granted to the employees of 
subsidiary undertakings by the Company, they are treated as a capital 
contribution to the subsidiary and the Company’s investment in the 
subsidiary is increased accordingly.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation is 
provided to write-off the cost of the assets on a straight-line basis to 
their residual value over their estimated useful lives. Residual values 
and asset lives are reviewed annually.
Freehold properties are depreciated on a straight-line basis over 25 
years. Freehold land is not depreciated. Plant is depreciated on a 
straight-line basis over its expected useful life, which ranges from one 
to seven years.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Cost comprises of direct materials, direct labour costs and those 
overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their 
present location and condition. 
Land held for development, including land in the course of 
development, is initially recorded at discounted cost. Where, through 
deferred purchase credit terms, the carrying value differs from the 
amount that will ultimately be paid in settling the liability, this difference 
is charged as a finance cost in the Income Statement over the period 
of settlement.
Due to the scale of the Group’s developments, the Group has to allocate 
site-wide development costs between units built in the current year 
and in future years. It also has to estimate costs to complete on such 
developments. In making these assessments, there is a degree of 
inherent uncertainty. The Group has developed internal controls to 
assess and review carrying values and the appropriateness of 
estimates made.
Leases as lessee
Operating lease rentals are charged to the Income Statement in equal 
instalments over the life of the lease.
Leases as lessor
The Group enters into leasing arrangements with third parties 
following the completion of constructed developments until the date of 
the sale of the development to third parties. Rental income from these 
operating leases is recognised in the Income Statement on a straight-
line basis over the term of the lease. Initial direct costs incurred in 
negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying 
amount of the leased asset and recognised in the Income Statement on 
a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain 
employees. In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 ‘Share-
based Payments’ has been applied to all grants of equity instruments 
after 7 November 2002 that had not vested at 1 January 2005.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at the fair value of 
the equity instrument at the date of grant. Fair value is measured either 
using Black-Scholes, Present-Economic Value or Monte Carlo models 
depending on the characteristics of the scheme. The fair value is 
expensed in the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the 
vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will 
eventually vest where non-market vesting conditions apply. 
Non-vesting conditions are taken into account in the estimate of the fair 
value of the equity instruments.
Tax
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and 
deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year. 
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income 
Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are 
taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that 
are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is 
calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is recognised in 
respect of all temporary differences that have originated but not been 
reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that 
result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less 
tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rates that are expected to apply in the 
period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on tax 
rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except 
when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which 
case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore 
recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be 
regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable 
profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing 
differences can be deducted. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set-off current tax 
assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to taxes 
levied by the same tax authority and the Group intends to settle its 
current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. Barratt Developments PLC

Strategic Report Governance Other Information Financial Statements
Pensions
Defined contribution
The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes for certain 
employees. The Group’s contributions to the schemes are charged in 
the Income Statement in the year in which the contributions fall due.
Defined benefit
For the defined benefit scheme, the cost of providing benefits is 
determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial 
valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. Actuarial gains 
and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. 
They are recognised outside profit or loss and presented in the 
Statements of Comprehensive Income. Net-interest is calculated by 
applying a discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset.
Past service cost, until the scheme ceased to offer future accrual of 
defined benefit pensions to employees from 30 June 2009, was 
recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits were already 
vested, and otherwise was amortised on a straight-line basis over the 
average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Balance Sheet 
represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as 
adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair 
value of the scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is 
limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds 
and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
Borrowing costs
The Group capitalises borrowing costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset as part of 
the cost of the asset where developments are considered to fall under 
the requirements of IAS 23 ‘Borrowing costs’ (Revised). Otherwise, the 
Group expenses borrowing costs in the period to which they relate 
through the Income Statement.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Balance 
Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instrument.
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual 
rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or it transfers the 
financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
of the asset to another entity.
The Group derecognises a financial liability only when the Group’s 
obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
Financial assets
Non-derivative financial assets are classified as either ‘available for 
sale financial assets’ or ‘loans and receivables’. The classification 
depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is 
determined at the time of initial recognition.
Available for sale financial assets
Secured loans
Non-interest bearing loans granted as part of sales transactions that 
are secured by way of a second legal charge on the respective property 
are classified as being available for sale and are stated at fair value. 
Fair value is determined in the manner described in note 17.
Revenue from transactions involving available for sale financial assets 
is recognised at the fair value of consideration receivable.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in 
equity within other comprehensive income. Gains and losses arising 
from impairment losses, changes in future cash flows and interest 
calculated using the ‘effective interest rate’ method are recognised 
directly in the Income Statement.
Residential property fund
Revenue from transactions involving available for sale financial assets 
is recognised at the fair value of consideration receivable. The fair value 
of consideration received is the initial fair value of the units received in 
the property fund.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in 
equity within other comprehensive income. The fair value of this 
investment is calculated using the unadjusted quoted price of units in 
the property fund obtained from independent brokers.
Gains and losses arising from impairment losses and changes in 
future cash flows are recognised directly in the Income Statement.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are financial assets with fixed or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
They are included in current assets, except for those with maturities 
greater than twelve months after the balance sheet date, which are 
classified as non-current assets and are measured at amortised cost 
less an allowance for any uncollectable amounts. The net of these 
balances are classified as ‘trade and other receivables’ in the 
Balance Sheet. 
Trade and other receivables are classified as ‘loans and receivables’. Barratt Developments PLC

Financial Statements – Accounting Policies continued
Impairment of financial assets
Trade and other receivables are assessed for indicators of impairment 
at each balance sheet date and are impaired where there is objective 
evidence that the recovery of the receivable is in doubt. 
Objective evidence of impairment could include significant financial 
difficulty of the customer, default on payment terms or the customer 
going into liquidation.
The carrying amount of trade and other receivables is reduced through 
the use of an allowance account. When a trade or other receivable is 
considered uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account. 
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited 
against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the 
allowance account are recognised in the Income Statement.
For financial assets classified as available for sale, a significant or 
prolonged decline in the value of the property underpinning the value of 
the loan or increased risk of default are considered to be objective 
evidence of impairment.
In respect of debt instruments classified as available for sale financial 
assets, increases in the fair value of assets previously subject to 
impairment, which can be objectively related to an event occurring 
after recognition of the impairment loss, are recognised in the Income 
Statement to the extent that they reverse the impairment loss. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and balances in bank 
accounts with no notice or less than three months’ notice from 
inception and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Cash and cash equivalents are classified as ‘loans and receivables’.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity are classified according to the substance 
of the contractual arrangements entered into.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments consist of the Company’s ordinary share capital and 
are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities
All non-derivative financial liabilities are classified as ‘other financial 
liabilities’ and are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction 
costs. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the ‘effective interest rate’ method.
Other financial liabilities consist of bank borrowings and trade and 
other payables. 
Financial liabilities are classified as current liabilities unless the Group 
has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 
twelve months after the balance sheet date.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and 
are stated at amortised cost.
Trade and other payables on extended terms, particularly in respect of 
land, are recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition of the 
asset to which they relate by discounting at prevailing market interest 
rates at the date of recognition. The discount to nominal value, which 
will be paid in settling the deferred purchase terms liability, is 
amortised over the period of the credit term and charged to finance 
costs using the ‘effective interest rate’ method.
Bank borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Where bank agreements include a legal right of offset for in hand and 
overdraft balances, and the Group intends to settle the net outstanding 
position, the offset arrangements are applied to record the net position 
in the Balance Sheet.
Finance income and charges are accounted for using the ‘effective 
interest rate’ method in the Income Statement. 
Finance costs are recognised as an expense in the Income Statement 
in the period to which they relate.
Get Britain Building
The Group has received cash upon specific sites under the 
Government’s ‘Get Britain Building’ scheme, which is repayable in 
current and future periods as the sites to which it relates are 
developed. These loans are interest bearing and are recorded at the 
proceeds received plus accrued interest. These loans are included 
within loans and borrowings.
Finance costs are recognised as an expense in the Income Statement 
in the period to which they relate.
Growing Places Fund
The Group has received cash under a local government ‘Growing 
Places Fund’ scheme which is repayable over four years in eight 
six-monthly instalments, the first of which was in December 2013. 
This loan is interest bearing and recorded at the proceeds received 
plus accrued interest less repayments to date. This loan is included 
within loans and borrowings. 
Finance costs are recognised as an expense in the Income Statement 
in the period to which they relate. Barratt Developments PLC

Strategic Report Governance Other Information Financial Statements
Derivative financial instruments
The Group has entered into derivative financial instruments in the form 
of interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps to manage the 
interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk arising from the Group’s 
operations and sources of finance. The use of financial derivatives is 
governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors as 
detailed in notes 26 and 27 to the Financial Statements.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative 
contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured to their fair 
value at each balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is 
recognised in the profit or loss immediately unless the derivative is 
designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the 
timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the 
hedge relationship. 
The interest rate and cross currency swap arrangements are 
designated as hedging instruments, being either hedges of a change in 
future cash flows as a result of interest rate movements or hedges of a 
change in future cash flows as a result of foreign currency exchange 
rate movements. 
The fair value of hedging derivatives is classified as a non-current 
asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the hedging 
relationship is more than twelve months and as a current asset or a 
current liability if the remaining maturity of the hedge relationship is 
less than twelve months.
Hedge accounting
All of the Group’s interest rate and cross currency swaps are 
designated as cash flow hedges. At the inception of the hedge 
relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the 
hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk 
management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various 
hedged transactions. In addition, at the inception of the hedge and on 
an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging 
instrument is highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows of 
the hedged items.
Details of the fair values of the interest rate and cross currency swaps 
are provided in notes 24, 25, 26 and 27 to the Financial Statements. 
Movements on the hedging reserve in equity are detailed in the 
Statements of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity.
Cash flow hedge
To the extent that the Group’s cash flow hedges are effective, gains and 
losses on the fair value of the interest rate and cross currency swap 
arrangements are deferred in equity in the hedging reserve until 
realised. On realisation, such gains and losses are recognised within 
finance charges in the Income Statement. 
To the extent that any hedge is ineffective, gains and losses on the fair 
value of these swap arrangements are recognised immediately in 
finance charges in the Income Statement.
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in profit or loss in the periods 
when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging 
relationship, the hedging instrument expires, is sold or terminated or 
no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative 
gain or loss deferred in equity remains in equity and is recognised 
when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. 
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the 
cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised 
immediately in profit or loss.
Government grants
Government grants are not recognised until there is reasonable 
assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching to 
them and that the grants will be received. 
Government grants are recognised in the Income Statement so as to 
match with the related costs they are intended to compensate for. 
Grants related to income are included in the appropriate line within the 
Income Statement. Grants related to assets are deducted from the 
carrying amount of the asset.  Barratt Developments PLC

Financial Statements
Impact of Standards and Interpretations  
in issue but not yet effective
At the date of approval of these Financial Statements, there were a 
number of standards, amendments and interpretations that have been 
published and are therefore mandatory for the Group’s accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1 July 2015 and later periods.
Amendments to IAS 19: ‘Defined Benefit Plans Employee 
Contributions’, Annual Improvements 2010-2012 and Annual 
Improvements 2011-2013 have been endorsed by the EU. 
Amendments to IAS 27 ‘Equity Method in Separate Financial 
Statements’, IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ as issued in 2009 and 
subsequently amended in 2010 and 2014, IFRS 14 ‘Regulatory Deferral 
Accounts’, IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’, 
Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 41 ‘Bearer Plants’, Amendments to IAS 
16 and IAS 38 ‘Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and 
Amortisation’, Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 ‘Investment 
Entities’, Amendments to IFRS 11 ‘Accounting for Acquisitions of 
Interests in Joint Operations’, Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 ‘Sale 
or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint 
Venture’, Disclosure Initiative (Amendments to IAS 1) and Annual 
Improvements 2012-2014 have not yet been endorsed by the EU. 
The Group has not early-adopted any standard, amendment 
or interpretation.
The standards, amendments and interpretations that are expected to 
have an impact upon the Group are: 
•  IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ was reissued in October 2010 as 
the second step in the IASB project to replace IAS 39 ‘Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’. The final revision to 
the standard incorporating the impairment, classification and 
measurement requirements was issued by the IASB in July 2014. 
IFRS 9 will impact both the measurement and disclosures of 
financial instruments. The Group is currently assessing the 
impact of the revisions on the Group’s results and financial 
position, until such assessment is completed it is not practical to 
provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of IFRS 9. 
•  IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ was issued on 
28 May 2014. This standard sets out revenue recognition 
conditions for the Group and will be applicable from 1 July 2018. 
The standard remains subject to an exposure draft with proposed 
clarifications as well as being subject to industry interpretations 
and consensus. The Group has continued, but not yet completed, 
its assessment of the impact of the standard, as currently drafted, 
on the Group. To date, we expect the standard may delay the 
recognition of revenue from construction contracts, although this 
will not affect the Group’s cash flows. In addition, the standard is 
expected to require presentational changes to our Income 
Statement to show part exchange income and expenses 
separately, which are currently recognised on a net basis within 
cost of sales, as detailed in note 1. It is not practical to provide a 
reasonable estimate of the full impact of IFRS 15 until our 
assessment has been completed, which we expect to be within the 
year ended 30 June 2016, subject to the finalisation of the 
standard, and therefore we will provide further disclosures upon 
the impact of IFRS 15 in our Annual Report and Accounts 
next year. 
The adoption of the following standards, amendments and 
interpretations is not expected to have any material impact on the 
Financial Statements of the Group:
•  Amendment to IFRS 11 ‘Accounting for Acquisition of Interest in 
Joint Operations’. The amendment requires companies to apply 
IFRS ‘Business Combinations’ acquisition and disclosure 
requirements to investments in joint operations. The only 
exemption from this is if the formation of the joint operation 
coincides with the formation of the business.
•  IFRS 14 ‘Regulatory Deferral Accounts’ has not yet been endorsed 
by the EU. This will not have an impact on the Group. 
•  Amendments to IAS 27 ‘Equity Method in Separate Financial 
Statements’ reinstate the equity method as an accounting option 
for investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates in an 
entity’s separate financial statements. These amendments have 
not yet been endorsed by the EU and are not expected to impact 
the Group.
•  Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 ‘Investment Entities’ 
have not yet been endorsed by the EU. These amendments give 
guidance on exemptions from consolidating certain subsidiaries 
for investment entities and are not expected to impact the Group.
•  Amendments to IAS 16 ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’ and IAS 
38 ‘Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and 
Amortisation’ has not yet been endorsed by the EU. None of these 
amendments are expected to impact the Group.
•  Amendments to IAS 19 ‘Defined Benefit Plans: Employee 
Contributions’ will apply to the Group from 1 July 2015. 
This amendment is not expected to impact the Group.
•  The Annual Improvements 2010-2012 and 2011-2013 Cycles 
includes amendments to a number of different accounting 
standards. These amendments will apply to the Group from 1 July 
2015. None of these amendments are expected to impact 
the Group.
•  The Annual Improvements 2012-2014 have not yet been endorsed 
by the EU and are not expected to impact the Group.
•  Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 41 ‘Bearer Plants’ have not yet 
been endorsed by the EU and are not expected to impact 
the Group.
•  Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 ‘Sale or Contribution of Assets 
between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture’ have not 
yet been endorsed by the EU and are not expected to impact  
the Group.
•  Disclosure Initiative (Amendments to IAS 1) has not yet been 
endorsed by the EU and is not expected to impact the Group. Barratt Developments PLC

Critical Accounting Judgements and  
Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty
In accordance with the requirements of IFRS, the Group has detailed 
below the critical accounting judgements made and the key sources of 
estimation uncertainty within these Financial Statements.
Critical accounting judgements
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are 
described in the accounting policies note, the Directors have made no 
individual judgements that have a significant impact upon the Financial 
Statements, apart from those involving estimations, which are dealt 
with below.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of 
estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet dates, are discussed below.
Carrying value of land and work in progress 
The Group’s principal activity is housebuilding and commercial 
development. The majority of the development activity is not contracted 
prior to the development commencing. Accordingly, the Group has in 
its Balance Sheet at 30 June 2015 current assets that are not covered 
by a forward sale. The Group’s internal controls are designed to identify 
any developments where the Balance Sheet value of land and work in 
progress is more than the lower of cost or net realisable value.
During the year the Group has conducted six-monthly reviews of the 
net realisable value of specific sites identified as at high risk of 
impairment, based upon a number of criteria including low site profit 
margins and sites with no forecast completions. Where the estimated 
net realisable value of a site was less than its current carrying value 
within the Balance Sheet, the Group has impaired the land and work in 
progress value. 
During the year, due to performance variations and changes to viability 
on individual sites, there were gross impairment charges of £17.9m 
(2014: £31.3m) and gross impairment reversals of £6.2m, 
(2014: £22.4m) resulting in a net impairment charge of £11.7m 
(2014: £8.9m) included within profit from operations.
The key judgements in these reviews were estimating the realisable 
value of a site, which is determined by forecast sales rates, expected 
sales prices and estimated costs to complete. The estimation of future 
sales prices and costs to complete included allowances for low 
single-digit sales price inflation and low single-digit build costs 
inflation in future periods. During the year the Group continued to 
benefit from favourable market conditions. If the UK housing market 
were to change beyond management expectations in the future, in 
particular with regards to the assumptions around sales prices and 
estimated costs to complete, further adjustments to the carrying value 
of land and work in progress may be required.
The land held at the balance sheet date that has already been impaired 
is most sensitive to the judgements being applied and the potential for 
further impairment or reversal. Forecasting risk also increases in 
relation to those sites that are not expected to be realised in the short 
to medium term. 
Available for sale financial assets
The Group holds available for sale financial assets principally 
comprising interest free loans granted as part of sales transactions 
that are secured by way of a second legal charge on the respective 
property, which are held at fair value. The fair value calculation 
requires an estimate of the future cash flows expected from the 
redemption of interest free loans, including an estimate of the market 
value of the property at the estimated time of repayment, and requires 
the determination of a suitable discount rate to calculate the present 
value of the cash flows. The estimated market value is based on 
original selling prices and local market conditions with an allowance 
for low single-digit sales price inflation. The estimated repayment 
profile is based on historical data for first time buyers selling their 
property. The discount rate used is consistent with the interest rate 
payable on a third party second charge loan of a similar amount 
and duration. 
The interrelationship between these assumptions, particularly those 
related to estimated market value and estimated repayment profile, 
means that there is not a direct correlation between house price 
inflation and the valuation of the Group’s available for sale financial 
assets. During the year, the levels of house price inflation and 
redemptions have been in line with those expected in the fair value 
calculation. Accordingly, there has been no significant change in the 
Balance Sheet valuation due to the improved market. At 30 June 2015, 
the total asset recognised on the Balance Sheet in relation to these 
secured loans was £107.0m (2014: £122.4m), with the reduction 
primarily due to redemptions.
Goodwill and intangible assets impairment review
The impairment review for the goodwill of the housebuilding business 
and the Group’s indefinite life brand, David Wilson Homes, requires an 
estimation of the value-in-use of the housebuilding segment as defined 
in notes 10 and 11. The value-in-use calculation requires an estimate of 
the future cash flows expected from the housebuilding business, 
including the anticipated growth rate of revenue and costs, and 
requires the determination of a suitable discount rate to calculate the 
present value of the cash flows. The discount rate used is based on the 
average capital structure of the Group, current market assessments of 
the time value of money and risks appropriate to the Group’s 
housebuilding business. Changes in these may impact upon the 
Group’s discount rate in future periods. The carrying amount of 
goodwill at 30 June 2015 was £792.2m and the indefinite life brands 
was £100.0m, there was no impairment recognised during the year.  Barratt Developments PLC

Investment in joint venture holding non-current available for 
sale financial assets
The Group holds a joint venture investment of £25.6m (2014: £25.6m) in 
Rose Shared Equity LLP . This entity holds non-current available for 
sale financial assets comprising interest free loans that are secured by 
way of a second charge on the respective property. The Group’s 
investment is accounted for using the equity method of accounting. 
In line with the Group’s other joint venture investments, the carrying 
value is reviewed at each balance sheet date. This review requires 
estimation of the cash flows expected to be received by the Group 
which is based upon calculation of the fair values of the loans held by 
the entity including an estimate of future cash flows expected from the 
redemption of interest free loans, including an estimate of the market 
value of the property at the estimated time of redemption, and requires 
the determination of a suitable discount rate to calculate the present 
value of the cash flows. The estimated market value is based on 
original selling prices and local market conditions with an allowance 
for low single-digit sales price inflation. The estimated repayment 
profile is based on historic data for first time buyers selling their 
property. The discount rate used is consistent with the interest rate 
payable on a third party second charge loan of a similar amount 
and duration.
Classification of joint arrangements
The Group holds one joint venture investment not in equal share and 
one with more than one other party. However, in both cases, the Group 
has equal voting rights and control over the activities of the companies 
with the other parties, as explained in note 13. In addition, the Group 
and the other parties to the agreements only have rights to the net 
assets of these companies through the terms of the contractual 
arrangements. These entities are therefore classified as joint ventures 
and are accounted for by the equity method in the Consolidated 
Financial Statements.
The Group’s interests in a number of the entities classified as joint 
ventures are held indirectly. 
Barratt Wates (East Grinstead) No. 2 Limited is a wholly owned 
subsidiary of the Group’s joint venture, Barratt Wates (East Grinstead) 
Limited, and is therefore classified as a joint venture of the Group. 
Aldgate Land One Limited and Aldgate Land Two Limited are wholly 
owned subsidiaries of the Group’s joint venture, Aldgate Place (GP) 
Limited, and are therefore classified as joint ventures of the Group. 
BDWZest Developments LLP , Alie Street LLP , Queensland Road LLP , 
Fulham Wharf LLP and Nine Elms LLP form a group of limited liability 
partnerships jointly owned (directly or indirectly) by BDWZest LLP and 
ZestBDW LLP , both of which are joint ventures of the Group. All of these 
entities are therefore classified as joint ventures of the Group.
Estimation of costs to complete
In order to determine the profit that the Group is able to recognise on 
its developments in a specific period, the Group has to allocate 
site-wide development costs between units built in the current year 
and in future years. It also has to estimate costs to complete on such 
developments. In making these assessments there is a degree of 
inherent uncertainty. The Group has developed internal controls to 
assess and review carrying values and the appropriateness of 
estimates made. 
Recognition of profit where developments are accounted for 
under IAS 11 ‘Construction Contracts’ 
The Group applies its policy on contract accounting when recognising 
revenue and profit on partially completed contracts. The application of 
this policy requires judgements to be made in respect of the total 
expected costs to complete for each site. The Group has in place 
established internal control processes to ensure that the evaluation of 
costs and revenues is based upon appropriate estimates.
Defined benefit pension scheme 
The Directors engage a qualified independent actuary to calculate the 
Group’s asset in respect of its defined benefit pension scheme. 
In calculating this asset, it is necessary for actuarial assumptions to be 
made, which include discount rates, salary and pension increases, 
price inflation, the long term rate of return upon scheme assets and 
mortality. As actual rates of increase and mortality may differ from 
those assumed, the pension asset may differ from that included in 
these Financial Statements.
The Group has obtained legal advice on the rights to the Group’s 
defined benefit pension scheme’s assets after the death of the last 
member. Based on this advice, the Group has concluded that it is 
appropriate to recognise an asset related to this scheme.
Hedge accounting
The majority of the Group’s facilities are floating rate, which exposes 
the Group to interest rate risk. The Group has in place £137.0m 
(2014: £137.0m) of floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps. The Group has 
adopted hedge accounting for these swaps on the basis that it is highly 
probable that there is sufficient forecast debt to match with the period 
of swaps. If this basis was not met in the future any changes in fair 
value of the swaps would be recognised in the Consolidated Income 
Statement, rather than in equity. During the year ended 30 June 2015, 
there was a gain of £2.4m (2014: £7.7m) included in equity related to 
these swaps. 
In addition, the Group has US$80.0m (2014: US$80.0m) of cross 
currency swaps to manage the cash flow risks related to foreign 
exchange, arising from the Group’s sources of US Dollar denominated 
finance. These swaps are designated as a cash flow hedge against 
future foreign exchange rate movements. If the hedges ceased to be 
highly effective, any changes in fair value of the swaps would be 
recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, rather than equity. 
During the year ended 30 June 2015, there was a gain of £4.1m (2014: 
loss of £7.3m) included in equity related to these swaps. Barratt Developments PLC

Other income principally comprises the sale of freehold reversions, ground rents and management fees receivable from JV’s.
2. Segmental analysis
The Group consists of two separate segments for management reporting and control purposes, being housebuilding and commercial developments. 
The segments are considered appropriate for reporting under IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ since these segments are regularly reviewed internally by 
the Board without further significant categorisation. The Group presents its primary segment information on the basis of these operating segments. 
As the Group operates in a single geographic market, Great Britain, no secondary segmentation is provided.

9. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders of £449.4m (2014: £305.4m) by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by the Employee Benefit Trust which are treated as 
cancelled, which was 987.2m (2014: 979.1m) shares.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders of £449.4m (2014: £305.4m) by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive share options from the start of the 
year, giving a figure of 1,008.4m (2014: 1,004.7m) shares.

The Group’s goodwill has a carrying value of £792.2m relating to the housebuilding segment. The goodwill relating to the commercial 
developments segment, with a cost of £24.5m, was fully impaired in the year ended 30 June 2008.
The Group conducts an annual impairment review of goodwill and intangibles together for both the housebuilding and commercial developments 
segments. The impairment review was performed at 30 June 2015 and compared the value-in-use of the housebuilding segment with the carrying 
value of its tangible and intangible assets and allocated goodwill. The Group allocates any identified impairment first to goodwill and then to 
assets on a pro-rata basis, which in the case of the Group is its intangible assets and property, plant and equipment.
The value-in-use was determined by discounting the expected future cash flows of the housebuilding segment. The first two years of cash flows 
were determined using the Group’s approved detailed site-by-site business plan. The cash flows for the third to fifth years were determined using 
Group level internal forecasted cash flows based upon expected volumes, selling prices and margins, taking into account available land 
purchases and work in progress levels. The cash flows for year six onwards were extrapolated in perpetuity using an estimated growth rate of 
2.5%, which was based upon the expected long term growth rate of the UK economy. 
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations were:
•  Discount rate: this is a pre-tax rate reflecting current market assessments of the time value of money and risks appropriate to the Group’s 
housebuilding business. Accordingly, the rate of 14.0% (2014: 12.6%) is considered by the Directors to be the appropriate pre-tax risk 
adjusted discount rate, being the Group’s estimated long term pre-tax weighted average cost of capital. The rate used in the 30 June 2015 
impairment review is calculated using the average capital structure of the Group during the financial year, consistent with the prior year, 
due to the cyclicality of the Group’s borrowing requirements and reflects the Group’s reduced borrowing costs following the comprehensive 
refinancing completed during the prior year. 
•  Expected changes in selling prices for completed houses and the related impact upon operating margin: these are determined on a 
site-by-site basis for the first two years dependent upon local market conditions and product type. For years three to five, these have been 
estimated at a Group level based upon past experience and expectations of future changes in the market, taking into account external 
market forecasts.
•  Sales volumes: these are determined on a site-by-site basis for the first two years dependent upon local market conditions, land availability 
and planning permissions. For years three to five, these have been estimated at a Group level based upon past experience and expectations 
of future changes in the market, taking into account external market forecasts.
•  Expected changes in site costs to complete: these are determined on a site-by-site basis for the first two years dependent upon the 
expected costs of completing all aspects of each individual development. For years three to five, these have been estimated at a Group level 
based upon past experience and expectations of future changes in the market, taking into account external market forecasts.
The conclusion of this impairment review was that given the current position of the housebuilding segment and the expectations as to its future 
performance based upon current forecasts for sales volumes and expected changes in both selling prices and costs to complete, the 
housebuilding segment’s goodwill and intangible assets were not impaired. The recoverable value of goodwill and intangible assets exceeded its 
carrying value by £1,547.4m (2014: £1,213.2m). 
If the UK housing market and expectations regarding its future were to deteriorate with either operating margins reducing by 4.5% per annum 
(2014: 3.3% per annum) or the appropriate discount rate were to increase by 4.3% (2014: 2.9%) and all other variables were held constant, then the 
recoverable value of goodwill and intangible assets would equal its carrying value. Further information is given in Critical Accounting Judgements

The Group does not amortise the housebuilding brand acquired with Wilson Bowden, being David Wilson Homes, valued at £100.0m, as the 
Directors consider that this brand has an indefinite useful economic life due to the fact that the Group intends to hold and support the brand for an 
indefinite period and there are no factors that would prevent it from doing so.
The Group tests indefinite life brands annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that they might be impaired. At 30 June 
2015, an impairment review was conducted using the calculations and assumptions as explained in note 10. The conclusion of this impairment 
review was that the Group’s David Wilson Homes brand was not impaired.
The brand of Wilson Bowden Developments (valued at £7.0m prior to amortisation) was being amortised over ten years as it is a business-to-
business brand operating in niche markets. Following an impairment review at 30 June 2008, the Wilson Bowden Developments brand was 
fully impaired.

Available for sale financial assets principally comprise interest free loans that are granted as part of sales transactions and for which the cash 
flows receivable are based on the value of the property at redemption. These loans are secured by way of a second legal charge on the respective 
property (after the first mortgage charge). These loans are held at the present value of expected future cash flows, taking into account the 
estimated market value of the property at the estimated time of repayment. The Consolidated Income Statement includes a net impairment 
charge of £8.5m and a profit on disposal of £9.9m (2014: impairment reversal of £2.8m and profit on disposal of £2.4m) in cost of sales (note 5).
The present value of expected future cash flows is calculated using a discount rate consistent with the interest rate payable on a third party 
second charge loan of a similar amount and duration. This is considered to be the most appropriate rate as the interest free loans are similar in 
nature to second charge loans offered by third party financial institutions. The average discount rate used for the year ended 30 June 2015 was 
7.5% (2014: 8.0%). A fair value adjustment credit of £5.1m (2014: £0.7m) has been taken through other comprehensive income reflecting the 
unwinding of the discount in the year.
The estimated fair value is based on original selling prices and local market conditions with an allowance for low single-digit sales price inflation. 
The Group has also used independent valuation specialists in prior years to review and assess the estimated portfolio value, which has been 
updated using house price indices.
The repayment profile used to calculate the timing of future cash flows is based on historical data for first-time buyers selling their property.
The net impairment charge/reversal of the available for sale financial assets taken through the Consolidated Income Statement relates to 
borrower default including an estimate made for losses incurred that have not yet been reported to the Group by the home owner or the first 
charge provider and the impact of the change in UK house prices on the present value of the estimated future cash flows of these assets.
Further disclosures relating to financial assets are set out in note 24 and note 27(b)(i).
Residential property fund
During the prior year ended 30 June 2014, the Group disposed of its 1.3m units in a residential property fund that was managed by Hearthstone 
Investments, which at 30 June 2013, based on unadjusted quoted prices, had a market value of £1.3m, and was classified within current available 
for sale financial assets. No gain or loss was recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in respect of this disposal for the year ended 
30 June 2014.

a) Nature of inventories 
The Directors consider all inventories to be essentially current in nature, although the Group’s operational cycle is such that a proportion of 
inventories will not be realised within twelve months. It is not possible to determine with accuracy when specific inventory will be realised as this 
will be subject to a number of variables such as consumer demand and planning permission delays. 
b) Expensed inventories
The value of inventories expensed in the year ended 30 June 2015 and included in cost of sales was £2,903.5m (2014: £2,500.7m).

The allowance for doubtful receivables consists of individually impaired trade receivables that are in default. The impairment recognised in cost of 
sales represents the difference between the carrying amount of these trade receivables and the present value of any expected recoveries. 
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade receivables approximates to their fair value.

24. Financial assets (continued)
The following table provides an analysis of financial assets that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1, 
2 and 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:
• Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical liabilities;
• Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices;
•  Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset that are not based on 
observable market data (unobservable inputs).
Further details on the fair value of the financial assets measured in accordance with Level 3 can be found in note 17.
There have been no transfers of assets between levels of the fair value hierarchy and no non-recurring fair value measurements.

Trade and other payables excludes deferred income, payments received in excess of amounts recoverable on contracts, tax and social security 
and other non-financial liabilities.
Trade and other payables include land payables, which may bear interest on a contract specific basis, and items secured by legal charge as 
disclosed in note 21.
The fair values of financial assets and liabilities are determined as follows:
•  The fair values of the secured loan available for sale financial assets are calculated using an internal valuation model. The model calculates 
the fair value on a loan by loan basis using the present value of expected future cash flows of each loan. The future value of each loan is 
based on original selling prices adjusted for regional house price inflation, which in turn is based upon independent valuation specialists 
and official published valuation data. Each loan includes an allowance for future low single-digit house price inflation on the property. 
In addition, the Group includes an allowance for borrower default, including an estimate made for losses incurred that have not yet been 
reported to the Group by the home owner or first charge provider.
•  Derivative financial instruments are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable 
yield curves derived from quoted interest rates.
•  The fair values of other non-derivative financial assets and liabilities are determined based on discounted cash flow analysis using current 
market rates for similar instruments.
•  The fair value trade and payables for both the current and prior years are measured using unobservable inputs in accordance with Level 3 
of the fair value hierarchy as they include land payables which bear interest on a contract specific basis, which require discounting to 
determine a fair value.
•  The fair value of trade and other receivables for both the current and prior years are measured in accordance with Level 3. The Directors 
consider the carrying amounts of financial assets recognised in the consolidated financial statements approximate to their fair values.
The following table provides an analysis of financial liabilities that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 
1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:
• Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical liabilities;
•  Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the 
liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and 
•  Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the liability that are not based on 
observable market data (unobservable inputs).
There have been no transfers of liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy and no non-recurring fair value measurements. Barratt Developments PLC

a) Interest rate swaps 
The Group and Company enter into derivative transactions in the form of swap arrangements to manage the cash flow risks, related to interest 
rates, arising from the Group’s and Company’s sources of finance. 
As at 30 June 2015, the Group had outstanding floating rate Sterling debt and overdrafts, excluding fees, of £126.9m (2014: £164.3m) and the 
Company had outstanding net floating rate Sterling debt and overdrafts, excluding fees, of £158.5m (2014: £156.8m). In obtaining this funding, the 
Group and the Company sought to achieve certainty as to the availability of, and income statement charge related to, a designated proportion of 
anticipated future debt requirements.
The Group and Company have entered into swap arrangements to swap £137.0m (2014: £137.0m) of this debt into fixed rate Sterling debt in 
accordance with the Group and Company treasury policy outlined in note 27. After taking into account swap arrangements, the fixed interest rates 
applicable to the debt were as follows:

137.0 137.0
The swap arrangements are designated as a cash flow hedge against future interest rate movements. The fair value of the swap arrangements 
as at 30 June 2015, which is based on third party valuations, was a liability of £17.0m (2014: £19.4m) with a gain of £2.4m (2014: £7.7m) credited 
directly to equity in the year. 
There was no ineffectiveness to be taken through the Consolidated Income Statement during the year or the prior year.

b) Foreign exchange swaps 
The Group and Company enter into derivative transactions in the form of swap arrangements to manage the cash flow risks related to foreign 
exchange arising from the Group’s sources of finance denominated in US Dollars. 
As at 30 June 2015, the Group and Company had outstanding fixed rate US Dollar loan notes of $80.0m (2014: $80.0m). 
The Group and Company have entered into swap arrangements to swap all of this debt into fixed rate Sterling debt in accordance with the Group 
and Company treasury policy outlined in note 27. After taking into account swap arrangements, the fixed interest rates applicable to the debt were 
as follows:

Maturity
80.0 8.14 2017 80.0 8.14 2017
The swap arrangements are designated as cash flow hedges against future foreign exchange rate movements. The hedges match the contractual 
initial receipt, the final settlement and match 100% of the interest payments. The fair value of the swap arrangements as at 30 June 2015, which is 
based on third party valuations, was an asset of £2.3m (2014: liability of £1.8m) with a gain of £4.1m (2014: loss of £7.3m) credited directly to equity 
in the year.
There was no ineffectiveness to be taken through the Consolidated Income Statement during the year or the prior year. Further disclosures 
relating to financial instruments are set out in note 27.
27. Financial risk management
The Group’s approach to risk management and the principal operational risks of the business are detailed on pages 40 to 45. The Group’s financial 
assets, financial liabilities and derivative financial instruments are detailed in notes 24, 25 and 26.
The Group’s operations and financing arrangements expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in debt market 
prices, credit risks, liquidity risks and interest rates. The most significant of these to the Group is liquidity risk and, accordingly, there is a regular, 
detailed system for the reporting and forecasting of cash flows from the operations to Group management to ensure that risks are promptly 
identified and appropriate mitigating actions taken by the central treasury department. These forecasts are further stress-tested at a Group level 
on a regular basis to ensure that adequate headroom within facilities and banking covenants is maintained. In addition, the Group has in place a 
risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects of the other risks on its financial performance, in particular by using financial 
instruments, including debt and derivatives, to hedge interest rates and currency rates. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments 
for speculative purposes.
The Board approves treasury policies and certain day-to-day treasury activities have been delegated to a centralised Treasury Operating 
Committee, which in turn regularly reports to the Board. The treasury department implements guidelines that are established by the Board and 
the Treasury Operating Committee.
a) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its liabilities as they fall due. The Group actively maintains a mixture of long term and 
medium term committed facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for operations. The Group’s 
borrowings are typically cyclical throughout the financial year and peak in April and May; and October and November of each year, due to seasonal 
trends in income. Accordingly, the Group maintains sufficient facility headroom to cover these requirements. On a normal operating basis, the 
Group has a policy of maintaining a minimum headroom of £150.0m. The Group identifies and takes appropriate actions based upon its regular, 
detailed system for the reporting and forecasting of cash flows from its operations. At 30 June 2015, the Group had committed bank and other 
facilities of £887.7m (2014: £880.8m) and total facilities of £958.9m (2014: £932.0m). The Group’s drawn debt, excluding fees, against the 
committed facilities was £186.2m (2014: £180.8m). This represented 21.0% (2014: 20.5%) of available committed facilities at 30 June 2015. 
In addition, the Group had £360.4m (2014: £274.7m) of cash and cash equivalents. 
The Group was in compliance with its financial covenants at 30 June 2015. At the date of approval of the Financial Statements, the Group’s internal 
forecasts indicate that it will remain in compliance with these covenants for the foreseeable future, being at least twelve months from the date of 
signing these Financial Statements.
The Group’s objective is to minimise refinancing risk. The Group therefore has a policy that the average maturity of its committed bank facilities 
and private placement notes is at least two years on average with a target of three years. At 30 June 2015, the average maturity of the Group’s 
facilities was 4.0 years (2014: 3.7 years). Barratt Developments PLC

b) Market risk (price risk)
i) UK housing market risk
This section specifically discusses UK housing market risk in the context of the financial instruments in the Group Balance Sheet. 
The Group is subject to the prevailing conditions of the UK economy and the Group’s earnings are dependent upon the level of UK house prices. 
UK house prices are determined by the UK economy and economic conditions including employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence, 
mortgage availability and competitor pricing. However, the Group does seek to maintain an appropriate geographic spread of operating divisions 
and an appropriate product mix to mitigate any risks caused by local economic conditions. The Group has detailed procedures to manage its 
market related operational risks, which include:
•  a weekly review of key trading indicators, including reservations, sales rates, visitor levels, levels of incentives, competitor activity and cash 
flow projections;
•  the provision to mortgage providers with complete transparency of house purchase prices alongside any discounts or other incentives in 
order that they have appropriate information upon which to base their lending decision; and
•  collaboration with key mortgage lenders to ensure that products are appropriate wherever possible for customers.
The UK housing market affects the valuation of the Group’s non-financial assets and liabilities and the critical judgements applied by management 
in these Financial Statements, including the valuation of land and work in progress, goodwill and intangible assets.
The Group’s financial assets and liabilities, which are directly linked to the UK housing market, are as follows:

b) Market risk (price risk) (continued)
i) UK housing market risk (continued)
The value of the Group’s available for sale financial assets is directly linked to the UK housing market. At 30 June 2015, these assets were carried 
at a fair value of £107.0m (2014: £122.4m). Further information is set out in note 17.
The Company has no financial assets and liabilities which are directly linked to the UK housing market.
Sensitivity analysis
The value of the Group’s house price linked financial assets, which are solely available for sale financial assets, is sensitive to UK house prices 
since the amount repayable is dependent upon the market price of the property to which the loan is linked. At 30 June 2015, if UK house prices had 
been 5% lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s house price linked financial assets and liabilities would decrease in value, 
excluding the effects of tax, by £5.8m (2014: £2.7m) with a corresponding reduction in both the result for the year and equity.
In addition the value of the asset is affected by mortgage rates, the availability of finance and UK economic conditions since all of these affect the 
risk of default.
ii) Interest rate risk
The Group has both interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities. Floating rate borrowings expose the Group to cash flow interest rate 
risk and fixed rate borrowings expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The Group has a policy of maintaining both long term fixed rate funding and medium term floating rate funding so as to ensure that there is 
appropriate flexibility for the Group’s operational requirements. The Group has entered into swap arrangements to hedge cash flow risks 
relating to interest rate movements on a proportion of its debt and has entered into fixed rate debt in the form of US Dollar denominated 
private placements.
The Group has a conservative treasury risk management strategy and the Group’s interest rates are fixed using both swaps and fixed rate debt 
instruments. The Group’s policy target is for 0-40% of average borrowings over the 3 year plan period to be at fixed rates of interest. Due to the 
seasonality of the Group’s funding requirements, 105.4% (2014: 87.2%) of the Group’s gross borrowings were fixed as at 30 June 2015 and the 
average over the 3 year plan period is 43.2%. Group interest rates are fixed using both swaps and fixed rate debt instruments.

Floating interest rates on Sterling borrowings are linked to the UK bank rate, LIBOR and money market rates. The floating rates are fixed in 
advance for periods generally ranging from one to six months. Short term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft, committed and 
uncommitted bank facilities. The weighted average interest rate for floating rate borrowings in 2015 was 3.1% (2014: 3.4%).
US Dollar denominated private placement notes of £50.4m (2014: £46.1m) were arranged at fixed interest rates and exposed the Group to fair 
value interest rate risk. The weighted average interest rate for fixed rate US Dollar denominated private placement notes, after the effect of 
foreign exchange rate swaps, for 2015 was 8.1% (2014: 8.2%) with, at 30 June 2015, a weighted average period of 2.2 years (2014: 3.2 years) for 
which the rate is fixed. Barratt Developments PLC

b) Market risk (price risk) (continued)
ii) Interest rate risk (continued)
Sensitivity analysis
In the year ended 30 June 2015, if UK interest rates had been 50 basis points higher/lower, as this is a reasonably possible change, and all other 
variables were held constant, the Group’s pre-tax profit would decrease/increase by £0.9m (2014: £0.7m), the Group’s post-tax profit would 
decrease/increase by £0.6m (2014: £0.5m) and the Group’s equity would decrease/increase by £0.6m (2014: £0.5m).
iii) Foreign exchange rate risk
As at 30 June 2015, the Group has fixed rate US Dollar denominated private placement notes of $80.0m (2014: $80.0m). In order to mitigate risks 
associated with the movement in the foreign exchange rate, the Group has a policy of fully hedging the principal of its US Dollar denominated debt 
and a significant proportion of the interest payments. The Group therefore entered into foreign exchange swap arrangements on the issue of its 
US Dollar denominated debt, all of which are designated as cash flow hedges, which fully hedge the principal of its US Dollar denominated debt 
and the US Dollar interest payments.
Details of the Group’s foreign exchange swaps are provided in note 26.
Sensitivity analysis
In the year ended 30 June 2015, if the US Dollar per Pound Sterling exchange rate had been $0.20 higher/lower and all other variables were held 
constant, the Group’s pre-tax profit would decrease/increase by £nil (2014: £nil), the Group’s post-tax profit would decrease/increase by £nil 
(2014: £nil) and the Group’s equity would decrease/increase by £nil (2014: £nil).
c) Credit risk
In the majority of cases, the Group receives cash upon legal completion for private sales and receives advance stage payments from Registered 
Providers for affordable housing. The Group has £107.0m (2014: £122.4m) of available for sale financial assets, which expose it to credit risk, 
although this asset is spread over a large number of properties. In addition, the Group and Company have an investment of £25.6m (2014: £25.6m) 
in a joint venture that holds available for sale financial assets, which exposes the joint venture to credit risk, although this is spread over a large 
number of properties. Included within trade and other receivables £45.9m (2014: £41.4m) is due from the Homes and Communities Agency in 
respect of the Help to Buy scheme. Since this receivable is due from a UK Government agency, the Group considers that this receivable has an 
insignificant risk of default. Other than this, neither the Group nor the Company have a significant concentration of credit risk, as their exposure is 
spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The Group manages credit risk in the following ways:
•  The Group has a credit policy that is limited to financial institutions with high credit ratings, as set by international credit rating agencies, 
and has a policy determining the maximum permissible exposure to any single counterparty. 
•  The Group only contracts derivative financial instruments with counterparties with which the Group has an ISDA Master Agreement in 
place. These agreements permit net settlement, thereby reducing the Group’s credit exposure to individual counterparties.
The maximum exposure to any counterparty at 30 June 2015 was £64.4m (2014: £71.8m) of cash on deposit with a financial institution. The  
carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the Financial Statements, net of any allowance for losses, represents the Group’s maximum 
exposure to credit risk. 
As at 30 June 2015, the Company was exposed to £695.6m (2014: £810.2m) of credit risk in relation to intercompany loans, as well as financial 
guarantees, performance bonds and the bank borrowings of subsidiary undertakings. The Company was also exposed to credit risk through its 
joint venture as explained above. Further details are provided in notes 34 and 35.
d) Capital risk management (cash flow risk)
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for 
shareholders and meet its liabilities as they fall due whilst maintaining an appropriate capital structure.
The Group manages as capital its equity, as set out in the Statement of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity, its bank borrowings (being overdrafts, 
loan notes and bank loans) and its private placement notes, as set out in note 25. 
The Group is subject to the prevailing conditions of the UK economy and the Group’s earnings are dependent upon the level of UK house prices. 
UK house prices are determined by the UK economy and economic conditions including employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence, 
mortgage availability and competitor pricing. The management of these operational risks is set out in the principal risks and uncertainties on 
pages 40 to 45.
In addition, the other methods by which the Group can manage its short term and long term capital structure include: adjusting the level of 
dividends and special cash payments paid to shareholders (assuming the Company is paying a dividend or a special cash payment); issuing new 
share capital; arranging debt to meet liability payments; and selling assets to reduce debt. Barratt Developments PLC

28. Retirement benefit obligations
The Group operates defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes.
a) Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for all qualifying employees, under which it pays contributions to an 
independently administered fund. Contributions are based upon a fixed percentage of the employee’s pay and once these have been paid, 
the Group has no further obligations under these schemes.

Contributions during the year
Group defined contribution schemes Consolidated Income Statement charge 8.1 7.8
At the balance sheet date, there were outstanding contributions of £0.9m (2014: £0.8m), which were paid on or before the due date.
b) Defined benefit scheme 
The Group operates a funded defined benefit pension scheme in Great Britain, the Barratt Group Pension & Life Assurance Scheme (the 
‘Scheme’), which with effect from 30 June 2009, ceased to offer future accrual of defined benefit pensions. Alternative defined contribution 
pension arrangements are in place for current employees.
The Scheme provides benefits to members based on their length of service and their salary in the final years leading up to retirement or date of 
ceasing active accrual if earlier. The Group operates the Scheme under the UK regulatory framework, with a legally separate fund that is 
Trustee-administered. The Trustees are responsible for ensuring that the Scheme is sufficiently funded to meet current and future benefit 
payments and for the investment policy with regard to scheme assets. 
The Trustees must agree a funding plan with the Group such that any funding shortfall is expected to be met by additional contributions and 
investment performance. In order to assess the level of contributions, triennial valuations are carried out using prudent assumptions.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the Scheme was carried out at 30 November 2013. The results of this valuation have been updated to 
30 June 2015 by a qualified independent actuary. The Group has agreed with the Trustees of the Scheme to make contributions to the Scheme of 
£13.3m per annum until 30 November 2015 and then £9.5m per annum until 31 December 2016 to address the Scheme’s actuarial deficit. 
The Group also continues to meet the Scheme’s administration expenses and Pension Protection Fund levy. 
At the balance sheet date, there were outstanding contributions of £1.1m (2014: £1.1m).
The Scheme exposes the Group to a number of risks, the most significant being:
Risk Description
Volatile asset returns The defined benefit obligation (‘DBO’) is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to high quality corporate bond yields. 
If assets underperform this discount rate, this will create a plan deficit. The Scheme holds a proportion of its assets in equities 
and other growth assets which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term. However, returns are likely to be 
volatile in the short term, potentially resulting in short term cash requirements and an increase in the defined benefit obligation 
recorded on the Balance Sheet. The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the 
Scheme’s long term objectives.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the funding and accounting liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an 
increase in the value of the Scheme’s investments in corporate and government bonds. 
Inflation risk A significant proportion of the DBO is indexed in line with price inflation, with higher inflation leading to higher liabilities.
Life expectancy The majority of the Scheme’s obligations are to provide a pension for the life of each of the members, so increases in life 
expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.
For the purposes of calculating the accounting costs and obligations of the Scheme, the assets of the defined benefit scheme have been 
calculated at fair (bid) value. The liabilities of the Scheme have been calculated at each balance sheet date using the following assumptions:
Principal actuarial assumptions 2015 2014
Weighted average assumptions to determine benefit obligations
Discount rate 3.80% 4.30%
Rate of price inflation 3.30% 3.30%
Weighted average assumptions to determine net cost
Discount rate 4.30% 4.70%
Rate of price inflation 3.30% 3.40%
Members are assumed to exchange 19% of their pension for cash on retirement. The assumptions have been chosen by the Group following 
advice from Mercer Limited, the Group’s actuarial advisers. Barratt Developments PLC

The following table illustrates the life expectancy for an average member on reaching age 65, according to the mortality assumptions used to 
calculate the Scheme liabilities:
Assumptions Male Female 
Retired member born in 1950 (life expectancy at age 65) 23.6 years 26.1 years
Non-retired member born in 1970 (life expectancy at age 65) 25.4 years 28.1 years
The base mortality assumptions are based upon the S1NA mortality tables with an adjustment to allow for the Scheme members being 1.5 years 
younger than the population of the S1NA mortality tables. Allowance for future increases in life expectancy is made in line with the CMI 2014 
projections with a long term trend of 1.25% per annum (2014: 1.25% per annum).

a) Details of the share-based payment schemes
i) Long Term Performance Plan
The Long Term Performance Plan (the ‘LTPP’) was initially approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held in November 2003 to 
take effect from 1 July 2003. The ten year limit on powers to grant any awards under the LTPP expired on 12 November 2013 and a resolution 
seeking: (i) the approval of shareholders to extend the LTPP for a further ten years to 12 November 2023; and; (ii) the adoption of the updated rules 
of the LTPP , was proposed to, and passed by, shareholders at the 2012 Annual General Meeting. During the financial year ended 30 June 2015, 
2,176,347 (2014: 2,407,303) awards were granted under the LTPP . Awards under the LTPP are at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee 
(the ‘Committee’), taking into account individual performance and overall performance of the Group. An employee is not eligible to receive options 
under the Executive Share Option Scheme and awards under the LTPP in the same financial year. Information on the performance conditions for 
the LTPP awards to be granted during the 2015/16 financial year and each of the outstanding LTPP awards, can be found on pages 87 to 88 and 
page 94.
ii) Savings-Related Share Option Scheme
In November 2008, the Company adopted the Savings-Related Share Option Scheme (‘SRSOS’). Under the SRSOS, participants are required to 
make monthly contributions to a HM Revenue and Customs (‘HMRC’) approved savings contract with a bank or building society for a period of 
three or five years. On entering into the savings contract, participants are granted an option to acquire ordinary shares in the Company at an 
exercise price determined under the rules of the SRSOS. The SRSOS is open to all eligible employees as determined by the Board and is not 
subject to the satisfaction of any performance conditions.
iii) Executive Share Option Scheme
In November 2008, the Company adopted the Executive Share Option Scheme (the ‘ESOS’). The grant of share options under the ESOS is at the 
discretion of the Committee, taking into account individual performance and the overall performance of the Group. Options must be held for a 
minimum of three years from the date of grant before they can be exercised and lapse if not exercised within ten years from the date of grant. 
The exercise of options granted under the ESOS is subject to the achievement of an objective performance condition set by the Committee, which 
for options granted in 2009/10 was based upon total shareholder return and earnings per share performance conditions. The performance 
conditions for the ESOS granted in December 2009 (the ‘2009/10 ESOS’), were tested after the financial year ended 30 June 2012 and accordingly, 
32.8% of the 2009/10 ESOS vested on 10 December 2012. Participants have until 9 December 2019 to exercise their options.
iv) Senior Management Share Option Plan
In December 2009, the Company adopted the Senior Management Share Option Plan 2009-2012 (the ‘SMSOP’). The Board approved the grant of 
share options to employees under the SMSOP , which are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant, provided the 
employee remains employed by the Group. Individuals who participate in the SMSOP are not eligible to participate in the LTPP or ESOS; therefore 
Executive Directors do not participate in the SMSOP . There is currently no intention to make any further grants under the SMSOP . The options 
granted under the SMSOP in December 2009 (the ‘2009/10 SMSOP’), were subject to a ‘continued employment’ performance condition. 
The 2009/10 SMSOP vested on 10 December 2012 and participants have until 9 December 2019 to exercise their options.
v) Co-Investment Plan
The Co-Investment Plan (the ‘Plan’) was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held in November 2005 and is currently utilised 
to hold shares awarded in respect of any bonus earned in excess of 100% of base salary. The Committee has the discretion to award matching 
shares against the deferred shares; however, no matching shares have been awarded to date. The Executive Directors also have the opportunity 
to voluntarily defer additional amounts of annual bonus up to a maximum of 25% of basic salary into the Plan. Further details are on page 87.
vi) Senior Management Incentive Scheme
In October 2012, the Board adopted the Senior Management Incentive Scheme (the ‘SMIS’). Awards under the SMIS are at the discretion of the 
Chief Executive (or in his absence, the Chairman of the Board). Any awards under the SMIS must be held for a minimum of three years from the 
date of grant. Executive Directors and those individuals directly below this level are not eligible to participate in the SMIS. Any award granted 
under the SMIS is subject to performance conditions as set for the LTPP , excluding the total shareholder return condition, granted in the same 
financial year. Further details are on page 87. Barratt Developments PLC

The weighted average share price, at the date of exercise, of share options exercised during the year was 478.4p (2014: 349.1p). The weighted 
average life for all schemes outstanding at the end of the year was 1.8 years (2014: 2.0 years).
d) Consolidated Income Statement charge
A charge to the Consolidated Income Statement has been made for the awards issued on or after 7 November 2002 that had not vested at 
1 January 2005 in accordance with IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payments’. 
i) Savings-Related Share Option Scheme
The weighted average fair value of the options granted during 2015 was 119.8p (2014: 102.6p) per award. The awards have been valued using  
a Black-Scholes model.
The weighted average inputs to the Black-Scholes model were as follows:
Grants 
2015 
Grants 
2014
Average share price 536p 370p
Average exercise price 447p 349p
Expected volatility 33.5% 38.0%
Expected life 3.2 years 3.3 years
Risk free interest rate 0.70% 1.20%
Expected dividends 4.51% 3.30%
Expected volatility was determined by reference to the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over a period consistent with the expected life 
of the options. The expected life used in the models has been adjusted, based on the Directors’ best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, 
exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
ii) Long Term Performance Plan
The weighted average fair value of the options granted during 2015 was 357.8p (2014: 327.5p). 
The awards have been valued using a Black-Scholes model for the earnings per share element of the scheme and a Monte Carlo model for the 
total shareholder return element of the scheme.  Barratt Developments PLC

31. Reserves
Hedging reserve
The hedging reserve represents the cumulative effective portion of deferred fair value gains or losses on derivative financial instruments that 
have been designated as cash flow hedges by the Company, where the hedged cash flows are still expected to occur.
Transfers to the hedging reserve in the period equate to losses of £0.5m (2014: £5.4m). This loss comprises a loss of £4.6m (2014: £1.9m gain) 
relating to interest rate swaps and gains of £4.1m (2014: £7.3m loss) on foreign exchange swaps.
Transfers from the hedging reserve to the Consolidated Income Statement for the period are gains of £2.9m (2014: £11.7m). Transfers arose from 
continuing cash flow hedges of interest rate risks and foreign exchange risks where the hedged risk impacted profit or loss in the year. Of these 
gains, £7.0m (2014: £5.8m) related to hedged interest cash flows and losses of £4.1m (2014: £5.9m gains) related to hedged foreign currency 
cash flows.
Merger reserve
The merger reserve comprises the non-statutory premium arising on shares issued as consideration for the acquisition of subsidiaries where 
merger relief under section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 applies.
Own shares reserve
The own shares reserve represents the cost of shares in Barratt Developments PLC purchased in the market and held by the EBT on behalf of the 
Company in order to satisfy options and awards under the Company’s incentive schemes. 
Share-based payments reserve
The share-based payments reserve represents the obligation of the Group in relation to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
Parent Company Income Statement
In accordance with the provisions of section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, a separate Income Statement for the Company has not been 
presented. The Company’s profit for the year was £16.7m (2014: £165.4m). Barratt Developments PLC

e) Property purchase by a Director of Barratt Developments PLC
The Board and certain members of senior management are related parties within the definition of IAS 24 (Revised) ‘Related Party Disclosures’ 
(‘IAS 24’) and the Board are related parties within the definition of Chapter 11 of the UK Listing Rules (‘Chapter 11’). There is no difference between 
transactions with key personnel of the Company and transactions with key personnel of the Group.
During the year, the Group entered into the following transaction which, for the purposes of IAS 24 is considered to be a ‘related party transaction’.
In August 2014, Mark Clare, at the time, Group Chief Executive, reserved a flat (including a car parking space) from Fulham Wharf LLP , a joint 
venture partnership between BDW Trading Limited (the Company’s main trading subsidiary) and London and Quadrant Housing Trust (L&Q), at a 
purchase price of £1,692,350. This purchase was conducted at a fair and reasonable market price based on four independent market valuations 
and similar comparable transactions at that time. An amount of £2,500 was paid on reservation and a deposit of £166,735 was paid on 13 October 
2014. The remaining balance will become payable on legal completion, which is scheduled to be in December 2015, in accordance with the Group’s 
normal terms of trading. 
Fulham Wharf LLP is not controlled by and is not a ‘subsidiary undertaking’ of the Company.
On notification by Mark Clare of the above transaction, the Board sought advice from its legal advisers and corporate brokers in respect of the 
application of Chapter 11 and section 190 did not extend to LLPs and therefore the provisions of Chapter 11 and section 190 did not apply to this 
transaction. Consequently, no shareholder approval was required for this transaction.
There have been no ‘smaller related party transactions’ as defined in Listing Rule 11.1.10R for the year ended 30 June 2015 or in the year ended 
30 June 2014. Barratt Developments PLC

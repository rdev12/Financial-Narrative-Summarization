Chairman’s letter
Lord Grade of  Yarmouth
Dear Shareholder
Overview
The major corporate event during 2010 was our initial public offering and I would like to take this opportunity to welcome both 
pre and post IPO shareholders to our first annual report as a public listed company.  As a result of the IPO the Group has been 
able to accelerate its growth plans.
In the lead up to the IPO, a new ten year agreement was negotiated and completed with Waitrose (the grocery division of John 
Lewis Partnership), our sourcing partner from day one.  Without the support of the John Lewis Partnership (and subsequently the 
John Lewis Pension Fund) Ocado would not be the exciting business it is today and it is fitting to record their crucial role in the 
Ocado story with our gratitude.
Corporate governance
We continue to be a flexible and entrepreneurial company while recognising the importance of high standards of corporate 
governance.  Our values underpin our approach to doing business.  We have worked over the year towards complying with the 
corporate governance requirements and continue to do so.  
Board changes 
As part of our transition towards compliance with the corporate governance requirements, the Board has said farewell to T om 
Clayton, Jonathan Faiman, Jeremy Frampton, Patrick Lewis and Michael robarts.  On behalf of the Board I would like to pay thanks 
to them for their valuable contributions and wish them every success in their future endeavours.  We have welcomed ruth 
Anderson and David Grigson to the Board as independent Non-Executive Directors.  They bring with them a wealth of experience 
and have already settled in as integral members of the Board.  David is the Senior Independent Director and chairman of the 
Nomination Committee and ruth is chairman of the Audit Committee.
People
Our customers are the people who drive our business and we continue to find ways to respond to their needs by creating a better 
customer experience and new ideas to improve their online shopping experience.  Our employees continue to demonstrate their 
willingness to respond.  I would like to thank all members of the Ocado family for their continued energy, passion, expertise and 
commitment during this milestone year.
looking forward
I believe our focus on Ocado’s superior customer offer continues to position us favourably as the market expands – delighting 
our customers and creating value for our shareholders.  I look forward to our shareholders, customers, employees and suppliers 
continuing to share in Ocado’s growth and successes.

Chief Executive Officer’s review
The past year has been a year of significant progress for Ocado.  
In the core operations we delivered a strong set of results for 
2010.  Our strategy of continuously improving our market leading 
customer offer continued to drive sales growth which has delivered 
through to the bottom line.  This was a tremendous achievement by 
all the members of the Ocado team.
Delivering gross sales growth of 29% to £551.1 million against the 
backdrop of a weak UK economy is a strong result.  As the business 
grows and starts to achieve scale we are seeing the benefits of 
considerable operational leverage.  The business achieved numerous 
financial milestones in the year including reporting an adjusted EBIT 
profit for the second half of the year and being profitable at the EBT 
level for the final quarter (16 trading weeks).
The UK online grocery market is still at an early stage of 
development.  We believe the most effective way Ocado can increase 
adoption is to continue improving our customer offering.  As in 
previous years, we have worked hard to improve this on many levels, 
including working on range, price, availability, accuracy, ease of use as 
well as other service initiatives.
This year we expanded our range to 21.5k SKUs from 20.5k at the 
end of FY09, all of which are available to customers in the whole 
of our delivery geography.  T o put this in context, we have now 
taken our range from being among the smallest offered in any UK 
supermarket three years ago to one of the largest ranges today.  As 
we expand the capacity of the CFC further we expect to be able to 
offer the largest grocery range of any major UK supermarket.
A particularly important addition to our range this year has been the 
launch of the Ocado own-label range, which has been introduced to 
complement the Waitrose own-label products.  It offers the Ocado 
customer a range that matches closely in price and quality the core 
own-label ranges of the major UK supermarkets.  It has been a 
great achievement to build the team and the supplier relationships 
necessary to source and develop the Ocado own-label range.  While 
it is still early days we have seen strong take-up with 64% of all 
baskets containing an Ocado product in the final four week period 
of the year.  The Ocado own-label range now has over 250 products 
and we expect this to grow substantially in the coming years.
The launch of the Ocado range touches on another key area where 
we have improved this year, pricing.  We have continued to invest in 
our price positioning over the year through both range and absolute 
pricing.  Due to our increasing scale we managed to maintain 
margin while making these investments in price.  We continued our 
commitment to match the standard prices of all identical items of the 
UK’s largest supermarket group.  As we have expanded our range, 
we have increased the number of T esco Price Match items to c.7,200.  
We also launched “Switch and Save” which allows our customers to 
move to lower priced products with improved value as they check 
out.  This year we have run more promotions than ever before, 
increasing the value of our service to our customers.  The investments 
made in pricing over recent years have been recognised by the 
consumer and have led to a broadening of our customer base from a 
demographic perspective.
We also made substantial improvements this year to our customer 
interfaces with the aim of providing the customer with the best 
possible experience in online grocery shopping regardless of how 
they want to interact with Ocado, whether on the website, mobile 
phone or iPad.  This year we also upgraded the website and iPhone 
app and launched apps on the iPad and Android mobile devices with 
mobile checkouts reaching 12% since the New Y ear.
In November we launched the new version of the Ocado website.  
This has been a major operation involving teams across the business 
from trading through to creative to IT .  We have had a positive 
reaction from our customers and its introduction has driven an 
increased average spend per order.  Beyond the improved customer 
interface the new website provides a new back end platform which 
will allow us to continue to innovate over the coming years.
Ocado received numerous industry awards for its customer offer, 
including World Etailer of the Y ear 2010 at the Oracle World retail 
Awards.  However, we are not resting on our laurels and there are 
many customer offer developments planned for the coming year.

Our Performance
The customer offer improvements have led to both a significant 
increase in new customers using the service and an increase in spend 
per customer.  Average orders per week increased from 70,873 in 
FY09 to 92,916 in FY10, and exceeded 100,000 for the first time in 
the week commencing 10 May 2010.  As expected, average order 
size showed a slight decrease to £114.06 for the year.  This is due to 
changing customer behaviour with customers continuing to increase 
their frequency of shop but with a slight decline in order size.  We are 
pleased to note that we have seen the rate of decline slow over the 
course of the year.
Significant effort was also spent over the year on the behind the 
scenes projects which enable us to deliver capacity growth and 
customer offer improvements.  These occurred in all areas of the 
business affecting processes, software and hardware.  For example 
in the CFC one of the major projects was the addition of three new 
chill aisles.  This enabled the termination of the relatively inefficient 
process of trolley picking for chilled goods.  On the software side over 
1,500 individual changes were made to our CFC systems.
As we explained at the time of the IPO, increasing the scale of 
the business at this rate presents operational challenges.  The CFC 
capacity grew in line with expectations with a slight impact on 
productivity gains.  We reintroduced a number of processes, such as 
trolley picking, to help cope with increased demand.  This impacted 
CFC efficiency with units per hour (“UPH”) decreasing by 2.2% to 
121 UPH.  As our planned capital spend is invested in CFC1 over 
the coming years, we expect productivity to rise substantially and the 
long-term target of 180 UPH remains in place.  At 99% for the year, 
the accuracy of our offer remained at a level we believe is significantly 
higher than our competitors.  This is slightly down on last year and we 
expect the capital projects planned for the CFC will improve this.
On the delivery side of the business the progress towards the long-
term target is more linear and we have seen significant improvement 
this year.
The increasing scale combined with upgrades to the routing software 
and vans has led to drops per van per week (“DPv/wk”) increasing 
by 10% to 133.  In the most productive week of the year we achieved 
159 DPv/wk (compared to our long-term target of 175 DPv/wk).
Outside the core operations, this has been a significant year for the 
business.  Three major events occurred that are the building blocks 
for the long-term success of the business.  In May, we signed a new 
ten year agreement with Waitrose.  We were delighted to sign this 
agreement which is our fifth and longest contract with Waitrose.  This 
ensures that we will continue our relationship, which is now in its 
eleventh year.  In July, Ocado Group plc (the “Company”) listed on 
the London Stock Exchange.  This has many benefits for the Company 
and its shareholders but the primary benefit was to raise significant 
funds.  These will be used to fund the capital projects required to 
serve the demand we expect to see in the online grocery market.  In 
October, we reached agreement to purchase the site for a second 
CFC (“CFC2”); this is the most substantial capital project in the plan 
to more than triple the capacity of the business from 2009 to 2013.
Current trading and outlook 
As we announced on 4 March 2011 our growth has continued into 
the new financial year seeing gross sales increase by 25% in Q1.  
We are focused on positioning ourselves to take advantage of the 
significant latent demand for online grocery in the UK.  We continue 
to improve the customer offer, while at the same time build capacity 
to serve the increasing demand.  
“This was a landmark year for Ocado with gross sales up 29% for the year, we have delivered on 
the targets set out at the flotation.  We have continued our focus on improving the customer 
offer, which has led to a record number of customers and sales with the achievement of 
profitability in the final quarter.  Ocado’s growth continues to outpace the market.”

Chief Financial Officer’s review
Andrew Bracey 
Chief Financial Officer
2010 was a landmark year for Ocado with the Group reaching 
EBIT profitability pre-exceptional item for the second half of the 
financial year and EBT profitability in the last quarter of the financial 
year.  This is the first time the Group has achieved EBIT profitability 
and demonstrates the operational leverage of the Ocado model.  
This was further demonstrated by the incremental EBITDA margin 
increasing to 10.3% for the whole year, up from 9.1% in H1 to 11.3% 
in H2
1
.  This increased operational leverage has contributed to an 
increase in EBITDA margins from 2.2% of gross sales in Fy09 to 4.0% 
in Fy10
1
.
Revenue
Gross sales were up 29% to £551.1 million for the year.  The growth 
was driven by a substantial increase in orders per week offset by a 
slight decrease in average order size.  The number of active customers 
increased by 19% to 262,258 at the end of FY10, with average weekly 
new customers up by 37% to 2,948.  There was minimal geographic 
expansion during the year.  revenue grew by 28% to £515.7 million.  
Spend on marketing vouchers remained broadly flat at 1.5% of sales, 
increasing by 25% to £8.1 million which was slightly less than the rate 
of growth in gross sales.
Gross profit
Gross profit increased 32% to £161.6 million.  This equates to a 58 
basis point increase in gross margin over the period to 29.3%.  This was 
driven by positive changes in input prices, retail price inflation, supplier 
support and changes in product mix as well as the effects of the 
increasing scale of the business.  Over the period the average price of 
items sold increased by 0.8%.
Other income increased by 136% to  £6.2 million.  This was primarily 
driven by a 161% rise in marketing revenue.  The increased space on 
the new website launched at the end of the year has provided us 
with further opportunities to generate additional marketing revenue.
Operating costs
Distribution costs increased by 20% to £132.8 million.  This increase 
was slower than sales growth demonstrating the developing 
operating leverage of the business.  Distribution costs decreased as a 
percentage of sales from 26% to 24%.  The two major components 
of distribution costs are CFC costs and trunking and delivery costs.  
CFC costs increased by 17%.  variable CFC costs increased broadly 
in line with revenue due to limited productivity gains.  However, the 
operating leverage of the fixed cost base on increased volume meant 
that total CFC costs continued to fall as a percentage of revenue.  
Trunking and delivery costs increased by 23% with productivity gains 
more than offsetting inflationary pressures.  Administrative expenses 
increased by 25% to £36.9 million.  The main drivers of these 
cost increases were additional employment costs and associated 
infrastructure, including the additional costs of being a public listed 
company.
Operating profit/loss
Operating loss pre-exceptionals for the full year decreased from 
£14.4 million to £1.8 million, a decrease of 87%.  This decrease was 
primarily due to the growth in revenue that enabled greater operating 
efficiencies, as highlighted above.  This is demonstrated clearly in H2 
when the business made a pre-exceptionals EBIT of £0.9 million.  This 
compares to an EBIT loss of £7.0 million in the equivalent period in 
FY09.  In Q4 the business achieved PBT , for the first time, of  
£0.3 million.
In the second half of the year the Company incurred the one-
off exceptional costs associated with the IPO.  These, along with 
associated fees for a £100 million credit facility, came in at £12.4 
million, substantially under the budget set out in the Prospectus of 
£15 million.  £3.5 million was charged as a one-off exceptional item 
to the income statement with the remainder taken as financing costs 
and through the share premium account.
Net finance costs
Net finance costs decreased by 38% to £6.9 million from £11.1 
million.  This reduction in costs was primarily due to the proceeds of 
the IPO enabling repayment of debt shortly after the IPO in July.  The 
interest paid on borrowings reduced to £8.4 million.
Taxation
The statutory rate of tax applicable was 28%.  A deferred tax credit 
of £5.0 million was recognised.  Ocado had approximately £260 
million of unutilised carried forward tax losses as at the end of FY10.

Our Performance
loss per share
Basic and diluted losses per share decreased from 6.05p to 1.63p.  
This reduction in loss per share is due primarily to the improved 
financial performance as well as an increased number of shares on 
issue after the IPO.
Cash flow
Net operating cash flow doubled this year to £8.2 million.  This  
was primarily due to a significant reduction in loss before tax and a 
reduction in interest paid offsetting the impact of minimal net changes 
in working capital this year.
Balance sheet
The IPO enhanced the strength of the balance sheet with net assets 
increasing by over £200 million to £171.8 million.  £45.5 million of 
debt was repaid in the financial year and the Company ended the 
financial year with cash and cash equivalents (including short-term 
treasury deposits) of £154.6 million.  In addition, the arrangement of 
a £100 million credit facility further increased the financial flexibility of 
the business.
Capital investment
In FY10 there was capital expenditure of £35.0 million, an increase 
of 52%.  The capital investment increased the capacity of the Hatfield 
CFC (“CFC1”), expanded the van fleet and funded the internal 
development of new computer software.
Capital expenditure plans remain as described during the IPO.  
Completion of CFC1 is expected to cost £80 million.  This will 
increase both capacity to 180k orders per week and the range 
stocked.  CFC2 is expected to cost £210 million.  The construction of 
the new CFC in Dordon, Warwickshire, will commence in the coming 
months and will continue into 2012 and beyond.
“Strong sales growth has led to Ocado reaching EBIT profitability pre-exceptionals for the 
second half of the financial year and EBT profitability in the last quarter of the financial year.  
Achieving profitability clearly demonstrates the operational leverage of the Ocado model, 
with EBITDA margin from additional sales at 11.3% in the second half of the year.”

Ocado Group plc  Annual report and accounts for the 52 weeks ended 28 November 2010
 
 
Ocado provides an opportunity to fully access developments and 
growth in this early stage market, unhindered by bricks and mortar 
customer fulfilment processes.
The uk grocery market is huge
At £151bn the UK grocery market is as large as all other UK 
retail markets combined.  The UK grocery marketplace is highly 
competitive and is dominated by the big four grocers: Asda, 
Morrisons, Sainsbury and T esco.  Competition for market share is 
intensive as retailers strive to create new growth opportunities, 
reformulate propositions and build more multi-channel customer 
relationships.  
Retail is moving online
Spurred on by the continuing rise of broadband penetration, 
smartphone ownership, internet familiarity within the home and the 
evolution of website design consumers are increasingly becoming 
more comfortable with and place more confidence in online retail.  
Online retail markets have grown as shoppers have broadened 
from the original tech savvy early adopters to a customer base that 
broadly reflects the demographics of the UK.  This means that online 
penetration has reached almost 10% for categories such as clothing 
which commentators previously suggested would not move online.
However, grocery has been slower to move online
Historically, online grocery retail has lagged the development of other 
online categories due to the specific nature and logistical challenges 
traditionally associated with grocery.  Only a small proportion of 
grocery has so far moved online, estimated to be less than 3% of the 
overall grocery market.
Although online grocery is at an early stage of development it is 
widely anticipated to become an increasingly important segment 
of the overall grocery market.  IGD expects online grocery sales to 
become a larger proportion of the overall grocery market over the 
coming years, with total sales forecast to be over £7bn by 2014.  This 
represents a forecast annual growth rate many times faster than that 
of the wider grocery sector.  
Structural drivers fuel future growth
Consumers seeking a better experience in how they buy their 
groceries are driving the transition to online grocery shopping.  As long 
as online grocery retail continues to become more desirable from a 
customer’s perspective the market will show substantial growth.  
Simultaneously there has been an ongoing drive towards providing 
greater consumer choice particularly across a range of online 
food and non-foodstuffs (catering for issues around well-being, 
sustainability, provenance as well as greater differentiation across 
the value-premium spectrum).  Operating models that support 
consumer diversity have the ability to unlock further potential within 
this market.

Overcoming the unique challenges of online grocery retail
Demand for online grocery in the UK has previously been hindered 
by the unique challenges associated with online grocery retailing. 
For online grocery penetration to catch up with other online markets, 
retailers have to overcome these challenges and meet consumers’ 
needs.
The logistical challenges associated with online grocery are immense 
and represent one of the greatest barriers to entry.  The retailing 
mantra of providing outstanding customer service is simple to 
understand.  However, customer service and fulfilment within the 
online grocery space is complicated: picking an average of 55 items 
an order, across a product range of over 20,000 SKUs, that have a 
varied but limited life, requiring handling and storage across three 
temperature regimes (chilled, ambient and frozen) for onward 
delivery to customers in narrow time slots is not for the faint-hearted.  
Different approaches to addressing the market opportunity
The approach of the traditional grocery retailers to these online 
challenges has been based on using their stores and store-based 
systems.  This contrasts with the Ocado centralised picking model – a 
pioneering approach based on complex systems and software that 
are bespoke to Ocado and difficult to replicate as the key intellectual 
property resides within Ocado.

The future of grocery shopping is online
 
The uk grocery market is £151 billion per annum of which online represents around 
3%.  Over the foreseeable future, the online grocery market is expected to experience 
significant growth at the expense of traditional grocery channels.  Online grocery 
adoption is expected to be in line with other retail categories, driven by a number 
of complementary drivers:

Strategy: addressing the market
 
We continuously focus on improving the service we offer our customers.   
In doing this we focus on three key elements: product, price and service. Combined 
effectively, these elements are drawing new customers to Ocado.  Simultaneously, we 
are constantly working to improve our infrastructure to serve this growth.
Product Offering
✔	 Wide range:  We aim to offer a wide range of quality 
products at a value-for-money price point.  We are able 
to offer dedicated online inventory across a wide range 
of SKUs that traditional sales channels cannot stock 
economically.  In 2010, we:
	 ● Stocked 21,500 SKUs at year end
	 ● Introduced Ocado own-label (over 250 SKUs 
and growing)
	 ● Added convenience product range
	 ● rolled out service counter
✔	Quality and Freshness:  We offer guaranteed “use by 
dates” to customers that are visible at both point of 
order and on receipt, listing purchased items by expiry 
date as a useful reminder to customers.  In addition, 
the fulfilment process is designed to maximise product 
quality by minimising the number of human touch points 
and maintaining the optimum product temperature.
Price
✔	 value for Money:  We have improved our price 
positioning over the last three years.  Since March 2008, 
we have price matched T esco on all identical branded 
products.  We have also launched the Ocado own-label 
range to improve our value credentials.  In 2010, we:
	 ● Expanded T esco Price Match to 7,200 SKUs
	 ● Introduced “Switch and Save”
	 ● Substantially increased the number of promotions
Customer Service
✔	 Accuracy and Availability:  We deliver over 100,000 
orders per week (the equivalent of 1 million items per 
day) and we do this more accurately than any other 
online grocery retailer.  99% of items are delivered 
exactly as ordered.  We have 95% of our products 
available for next day delivery.
✔	Delivery Service:  We have the widest range of delivery 
slots of any online grocery retailer and 95% of customer 
orders are delivered on time or early.  The Ocado 
Delivery Pass provides customers with an opportunity 
to subscribe for their deliveries for a monthly or annual 
fee.  In 2010, we:
	 ● Launched mid-week Ocado Delivery Pass
	 ● rolled out Sunday deliveries
✔	User-friendly Interface: Our website is the first point 
of contact for our customers.  We have designed it 
to be engaging, intuitive and with good functionality.  
Complementing the website is our dedicated call centre, 
focused on helping customers with queries.  Finally, our 
CSTMs who make the deliveries (and who are much 
more than drivers) are key to getting “hassle-free” 
groceries to customers.  In 2010, we:
	 ● Launched the 5th version of the website, which 
is easier to navigate, has more personalisation, 
increased dietary filtering, additional recipes and 
more supplier opportunities
	 ● Added reviews and ratings
	 ● Launched iPad and Android apps
	 ● Upgraded the Ocado iPhone app

ensuring that we have the products that customers want 
to buy and sell them at a fair price.  The unique model that 
we operate allows us to remove operating costs.  We invest 
these savings in the customer by operating a number of 
competitive price matching features and continue to expand 
our own-label range ‘Ocado’, demonstrating our commitment 
to provide attractively priced products.  
We continue to focus on our core values that underpin our mission:

innovative and greener alternative to traditional grocery shopping.”
We have a passion for delivering quality 
groceries in perfect condition and on time, 
while treating our customers with care and 
honesty.  This helps us to share our vision of 
a different way of shopping: a better, greener 
and more convenient one

Ocado
We love what we do, and are proud of all the 
wonderful groceries that we sell.  This drives 
us on to offer the widest choice imaginable, 
and ensures everything we sell is always of 
the highest quality
We pride ourselves at being able to offer our customers a 
wide range of products including being at the forefront of food 
trends, enabling us to confidently recommend to our customers 
new or alternative product ideas that are aligned to customers’ 
purchasing profiles.  We look to create successful relationships

 choice
Ocado
We care passionately about our environment.  
This spurs us on to provide a greener, more 
sustainable alternative to old-fashioned, 
store-based supermarket chains
We strive to make shopping at Ocado better for our 
customers, better for their groceries and better for the planet.  
We have a revolutionary green approach to selling groceries.  
Each delivery van replaces multiple car journeys every 
single day; by saving our customers a trip to a supermarket 
we help to reduce the number of cars on the road each 
day.  Because our groceries are delivered directly from a 
dedicated warehouse the time from grower or supplier to 
the customer’s home is reduced.  This means customers get 
longer to enjoy their purchases and reduces the amount of 
food waste.

statement of corporate governance.  
Amendment of the Articles

Share capital
Pursuant to the Disclosure and Transparency rules, the Listing rules, 
the Companies Act  and the Large and Medium-sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and reports) regulations 2008 (No. 410), 
the Directors’ report must contain certain disclosures regarding the 
Company’s share capital and the rights and restrictions attaching to 
the Company’s shares, as set out in the following sections.  These 
statements are included so as to comply with Disclosure and 
Transparency rule 7.2.6 (regarding the corporate governance 
statement).
The Company’s authorised and issued ordinary share capital as at 
28 November 2010 comprised a single class of ordinary shares.  The 
shares have a nominal value of 2 pence each.  The ISIN of the shares 
is GB00B3MBS747.
Details of movements in the Company’s issued share capital can be 
found in Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements.  During 
the period, shares in the Company were issued as set out in Note 23 
to the consolidated financial statements (disclosed in accordance with 
Listing rule 9.8.4(7)).  
Rights attaching to shares
The Company’s shares when issued are credited as fully paid and free 
from all liens, equities, charges, encumbrances and other interests.  All 
shares have the same rights (including voting and dividend rights and 
rights on a return of capital) and restrictions as set out in the Articles, 
described below.  
Except in relation to dividends which have been declared and rights 
on a liquidation of the Company, the shareholders have no rights to 
share in the profits of the Company.
The Company’s shares are not redeemable.  However, the Company 
may purchase or contract to purchase any of the shares on or off-
market, subject to the Companies Act and the requirements of the 
Listing rules, as described below.  
No shareholder holds shares in the Company which carry special 
rights with regard to control of the Company.  There are no shares 
relating to an employee share scheme which have rights with regard 
to control of the Company that are not exercisable directly and solely 
by the employees, other than in the case of the Group’s joint share 
ownership scheme (the “JSOS”) where interests can be transferred 
to a spouse, civil partner or lineal descendant of a participant in the 
JSOS or certain trusts (as noted below).  
Share rights: Subject to the Companies Act, any resolution passed 
by the Company under the Companies Act and other shareholders’ 
rights, shares may be issued with such rights and restrictions as the 
Company may by ordinary resolution decide, or (if there is no such 
resolution or so far as it does not make specific provision) as the 
Board may decide.  Such rights and restrictions will apply as if they 
were set out in the Articles.  redeemable shares may be issued.  
The Directors can decide on the terms and conditions and the 
manner of redemption of any redeemable shares.  Such terms and 
conditions will apply as if they were set out in the Articles.  Subject 
to the Articles, the Companies Act and other shareholders’ rights, the 
unissued shares in the Company are at the disposal of the Board.
voting rights
Shareholders will be entitled to vote at a general meeting or class 
meeting of the Company whether on a show of hands or a poll, as 
provided in the Companies Act.  The Companies Act  provides that: 
(A) on a show of hands every member present in person has one 
vote and every proxy present who has been duly appointed by one 
or more members will have one vote, except that a proxy has one 
vote for and one vote against if the proxy has been duly appointed by 
more than one member and the proxy has been instructed by one 
or more members to vote for and by one or more other members 
to vote against.  For this purpose the Articles provide that, where a 
proxy is given discretion as to how to vote on a show of hands, this 
will be treated as an instruction by the relevant shareholder to vote 
in the way that the proxy decides to exercise that discretion; and (B) 
on a poll every member has one vote per share held by him and he 
may vote in person or by one or more proxies.  Where he appoints 
more than one proxy, the proxies appointed by him taken together 
shall not have more extensive voting rights than he could exercise in 
person.  This is subject to any rights or restrictions which are given 
to any shares or on which shares are held.  If more than one joint 
shareholder votes (including voting by proxy), the only vote which 
will count is the vote of the person whose name is listed before the 
other voters on the register for the share.  
Deadlines for exercising voting rights: The Articles provide a deadline for 
submission of proxy forms of not than less than 48 hours before the 
time appointed for the holding of the meeting or adjourned meeting.
Restrictions on voting rights: No shareholder shall be entitled to vote 
at any general meeting or class meeting in respect of any share held 
by him if any call or other sum then payable by him in respect of 
that share remains unpaid or if a member has been served with a 
restriction notice (as defined in the Articles), described below.
JSOS voting rights: Disclosed in accordance with the Listing rules 
9.8.4(12) and 9.8.4(13) and the relevant company regulation, Appleby 
Trust (Jersey) Limited, the independent company which is the trustee 
of the Company’s employee benefit trust (the “EBT Trustee”) will not 
normally exercise the voting rights of unvested shares held under the 
JSOS but may exercise such rights on vested shares at the request 
of the relevant participants of the JSOS.  Of the Company’s issued 
shares, 32,476,700 ordinary shares are held by the EBT Trustee.  In 
respect of 8,119,400 ordinary shares which have vested under the 
JSOS, the EBT Trustee may vote in respect of such ordinary shares 
at the request of a participant.  The total of 24,357,300 unvested  21

Getting to Know Ocado Getting to Know Ocado Our responsibilities
ordinary shares held by the EBT Trustee are treated as treasury 
shares in the Group's consolidated balance sheet in accordance with 
IAS 32 “Financial Instruments: Presentation”.  As such, calculations 
of earnings per share for the Company exclude the 24,357,300 
unvested ordinary shares held by the EBT Trustee.  However, the 
Company does not hold any shares in treasury. 
Dividends and other distributions
The Company may by ordinary resolution from time to time declare 
dividends not exceeding the amount recommended by the Board.  
Subject to the Companies Act, the Board may pay interim dividends, 
and also any fixed rate dividend, whenever the financial position of 
the Company, in the opinion of the Board, justifies its payment.  If 
the Board acts in good faith, it is not liable to holders of shares with 
preferred or pari passu rights for losses arising from the payment 
of interim or fixed dividends on other shares.  Except insofar as the 
rights attaching to, or the terms of issue of, any share otherwise 
provide, all dividends shall be apportioned and paid pro rata 
according to the amounts paid up on the share during any portion of 
the period in respect of which the dividend is paid.  Except as set out 
above, dividends may be declared or paid in any currency.  
The Board may, if authorised by an ordinary resolution of the 
Company, offer shareholders (excluding any member holding shares 
as treasury shares) in respect of any dividend the right to elect to 
receive shares by way of scrip dividend instead of cash.  
Any dividend unclaimed after a period of 12 years from the date 
when it was declared or became due for payment shall be forfeited 
and revert to the Company.  The Company may stop sending 
cheques, warrants or similar financial instruments in payment of 
dividends by post in respect of any shares or may cease to employ 
any other means of payment, including payment by means of a 
relevant system, for dividends if either (i) at least two consecutive 
payments have remained uncashed or are returned undelivered 
or that means of payment has failed or (ii) one payment remains 
uncashed or is returned undelivered or that means of payment 
has failed and reasonable enquiries have failed to establish any new 
postal address or account of the holder.  The Company may resume 
sending dividend cheques, warrants or similar financial instruments 
or employing that means of payment if the holder requests such 
resumption in writing.  
Restriction on dividends: The Board may withhold payment of all or 
any part of any dividends or other monies payable in respect of 
the Company’s shares from a person with a 0.25 per cent.  interest 
(as defined in the Articles) if such a person has been served with a 
restriction notice (as defined in the Articles) after failure to provide 
the Company with information concerning interests in those shares 
required to be provided under the Companies Act.  
JSOS dividend rights: Disclosed in accordance with the Listing rules 
9.8.4(12) and 9.8.4(13) and the relevant company regulation,  shares 
held under the JSOS will not receive any dividends paid, but the 
hurdles of the JSOS will be reduced proportionally so as not to 
distort the value of the JSOS participants’ interests in the shares.  
Restrictions on transfer of securities
The Company’s shares are freely transferable, save as set out below.  
The Company may, under the Companies Act, send out statutory 
notices to those it knows or has reasonable cause to believe have an 
interest in its shares, asking for details of those who have an interest 
and the extent of their interest in a particular holding of shares.  
When a person receives a statutory notice and fails to provide any 
information required by the notice within the time specified in it, 
the Company can apply to the court for an order directing, among 
other things, that any transfer of shares which are the subject of the 
statutory notice is void.
The transferor of a share is deemed to remain the holder until the 
transferee’s name is entered in the register.  The Board can decline 
to register any transfer of any share which is not a fully paid share.  
The Company does not currently have any partially paid shares.  
The Board may also decline to register a transfer of a certificated 
share unless the instrument of transfer (in any usual form or in any 
other form which the Board may approve): (A) is duly stamped or 
certified or otherwise shown to the satisfaction of the Board to be 
exempt from stamp duty and is accompanied by the relevant share 
certificate or such other evidence of the right to transfer as the Board 
may reasonably require; (B) is in respect of only one class of share; 
and (C) if to joint transferees, is in favour of not more than four 
such transferees.  registration of a transfer of an uncertificated share 
may be refused in the circumstances set out in the uncertificated 
securities rules (as defined in the Articles) and where, in the case of 
a transfer to joint holders, the number of joint holders to whom the 
uncertificated share is to be transferred exceeds four.  
JSOS: Participants’ interests under the JSOS are generally non-
transferable during the period beginning on acquisition of the 
interest and ending on 31 December 2013.  However, interests can 
be transferred to a spouse, civil partner or lineal descendant of a 
participant; a trust under which no person other than the participant 
or their spouse, civil partner or lineal descendant has a vested 
beneficial interest or any other person approved by the EBT Trustee.  
If a participant purports to transfer, assign or charge his interest other 
than as set out above, the EBT Trustee may acquire the participant’s 
interest for a total price of £1.  
Lock-up agreements: Certain shareholders in the Company and 
the Directors, pursuant to the underwriting agreement and selling 
shareholders agreement and certain stand-alone lock-up deeds 
entered into on 6 July 2010 in conjunction with the Company’s IPO, 
have agreed to be subject to certain lock-up arrangements.  Each 
of these people have given undertakings to the underwriters of the 
IPO that, for a period ending 365 days in the case of Directors, and 
for a period of 180 days in the case of certain shareholders, from 6 
July 2010 that he or they will not, and will procure that none of his 
or their ‘connected persons’ (as defined in the relevant agreement) 
or persons acting on his or their behalf will transfer any shares in 
existence at the time of Admission without the consent of the joint 
global coordinators of the IPO, subject to certain exceptions including 
accepting a takeover offer.  In the case of the Steiner 2008 Millennium 
Trust, of which Tim Steiner, Ocado’s Chief Executive Officer, is one of  22

lock-up pursuant to the above IPO arrangements.  On 18 February 
2011, which coincided with the Steiner 2008 Millennium Trust 
selling 2 million shares, the Company announced that the Steiner 
2008 Millennium Trust agreed to be bound by a further lock-up, 
which expires on 6 July 2011, in line with the Directors’ IPO lock-up 
arrangements.
Other than as described above, the Company is not aware of 
any agreements between holders of securities that may result 
in restrictions on the transfer of securities or that may result in 
restrictions on voting rights.
variation of rights 
Subject to the Companies Act, rights attached to any class of shares 
may be varied with the written consent of the holders of not less 
than three-fourths in nominal value of the issued shares of that class 
(calculated excluding any shares held as treasury shares), or with the 
sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate general meeting 
of the holders of those shares.  At every such separate general 
meeting (except an adjourned meeting) the quorum shall be two 
persons holding or representing by proxy not less than one-third in 
nominal value of the issued shares of the class (calculated excluding 
any shares held as treasury shares).
The rights conferred upon the holders of any shares shall not, unless 
otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to those shares, 
be deemed to be varied by the creation or issue of further shares 
ranking pari passu with them.
Powers for the Company issuing shares
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, any equity securities 
issued by the Company for cash must first be offered to shareholders 
in proportion to their holdings of shares.  The Companies Act and 
the Listing rules allow for the disapplication of pre-emption rights 
which may be waived by a special resolution of the shareholders, 
either generally or specifically, for a maximum period not exceeding 
five years.
By written resolutions of the Company’s shareholders passed on 
23 June 2010, it was resolved that: 
(A) the Board be generally and unconditionally authorised to exercise 
all powers of the Company to allot shares in the Company and to 
grant rights to subscribe for or to convert any security into shares in 
the Company: (i) up to an aggregate nominal amount of £5,000,000 
in connection with the IPO; (ii) up to an aggregate nominal amount of 
£50,000 as required for the purposes of arrangements requiring the 
Company to satisfy the entitlements of non-employee optionholders 
who have entitlements to shares following Admission; (iii) up to 
an aggregate nominal amount of £6,666,666 (such amount to be 
reduced by the nominal amount of any shares in the Company under 
paragraph (iv) below in excess of such sum); and (iv) comprising 
equity securities (as defined in section 560(1) of the Companies Act) 
up to an aggregate nominal amount of £13,333,333 (such amount 
to be reduced by any shares in the Company under paragraph (iii) 
above) in connection with an offer by way of a rights issue: (a) to 
holders of shares in proportion (as nearly as may be practicable) to 
their existing holdings; and (b) to holders of other equity securities as 
required by the rights of those securities or as the Board otherwise 
considers necessary, and so that the Board may impose any limits or 
restrictions and make any arrangements which it considers necessary 
or appropriate to deal with treasury shares, fractional entitlements, 
record dates, legal, regulatory or practical problems in, or under the 
laws of, any territory or any other matter, such authorities to apply 
until the end of the next annual general meeting of the Company 
(or, if earlier, until the close of business on 19 September 2011) but, 
in each case, during this period the Company may make offers and 
enter into agreements which would, or might, require shares to be 
allotted or rights to subscribe for or convert securities into shares to 
be granted after the authority ends and the Board may allot shares or 
grant rights to subscribe for or convert securities into shares in the 
Company under any such offer or agreement as if the authority had 
not ended;
(B) the Board be given power, to allot equity securities (as defined 
in the Companies Act) for cash under the authority given by the 
resolution described in paragraph (A) above and/or to sell shares 
held by the Company as treasury shares for cash as if section 561 of 
the Companies Act did not apply to any such allotment or sale, such 
power to be limited: (i) to the allotment of equity securities up to an 
aggregate nominal amount of £5 million in connection with the IPO 
offers; (ii) to the allotment of equity securities and sale of treasury 
shares for cash in connection with an offer of, or invitation to apply 
for, equity securities (but in the case of the authority granted under 
paragraph A(iv) above, by way of a rights issue only): (a) to holders 
of shares in proportion (as nearly as may be practicable) to their 
existing holdings; and (b) to holders of other equity securities, as 
required by the rights of those securities, or as the Board otherwise 
considers necessary as permitted by the rights of those securities, 
and so that the Board may impose any limits or restrictions and make 
any arrangements which it considers necessary or appropriate to 
deal with treasury shares, fractional entitlements, record dates, legal, 
regulatory or practical problems in, or under the laws of, any territory 
or any other matter; and (iii) in the case of the authority granted 
under paragraph A(iii) and/or in the case of any sale of treasury 
shares for cash, to the allotment (otherwise than under paragraph (ii)

amount of £1 million, such power to apply until the end of the next 
annual general meeting of the Company (or, if earlier, until the close 
of business on 19 September 2011 but, in each case, during this 
period the Company may make offers, and enter into agreements, 
which would, or might, require equity securities to be allotted (and 
treasury shares to be sold) after the power ends and the Board may 
allot equity securities (and sell treasury shares) under any such offer 
or agreement as if the power had not ended.  
The Directors undertake that, to the extent that the authority 
conferred under: (1) paragraph (A)(iii) above is in respect of an 
aggregate nominal amount which exceeds the aggregate of (a) the 
aggregate nominal amount of the Company’s issued share capital 
immediately following Admission (the “Admission Capital”) and 
(b) one-third of the Admission Capital, they will not exercise that 
authority in respect of such excess; (2) paragraph (A)(iv) above, is in 
respect of an aggregate nominal amount which exceeds the aggregate 
of (a) the aggregate nominal amount of the Admission Capital and 
(b) two-thirds of the Admission Capital, they will not exercise that 
authority in respect of such excess.  The Directors undertake to

Important contracts or arrangements
Under section 417(5)(c) of the Companies Act, the Company is 
required to disclose information about persons with whom the 
Company has contractual or other arrangements which are essential 
to the business of the Company.  
Whilst the loss of or disruption to certain of the Group’s supply, 
financing or manufacturing arrangements (for example vans and CFC 
machinery) or other key contracts could affect the operations or 
growth of the Group until a replacement solution is found, none are 
considered to be essential to the business of the Company.  However, 
as noted in the principal risks and uncertainties, Ocado’s reputation 
and brand is based, at least in part, on its relationship with Waitrose.  
If the Sourcing Agreement with Waitrose were to end or if Waitrose 
were unable to source products for the Group, Ocado would need 
to engage additional personnel to: (i) find or create replacement 
own-label products; and (ii) find appropriate suppliers and negotiate 
equivalent prices itself.  Waitrose, through whom Ocado sources 
the vast majority of products it sells (and whose own-label products 
it sells), is a UK supermarket chain and the food division of the

limit the exercise of the power in paragraph (B) above, as limited 
by paragraph B(iii), to an aggregate nominal amount which is not 
more than the aggregate of (a) the aggregate nominal amount of the 
Admission Capital and (b) 5 per cent.  of the Admission Capital.
This standard authority for issuing shares on a non pre-emptive basis 
for cash may be renewed annually.  The Directors will seek to renew 
this authority at the AGM as set out in the Notice of Meeting.  
Powers for the Company buying back its own shares
The description below concerning the Company acquiring its own 
shares is made in accordance with the Disclosure and Transparency 
rule 4.1.11(4), Listing rule 9.8.6(4) and the relevant company 
regulation.  
The Company may purchase shares only out of distributable reserves 
or the proceeds of a new issue of shares made for the purpose of 
funding the repurchase.
By written resolutions of the Company’s shareholders passed on 
23 June 2010, it was resolved that the Company be authorised for 
the purposes of section 701 of the Companies Act to make one 
or more market purchases (as defined in section 693(4) of the 
Companies Act) of its shares, such power to be limited: (i) to a 
maximum number of 100,000,000 shares; (ii) by the condition that 
the minimum price which may be paid for a share is 2 pence and 
the maximum price which may be paid for a share is the highest 
of: (a) an amount equal to 5 per cent.  above the average market 
value of a share for the five business days immediately preceding the 
day on which that share is contracted to be purchased; and (b) the 
higher of the price of the last independent trade and the highest 
current independent bid on the trading venues where the purchase 
is carried out; such power to apply until the end of the next annual 
general meeting of the Company (or, if earlier, 19 September 2011) 
but in each case so that the Company may enter into a contract to 
purchase shares which will or may be completed or executed wholly 
or partly after the power ends and the Company may purchase 
shares pursuant to any such contract as if the power had not ended.  
The Directors undertake that, to the extent that the authority 
conferred in the above resolution is in respect of an aggregate 
number of shares which exceeds the aggregate of: (a) the aggregate 
number of shares in issue immediately following Admission (the 
“Aggregate Number”) and (b) 10 per cent. of the Aggregate Number, 
they will not exercise that authority in respect of such excess.
This standard authority for the Company to purchase its shares may 
be renewed at the annual general meeting.  The Directors will seek to 
renew this authority at the AGM on the terms set out in the Notice 
of Meeting.
The Company has not acquired its shares during the period.  It is 
the Company’s present intention to cancel any shares it buys back in 
future, rather than hold them in treasury.
Significant shareholders 
As required under the Listing rule 9.8.6(2) and relevant company 
regulations, the table below sets out the notifications that the 
Company had received from its shareholders of the significant direct 
or indirect holdings (being 3 per cent. or more) in the Company’s 
shares, pursuant to Disclosure and Transparency rule 5 (which were 
also published on a regulatory Information Service and on the 
Company’s corporate website), up to 22 March 2011 (being not 
more than one month prior to the likely date of the Notice 
of Meeting):  24

privately owned retailer John Lewis.  Waitrose has over 240 branches 
across the UK, sells high quality food and places an emphasis on the 
provenance and traceability of the food that it sells.  In its last financial 
year (ended 29 January 2011) it had gross sales of £5.0 billion and 
made an operating profit of £274.9 million (Source:  
www.johnlewispartnership.co.uk).  
The principal risks and uncertainties section describes the principal 
risks facing the Group that may have an adverse impact on the 
Group’s operations, performance or future prospects.  
Change of control under significant agreements
There are a number of agreements to which the Group is a party 
that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of 
the Company following a takeover bid.  Details of the significant 
agreements of this kind are as follows:
	 ● Sourcing Agreement: If the parties terminate the Sourcing 
Agreement after certain competitors of Waitrose or John Lewis 
acquire 50 per cent.  or more of the shares or control of the 
Company’s Board, Ocado is obliged to pay Waitrose the lower 
of £40 million and 4 per cent.  of the market capitalisation of the 
Company.  This change of control provision will cease to bind the 
parties if, prior to the change of control, any party has already 
given a valid notice of termination.
	 ● Debt facility agreement: The Group has a £100 million term 
loan facility with Barclays Bank plc, HSBC Bank plc and Lloyds 
TSB Bank plc for the acquisition of land, building materials, plant, 
machinery and equipment, for the existing CFC and/or the 
second CFC and/or the Spokes.  If Ocado or Waitrose gives 
notice to terminate the Sourcing Agreement it will be an event of 
default under this facility.  
	 ● HSBC Equipment Finance (UK) Limited:  On 22 July 2004 Ocado 
(as lessee) and HSBC Equipment Finance (UK) Limited (as lessor) 
entered into a master sale and leaseback agreement.  Since then, 
there have been 24 sale and leaseback agreements covering the 
majority of the conveyor systems and associated capital goods 
that have been added to the CFC since August 2004, with 
outstanding sums totalling £28 million.  As well as either party 
having the right to terminate it on one month’s notice, pursuant 
to side letters between Ocado and HSBC varying the original 
agreement, HSBC is able to terminate the agreement if there is a 
change of control of the Company or if the Sourcing Agreement 
is terminated for any reason. 
Change of control for Director and employee agreements
The Company does not have any agreements with any Director 
or employee that would provide compensation for loss of office or 
employment resulting from a takeover except that provisions of the 
Company’s share schemes may cause options and shares granted to 
employees under such schemes to vest on a takeover.  
Directors’ report continued
Research and development and future developments
The Group has dedicated in-house software design and development 
teams with primary focus on IT and improvements to the CFC and 
its material handling equipment.  Costs relating to the development 
of computer software are capitalised if they relate to internal capital 
projects.
The Group’s likely future developments are described in the ‘About 
Ocado’ section, Chief Executive Officer’s review and the Chief 
Financial Officer’s review.
Results and dividends
The Group’s results for the period are set out in the consolidated 
income statement on page 48.  The Group’s loss after tax for the 
period amounted to £7.2 million (2009: £23.2 million). 
The Directors do not propose to pay a dividend for the period 
(2009: £nil).
Post balance sheet events
Events occurring after the balance sheet date that affect the Group 
are disclosed in Note 33 to the consolidated financial statements.
Creditor payment policy
It is the Group’s policy, in respect of the current financial year for all 
trade creditors, to agree payment terms in advance of the supply of 
goods with the supplier, to make the supplier aware of the terms of 
payment and to adhere to those payment terms.  The Company is a 
holding company and therefore has little trade creditors.  The Group 
does not follow any code or standard on payment practice in respect 
of the current financial year.  The Group’s average trade creditor 
payment period for the 52 weeks ended 28 November 2010 was 
26 days (2009: 27 days), based on the ratio of Group trade creditors 
at the end of the year to the amounts invoiced during the year by 
trade creditors.
Market value of properties
The Directors are of the opinion that the aggregate market value of 
the Group’s properties as at 28 November 2010 is in line with the 
net book value as set out in Note 11 to the consolidated financial 
statements.
Going concern
After making appropriate enquiries and having considered the 
business activities as set out on page 19 and the Group’s principal 
risks and uncertainties as set on pages 29 to 32, the Directors are 
satisfied that the Company, and the Group as a whole, have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future.  Accordingly, the financial statements have been prepared 
on the going concern basis in accordance with Going Concern 
and Liquidity risk: Guidance for Directors of UK Companies 2009, 
published by the Financial reporting Council in October 2009.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities

Getting to Know Ocado Getting to Know Ocado Our responsibilities
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year.  Under that law the Directors have prepared 
the Group and the Company financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial reporting Standards (IFrSs) as adopted 
by the European Union (“IFrS-EU”).  Under company law the 
Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of 
the Company and the Group and of profit or loss of the Group for 
that period.  In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
	 ● select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
	 ● make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
	 ● state whether applicable IFrSs as adopted by the European 
Union have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
	 ● prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ remuneration 
report comply with the Companies Act and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS regulation.  They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the 
Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the Company’s website.  Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Each of the Directors confirms that, to the best of their knowledge:
	 ● the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFrSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit and loss of 
the Group; and
	 ● the Directors’ report contained in this annual report includes a 
fair review of the development and performance of the business 
and the position of the Group, and contains a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group.
Disclosure of information to auditors
Each Director who held office at the date of the approval of this 
Directors’ report confirms that, so far as he or she is aware, there 
is no relevant audit information of which the Group’s auditors are 
unaware, and that each Director has taken all the steps that they 
ought to have taken as a Director in order to make himself or herself 
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Group’s auditors are aware of that information.
Independent auditors
The Company’s auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , have 
indicated their willingness to continue their role as the Company’s 
auditors.  resolutions concerning the re-appointment of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors of the Company and to 
authorise the Directors to determine their remuneration will be 
proposed at the AGM and set out in the Notice of Meeting.  
unaudited interim financial information
Unaudited interim financial information relating to the Group for the 
24 weeks ended 16 May 2010 was published in the Company's IPO 
Prospectus dated 6 July 2010.
Forward-looking statements
Certain statements made in this report are forward-looking 
statements.  Such statements are based on current expectations and 
assumptions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from any  
expected future events or results expressed or implied in these 
forward-looking statements.  They appear in a number of places 
throughout this report and include statements regarding the 
intentions, beliefs or current expectations of the Directors concerning, 
amongst other things, the Group’s results of operations, financial 
condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies and the business.  
Persons receiving this report should not place undue reliance on

Corporate social responsibility report
Environment
Ocado aims to provide a greener, more sustainable alternative to 
store-based supermarkets.
A traditional supermarket requires deliveries first to be made to a  
regional distribution centre and then to the supermarket itself.  
Customers will often drive to the supermarket in order to shop, and 
the supermarkets themselves require energy to be lit and heated 
and tend to have open fridges and freezers in an otherwise ambient 
environment.  Ocado delivers from the CFC (sometimes via a Spoke) 
to a customer’s home, which eliminates much of the carbon emissions 
generated by traditional supermarkets and their stores, and also 
reduces the number of cars on the road.  Each Ocado delivery van 
replaces a significant number of car journeys every day.
This sustainable alternative has been reflected in awards made to 
Ocado in recent years.  Ocado was voted Green retailer of the Y ear 
2009 in The Grocer Gold Awards, Large retailer of the Y ear 2008 in 
the Online Green Awards and won Ethical/Green Practice 2009 at the 
IMRG E-Commerce Awards for Excellence.
Environmental management 
Ocado’s management is conscious that the Company’s operations 
have an impact on the environment and will regularly consider 
new measures and innovations to make the business more 
environmentally friendly.
In early 2008, the Company established a green team comprising 
over 40 staff members from across the business.  This team has 
introduced new initiatives to reduce the impact of the business 
on the environment and raised awareness within Ocado of 
environmental issues.
Carbon Reduction
Ocado is seeking to minimise the environmental impact and carbon 
footprint associated with its operations.
Ocado has had its operations independently audited to measure the 
extent of its carbon footprint.  Ocado’s total emissions for the period 
from July 2009 to June 2010 were 37,532 tCO2e.  In this period, the 
Group’s normalised emissions (normalised by the total value of the 
Group’s sales) decreased from 84.9tCO2e (per million of sales in 
pounds) in September 2009 to 71.5tCO2e (per million of sales in 
pounds) in June 2010.  So while the Group’s absolute energy emissions 
have increased as its sales have increased, the actual carbon emissions 
attributable to each order has decreased with the greater efficiency of 
the Group’s operations.  Part of the improved efficiency is due to the 
opening of a new Spoke which resulted in some shorter van routes 
as well as continuing improvements in the Group’s delivery routing 
software which optimises the delivery route for each van journey.  A 
breakdown of the source of the Group’s carbon footprint is set out in 
the diagram below.
The Directors believe that the carbon footprint of the Group’s 
operations have been considerably lower carbon intensity than that of 
many of its competitors (taking into account the relative size of each 
operation) because the Group’s business model is more efficient than 
that of the traditional store-based model.  
T o continue to reduce its carbon footprint, the Group is 
implementing measures such as van monitoring devices which help 
identify areas for reducing fuel use in delivery vans (for example, as a 
result of vans sitting idle).
The Group has taken a number of other steps in response to new 
carbon reduction legislation and to address the lessening of its carbon 
footprint, as set out below.
Climate Change Agreement: Ocado has signed up to the Climate 
Change Agreement (with the Carbon Trust), which places certain 
obligations on the Group to monitor and lower carbon usage.
10:10 campaign: In 2010, the Company signed up to the 10:10 
campaign, which is a campaign run by an independent UK charity, 
the 10:10 Trust, aimed at reducing carbon emissions by 10% in a 
year.  The Company has not had its carbon emissions audited for the 
period since signing up to the 10:10 campaign, so cannot yet measure 
whether it has met this target.  However, as noted above, Ocado has 
shown it has been reducing its carbon emissions against previous 
periods when measured as a percentage of sales.
Electric vans: Ocado has co-developed two prototype electric 
powered vans, which are currently being trialled in central London as 
part of Ocado’s delivery fleet.
Green van deliveries: Customers can choose a ‘green van slot’ when 
booking a delivery time (that is, when a delivery van is already 
booked in that customer’s area) which helps minimise the carbon 
impact of that customer’s delivery.
Energy efficiency project: Ocado invested about £200,000 in 2010 on a 
project aimed at making the Group’s operations more energy efficient.  
The investment included the purchase of energy saving equipment and 
facilities for the CFC, such as the modernisation of the lighting systems, 
installation of more energy efficient chilling equipment and improved 
door seals and automated controls.  Ocado makes it a standard 
requirement for new sites and new fit-outs of existing buildings that 
they use energy efficient lighting, motion detectors and daylight controls 
as part of its energy saving commitments.

Getting to Know Ocado Getting to Know Ocado Our responsibilities
Environmental initiatives undertaken 
The Group has taken a number of measures to reduce its 
environmental impact, as set out below.  
Responsible bag recycling: The business has a closed-loop grocery bag 
recycling system, whereby when making a delivery, CSTMs offer to 
collect used bags (both Ocado bags and any other company’s plastic 
bags) from customers which are then recycled within the UK to make 
new Ocado grocery bags.  
Reducing food wastage:  The Group’s food waste as a percentage 
of gross sales (0.61% for the period) is significantly less than any of 
its competitors.  Food wastage is an important key performance 
indicator measured by the business, as noted in the Chief Financial 
Officer's review.  Ocado also helps customers to reduce their food 
waste, by being the first online food retailer to show guaranteed 
product life on the website and by including ‘use-by’ dates on each 
order receipt which assists customers to plan meals and reduce 
their waste.  Food that is beyond the guaranteed product life but 
within the use-by date is often donated to various charities including 
vineyard in Southend, YMCA in Watford, and New Hope in Watford.  
Any food that isn’t fit for Ocado’s company shop or charities, but is 
suitable for animals, is sent to Paradise Wildlife Park in Broxbourne.  
Anaerobic digestion: Ocado recently completed a trial of a process 
called “anaerobic digestion”.  That is a process whereby any food 
supplied that is no longer edible is mixed with bacteria and burnt to 
produce electricity.  Ocado expects to implement this means of food 
waste disposal as part of its operations.
Meat Free Monday: The Company supports the “Meat Free Monday” 
campaign which raises awareness of the climate-changing impact of 
meat production and consumption.  The Meat Free Monday campaign 
encourages people to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 
having at least one meat-free day every week.
Recycled office furniture: Ocado fitted out much of its new head office 
space in January 2010 with used office furniture.  The benefits of this 
for the environment were that Ocado helped divert a large amount 
of used furniture from being disposed of in landfill sites and that there 
was no environmental impact related to the production and delivery 
of new furniture for Ocado.
Suppliers and products
Product range: The Ocado own-label product range has been 
introduced to broaden the choice for our customers and offers 
good quality at competitive prices.  One of the key criteria when 
developing the Ocado own-label range is that it be responsibly 
sourced.  The Company supports British and EU farming and, where 
possible, sources relevant Ocado own-label products from the 
British Isles when in season and available.  Ocado fish is responsibly 
caught, Ocado fresh meat and poultry is raised to British, EU or New 
Zealand welfare standards, Ocado boxed eggs are free-range and all 
of the Ocado own-label bread is made using British wheat.  
Waitrose Foundation: Through its supply agreement with Waitrose, 
Ocado supports the Waitrose Foundation.  The Waitrose Foundation 
is a supply chain partnership that returns a percentage of profits 
from the sale of produce, flowers and prepared fruit to fund 
projects chosen by the farm workers and smallholders who grew 
or produced it.  Since its beginnings in South Africa in 2005, the 
Waitrose Foundation has raised nearly £3 million and launched over 
170 projects.  Ocado has already contributed over £115,000 to the 
Waitrose Foundation.  These projects are diverse and reflect the 
individual needs of the communities, ranging from supporting crèches 
to adult literacy programmes, and from supporting sports teams to 
provision of equipment for medical clinics.
Duchy Originals products: Ocado makes a significant charitable 
donation to the Prince’s Charities Foundation, a group of 20 non-profit 
organisations, through its sales of Duchy Originals branded products.  
Fair trade: Ocado aims to trade fairly with its suppliers and supports 
established schemes such as Fairtrade and Traidcraft, which contribute 
to the sustainable development of the communities where farmers 
and workers live.  Ocado has one of the largest Fairtrade range of 
products of all UK grocers.
Organic farming: Ocado has a large selection of organic groceries.  
Organic farming helps promote biodiversity by using crop rotation 
and clover to build soil fertility.  With organic farming there are strict 
rules around animal welfare and how food is produced.  
People
Ocado’s employees are key to its business and are the most visible 
part of the business to its customers.  Management is committed 
to high standards of employment practice and to providing equality 
of opportunity, training and development and a safe workplace, in 
addition to developing initiatives which encourage innovation.
Ocado aims to be an exceptional employer; one that recognises 
talent and develops people to the best of their abilities.  We ask our 
people to share our determination to succeed.  We deliver superior 
customer service and business success through our people which is 
why it is important for us to appropriately reward, engage, listen to 
and develop our employees.
Rewarding our people
Since its commencement as a privately owned business, Ocado’s policy 
has been to issue share options to its employees.  The rationale is that 
we want to give all of our employees the opportunity to own a part 
of the business.  We continue to grant share options in the Company 
to each new employee as part of their employee benefits package. 
T o continue our philosophy of employee share ownership we 
established the Group’s ‘Sharesave Scheme’ after the Company’s 
Admission.  A large number of our employees have chosen to 
participate in Ocado’s Sharesave Scheme, which is the savings-related 
share option plan where each participating employee is granted 
options over shares in the Company in proportion to the amount 
saved by that employee. 
We expect that in future, Ocado will introduce additional share 
schemes to both reward employees and to offer employees further 
opportunities to become shareholders in the Company.  
In addition to share schemes, we provide a range of employee 
benefits including a staff discount on orders (with free deliveries on 
certain days), discount shopping membership, pension, life assurance, 
healthcare and an employee assistance programme. 28

Engaging our people
Engaged staff help us to continue to be successful and grow.  We have 
this year launched our first formal employee survey across the whole 
business.  This will measure current levels of employee engagement and 
identify the areas where we can become a better employer.  
We continue to hold regular events to connect with our people, 
such as our annual family fun day, inter-Spoke football tournament, 
charity golf day, Woodland Trust tree plant team days, business results 
briefings and our Christmas parties.  These reinforce our informal, 
relaxed culture and promote our family and community focus.
Our unique and informal culture means that many of our people 
have direct access to our senior leaders, but as we continue to grow 
we know this will be more challenging.  We hold weekly board 
lunches with employees from across the whole business to increase 
dialogue between staff and business leaders.  Ocado’s employees 
are kept well informed of the performance of the Group and key 
events concerning the business through regular staff briefings done 
by management and through communications via the internet, email 
and video and audio recordings (which are particularly helpful for 
communicating with our large number of CSTMs).  
Giving our people a voice
In order to better facilitate employee involvement and feedback 
in our rapidly growing business we have introduced the ‘Ocado 
Council’, which is a representative forum for dialogue between 
Ocado employees and leaders of the business.  The Ocado Council 
was formed in January 2010 when elections were held to select 
47 council representatives from across the business.  The Council’s 
achievements over its first year of existence include involvement in 
changes to terms and conditions of employment, pay and bonus 
awards, performance reviews, organisational changes and physical 
working environment improvements.
Developing our people
Every employee plays a part in the Company’s success and we are 
focused on developing our people to the best of their abilities.  When 
joining the business employees undertake a thorough induction which 
includes training on how to do their new job and orientation around 
different areas of the business.  
Ocado's people have a range of backgrounds and we work hard 
to provide opportunities to move around the business where 
appropriate and provide training to develop skills for current and 
future roles.  Our excellent in-house training team deliver customer 
focused training that prioritises the health and safety of our people 
and meets individual needs.
Attracting talent
We rely on talented people with drive and dedication to deliver 
excellent customer service.  This is why we are careful to recruit the 
right people for the right roles.  Our graduate programme plays an 
important part in developing talented people for our future, and our 
newly launched careers website allows timely recruitment of talented 
people for business growth.
Ocado creating new jobs
During the period the Group created an additional 883 jobs.  The 
average number of employees employed by the Group for the period 
was 4,252 (2009: 3,494).  
The Group purchased a 35.2 acre site in Dordon, Warwickshire on 
which the second CFC will be built.  When this second CFC is at full 
operational capacity, Ocado expects that it will have created in excess 
of 2,000 jobs in the region.  
Diversity of our people
We are committed to equal opportunities for all of our people, 
regardless of disability or background, from recruitment and selection, 
through training and development and promotion. 
It is the policy of the Group that applications for employment by 
disabled persons are always fully considered, bearing in mind the 
respective aptitudes and abilities of the applicant concerned.  In the 
event of employees becoming disabled all reasonable effort is made 
to ensure that their employment within the Group continues.  It is 
the policy of the Group that the training, career development and 
promotion of a disabled person should, as far as possible, be identical 
to that of an able bodied person.
Social and Community Issues
Making a positive difference in the community:  Ocado supports a 
number of community projects.  One of these is the Woodland Trust, 
which is aimed at restoring and protecting ancient woods and 
native trees.
Charitable and political donations:  Ocado has a charity committee 
made up of a number of employees, with the aim of encouraging 
support of certain charitable organisations by Ocado employees 
through the organisation of various fundraising initiatives.  During the 
period Ocado employees raised more than £15,000 for a number of 
charities, the details of which are set out below: 
British Heart Foundation £6,190 
NSPCC £4,143 
MacMillan Cancer relief £2,493 
Cancer research UK £990 
The Harry Christie Surgery Fund £820 
Paul Dix Appeal (Princess Alexandra Hospital) £650  
Kent Air Ambulance £361 
Sick Children’s Fund Coventry £117
Ocado made charitable donations during the period of over £14,000 
(2009: £2,000).  Included in the amount for the current period is a 
donation of £10,000 to the 10:10 Trust, which as noted above, is a 
charity committed to reducing carbon emissions by 10% a year.  
No political donations were made during the period by the Group 
(2009: £nil).  
The Group also donates money to the Waitrose Foundation and the 
Prince’s Charities Foundation, as noted above.

Principal risks and uncertainties
Strategy
New CFC and 
expansion of current 
CFC 
A critical part of the Group’s strategy is to expand 
its operations by further developing the current CFC 
and building at least one additional CFC in the UK to 
increase its capacity to service customers.  The Group’s 
ability to develop the current CFC and replicate its 
business model in the second CFC cost-effectively and 
in a timely fashion will depend upon a variety of factors 
notably: the Group’s ability to hire and train employees 
to operate the CFCs; management resources; the 
Group’s ability to roll out the business systems 
and infrastructure, in particular, in any new CFC; 
reliable developers and the availability of appropriate 
equipment and the contractors to design and install 
such equipment.
The Group has purchased a 999-year lease on a site 
in Dordon, Warwickshire for the construction of the 
second CFC, and groundworks have commenced.  
The Group has a detailed plan for the management 
and resourcing of the second CFC project and the 
Directors have oversight of the project to ensure that 
it stays on schedule and within budget.
The Directors are confident that the business systems 
of the existing CFC can be replicated and enhanced 
in the second CFC (and in any further CFCs in 
the future) within the parameters of the capital 
expenditure budget set for the project and that it can 
continue to successfully complete projects to expand 
the existing CFC.  
Operational
Single CFC The Group is dependent on the continued operation 
of the CFC (and to a lesser extent, the Spokes) in 
order to satisfy customer orders.  Any disruption 
(such as an IT failure or a fire) to the operation of the 
existing CFC, in particular, or a Spoke may therefore 
have an adverse effect on the Group’s financial position 
or affect the ability of the Group to economically 
deliver products to certain customers.
The Group has disaster recovery procedures in place 
to minimise possible disruption to the business.  The 
Group is in the advanced stages of a plan aimed at 
achieving the industry recognised “Highly Protected 
Status”.  The CFC is protected by fire and security 
systems and has a full contingency plan to manage 
power outages.  The Group also has insurance policies 
in place which cover business interruption to certain 
maximum levels.  In addition, the Group’s plans to 
build at least one additional CFC in the UK will limit, in 
part, the effect of any failure at the current CFC.  Also, 
Spokes are able, to some extent, to serve geographies 
of neighbouring Spokes.
road network The Group’s delivery service is reliant on deliveries 
by road: from suppliers to the CFC and from the 
CFC and the Spokes to customers.  This means that 
inclement weather, particularly snow, and sometimes 
traffic congestion may reduce the number of  deliveries 
that can be made and/or increase their cost.
The Group fits winter tyres to its delivery fleet for the  
winter period and can optimise its delivery routing  
system with road speed adjustments, for example, for  
inclement weather.  The Group also subscribes to a  
dedicated weather information service to give it early 
warning and more accurate details of extreme weather.
Identifying and monitoring risks
The Group faces a number of risks and uncertainties that may have an adverse impact on the Group’s operation, performance or future 
prospects.
It is important for the Board to effectively manage risks and opportunities in seeking to achieve the Group's objectives.  The Directors have 
overall responsibility for risk management and internal control systems. The Board's system of risk management is described in the statement of 
corporate governance.
The risks and uncertainties described below represent those which the Directors consider to be the most significant in achieving the potential 
success of the Group’s strategy.  However, these risks and uncertainties do not comprise all of the risks associated with the Group and are not 
set out in any order of priority.  Additional risks and uncertainties currently not known to the Directors and/or which the Directors believe to 
be less material may also have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business,  financial condition or future prospects.  The relevant mitigating 
factors are also described below.

Risk area Potential impact Mitigation
Relationships with third parties
relationship with 
Waitrose
Ocado’s reputation and brand is based, at least in 
part, on its relationship with Waitrose.  If the Sourcing 
Agreement with Waitrose were to end or if Waitrose 
were unable to source products for the Group, 
Ocado would need to engage additional personnel to: 
(i) find or create replacement own-label products; and 
(ii) find appropriate suppliers and negotiate equivalent 
prices itself.
The Sourcing Agreement also contains provisions 
which restrict the extent to which Ocado can 
source products other than from Waitrose, and the 
extent to which Ocado’s range of Ocado own-label 
products may be expanded.  If the parties terminate 
the Sourcing Agreement after certain competitors of 
Waitrose or John Lewis gain control of the Company, 
Ocado is obliged to pay Waitrose £40 million.
The Group has a successful relationship with Waitrose 
(which is now in its eleventh year) and in May 2010 
agreed a new sourcing arrangement which will 
continue this relationship until at least 2017.  The 
Group is not particularly dependent on the Waitrose 
supply chain as about 85% of products are delivered 
directly to the CFC by the relevant supplier or 
manufacturer.
Ocado currently stocks approximately 250 Ocado 
own-label products, and is in the process of extending 
this range.  The Directors do not believe that the 
restrictions on Ocado own-label products will have 
a significant impact on the growth of the business or 
their intended expansion of the range of products 
stocked by Ocado.  
IT systems and security and intellectual property
IT systems The Group relies to a significant degree on the 
efficient and uninterrupted operation of the internet 
and its IT and communications systems.  The Group’s 
business model relies on the complex integration 
of the Group’s website, the highly automated CFC, 
goods handling equipment and the order fulfilment 
and delivery operations.  Operational problems in 
the Group’s core systems and technologies (such as 
computer server or system failures, network outages, 
software performance problems or power failures) can 
result in customer orders being unable to be captured 
on the Group’s website or processed through the 
CFC, or errors and delays in their delivery.
The Group has an IT strategy that is aimed at ensuring 
plans are in place to have information systems and 
new technology that provide the capabilities necessary 
for the Group to maintain the integrity and reliability 
of its business.  The Group has disaster recovery and 
business continuity contingency plans to maintain the 
security, integrity and efficiency of its IT infrastructure.  
The Group’s IT systems are housed in a purpose-built 
data centre and it has a separate disaster recovery data 
centre which houses standby servers for all the critical 
systems and resilient data storage systems.  All critical 
communication links are provided via two diversely 
routed fibres and the internet connectivity is provided 
by two major internet service providers.
IT security and fraud If any compromise in the Group’s IT security measures 
or payment processing systems were to occur, the 
Group’s reputation may be harmed and it could lose 
its customers.  The Group relies on third parties to 
provide payment processing services and is exposed 
to typical fraud risk in relation to card payments.  The 
Group is also subject to IT regulations and compliance 
requirements.
The Group uses encryption and authentication 
technology to provide the security necessary to 
effect the secure transmission of information from 
its customers, such as card payments and to reduce 
possible fraud.  The Group’s customers’ confidential data 
is protected by a range of both physical and industry 
standard systems controls.  The Group’s website is 
regularly tested for vulnerability by both internal and 
external teams.  relevant accounting, IT and other 
procedures and controls at all levels are clearly set out 
and some of which are audited across the business to 
reduce the risk of fraud.  Ocado is undertaking a plan 
to ensure compliance with the Payment Card Industry 
Data Security Standards.  
Intellectual property 
rights
The business and IT systems and intellectual property 
are not protected by patents or registered design 
rights which means that the Group cannot inhibit 
competitors from entering the same market if they 
develop the similar technology independently.  In 
addition, third parties may independently discover 
Ocado’s trade secrets and proprietary information or 
systems.
The Group is reliant on copyright and confidentiality 
and licence agreements with its employees, customers, 
suppliers, consultants and others to protect its 
intellectual property rights.

Governmental 
regulation
A change in regulations relating to the internet and 
online retail operations, consumer protection laws, the 
processing of customer data, the environment (such 
as carrier bags), or the sale, licensing or storage of 
products could adversely affect the manner in which 
the Group currently conducts its business.  regulations 
govern the weight limits of the loads that each van can 
take and the number of hours that drivers can work 
on consecutive days, impacting the potential efficiency 
of the business.
The Group has an established governance process 
in place to monitor regulatory developments and to 
ensure that all existing regulations are complied with.  
The Group’s delivery routing software and customised 
vans (which are specifically designed to improve 
load-carrying capacity) help maximise the operational 
efficiency of the Group’s delivery infrastructure within 
the scope of the existing regulatory requirements.  
Financing
Funding for capital 
expenditure
The Group’s £100 million debt facility may be 
terminated by the lenders if the Sourcing Agreement 
with Waitrose is terminated for any reason.
The Group is able to manage whether any such 
termination rights will arise under the Sourcing 
Agreement and hence any potential impact on the 
debt facility (with the exception of the change of 
control termination right described above).
Regulation
Health and 
safety law
A violation of health and safety laws relating to the 
Group’s operations or construction of the second 
CFC or expansion of the current CFC could lead to 
injury to employees, negative publicity and reputational 
damage, fines, costly compliance procedures and in 
very serious circumstances, a temporary shutdown of 
all or part of the business, or a delay in construction of 
the second CFC.  
The Group’s health and safety department maintains 
and monitors procedures, which are aligned with 
the relevant regulations and industry standards.  The 
Group’s staff are trained in safe workplace practices.  
The Group is in the process of developing safety 
procedures and reporting structures for the second 
CFC construction project.
Exchange rate, 
interest rate and 
commodity 
fluctuations
Any depreciation of sterling in relation to the euro will 
increase the sterling equivalent of the price paid for 
the machinery used in the second CFC and to expand 
the capacity of the current CFC (which is mostly 
purchased from suppliers located in countries that 
have adopted the euro).  Fluctuations in the cost of 
commodities (in particular, steel) required to build the 
second CFC and in interest rates will impact on the 
costs to the business.
The Group has a policy, controlled by the treasury 
committee (and authorised by the Directors), to hedge 
certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures 
through the use of derivative financial instruments and 
fixed and floating instruments.  There are approval 
parameters for hedging arrangements and a policy to 
monitor and review hedging arrangements including 
short and long-term foreign exchange rates, interest 
rates and counter-party risk.  
Product safety The Group is subject to a wide variety of regulatory 
requirements including those in relation to the manner 
in which it sources, stores, handles and sells products 
(such as meat and fish) to customers and relating to 
the operating of its physical facilities.  Any assertion 
or regulatory investigation that the products supplied 
by the Group caused illness or injury to customers or 
others could adversely affect the Group’s reputation 
with existing and potential customers.
There is an established legal and regulatory team in 
place to monitor developments and to ensure that 
all existing regulations are complied with.  The Group 
has a food technology department which monitors 
procedures to ensure quality standards and compliance 
with applicable food law and which liaises with the 
Waitrose food technology department.   32

Staff
Key management, 
staff retention and 
recruitment
The Group is reliant on its key management and staff 
for the operation of its business.  The Group’s ability 
to recruit or adequately replace, retain and motivate 
suitably qualified and experienced staff is important 
for the Group’s success.  The relationship between the 
Group and its workforce could change if the Company 
were to formally recognise a union to represent its staff.
The business has had good relations with its workforce 
to date.  The Ocado Council, the Group’s employee 
council, was established by the Group in January 2010 
with a remit to discuss the terms and conditions of 
employment for the workforce and provide for further 
engagement with staff.  The Directors continue to keep 
staff remuneration and incentivisation under review to 
ensure it remains competitive.  The Directors expect 
to have constructive communications with any union 
seeking recognition by the Group.  
Risks relating to the industry
Competition and the 
online grocery 
market
The trend in UK food retailing of moving from the 
traditional grocery market to the online grocery 
market may not continue.  
The Group may be adversely affected (in loss of 
market share) by the entrance of new competitors in 
the online grocery market or if the traditional grocery 
retailers invest heavily in their online operations.  The 
Group also expects some increased competition 
from the Waitrose online business, Waitrose.com 
when certain exclusivity provisions which limit the 
extent to which the Waitrose.com service may 
compete with the Group in the Greater London area 
expire in June 2011.
The Directors believe that the online grocery market 
will continue to grow rapidly in the UK, particularly as 
the number of people shopping online continues to 
increase.
Ocado has a business model which is predicated on 
offering our customers a superior service in terms 
of product quality and convenience, reliability and 
accuracy of delivery, as well as environmental efficiency.  
The Directors believe that as the Group’s proprietary 
intellectual property and bespoke IT systems (including 
the Group’s website, the stock management systems, 
the CFC, the customer delivery system and the van 
routing system) become more sophisticated, so the 
barriers to entry for a potential online competitor 
become greater.  The Directors do not anticipate a 
significant overall impact on the Company from the 
increased competition from Waitrose.com.
UK and global 
economic conditions
The Group’s performance may depend on factors 
outside the control of the Group which impact on UK 
consumer spending, including  political, financial and 
economic conditions.
The Group regularly reviews its approach to pricing,  
marketing and product range for appropriateness to  
market conditions and to adapt to customer feedback.  
Despite the recent economic downturn the Group’s 
sales have continued to grow rapidly.

Statement of corporate governance
Introduction
The following sections explain how the Company applies the main 
principles set out in section 1 of  The Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance June 2008 issued by the Financial reporting Council (the 
“Combined Code”), as required by the Listing rules of the Financial 
Services Authority and where relevant, the main principles of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code June 2010 issued by the Financial 
reporting Council (the “2010 Code”).  
The new 2010 Code applies to all companies with a premium listing 
of equity shares with accounting periods beginning on or after 29 
June 2010.  Hence the 2010 Code is not applicable to the current 
period presented.  However, in anticipation of its application, the 
Board has voluntarily implemented a number of changes to its 
governance arrangements to reflect the requirements of the new 
2010 Code because the Board is committed to the highest standards 
of corporate governance.
The Combined Code applies to the current period.  Prior to its 
Admission on 26 July 2010, the Company was privately owned.  
Although not obliged prior to Admission to apply the Combined 
Code or the 2010 Code to its governance arrangements the 
Company had voluntarily adopted some governance standards 
commensurate with a UK listed company (as noted below).  
Since its recent Admission, the Company has applied the principles 
and complied with the provisions of the Combined Code, save 
as described below.  Where the Company has not complied the 
reasons for non-compliance are stated, including the period where 
it has not complied (if relevant).  recognising that it is a newly listed 
company the Board has the goal of moving the Company towards 
full compliance with all provisions of the 2010 Code as swiftly 
as practicable.  The Company will continue to put in place new 
governance arrangements in order to meet that objective.
Further information on the Combined Code and the 2010 Code can 
be found at www.frc.org.uk.  
The Board
The Company is led by the Board.  Subject to the Articles, the 
Companies Act and any directions given by special resolution, the 
business of the Company will be managed by the Board who may 
exercise all of the powers of the Company.  
The names, responsibilities and details of the current Directors on 
the Board are set out in the Board of Directors section.  During 
the period there were a number of changes to the Board.   The 
Non-Executive Directors, T om Clayton, Jonathan Faiman and Jeremy 
Frampton resigned from the Ocado Limited board on 9 March 2010.  
In addition, Michael robarts was appointed on 19 January 2010 as a 
non-executive Director and resigned on 26 July 2010.  The Company 
announced on 18 February 2011 the resignation of Patrick Lewis 
from the Board.  
Director election
The rules that the Company has about the appointment and 
replacement of Directors are described in the Directors’ report.  
In order to maintain high standards of corporate governance, 
the Articles require each Director to retire at every annual 
general meeting (each Director may offer himself or herself for 
reappointment by the members at such meeting).  The Combined 
Code does not contain such a stringent requirement (except 
for directors serving longer than nine years) and this 2010 Code 
requirement did not apply to the Company for the current period.  
However, each Director will seek re-election by shareholders at the 
Company’s AGM on 11 May 2011.  
John lewis Pension Fund right to appoint a director
As stated in the Company’s prospectus on 6 July 2010, the 
John Lewis Pension Fund agreed with Ocado that Patrick Lewis, a  
Non-Executive Director originally appointed to the Board in October 
2009 by the John Lewis Pension Fund, would step down from the 
Ocado board if the John Lewis Pension Fund’s holding of ordinary 
shares in Ocado falls below 10 per cent.  of the issued ordinary  
share capital of Ocado.  On 11 February 2011, the company 
announced that John Lewis Pension Fund had sold its entire 
shareholding in the Company.  As noted above, Patrick Lewis has 
resigned from the Board.
Chief Executive Officer
The Company’s Chief Executive Officer is Tim Steiner.  His 
biographical details are set out on page 16.
The Chairman
Lord Grade joined the Board as an independent Non-Executive 
Director and Chairman in 2006 and along with some of the other 
members of the Ocado Board, he became a Director of the 
Company in March 2010.  His biographical details are set out on 
page 16.  During the period, a Peerage of the United Kingdom for 
Life was conferred upon Michael.  He notified the Board of this new 
commitment outside of the Company.  
Division of responsibilities between Chairman and  
Chief Executive Officer
There is a clearly established and long-standing division of 
responsibilities between the Chairman and the Chief Executive 
Officer which is set out in writing and has been approved by the 
Board.  The Chairman is responsible for leadership of the Board, 
ensuring its effectiveness and setting its agenda.  He facilitates both 
the contribution of the Non-Executive Directors and constructive 
relations between the Executive and Non-Executive Directors.  The 
Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the day-to-day management, 
operations and results of the Group, executing the strategy once 
agreed by the Board and making proposals to the Board for the 
strategic development of the Group.  He creates a framework of 
strategy, values, organisation and objectives to ensure the successful 
delivery of results, and allocates decision making and responsibilities 
accordingly.  He takes a leading role, with the Chairman, in the 
relationship with all external parties and in promoting the Company. 34

Senior Independent Director
David Grigson joined the Board of Ocado as an independent Non-
Executive Director in February 2010 and along with some of the 
other members of the Ocado Board he became a Director of the 
Company in March 2010.  The Board appointed David to act as Senior 
Independent Director.  His biographical details are set out on page 16.  
The Senior Independent Director is available to shareholders of the 
Company to assist in resolving concerns of such shareholders.  
Independence
The Combined Code recommends that at least half of the board 
of directors of a UK listed company, excluding the chairman, should 
comprise non-executive directors determined by the board to be 
independent in character and judgement and free from relationships 
or circumstances which may affect, or could appear to affect, the 
director’s judgement.  The Ocado Board comprises ten members, 
including the Chairman, two independent Non-Executive Directors, 
four Executive Directors and three Non-Executive Directors who are 
not deemed to be independent for the purposes of the Combined 
Code.  The Company does not therefore currently comply with the 
relevant requirements of the Combined Code in relation to the 
balance of Executive and independent Non-Executive Directors, 
although it intends to do so.
The Company expects that as existing members of the Board step down 
and new directors are appointed, the Company will become compliant 
with the Combined Code (and the 2010 Code) in this respect.
Of the six Non-Executive Directors on the Board, the Chairman, 
David Grigson and ruth Anderson are independent as defined in the 
Combined Code.  However:
	 ● robert Gorrie is not deemed independent for the purposes of 
the Combined Code because he was an Executive Director of 
Ocado from April 2000 until April 2006 and a Non-Executive 
Director from May 2006 until March 2010 when, along with 
some of the other members of the Board, he became a Director 
of the Company.  He also provides consulting services to the 
Group under a separate consulting agreement.  Notwithstanding, 
the Board considers robert to be independent;
	 ● Jörn rausing is not deemed independent for the purposes of  
the Combined Code because the Apple Trust (of which 
he is a beneficiary) is a major shareholder of the Company.  
Notwithstanding, the Board considers Jörn to be independent; 
and
	 ● David Y oung is not deemed independent for the purposes of 
the Combined Code because he was a Non-Executive Director 
of Ocado from October 2000 to March 2010 when, along with 
some of the other members of the Board, he became a Director 
of the Company.  Notwithstanding, the Board considers David to 
be independent.  
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors have wide and varied skills and 
commercial experience which they bring to the deliberations of the 
Board and the committees, as well as their independent judgment on 
Group strategy, risk and performance.  The Board considers that its 
size and composition and that its balance of skills and experience is 
appropriate for the requirements of the business.  
The Chairman seeks to ensure the effective contribution of the 
Non-Executive Directors and constructive relations between Non-
Executive Directors and Executive Directors, particularly during 
discussions at Board meetings.  
Each Non-Executive Director’s letter of appointment to the Board 
sets out clearly the expected time commitment from them to 
the Company and at the time of appointment the relevant Non-
Executive Director confirmed that that he or she is able to devote 
sufficient time as is necessary to the performance of his or her duties.  
The Board is satisfied that each of the Non-Executive Directors has 
sufficient time available to devote to the Company.  
The terms and conditions of appointment of the Non-Executive 
Directors are available for inspection at the Company’s registered 
office (during normal business hours) and at the Company’s AGM.  
Conflicts of interests
The Companies Act provides that directors must avoid a situation 
where they have, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that 
conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with a company’s interests.  
Directors of public companies may authorise conflicts and potential 
conflicts, where appropriate, if a company’s articles of association 
permit.  
Each Non-Executive Director’s letter of appointment sets out 
the requirement for disclosing conflicts to the Chairman and the 
Company Secretary.  As part of the Company’s preparation for 
Admission each Director completed a questionnaire which required 
them to disclose any conflicts of interests.  Other than Patrick Lewis 
(noted above), no Director has any actual or potential conflicts of 
interest between any of his duties to the Company and his private 
interests and/or other duties.  
Whenever a Director takes on additional external responsibilities, the 
Board considers any potential conflicts that may arise.  The Board will 
continue to monitor and review potential conflicts of interest on a 
regular basis.  
The Board’s role
The Board has a number of key responsibilities and formally reserved 
powers.  The Board has responsibility for the overall management 
of the Group and for setting and reviewing the Group’s long-term 
objectives and commercial strategy, including determination of the 
nature and extent of the significant risks that the Board is willing 
to take to implement its commercial strategy.  The Board has set 
out a clear schedule of matters reserved for Board decisions (such 
schedule was approved by the Board prior to the Company’s 
Admission).  Other reserved matters include approval of: the annual 
report and half-yearly report; the Group’s budgets; the authority 
levels for capital expenditure; the treasury policy; and any governance 
policies.  
The Board delegates to management the detailed implementation 
of matters approved by the Board and the day-to-day operational 
aspects of the business.  The Executive Directors and the management 
committee meet twice weekly to review operational performance 
and to monitor implementation of certain projects.  Management has 
authority to undertake capital expenditure without Board approval up 
to certain pre-approved expenditure thresholds and above which the 
expenditure must be elevated to the Board for approval.

The Board delegates certain responsibilities to its principal 
committees, namely the Audit Committee, the remuneration 
Committee and the Nomination Committee.  The committees keep 
the full Board apprised of their work and refer matters requiring 
resolution to the full Board for approval as appropriate.  The 
Audit Committee monitors the integrity of financial information 
and reviews the effectiveness of the financial controls and the 
internal control and risk management systems.  The remuneration 
Committee sets the remuneration policy for Executive Directors 
and determines their individual remuneration arrangements.  The 
Nomination Committee recommends the appointment of Directors 
and has responsibility for evaluating the balance of the Board and for 
succession planning at Board level.  Further details concerning the 
committees of the Board are set out below.  The Company expects 
to establish other committees in certain areas including corporate 
social responsibility.  The purpose of the corporate social responsibility 
committee would be to review and update the Company’s existing 
corporate social responsibility policies, and monitor the Company’s 
formal corporate social responsibility objectives and plan.  
During the period the Board’s key activity was overseeing the 
preparation of the Company for Admission.  In addition the Board 
approved the entry into a new 10-year branding and sourcing 
arrangement with John Lewis and Waitrose.  
Attendance
The table below shows the attendance of Directors at scheduled 
Board and committee meetings during the period.  The Board 
had scheduled 10 meetings during the year and additional ad hoc 
meetings and conference calls were also convened to deal with 
specific matters, including the Company’s Admission, which often 
required attention between scheduled meetings.  Directors leave a 
meeting where the matters being discussed relate to them or which 
may constitute a conflict of interest to them.  From 9 March 2010 
onwards the main Board and committees were constituted with the 
Company and not Ocado, when the Directors were appointed to 
the Company Board (as noted above).  The composition of each of 
the committees changed during the period, as described in the Board 
committees description set out below.

was a major shareholder in the Company during the period.   
* Jeremy Frampton, Jonathan Faiman and T om Clayton resigned from the Ocado Limited board on 9 March 2010.  Michael robarts resigned 
from the Board of the Company on 26 July 2010.  Patrick Lewis resigned from the Board of the Company on 15 February 2011.
Information and professional development 
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring that all Directors are 
properly briefed on issues arising at Board meetings and that they 
have full and timely access to relevant information.  The quality and 
supply of information provided to the Board will be reviewed as part 
of the Board evaluation exercise.
Directors appointed to the Board during the period participated 
in an induction programme including a CFC visit and meetings with 
members of senior management and certain key employees, for 
example, in the finance department.  The Company intends to expand 
this induction program in future taking account of feedback from new 
Directors.  The Board intends that in future the Board programme will 
include regular presentations from management to help maintain the 
Non-Executive Directors’ understanding of the business and the sector. 36

Chairman’s Statement
Ocado Group plc  Annual report and accounts for the 52 weeks ended 28 November 2010
The need for Director training is assessed by the Board from 
time-to-time.  In conjunction with the Company’s Admission, the 
Company Secretary, Neill Abrams, arranged for the Directors to 
receive information and a presentation on the duties and obligations 
of a listed company director.  Training for Directors is available on an 
ongoing basis to meet any particular needs.
The committees have access to sufficient resources to discharge 
their duties, as required by the Combined Code.  In this regard, 
remuneration consultants had advised the remuneration Committee 
on executive remuneration during the period.  The Audit Committee 
received updates from the Group’s auditors on technical accounting 
issues or developments when required.  The Company retained the 
services of professional services consultants for the recruitment of 
new Non-Executive Directors.  
The Board is assisted by the Company Secretary, Neill Abrams, who 
reports to the Chairman in respect of his core duties to the Board.  
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary.  He has responsibility for ensuring that Board procedures 
are followed and for governance matters.  The Company Secretary, 
under the direction of the Chairman, was responsible for ensuring 
good information flows within the Board and its committees, as 
required under the Combined Code.  The appointment and removal 
of the Company Secretary is one of the matters reserved for the 
Board.  
Members of the Board may take independent professional advice at 
the Company’s expense in the furtherance of their duties.  
Director insurance and indemnities
The Company maintains directors’ and officers’ liability insurance 
cover for its Directors and officers as permitted under the 
Company’s Articles and the Companies Act.  Such insurance policies 
were renewed during the period and remain in force.  The Company 
also indemnifies the Directors under an indemnity deed with each 
Director which contain provisions that are permitted by the director 
liability provisions of the Companies Act and the Company’s Articles.  
The indemnity deeds were entered into by each Director at the time 
of Company’s Admission.  Qualifying third party indemnity provisions 
(as defined by section 234 of the Companies Act) were in force 
during the period and remain in force for the benefit of the Directors 
(and any officer) of the Company or of any associated company.  
Board performance evaluation
The performance of the Board is important to the success of the  
Group and accordingly the Board considers that reviewing its 
performance is helpful.  During the period, each of the Executive 
Directors was subject to a full performance evaluation from each 
other and the management committee.  This process will be repeated 
annually.  The Nomination Committee recommended to the 
Board that the Board should be subject to an annual performance 
evaluation in 2011, as required by the 2010 Code.  In due course, the 
Nomination Committee will agree who will conduct the evaluation 
exercise, the key objectives of the appraisal, a process for conducting 
the evaluation and a means of comparing the results with evaluations 
in future years.  The Nomination Committee expects that the 
performance evaluation will cover the performance of the Board, 
each of the Board committees and the individual Directors.
In conjunction with the implementation of this Board evaluation 
process, the Nomination Committee recommended that in due 
course, the Chairman separately review the contribution of each of 
the Directors with them.
Subsequent to the period end, the Chairman and the Non-Executive 
Directors met without the Executive Directors being present, as 
required by the Combined Code.  The Senior Independent Director 
and the Non-Executive Directors also met without the Executive 
Directors or the Chairman being present, as required by the Combined 
Code, and subsequently met with the Chairman to provide feedback.
The explanatory notes set out in the Notice of Meeting for the AGM 
state the reasons that the Board believes each Director proposed for 
re-election at the AGM should be re-appointed.  
Board committees
As envisaged by the Combined Code, the Board has established 
three committees: a Nomination Committee, a remuneration 
Committee and an Audit Committee.  The Chairman of each 
committee provides a report or update of each meeting of the 
respective committee to the Board at the following Board meeting.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee’s principal responsibility is to keep 
the composition and balance of the Board under review, consider 
succession planning, lead the process for Board appointments and 
make recommendations to the Board on all new appointments 
and re-appointments of Non-Executive Directors.  The Nomination 
Committee also makes recommendations for the membership of the 
Audit and remuneration Committees.
Meetings:  The Nomination Committee meets when necessary and 
will normally meet no fewer than two times a year.  The Nomination 
Committee met once since it was constituted around the time of the 
Company’s Admission. It met primarily to discuss the composition of 
the Board and the recruitment of new Non-Executive Directors.  
Members:  The Nomination Committee is chaired by David Grigson, 
and all of the other Non-Executive Directors (including the 
Chairman) are members.  
Independence:  The Combined Code requires a majority of the 
members of the Nomination Committee to be independent Non-
Executive Directors.  As explained above, while the Board considers 
its Non-Executive Directors on the Nomination Committee to be 
independent, from the perspective of the Combined Code only three 
of the members of the Nomination Committee (David Grigson, 
Lord Grade and ruth Anderson) are independent.  Therefore the 
Company does not comply with the Combined Code in this respect.
Prior to the Company’s Admission, the Company recruited two new 
independent Non-Executive Directors, to supplement the existing 
Non-Executive Directors.  This process was led by the Chairman (as 
prior to the Company’s Admission, the Nomination Committee had 
not been constituted).  Professional services consultants, The Zygos 
Partnership, was instructed by the Chairman in connection with this 
process.  Following an extensive search, the Chairman recommended 
to the Board that David Grigson and ruth Anderson be appointed as 
independent Non-Executive Directors.  Both were appointed to the 
Company Board in March 2010.

Getting to Know Ocado Getting to Know Ocado Our responsibilities
The Company had previously stated its objective to re-balance the 
Board in favour of Non-Executive Directors who are considered 
independent under the 2010 Code.  During the period, the 
Nomination Committee recommended that one new independent 
Non-Executive Director be sought and since the end of the period 
the recruitment of such new director to the Board was led by the 
chairman of the Nomination Committee.  Professional services 
consultants, Lygon Group, were instructed by the chairman of the 
Nomination Committee in connection with this process.  Here the 
Nomination Committee considered the skills, knowledge, background 
and experience required for the role, and prepared a job specification 
for the role.  A number of Directors including the chairman of the 
Nomination Committee, the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer 
and other Directors interviewed candidates for the role of Non-
Executive Director.  The Nomination Committee also specified 
the time commitment expected of the role and confirmed with 
candidates that each had sufficient time available to devote to 
the role. 
The Company will continue to actively seek to recruit new non-
executive directors so that the Board  meets the independence 
requirements of the 2010 Code.  The Nomination Committee 
will continue to meet regularly to consider the Board size and 
composition and to ensure that plans are in place for the orderly 
succession of appointments to the Board, as required by the 
2010 Code.   
The Nomination Committee’s terms of reference are available on the 
website (www.ocadogroup.com/corporate-responsibility/corporate-
governance.aspx) and set out the Nomination Committee’s 
responsibilities.  
Remuneration Committee
Role:  The role of the remuneration Committee is to determine and 
recommend to the Board the remuneration policy for the Chairman 
of the Board and the Executive Directors.  This includes base 
salary, annual and long-term incentive entitlements and awards and 
pension arrangements.  In determining the remuneration policy, the 
remuneration Committee takes into account many factors including 
the need for a significant proportion of the Executive Directors’ 
remuneration to be structured so as to link rewards to business and 
individual performance, as required by the Combined Code.  
Members:  The remuneration Committee is chaired by David Y oung, 
and its other members are ruth Anderson, robert Gorrie and Jörn 
rausing. During the period, the composition of the remuneration 
Committee changed.  Prior to Admission of the Company the 
remuneration Committee comprised David Y oung (as chairman), 
Lord Grade and Jörn rausing. 
Independence:  The Combined Code requires a board to establish 
a remuneration Committee of at least three independent Non-
Executive Directors.  As explained above, while the Board considers 
each of its Non-Executive Directors on the remuneration 
Committee to be independent, from the perspective of the 
Combined Code the only member of the remuneration Committee 
who is independent is ruth Anderson.  Therefore the Company does 
not comply with the Combined Code in this respect.   
Meetings:  The remuneration Committee will normally meet no 
fewer than two times a year.  During the period, the remuneration 
Committee met on two occasions.  
Duties:  The remuneration Committee’s key duties are as follows:
	 ● approve the design of, and determine targets for, any 
performance related pay schemes operated by the Group 
(ensuring that the performance related elements of Executive 
Directors’ remuneration are stretching and designed to promote 
the long-term success of the Company and Group) and annual 
payments made under such schemes.  In designing such schemes, 
the remuneration Committee should follow the provisions in 
Schedule A to the 2010 Code;
	 ● review the design of all new long-term schemes and significant 
changes to such schemes for approval, in each case, by the 
Board and shareholders (save in the circumstances permitted by 
the Listing rules).  For any such schemes, determine each year 
whether awards will be made, and if so, the overall amount of 
such awards and the individual awards to Executive Directors;
	 ● determine the policy for, and scope of, pension arrangements (if 
any) for each Executive Director;
	 ● ensure that contractual terms on termination, and any payments 
made, are fair to the individual, and the Company or the relevant 
member of the Group (as applicable), that failure is not rewarded 
and that the duty to mitigate loss is fully recognised.  The 
remuneration Committee should aim to avoid rewarding poor 
performance and take a robust line on reducing compensation to 
reflect departing Directors’ obligation to mitigate loss;
	 ● ensure that notice or contract periods should be set at one year 
or less;
	 ● within the terms of the agreed policy and in consultation with 
the Chairman and/or Chief Executive Officer as appropriate, 
determine the total individual remuneration package of each 
Executive Director and the Chairman including bonuses, 
incentive payments, share options or other share awards and any 
compensation payments (giving due regard to any relevant legal 
requirements and guidance);
	 ● review and note annually the remuneration trends across the 
Group;
	 ● oversee any major changes in employee benefits structures 
throughout the Group;
	 ● review the policy for authorising claims for expenses from the 
Chief Executive Officer and Chairman;
	 ● ensure that all provisions regarding disclosure of remuneration, 
including pensions, are fulfilled; 38

	 ● be responsible for establishing the selection criteria, selecting, 
appointing and setting the terms of reference for any 
remuneration consultants who advise the remuneration 
Committee; and
	 ● obtain reliable, up-to-date information about remuneration 
in other companies, with a view to judging where to position 
the Company relative to other companies.  The remuneration 
Committee shall have full authority to commission any reports or 
surveys which it deems necessary to help it fulfil its obligations.
The remuneration Committee has produced the Directors’ 
remuneration report (see page 41) and will put it to the Company’s 
shareholders for approval at the AGM on 11 May 2011.  
The remuneration Committee was advised by remuneration 
consultants, T owers Perrin (now T owers Watson), on certain 
remuneration issues. T owers Watson was appointed by the 
remuneration Committee.  The remuneration Committee is satisfied 
that there is no connection between the Company and T owers 
Watson. In addition, the remuneration Committee received advice 
from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , Slaughter and May and Appleby 
Trust (Jersey) Limited in connection with the implementation of the 
Group’s JSOS. 
The Board considers that the remuneration for Non-Executive 
Directors reflects the time commitment and responsibilities of the role.  
The remuneration arrangements for Non-Executive Directors do not 
include share options.  However, the Non-Executive Director, robert 
Gorrie, holds share options in the Company which were granted to 
him while he held the position of Executive Director of the Company. 
The Board determines the remuneration of the Non-Executive 
Directors within the limits set in the Company’s Articles.  
The remuneration Committee will, in due course, undertake an 
annual review of its own performance and terms of reference to 
ensure it is operating effectively and recommend any changes it 
considers necessary to the Board for approval.
The remuneration Committee’s terms of reference are available 
on the website (www.ocadogroup.com/corporate-responsibility/
corporate-governance.aspx) and set out the remuneration 
Committee’s responsibilities.  
Audit Committee 
Role:  The Audit Committee’s principal roles are to monitor the 
financial reporting process and the integrity of the financial statements 
of the Group and review the effectiveness of the Company’s internal 
controls, risk management and audit.  Its review of audit includes 
monitoring the effectiveness and independence of the auditors, 
including the provision of additional services by the auditors to 
the Group. 
Meetings:  The Audit Committee will normally meet no fewer than 
three times a year and during the period it met on five occasions to 
coincide with the Company’s reporting timetable and its Admission.
Members:  The Audit Committee is chaired by ruth Anderson, and 
its other members are David Grigson, David Y oung and robert 
Gorrie.  As required by the Combined Code, at least one member 
of the Audit Committee is considered by the Board to have 
recent and relevant financial experience.   The biography of each 
member of the Audit Committee is set out on pages 16 and 17.  
The Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Bracey, and senior members 
of the finance department and the auditors regularly attended the 
Audit Committee meetings.  During the period, the composition 
of the Audit Committee changed.  Prior to March 2010, the Audit 
Committee members comprised David Y oung and robert Gorrie.
Committee Independence:  The Combined Code requires a board to 
establish an Audit Committee of at least three independent Non-
Executive Directors.  As explained above, while the Board considers 
each of its Non-Executive Directors on the Audit Committee to be 
independent, from the perspective of the Combined Code only two of 
the four members of the Audit Committee (ruth Anderson and David 
Grigson) are independent.  Therefore the Company does not comply 
with the Combined Code in this respect.
The auditors had direct access to the chairman of the Audit 
Committee and had meetings with her without the Group’s finance 
executives present.  Since the period end, the Audit Committee met 
with the Group’s finance executives without the auditors present.  It 
is intended that the Audit Committee will also meet solely with the  
auditors.  
Auditors independence:  The Combined Code requires that the 
Board establish formal arrangements for maintaining an appropriate 
relationship with its auditors and explain how auditor objectivity and 
independence is maintained.  Following the end of the period, the 
Audit Committee developed and implemented the Company’s policy 
which restricts the engagement of its auditors in relation to non-audit 
services to help ensure that provision of non-audit services by the 
auditors do not have an impact on the independence and objectivity 
of the Company’s auditors.  The policy applies the guidance set out in 
the Guidance on Audit Committees issued by the Financial reporting 
Council in December 2010. 
The majority of the non-audit work undertaken by 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP during the period related to the 
Company’s Admission.  The total of non-audit fees paid to 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP during the period is set out in the notes 
to the financial statements.  Since the end of the period, the Audit 
Committee has received a regular update from management on any 
non-audit services being provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
and the cumulative total of any non-audit fees.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP also follows its own ethical guidelines 
and the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standard 5 – Non-Audit 
Services Provided to Audited Entities, and continually reviews its audit 
team to ensure its independence is not compromised.
Auditors re-appointment: In relation to the auditors, the Audit 
Committee reviewed the effectiveness and performance of the 
audit team and received assurances from the auditors regarding 
their independence.  On the basis of this review, the Audit 
Committee recommended to the Board the re-appointment of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors to the Company.  The 
Board accepted this recommendation and this will be put to the 
shareholders at the AGM on 11 May 2011.

Getting to Know Ocado Getting to Know Ocado Our responsibilities
Principal activities of the Audit Committee: The Audit Committee 
discharged its responsibilities in a number of ways, as described below. 
Internal controls:  The Audit Committee received and considered 
reports during the period on the work undertaken by its auditors 
in reviewing and auditing the control environment and reviewing 
the financial reporting procedures, which the Audit Committee took 
into account in assessing the quality and effectiveness of the Group’s 
systems of internal control.  
Financial reporting:  The Audit Committee reviewed the Group’s 
financial statements including, prior to the period end, a review of 
the significant financial reporting issues and judgements.  It reviewed 
the basis for preparing the Group consolidated financial statements 
on a going concern basis and disclosures in the financial statements.  
In addition, the Audit Committee reviewed the two interim 
management statements made by the Company prior to publication.
External auditors: The Audit Committee agreed the approach and 
scope of the audit work to be undertaken by the auditors.  It reviewed 
the Group’s processes for disclosing information to the auditors.  The 
Audit Committee reviewed, with the auditors, the findings of their 
work and agreed the fees payable in relation to the audit for the 
period.  As noted above, it also agreed and implemented a policy in 
relation to the provision of non-audit services by the auditors.
Internal audit:  The Group does not have a dedicated internal audit 
function, although internal reviews of the Group’s operations are 
undertaken periodically by senior financial staff.  The Audit Committee 
and the Board have considered the need for an internal audit 
function and concluded that, given the Group’s size and structure, it 
is not necessary at this time.  The need for an internal audit function 
will be monitored and developed as the size and complexity of the 
Group increases. 
Treasury committee:  The Audit Committee approved the terms of 
reference of the treasury committee which was established in June 
2010.  It reports periodically to the Audit Committee and must 
obtain the Audit Committee’s approval if it wishes to carry out 
actions that go beyond the scope of its remit set out in the treasury 
policy.  The treasury committee’s role is to oversee the Company’s 
treasury framework and working capital management as set out in 
the treasury policy and review compliance with the treasury policy. 
Review and risk:  Since the period end, the Audit Committee has 
received a report on key risks prepared by management and this, 
together with plans to mitigate such risks, will be reviewed regularly.  
In future, it is intended that the Audit Committee will receive 
individual reports in key areas such as IT security and controls, risk 
management, fraud and bribery.  
Whistle blowing:  The Audit Committee receives an update at each 
of its meeting on frauds and improprieties raised through the 
Company’s whistle blowing procedures.  The Company’s whistle 
blowing procedure, which allows the Company’s employees to report 
concerns anonymously, is set out in the employee handbook.
Bribery Act:  T owards the end of the period, the Company introduced 
a gifts policy.  The Company proposes to update this policy in light of 
the Bribery Act 2010 due to come into force in 2011.
Tax controls:  T owards the end of the period, the Company appointed 
its Group treasurer as the “Senior Accounting Officer” for the 
purposes of Schedule 46 of Finance Act 2009.  The Company’s Senior 
Accounting Officer is responsible for ensuring and certifying that 
appropriate tax accounting arrangements have been established and 
are maintained by the Company.  The Company plans to carry out an 
assessment of its tax accounting arrangements, systems and processes 
for corporation tax, vAT and payroll tax.  
GSCOP:  The Grocery Supply Code of Practice (“GSCOP”) which 
became effective in 2010 does not apply to the Company, so it is 
not obliged to implement any measures to accommodate this code.  
Nevertheless, the Company is taking steps to prepare for the likely 
application of GSCOP in future, including documenting written 
terms of supply with all suppliers.  The Audit Committee will monitor 
this code and consider any preparations for implementation of the 
GSCOP code’s requirements if the need arises in future.
Terms of reference:  The Audit Committee’s terms of reference, which 
are available on the website (www.ocadogroup.com/corporate-
responsibility/corporate-governance.aspx), set out the Audit 
Committee’s responsibilities.
Internal control
The Board has oversight of the system of internal controls for the 
Company and for reviewing the effectiveness of such a system.  
Certain of these responsibilities have been delegated to the Audit 
Committee, which reports to the Board.  Management is responsible 
for implementing and maintaining the necessary internal control 
systems and processes.
The Audit Committee has, in the period, reviewed the effectiveness 
of the Company’s system of internal controls, including financial, 
operational and compliance controls and risk management systems.  
As noted above, its review had included consideration of reports 
prepared during the period by the Company’s auditors.  
A system of internal controls has been in place during the period, 
up to the date of approval of the annual report and accounts.  
The Company has made significant improvements to the Group’s 
system of internal controls to address issues raised in the reviews, in 
connection with the continuing expansion of the Group’s business 
and to recognise the more robust and formal control measures 
needed after the Company’s Admission. 
The Audit Committee is satisfied that the controls in place are 
appropriate. However, it is mindful that the internal control system is 
designed to manage rather than eliminate risk in order to achieve the 
Company’s strategy and business objectives and so can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against loss.
The main features of the Company’s internal control and risk 
management systems in relation to the financial reporting process (as 
required under the Disclosure and Transparency rules) are:
	 ● an organisational structure with clear segregation of duties, 
control and authority;
	 ● comprehensive management information systems for providing 
management with financial and operational performance 
measurement indicators each week.  This information is 
summarised monthly and reviewed by the Board; 40

	 ● formal budgeting and re-forecasting processes.  variances from 
budget and forecasts are monitored and explained to the Board 
by management;
	 ● a capital approval policy that controls the Group’s capital 
expenditure that can be undertaken without Executive Director 
or Board approval; 
	 ● monitoring the progress of major projects, including the second 
CFC project, by management and the Executive Directors and by 
the Board;
	 ● a review of key accounting policies by the Audit Committee each 
year; and
	 ● a review of reports on any whistle blowing and fraudulent 
activity by employees or suppliers is undertaken by the Audit 
Committee.
Risk management
The Board accepts that risk is an inherent part of the business.  The 
Company’s formal risk management system was put in place in 
conjunction with the Company’s Admission.  The Company’s risk 
management system is designed to identify key risks and provide 
assurance that these risks are fully understood and managed.  
The Company’s risk management department undertook a business-
wide risk and controls assessment in 2010, identifying any actions to 
mitigate risk and implement new control procedures where necessary.  
The risk management assessment undertaken in 2010 consisted of 
formal identification by each department of the key risks to achieve 
their business objectives and the controls in place to manage them.  
This exercise was facilitated by the head of risk management.  
The risk management department maintains a risk register which was 
compiled as a result of this risk assessment.  The risk register lists all 
of the key risks that face the Company in achieving its objectives.  It 
identifies the potential impact and likelihood of each risk both, before 
taking into account any mitigating controls and after any mitigating 
factors are taken into account.  Some actions necessary to mitigate 
some of these risks have been identified and discussed by the risk 
management department and the heads of each relevant department.  
Subsequent to the period end, the risk management department 
provided a report to the Audit Committee to allow it to review 
the risk assessment. It is expected that in due course, the Audit 
Committee will make some recommendations for taking actions to 
mitigate risks and agreeing specific timelines for taking such actions.  
These agreed actions will then be monitored by the risk management 
department until they are implemented.
The effectiveness of the risk management process will be reviewed 
by the Audit Committee which then reports to the Board.  The 
Company intends that the risk management department will report 
to the Audit Committee summarising the risk management process 
and the risk assessment.  The Audit Committee will report to the 
Board thereafter.
As part of the Board’s oversight of risk, it receives an update at each 
Board meeting on health and safety issues.  Any specific issues which 
might affect the Company’s reputation are reported to the Board as 
they occur.
The Audit Committee is also concerned with financial risk 
management.  The treasury committee reports to it on financial risk 
management issues such as hedging the Company’s exposure to 
movements in interest rates and currency, as noted above.
Investor relations
The Company is committed to maintaining constructive 
communications with its shareholders.  Normal shareholder contact is 
the responsibility of the Chief Executive Officer, Tim Steiner, the Chief 
Financial Officer, Andrew Bracey and the head of investor relations.  
The Chairman and the Senior Independent Director are available to 
the Company's shareholders to discuss any of their concerns.
The Company regularly meets with its large investors and institutional 
shareholders who, along with analysts, are invited to presentations by 
the Company immediately after the announcement of the Company’s 
results.   The Chairman will occasionally attend these presentations 
by the Company to investors.  The Board regularly receives feedback 
from the Executive Directors on the views of major shareholders and 
the investor relations programme and also receives regular reports 
on the main changes to the composition of the Company’s share 
register.  One of the Company's largest shareholders, the Apple Trust, 
has a representative Director on the Board.

Directors’ remuneration report
This Directors’ remuneration report, prepared by the remuneration 
Committee on behalf of the Board, has been drawn up in accordance 
with the Combined Code, Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and reports) regulations 2008, the 
Listing rules and the Disclosure and Transparency rules.
This Directors’ remuneration report has been approved by both the 
remuneration Committee and by the Board, and a resolution to 
approve the report will be proposed at the AGM of the Company on 
11 May 2011.
Part A: unaudited information
(a) Remuneration Committee
Role
The remuneration Committee’s role and duties are described in the 
corporate governance statement, together with other information 
regarding the operation of the remuneration Committee, and is 
incorporated into this Directors’ remuneration report by reference.
(b) Remuneration policy
The remuneration policy of the remuneration Committee and of the 
Board is to provide remuneration packages for Executive Directors and 
other senior executive managers in the Group which:
	 ● align management’s interests with those of shareholders by 
incentivising management to deliver the Group’s long-term strategy 
and enhance shareholder value;
	 ● provide management with the opportunity to earn competitive 
remuneration through variable based pay;
	 ● provide rewards comparable with those of other relatively similar 
companies to the Group; and
	 ● enable the Group to attract and retain management of the calibre 
required to run the business and drive shareholder value creation.
Like the Board, the remuneration Committee is able to take into 
account various environmental, social and other factors in making its 
decisions about Executive Director remuneration.
Any Director who is appointed to any executive office shall be entitled 
to receive such remuneration (whether by way of salary, commission, 
participation in profits or otherwise) as the Board or any committee 
authorised by the Board may decide, either in addition to or in lieu 
of their remuneration as a Director.  In addition, any Director who 
performs services which in the opinion of the Board or any committee 
authorised by the Board go beyond the ordinary duties of a Director, 
may be paid such extra remuneration as the Board or any committee 
authorised by the Board may determine.  Each Director may be paid 
their reasonable travelling, hotel and incidental expenses of attending 
and returning from meetings of the Board, or committees of the Board 
or of the Company or any other meeting which as a Director they 
are entitled to attend, and shall be paid all other costs and expenses 
properly and reasonably incurred by them in the conduct of the 
Company’s business or in the discharge of their duties as a Director.  
The Company may also fund a Director’s or former Director’s 
expenditure and that of a Director or former Director of any holding 
company of the Company for the purposes permitted under the 
Companies Act and may do anything to enable a Director or former 
Director or a Director or former Director of any holding company of
the Company to avoid incurring such expenditure as provided in the 
Companies Act.
The Board or any committee authorised by the Board may exercise 
the powers of the Company to provide benefits by the payment of 
gratuities or pensions or by insurance or in any other manner for 
any Director or former Director or their relations, dependants or 
persons connected to him, but no benefits (except those provided 
for by the Articles) may be granted to or in respect of a Director or 
former Director who has not been employed by or held an executive 
office under the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings or 
their respective predecessors in business without the approval of an 
ordinary resolution of the Company.
The remuneration consists of the elements outlined below.
Performance-related versus fixed remuneration
It is the Company’s policy that a substantial proportion of the Executive 
Directors’ remuneration should be variable and performance related 
in order to encourage and reward superior business performance and 
shareholder returns and that remuneration should be linked to both 
individual and Company performance.
Base pay
Basic salary for Executive Directors takes into account the individual’s 
experience, roles, responsibilities and performance.  This is normally 
reviewed annually unless their responsibilities change.  For an Executive 
Director the remuneration Committee considers base salary and 
increases based on the median level paid for comparable roles within 
the market and the FTSE 250. 
One of the remuneration Committee’s duties is to review and note, 
annually, remuneration trends across the Group.  Following the end 
of the period, the remuneration Committee received an update 
from management on the reviews being undertaken by management 
on pay, share schemes and other employee benefits for the Group 
generally.  Although the pay of employees of the Group was not 
specifically considered by the remuneration Committee in making its 
recommendations on Director remuneration during the period, the 
remuneration Committee expects that it will receive further reports 
from management on pay trends and reviews being undertaken by the 
Group, in order for this to be taken into account by the remuneration 
Committee in future Director remuneration reviews.
Each of the Directors shall be paid a fee at such rate as may from time 
to time be determined by the Board, but the aggregate of all such fees 
so paid to the Directors shall not exceed £1 million per annum or 
such higher amount as may from time to time be decided by ordinary 
resolution of the Company.  The Executive Directors are not currently 
paid any fees on account of holding an office. 
Annual bonus
The remuneration Committee takes into account the performance 
of the Group and the performance of the individual Executive 
Directors to determine the amount to be awarded each year.  The 
remuneration Committee also takes into account median levels of 
remuneration compared to the Group’s retail peers.
On the recommendation of the remuneration Committee the Board 
approved bonus payments to the Company’s four Executive Directors 
totalling £640,000 for the period, consistent with the Company’s  42

Chairman’s Statement
Ocado Group plc  Annual report and accounts for the 52 weeks ended 28 November 2010
practice for awarding Executive Director bonuses in previous periods, 
including before the Company’s Admission.  The individual amounts are 
detailed in the Directors’ remuneration table on page 45.
These bonuses reflected the Executive Directors’ achievement in 
growing the Group’s sales in line with internal targets and moving the 
business into profitability in the final quarter of the period.  They also 
recognised the achievement of the Company’s strategic objectives, 
which in the period included the IPO of the Company and in the 
process, raising funds to enable continued rapid expansion of the 
business.  The Board was also mindful of the fact that, after these 
payments, Executive Director pay plus bonuses for the period was 
essentially unchanged from the previous year (except in the case of 
Andrew Bracey, who joined the Group in November 2009).  
Applicable to the Company’s first full period post-Admission, the Board 
has put in place a structured annual incentive scheme for the Executive 
Directors.  For the 2011 period, potential cash bonus payments will 
be calculated from performance measures related to sales growth, 
profitability and strategic objectives.  The selection of these measures 
reflects the strategic priorities for the business at this stage of its 
development.
Pension
Ocado contributes to the personal pension plans of its staff through 
a defined contribution Group personal pension scheme which is 
administered by Standard Life.  Employer contributions to the scheme 
are a percentage of salary based on length of scheme membership.  
The Group’s contributions on behalf of Executive Directors are on 
the same terms as for other employees.  All the Executive Directors 
participate in the Group’s pension plan with the exception of 
Andrew Bracey.
(c) Share plans
The Group currently operates three employee share incentive 
schemes, described below. Further information on the Group’s 
share schemes can be found in Note 24 to the consolidated financial 
statements.
Executive share ownership scheme (the “ESOS”)
The ESOS is the Group’s share option scheme approved by HMrC, 
and was established by Ocado in 2001.  Options may also be granted 
under the terms of a schedule, which is not so approved.
The employees who are eligible to participate in the ESOS are all 
Ocado’s Executive Directors and employees, including the employees 
of Ocado’s subsidiaries.  Directors and employees may not participate 
if, in the period of 12 months before grant of the option, they had a 
material interest (broadly owning or controlling 25 per cent of its share 
capital) in Ocado or a company which owns or controls Ocado and 
that company was a close company.
Subsequent to the last set of share options under the ESOS having 
been granted to a Director in November 2009 the Board has resolved 
that options will not be granted to Directors under the ESOS without 
first setting appropriate performance targets (for example achieving a 
target contribution per order or the Group achieving EBITDA targets).  
The number and exercise price for any options granted to Directors 
is set by the remuneration Committee.  All Executive Directors 
participate in the ESOS.
JSOS
The set up of the JSOS was approved by a resolution of the Board on 
13 January 2010 following recommendations made by the 
remuneration Committee that a new executive incentive scheme be 
established to incentivise and retain its four Executive Directors and 
select members of senior management of the Group.  The scheme was 
approved by shareholders by written resolution in January 2010.  The 
terms of the JSOS were approved by the remuneration Committee 
who oversee the operation of the scheme.
The JSOS is a share ownership scheme under which its participants 
and Appleby Trust (Jersey) Limited, EBT Trustee, acquired separate 
beneficial interests in 32,476,700 ordinary shares which represented, 
at the time of issue, 7.5 per cent of the then issued share capital of 
the Company.  These ordinary shares were divided into four tranches, 
vesting over four years.
The employees eligible to participate in the JSOS are all bona fide 
employees of the Company or its subsidiaries, including Executive 
Directors.
The remuneration Committee is responsible for deciding the identity 
of the participants and the number of ordinary shares that may be 
acquired.  All Executive Directors participate in the JSOS.
Sharesave Scheme
The Sharesave Scheme was approved by a written resolution of the 
shareholders passed on 23 June 2010, and launched on 30 September 
2010.  It is a savings-related share option plan and is approved by 
HMrC.  Under this scheme, the Company or the trustees of an 
employee trust may grant options over shares in the Company to 
eligible employees, including Executive Directors of the Company or 
its subsidiaries.  T o obtain an option an eligible individual must agree to 
save a fixed monthly amount for three years.  The amount saved will 
determine the number of shares over which the option is granted.  All 
Executive Directors participate in the Sharesave Scheme.
Non-employee share options
In addition to the options granted under the ESOS outlined above, 
Ocado had granted to certain non-employees options to subscribe 
for either ordinary shares or convertible preference shares in 
Ocado Limited (and following the reorganisation that resulted in 
the Company becoming the holding company of the Group, in the 
Company).  Options over shares in Ocado Limited were granted 
to Andrew Bracey before he became a Director.  Following the 
reorganisation that resulted in the Company becoming the holding 
company of the Group, such options are now options over ordinary 
shares in the Company.  
Performance conditions in share schemes
Under the JSOS, a tranche vests in each of the four years (as set out 
in the table in Part B, below) if the participant in the JSOS remains 
employed by the Company.  As described in detail in the Company’s 
Prospectus, if a participant leaves during the currency of the scheme, 
he may lose all or part of his beneficial interest, depending on the 
circumstances in which he leaves (that is, whether he is a “good leaver”, 
“bad leaver” or “very bad leaver”).  Apart from these leaver provisions, 
there are no performance conditions attaching to the shares in 
the JSOS.

Independent auditors’ report
to the members of Ocado Group plc
We have audited the group financial statements of Ocado Group 
plc for the year ended 28 November 2010 which comprise 
the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income, the consolidated balance sheet, the 
consolidated statement of cash flows, the consolidated statement 
of changes in equity and the related notes.  The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law 
and International Financial reporting Standards (IFrSs) as adopted by 
the European Union.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement 
set out on pages 24 and 25, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view.  Our responsibility is 
to audit the consolidated financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland).  Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for 
the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of 
Part 16 of the Companies Act and for no other purpose.  We do not, 
in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other 
purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or 
into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our 
prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.  This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the consolidated financial statements:
	 ● give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 
28 November 2010 and of its loss and cash flows for the year 
then ended;
	 ● have been properly prepared in accordance with IFrSs as 
adopted by the European Union; and
	 ● have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the lAS regulation.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
	 ● the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial 
year for which the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the consolidated financial statements; and
	 ● the information given in the Statement of Corporate Governance 
set out on pages 33 to 40 with respect to internal control and 
risk management systems and about share capital structures is 
consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion: 
	 ● certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or
	 ● we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.
Under the Listing rules we are required to review:
	 ● the Directors’ report, set out on pages 19 to 25, in relation to 
going concern; and
	 ● the part of the Statement of Corporate Governance relating to 
the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of June 2008 
Combined Code specified for our review.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the parent company financial 
statements of Ocado Group Plc for the year ended 28 November 
2010 and on the information in the Directors’ remuneration report 
that is described as having been audited.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
1 General information
Ocado Group plc (hereafter “the Company”) is incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.  The address of its registered office is Titan 
Court, 3 Bishops Square, Hatfield Business Park, Hatfield, Hertfordshire, AL10 9NE.  The financial information comprises the results of Ocado 
Group plc and its subsidiaries (hereafter “the Group”), see Note 28.  The financial period represents the 52 weeks ending 28 November 2010 
(prior period 52 weeks ending 29 November 2009).   
2 Accounting policies
(a) Basis of preparation and development of Ocado Group plc
The Company was incorporated on 8 December 2009 and on 9 February 2010 acquired the entire share capital of Ocado Limited.  As a 
result of this transaction, the ultimate shareholders in Ocado Limited received shares in the Company in direct proportion to their original 
shareholdings in Ocado Limited.  
Under IFRS 3 (revised) “Business Combinations”, the acquisition of Ocado Limited by the Company has been accounted for as a reverse 
acquisition and the consolidated IFRS financial information of the Company is therefore a continuation of the financial information of Ocado 
Limited.
As a result any financial information after 9 February 2010 represents consolidated financial information of the Group.  Prior to this date the 
historical financial information represents the financial information of the Company’s only operating subsidiary, Ocado Limited (see Note 28).
The financial statements are presented in sterling, rounded to the nearest thousand (£’000) unless otherwise stated.  They have been prepared 
under the historical cost convention, except for financial instruments that have been measured at fair value through profit and loss.
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that the Group will continue to be able to meet its 
liabilities as they fall due for the foreseeable future.
Use of assumptions and estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during 
the reporting period.  The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed 
to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and 
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
These estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.  Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period 
in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects 
both current and future periods.  Please see Note 3 for further details.
Standards, amendments and interpretations adopted by the Group in 2009/10 or issued, but are not yet effective and have not been early

(b) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of all subsidiaries.  The financial year ends of all entities in the Group are 
coterminous.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control over the operating 
and financial decisions is obtained and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.  Control exists 
when the Company has the power, directly, or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain economic 
benefits from its activities.  
On 9 February 2010, the Group, previously headed by Ocado Limited, underwent a re-organisation by virtue of which Ocado Limited’s 
shareholders in their entirety exchanged their shares for shares in Ocado Group plc, a newly formed company, which then became the 
ultimate parent company of the Group.  Notwithstanding the change in the legal parent of the Group, this transaction has been accounted for 
as a reverse acquisition and the consolidated financial statements are prepared on the basis of the new legal parent having been acquired by 
the existing Group.
All intercompany balances and transactions, including recognised gains arising from inter-group transactions, have been eliminated in full.  
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same manner as recognised gains except to the extent that they provide evidence of impairment.
(c) Foreign currency translation
Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”).  Sterling is the Company’s functional and the Group’s presentation 
currency.
T ransactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions 
or valuation where items are re-measured.  Foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from 
the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income 
statement, except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges.
Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the income statement within 
“finance income” or “finance costs”.  All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the income statement within “Operating loss”.
Group companies
The results and financial position of all the group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyper-inflationary economy) that have a 
functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
(a) assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;
(b) income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless average is not a reasonable 
approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated 
at the rate on the dates of the transactions); and
(c) all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations, and of borrowings and other 
currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to equity.  When a foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold, 
exchange differences that were recorded in equity are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently by the Company to all periods presented in the financial statements.

(d) Revenue
Revenue consists of income generated from online sales through the Webshop and includes charges for delivery.
Online sales are shown net of returns, relevant marketing vouchers/offers and value added taxes.  Relevant vouchers/offers include: money-off 
coupons, conditional spend vouchers and offers such as buy three for the price of two.
Revenue is recognised at the point when the significant risks and rewards of products have been passed to the buyer and can be reliably 
measured; in general this is deemed to occur when customers take delivery of the goods.  Income from “Ocado Delivery Pass”, the discounted 
pre-pay delivery scheme, is recognised in the period to which it relates on an accruals basis.
(e) Cost of sales
Cost of sales represents the cost to the Group of the product sold.  It consists of all external costs incurred in procuring goods for resale and 
delivering them to the Customer Fulfilment Centre as well any adjustments to inventories.
(f) Distribution costs
Distribution costs consist of all the costs incurred, excluding product costs, to the point of sale, usually the customers’ home.  This includes the 
payroll-related expenses for the picking, dispatch and delivery of product sold to the point of sale, the cost of making those deliveries, including 
fuel, tolls, maintenance of vehicles, the operating costs of the properties required for the picking, dispatch and onward delivery operations and 
all associated depreciation, amortisation and impairment charges.
(g) Administrative expenses
Administrative expenses consist of all advertising and marketing expenditure, the payroll-related expenses of all marketing, IT and other head 
office functions, costs of annual software maintenance contracts, property-related costs for the head office, all fees for professional services and 
depreciation, amortisation and impairment of IT equipment and fixtures and fittings.
(h) Exceptional item — IPO costs
IPO costs allocated to profit and loss represent the portion of directly attributable costs relating to the secondary shares traded on Admission 
and other costs attributable to the Listing.
(i) Other income
Other income consists of advertising revenue, commission income received and income from other services to suppliers.
(j) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment excluding land are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.  Cost 
includes the original purchase price of the asset and any costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Depreciation is provided at rates estimated to write off the cost of the relevant assets less their estimated residual values by equal annual 
amounts over their expected useful economic lives.  Residual values and expected useful economic lives are reviewed and adjusted, if 
appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.
Land is not depreciated.  Depreciation on other fixed assets is found within distribution expenses and is calculated based on the useful 
economic life indicated below:
Freehold buildings and leasehold properties  25 years, or the lease term if shorter
Fixtures and fittings 5–10 years
Plant and machinery 3–20 years (97% between 5 and 10 years)
Motor vehicles 2–5 years
Capital work-in-progress is not depreciated until it is available for use.
Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing proceeds with the asset’s carrying amount and are recognised within operating 
profit.  
(k) Intangible assets — Computer software
Computer software is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any recognised impairment loss.  Externally acquired computer 
software and software licences are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives of three to five years.  
Costs relating to the development of computer software for internal use are capitalised once all the development phase recognition criteria of 
IAS 38 “Intangible Assets” are met.  When the software is available for its intended use, these costs are amortised in equal annual amounts over 
the estimated useful life of the software.  Amortisation and impairment of computer software or licences is charged to administration expenses 
in the period in which it arises. 56

(l) Impairment of non-financial assets
The Group does not have any assets that have an indefinite useful life and so are not subject to an annual amortisation or depreciation 
charge.  Assets that are subject to an annual amortisation or depreciation charge are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes 
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.  The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair 
value less cost to sell and value in use.  For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are 
separately identifiable cash flows (cash generating units).  Non-financial assets that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the 
impairment at each reporting date.
Given the Group’s current operating structure the lowest level at which cash flows can reasonably be assessed is for the Group as a whole.  
The Group is still investing in its future growth and so has not yet reached a stage where it delivers positive post tax earnings.  The Group 
prepares detailed forward projections which are constantly updated and refined.  Based on these projections the Board does not consider that 
any further impairment of assets is required.
(m) Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs which are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets are capitalised.  They are defined as the 
borrowing costs that would have been avoided if the expenditure on the qualifying asset had not been made.  All other borrowing costs are 
charged to finance costs, using the effective interest rate method.
(n) Leased assets 
Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group.  
All other leases are classified as operating leases.  For property leases, the land and building elements are treated separately to determine the 
appropriate lease classification.
Finance leases
Assets funded through finance leases are capitalised either as property, plant and equipment, or intangible assets, as appropriate, and are 
depreciated/amortised over their estimated useful lives or the lease term, whichever is shorter.  The amount capitalised is the lower of the fair 
value of the asset or the present value of the minimum lease payments during the lease term at the inception of the lease.  The resulting lease 
obligations are included in liabilities net of finance charges.  Finance costs on finance leases are charged directly to the income statement on an 
effective interest rate basis.
Operating leases
Assets leased under operating leases are not recorded on the balance sheet.  Rental payments are charged directly to the income statement 
on a straight line basis.
Lease incentives
Lease incentives primarily include up-front cash payments or rent-free periods.  Lease incentives are capitalised and spread over the period of 
the lease term.
(o) Inventories
Inventories comprise goods held for resale, fuel and other consumable goods made up principally of spares.  Inventories are valued at the lower 
of cost and net realisable value.  Goods held for resale and consumables are initially valued on a current cost basis and adjustments are made 
at the financial period end to bring this to an average cost basis.  Fuel stocks are valued at calculated average cost.  Costs include all direct 
expenditure and other appropriate attributable costs incurred in bringing inventories to their present location and condition.
(p) T axation
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax.  T ax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it 
relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.  In this case the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity respectively.
Current taxation
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date.  Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is 
subject to interpretation.  It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amount in the financial statements.  Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax 
liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised.  The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other when there is a legally enforceable right to set-off current taxation assets against 
current taxation liabilities and it is the intention to settle these on a net basis.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which 
case the deferred tax is also recognised in equity.
(q) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when: the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event; it is probable that an 
outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Insurance claims
Provisions for insurance claims relate to motor insurance claims that have been incurred but not reported and are based on estimates 
provided to Ocado by the third-party manager of the Ocado Cell in Atlas Insurance PCC Ltd.
Dilapidations
Provisions for dilapidations are recognised on a lease by lease basis and are based on the Group’s best estimate of the likely committed outflow 
to the Group.  Where material, these estimated outflows are discounted to net present value.
(r) Employee benefits
Pensions
The Group contributes to the personal pension plans of its staff through a defined contribution personal pension scheme which is 
administered by Standard Life.  Employer contributions to the scheme are calculated as a percentage of salary based on length of scheme 
membership.  Contributions are charged to the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Share-based payments
Employees (including Directors) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees 
render services in exchange for rights over shares (“equity-settled transactions”).  The cost of equity settled transactions with employees is 
measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted.  Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes pricing model.  
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise 
restrictions and behavioural considerations.  In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the years in which the performance 
conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award (“vesting date”).  The vesting 
period is 3 years.  If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant or the employee leaves the Group, the 
options expire (subject to a limited number of exceptions).
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which 
both the vesting period has expired and the number of awards, in the opinion of the Directors of the Group based on the best available 
estimate at that date, that will ultimately vest.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, 
which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are 
satisfied.
The Group has exposure in respect of cash-settled share-based payment transactions and share-based payment transactions with cash 
alternatives as defined by IFRS 2 “Share-based Payments” only in respect of bad leaver provisions in the JSOS.
For details of the share options see Note 24.
(s) Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instrument. 58

The Group classifies its financial instruments in the following categories: 
● ● Available-for-sale;
● ● Loans and receivables; 
● ● Other financial liabilities at amortised cost; and
● ● Financial liabilities at fair value through the profit or loss.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets and liabilities were acquired.  Management determines the classification 
of its financial instruments at initial recognition or in certain circumstances on modification.
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories.  
They are included in non-current assets unless the investment matures or management intends to dispose of it within 12 months of the end of 
the reporting period.  Management consider that the Group’s investments fall within this category as explained below.
Investments:
Investments are classified as either held for trading or available-for-sale.  There are currently no investments classified as held for trading.
Available-for-sale investments are held at fair value if this can be reliably measured.  If the equity instruments are not quoted in an active market 
and their fair value cannot be reliably measured the available-for-sale investment is carried at cost, less accumulated impairment.  Unless the 
valuation falls below its original cost, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value of available-for-sale assets are recognised directly in equity.  
On disposal the cumulative net gain or loss is transferred to the statement of comprehensive income.  Impairments and valuations below costs 
are recognised in the income statement.  Dividends are recognised in the income statement when the right to receive payment is established.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.  They 
are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period.  These are classified as 
non-current assets.  The Group’s loans and receivables comprise “Trade and other receivables,” “Short-term investment” and “Cash and cash 
equivalents” in the balance sheet.
Trade and other receivables:
Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are recognised initially at fair value, and subsequently at amortised cost, reduced by appropriate 
allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Short-term investment
Short-term investment comprises treasury deposits with a maturity of greater than three months at balance sheet date.  
Cash and cash equivalents:
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and bank overdrafts.  Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand and form an integral part of 
the Group’s cash management.  They are therefore included as a component of cash and cash equivalents.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.  An equity 
instrument is any contract that gives a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at fair value, net of attributable transaction costs.  Subsequent to initial 
recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised 
in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest rate basis.  On the balance sheet, interest bearing 
borrowings have been subcategorised as borrowings and obligations under finance leases.
Compound instruments
Compound financial instruments issued by the Group comprise convertible loan stock that can be converted to convertible preference shares 
at the option of the holder.

2 Accounting policies continued
The liability component of the compound financial instrument is recognised on the date of inception or modification at the fair value of a 
similar liability that does not have an equity conversion option.  The equity element is recognised as the difference between the fair value of the 
compound financial instrument as a whole and the fair value of the liability component.  Any directly attributable transaction costs are allocated 
to the equity and liability components in proportion to their initial carrying amounts.
Subsequently, the liability component of a compound financial instrument is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate 
method.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair 
value.  The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, 
the nature of the item being hedged.  The Group has designated all outstanding derivative financial instrument balances at 28 November 2010 
as cash flow hedges of highly probable forecast transactions.  
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk 
management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions.  The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge 
inception and at the financial reporting period, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting 
changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
The fair values of the various derivative instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in Note 22.  Movements on the hedging reserve 
in shareholders’ equity are shown in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.  The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified 
as a current asset when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months.
Cash flow hedging
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in equity.  
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss.  When the 
hedged forecast transaction results in the recognition of property, plant and equipment the gains or losses previously deferred in equity are 
included in the initial cost of the asset and are ultimately recognised in profit or loss through the depreciation line.  
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
(t) Impairment of financial assets
Assets carried at amortised cost
The Group assesses whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset is impaired at the end of each reporting period.  A financial asset 
is impaired and an impairment loss recognised if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of a loss event that occurred after the 
initial recognition of the asset and the loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial assets that can be reliably 
estimated.
The criteria that the Group uses to determine that there is objective evidence of an impairment loss includes but is not limited to:
● ● Financial difficulty indicators;
● ● Breach of contract such as missed payments;
● ● Fraud;
● ● Bankruptcy; and
● ● Disappearance of an active market.
The amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash 
flows discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate.  The asset’s carrying value is reduced and the loss recognised in the 
income statement.
If, in a subsequent period, the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the 
impairment was recognised the reversal of the previously recognised impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
Available-for-sale financial assets
Equity investments classified as available-for-sale and held at cost are reviewed annually to identify if an impairment loss has occurred.  The 
amount of the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the financial asset and the present value of 
estimated future cash flows discounted at the current market rate of return for a similar financial asset.  Impairment losses recognised in the 
income statement on equity investments are not reversed.   60

3 Critical accounting estimates and assumptions
Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future 
events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future.  The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the 
related actual results.  The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities within the next financial period are addressed below:
(a) Intangible assets — capitalised software
Cost capitalisation
Amounts capitalised include the total cost of any external products or services and labour costs directly attributable to development.  
Management judgement is involved in determining the appropriate internal costs to capitalise and the amounts involved.  
Useful life
The useful life is determined by management at the time the software is acquired and brought into use and is regularly reviewed for 
appropriateness.  For computer software licences, the useful life represents management’s view of the expected period over which the Group 
will receive benefits from the software, but not exceeding the licence term.  For unique software products controlled and developed by the 
Group, the life is based on historical experience with similar products as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their useful 
economic life, such as changes in technology.
(b) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment represents a significant proportion of the asset base of the Group being 33% in 2010 (2009: 66%) of the 
Group’s total assets.  Therefore, the estimates and assumptions made to determine their carrying value and related depreciation are critical to 
the Group’s financial position and performance.
Estimation of useful life
The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is derived after determining an estimate of an asset’s expected useful life and the expected 
residual value at the end of its life.  Increasing an asset’s expected life or its residual value would result in a reduced depreciation charge in the 
income statement.
The useful lives of the Group’s assets are determined by management at the time the asset is acquired and reviewed at least annually for 
appropriateness.  The lives are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their 
life, such as changes in technology.
(c) Going concern basis including its effect on the impairment of assets
The Group has cash reserves and maintains a mixture of long-term and short-term debt finance that is designed to ensure the Group 
has sufficient available funds for its operations and its planned expansion.  The Group monitors cash flow as part of its day to day control 
procedures and management consider cash flow projections on a monthly basis ensuring that appropriate facilities are available to be drawn 
upon as necessary.  The Group also prepares detailed forward projections for future periods which are constantly updated and refined.  As 
a consequence, the Directors are satisfied that the Group is able to maintain sufficient resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable 
future. Accordingly, they have adopted the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Impairment of assets based on the separation of the business into cash generating units
The Group is required to undergo an assessment of the future viability of assets grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately 
identifiable cash flows (cash generating units).  Given the Group’s current operating structure, the lowest level at which cash flows can 
reasonably be assessed is for the Group as a whole.  The Group is still investing in its future growth and so has not yet reached a stage where it 
delivers positive post tax earnings.  Based on the future projections referred to above, the Board do not consider that any further impairment 
of assets is required.
There are a large number of assumptions and estimates involved in calculating these future projections, including management’s expectations of:
● ● Increase in gross sales;
● ● Growth in EBITDA;
● ● Timing and quantum of future capital expenditure; and
● ● The estimation of future funding and the cost of such funding.

3 Critical accounting estimates and assumptions continued
(d) Leases
The Group has a number of complex high value lease arrangements.  The Group follows the guidance of IAS 17 “Leases” to determine the 
classification of leases as operating leases versus finance leases.  The classification of a lease as a finance lease as opposed to an operating lease 
will change EBITDA as the charge made by the lessor will pass through finance charges and depreciation will be charged on the capitalised 
asset.  Retained earnings may also be temporarily affected depending on the relative size of the amounts apportioned to capital repayments and 
depreciation.  IAS 17 “Leases” requires the Group to consider property leases split into their component parts (i.e. land and building elements) 
separately.  As only the buildings elements could be considered as a finance lease management must make a judgement, based on advice from 
suitable experts, as to the relative value of the land and buildings.
(e) Recognition of deferred tax assets
The Group’s tax charge on ordinary activities is the sum of the total current and deferred tax charges.  The calculation of the total tax charge 
necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of certain items.  The final outcome of some of these items may give rise to 
material profit and loss and/or cash flow variances.  
A deferred tax asset is recognised when it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.  
Recognition, therefore, involves judgement regarding the prudent forecasting of future taxable profits of the business and in applying an 
appropriate risk adjustment factor.
At the balance sheet date management has forecast that the Group would generate future taxable profits against which existing tax losses could 
be relieved.  As a result the Group has recognised a deferred tax asset of £7.3 million with respect to available tax losses.
4 Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker.  The chief 
operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as 
the Executive Directors.
The principal activity of the Group is the retailing and distribution of grocery and consumer goods within the UK.  The results from the licensing 
of intellectual property for use outside of the UK to a non-UK subsidiary and the establishment in October 2010 of a captive insurance cell in 
Malta (see Note 28) are not currently separately reported as they are not considered material and management do not believe information 
about these segments would be useful to the users of the financial statements.  
The principal activity of the Group is managed as one segment and does not split its activities into any further regional or product subdivisions in 
its internal management reporting, as any such split would not provide the Group’s management with any meaningful information.  Consequently 
all activities relate to this one segment.
The Group is domiciled in the UK.  All of its revenue is from UK external customers and all non-current assets are located in the UK.

Unlisted equity investment 395  395
The unlisted equity investment comprises a 25% interest in Paneltex Limited whose registered office is at Paneltex House, Somerden Road, Hull, 
HU9 5PE.  This stake was acquired in June 2001 at a cost of £395,000.  Payment for the shares was partly in cash (£237,000) and partly in equity 
(1,975 convertible preference shares).  The Group’s 25% interest in Paneltex Limited has not been treated as an associated undertaking as the 
Group do not have significant influence over Paneltex Limited.  In arriving at this decision the Board has reviewed the conditions set out in IAS 
28 “Investments in Associates” and concluded that despite the size of its holding it is unable to participate in the financial and operating policy 
decisions of Paneltex Limited due to the position of the majority shareholder as Executive Managing Director, the insignificant size and arms length 
nature of the relationship between the Group and the company.  
The shares of Paneltex Limited are not quoted in an active market and their fair value cannot be reliably measured.  As such the investment in 
Paneltex Limited is measured at cost less accumulated impairment.  
The Group does not intend to dispose of this investment in the foreseeable future.  If the Group did intend to dispose of this investment then 
the anticipated exit route would be the sale of shares to the existing shareholder or another connected party of Paneltex Limited.  
Further details of the relationship with Paneltex Limited are included in Note 31.   68

The Group renewed its bank overdraft facility of £5 million with Barclays Bank plc in January 2010.  This facility was cancelled in January 2011  
(see Note 33).  
The cash and cash equivalents balance does not include a £30 million treasury deposit held by the Group, which has been classified within  
short-term investment (see Note 15).  
£600,000 of the Group’s cash and cash equivalents are held by the Group’s captive insurance company to maintain solvency requirements.  
Therefore, these funds are deemed to be restricted and are not circulated within the Group on demand.   70

at the end of their respective lease terms.  The CFC lease expires in 2032.  Leases for vans run for five years.

Forward foreign exchange contracts
The notional principal amounts of the outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts at 28 November 2010 were EUR 17.6 million  
(2009: EUR nil).
The hedged highly probable forecast transactions denominated in foreign currency are expected to occur at various dates during the next  
12 months.  Gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve within other comprehensive income were £818,000 (2009: £ nil).  These gains 
are recognised in the income statement in periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects the income statement, which for the 
purchase of property, plant and equipment, is over the useful life of the asset (three to 25 years).  
Warrant agreements
In 2004, the Group issued to Ranelagh Nominees (an affiliate of Lloyds Bank plc) and to Lloyds TSB Bank plc warrants to subscribe for up to 
5,611,200 ordinary shares at £1.80 per share.  Lloyds TSB Bank plc subsequently transferred its warrants to Ranelagh Nominees Limited.  The 
warrants provided Ranelagh Nominees with the opportunity to benefit in the equity upside of the Company.  On IPO the warrants were fair 
valued at £150,000, down £933,000 from that previously recognised.  This decrease in fair value was due to the market price being lower on  
the IPO than the expected market price per the initial valuation.  The outstanding derivative liability of £150,000 was settled in cash.

Convertible preference shares were convertible into the same number of ordinary shares, either at the option of the holder or on the 
occurrence of certain trigger events, including a public listing.  The convertible preference shares ranked pari passu with ordinary shares, with 
the exception that on return of assets on a liquidation, reduction of capital or otherwise, the holders of the convertible preference shares shall 
be entitled in respect of their preference shares (in proportion to the number of such shares held by each of them) in priority to all other 
shareholders, to the surplus assets of the Company remaining after payment of its liabilities, the subscription price for their preference shares 
together with a sum equal to any arrears of dividends declared calculated down to the date of the return of assets.  
On 9 February 2010 the Company acquired the entire share capital of Ocado Limited.  As a result of this transaction, the shareholders in Ocado 
Limited received shares in the Company in direct proportion to their original shareholdings in Ocado Limited.  Shareholders were issued 100  
shares in the Company for every 1 share in Ocado Limited.  The shares in the Company have a nominal value of 2 pence each.  Therefore as at  
28 November 2010 share capital represents that of the Company.  The prior period presented represents that of Ocado Limited.  
On 26 July 2010 the Company’s shares were admitted to the Premium Listing segment of the Official List of the UK Listing Authority and to 
trading on the main market of the London Stock Exchange (the “Listing”).  In conjunction, the Company made an initial public offering (“IPO”) 
of 118,968,225 new 2 pence ordinary shares at a price of 180 pence per share.  Also in conjunction, 247,474,900 convertible preference shares 
converted to ordinary shares.   76

Costs related directly to the new issue of shares in the amount of £6.9 million have been deducted from the share premium account.  
Attributable IPO costs are allocated between the share premium account and profit and loss account in proportion to the number of primary 
and secondary shares traded on Admission.  Other costs attributable to the Listing have been expensed.  
Costs expensed in the amount of £3.5 million in relation to the IPO relate primarily to legal and professional fees.  
The ordinary shares held by the trustee of the Group’s employee benefit trust pursuant to the JSOS are treated as treasury shares in the Group’s 
consolidated balance sheet in accordance with IAS 32 ‘‘Financial instruments: Presentation’’.  These ordinary shares have voting rights but these 
have been waived by the trustee.  The number of allotted, called up and fully paid shares, excluding treasury shares, at the end of each period 
differs from that used in the loss per share calculation in Note 27 as loss per share is calculated using the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares and convertible preference shares in issue during the period, excluding treasury shares.

a) T reasury shares reserve 
This reserve arose when the Group issued equity share capital under its JSOS, which is held in trust by the trustee of the Group’s employee 
benefit trust.  The consideration paid is deducted from total shareholders’ equity and classified as treasury shares on consolidation.  
b) Scheme of arrangement and capital reduction 
On 9 February 2010, pursuant to a scheme of arrangement, all of Ocado Limited’s ordinary and convertible preference shares were cancelled.  
Immediately thereafter, Ocado Limited issued 100 ordinary shares to the Company for £1 and in consideration of that and of the cancellation 
of Ocado Limited’s ordinary and convertible preference shares, the Company issued 185,715,900 ordinary shares and 247,474,900 convertible 
preference shares on the basis of 100 ordinary and/or convertible preference shares for each Ocado Limited ordinary share and/or convertible 
preference share held.  The effect of the scheme of arrangement was to replicate the shareholders’ register of Ocado Limited at the Company 
level.  
On 16 February 2010, pursuant to an order of the Court confirming the reduction of capital of the Company, the Company’s share capital was 
reduced by decreasing the nominal value of each ordinary and convertible preference share issued pursuant to the Scheme of Arrangement  
from 110 pence to 2 pence.  This created distributable reserves of £467.8 million.
c) Reverse acquisition reserve 
The acquisition by the Company of the entire issued share capital of Ocado Limited has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition under IFRS 
3 (revised).  Consequently the previously recognised book values and assets and liabilities have been retained and the consolidated financial 
information for the period to 28 November 2010 has been presented as if the Company had always been the parent company of the Group.   
The share capital for the period covered by these consolidated financial statements and the comparative periods is stated at the nominal value  
of the shares issued pursuant to the above share arrangement.  Any differences between the nominal value of these shares and previously 
reported nominal values of shares and applicable share premium issued by Ocado Limited have been transferred to the reverse acquisition 
reserve.

(d) Other reserves 
Other reserves consist of the foreign currency translation reserve, the fair value reserve and the convertible loan interest reserve.   
The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of the 
Company’s foreign subsidiary, Ocado Information T echnology Limited, which is incorporated in Ireland and whose functional currency is Euro.   
The fair value reserve comprises gains and losses on the spot movement of the Group’s cash flow hedges.   
The convertible loan interest reserve existing on 1 December 2008 arose from the issuing of convertible loan stock in 2004 which in  
accordance with the principles of IAS 32 was bifurcated into its liability and equity components.  In March 2009 on the expiry of the stock 
holders’ convertible loan stock, £1.1 million previously recognised in the convertible loan interest reserve in respect of this convertible loan stock 
was transferred to the accumulated deficit reserve.  
24 Share options and other equity instruments
The Group currently operates three employee share incentive schemes, namely the ESOS, the JSOS and the Sharesave Scheme.
(a) ESOS
The Group’s ESOS is an equity-settled share option scheme approved by HMRC.  Options may also be granted under the terms of a schedule, 
which is not so approved.  The ESOS was established by Ocado in 2001.
Under the ESOS, Ocado or the trustees of an employee trust may grant options over shares in the Company to eligible employees.  The eligible 
employees to whom options are granted and the terms of such options will be determined by the Directors of Ocado or the trustees.  The 
employees who are eligible to participate in the ESOS are all Ocado’s Executive Directors and all employees, including the employees of Ocado’s 
subsidiaries.  Options are not transferable.
The exercise price of options may not be less than the market value of the Company’s shares on the date of grant.  If the trustees or the 
Directors have determined that the exercise of an option will be satisfied by the issue of ordinary shares, the exercise price may also not be less 
than the nominal value of ordinary shares.
The directors of Ocado or trustees may impose a performance target and any further condition determined to be appropriate on the exercise 
of an option.  Any performance target must generally be measured over a period of at least three years.  There are currently no options granted 
which are subject to performance targets that have not yet been met.
The vesting period for the ESOS is three years.  If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant or the 
employee leaves the Company, the options expire (subject to a limited number of exceptions).
On 9 February 2010 the ordinary shares and convertible preference shares in Ocado Limited were converted into ordinary shares and 
convertible preference shares in Ocado Group plc on a 1:100 basis with a nominal value of 2 pence per share.  Current period opening balance, 
movements during the period and options outstanding at the end of the period have been disclosed as if the conversion occurred at the 
beginning of the period. 78

The market value of the Company’s shares was derived based on the market value of similar companies and by taking into account transactions 
with shareholders during the period.  The Share Valuation Office of the Inland Revenue has confirmed in correspondence that in respect of 
options granted the exercise price per share was not less than the market value of the Company’s shares at each option grant date. Since the 
Company’s Admission, the closing mid-market price of the shares on the day prior to issuance will be used for all future share option grants. 
In determining the fair value of the share options, the Black–Scholes Option Pricing Model was used with the following inputs:
 28 November  29 November 
  2010 2009
Weighted average share price £1.47 £126.60
Weighted average exercise price £1.27 £114.78

Weighted expected life  3.00   4.19 
Risk-free interest rate 3.5% 5.0%
Expected dividend yield  0.0% 0.0%
Expected volatility was determined by comparing the Company to others of a similar size or which operate in similar.  The expected life used in 
the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural 
considerations.  All share awards are equity settled.  The charge to the income statement is detailed in Note 7.

(b) JSOS
The set up of the Group’s the Group’s JSOS was approved by a resolution of the Board of Directors on 13 January 2010 following 
recommendations made by the Company’s Remuneration Committee that a new executive incentive scheme be established to incentivise and 
retain its four Executive Directors and select members of senior management of the Group (the “Participants”).  The scheme was approved by 
the shareholders by written resolution in January 2010.  The terms of the JSOS have been approved by the Company’s Remuneration Committee 
who oversee the operation of the scheme.  
Participants
Following consultation with the Company’s lawyers, financial advisers and independent executive remuneration consultants and the Board of 
Directors’ approval, awards were granted to the Executive Board and a select group of senior management.  In total they acquired interests in 
32.5 million ordinary shares with an issue price of £1.50 per share (historically the maximum share price recorded for the Company’s shares).  
Nature of interests
Interests will take the form of a restricted interest in ordinary shares in the Company (“Interest”).  An Interest permits a participant to benefit 
from the increase (if any) in the value of a number of ordinary shares in the Company (“Shares”) over which the Interest is acquired.  In order 
to acquire an Interest, a participant must enter into a joint share ownership agreement with the trustees of an employee benefit trust under 
which the participant and the trustee jointly acquire the shares and agree that when the shares are sold the participant has a right to receive 
a proportion of the sale proceeds in so far as the value of the shares exceeds a threshold amount.  For the initial Interests acquired by the 
Participants, there are four tranches each with their own threshold or Hurdle Value as follows:
Tranche    Vesting   Hurdle   % above 
  date value issue price
1 (2011)   01/01/2011 £1.7250  15%
2 (2012)   01/01/2012 £1.9075  27%
3 (2013)   01/01/2013 £2.0829  39%
4 (2014)   01/01/2014 £2.2813  52%
A participant is required to provide up front funding to the employee benefit trust equal to 2% of the issue price on the acquisition of their 
interests, amounting to £0.03 per share (the “Entry Price”).  
When an Interest vests, the trustees will transfer shares to the participant of equal value to the participant’s Interest or the Shares will be  
sold and the trustee will account to the participant for the balance i.e. the difference between the sale proceeds (less expenses) and the  
Hurdle Value.  
Vesting conditions
The vesting of the Interests granted to Participants are subject to a time vesting condition with one-quarter of the Interest in the Shares  
vesting on the first anniversary of their acquisition, one-quarter on the second anniversary, one-quarter on the third anniversary and the final  
one-quarter on the fourth anniversary.  
The fair value of the Interests awarded under the JSOS was determined using the Black–Scholes Option Pricing Model.  As per IFRS 2 
‘Share-based Payments’, market based vesting conditions and the share price target conditions in the JSOS have been taken in to account in 
establishing the fair value of the equity instruments granted.  Other non-market or performance related conditions were not taken into account 
in establishing the fair value of equity instruments granted, instead these non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the 
number of equity instruments included in the measurement of the transaction amount so that, ultimately the amount recognised for services 
received as consideration for the equity instruments granted is based on the number of equity instruments that will eventually vest.  The  
following inputs were used in the Black–Scholes Option Pricing Model:
   Tranche 1 Tranche 2 Tranche 3 Tranche 4
Weighted average share price £1.35 £1.35 £1.35 £1.35
Weighted average exercise price £1.73 £1.90 £2.08 £2.28
Expected volatility 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25
Weighted expected life 0.91 1.91 2.91 3.91
Risk-free interest rate 3.5% 3.5% 3.5% 3.5%
Expected dividend yield  0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0%
Expected volatility was determined by comparing the Company to others of a similar size or which operate in a similar industry.

(d) Sharesave Scheme
On 30 September 2010 the Group launched the Ocado Sharesave Scheme.  This is an HMRC approved scheme and is open to any person  
that was an employee or officer of the Group at the launch date.  Under the scheme, members save a fixed amount each month for three  
years.  At the end of the three year period they are entitled to use these savings to buy shares in Ocado Group plc at a price equal to 85% of  
the market value of the shares at the launch date.  
At 28 November 2010 employees held 819 contracts in respect of options over 2,724,513 shares.  A reconciliation of the Ocado Sharesave 
Scheme option movements is shown below:

25 Financial instruments
(a) Fair value of financial instruments
The fair values of financial instruments are measured by using the following fair value hierarchy:
● ● Quoted priced (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1)
● ● Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset and liability, either directly or indirectly (level 2)
● ● Inputs for the assets or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is unobservable inputs) (level 3) 
The fair values of short-term deposits, receivables, overdrafts, payables and loans of a maturity of less than one financial period are assumed to 
approximate to their carrying values but for completeness are included in this analysis.  
The derivative asset at the end of the current period relates to forward foreign exchange contracts, the fair value of which was determined  
with reference to the forward rate to the date of maturity for all outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts at period end.  This derivative 
asset is categorised as level 2.  
In the prior period the Group recognised a derivative liability in respect of warrants issued.  The fair value was determined using the  
Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model, and it was categorised as level 3.
The Group’s only available-for-sale financial asset consists of an unlisted equity investment of which the fair value cannot be reliably determined.  
This investment has been categorised as level 3.  There has been no movement in this investment during the period. 83

The interest rate used to discount borrowings is based on a LIBOR plus margin measure blended for the type of security offered and was 
calculated as 5.0% (2009: 6.4%), and is classified as level 2.
The fair values of all other financial assets and liabilities have been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing market

(b) Credit risk
The Group’s exposures to credit risk arise from holdings of cash and cash equivalents, a short-term investment and trade and other receivables 
(excluding prepayments).
 
Exposure to credit risk
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment
The Group’s exposure to credit risk on cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment is managed by only opening and maintaining 
transactional bank accounts and term deposits with banks and financial institutions which carry a Moody’s rating of Aa3/P1 for long-term and 
short-term deposits, and limiting the amounts that can be deposited with any one such bank or financial institution.
 
T rade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables at the period end comprise mainly monies due from suppliers, which is considered of a good credit quality.  The 
Group provides for doubtful receivables in respect of monies due from suppliers.
The Group has very low retail credit risk due to transactions being principally of a high volume, low value and short maturity, and the Group’s 
effective controls over this area.  The Group has provided for doubtful receivables in respect of consumer sales by reviewing the ageing profile 
and, based on prior experience, assessing the recoverability of overdue balances. 84

The provisions account for trade receivables is used to record impairment losses unless the Group is satisfied that no recovery of the amount 
owing is possible; at that point, the amounts considered irrecoverable are written off against trade receivables directly.
(c) Liquidity risk
T o manage the working capital needs of the business, the Group is reliant on being able to negotiate sufficient financing arrangements.  T o  
achieve this, the Group maintains a mixture of short- and medium-term debt and lease finance arrangements that are designed to ensure it has 
sufficient available funds to finance its operations.  In addition, during the period the Group maintained a committed standby bank overdraft  
facility of £5 million (2009: £5 million).  After the period end this overdraft facility was cancelled and replaced with a Group composite account 
facility with the requirement that the aggregate of favourable cash balances offset adverse cash balances, with a limit of £5 million adverse  
balance on any one account within the Group.  
The Group monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs while 
maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities at all times so that the Group does not breach borrowing limits  
or covenants (where applicable) on any of its borrowing facilities.  For further details see Note 26.
The table below analyses the Group’s non-derivative financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the

At the end of the prior period the Group had a derivative liability in the form of warrants to subscribe for ordinary shares in Ocado Limited  
with a fair value of £1,083,000 outstanding (see Note 22).  The nature of these warrants does not allow for a maturity profile to be calculated 
due to the uncertain timing of it being exercised.  These warrants were revalued and eventually settled during the current period.

(d) Market risk
Currency risk
The Group has foreign currency exposure in relation to its trade payables, a portion of its cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial 
instruments in the form of forward foreign exchange contracts.  
Foreign currency trade payables arise principally on purchases of plant and equipment, whilst Euro bank accounts are maintained in order to 
minimise the Group’s exposure to fluctuations in the Euro relating to current and future purchases of plant and equipment.  Forward foreign 
exchange contracts are entered into in order to hedge future purchases of Euro.
The Group’s exposure to currency risk is based on the following amounts:
   28 November  29 November
   2010 2009
    £’000 £’000
Cash and cash equivalents — Euro  5,318   — 
Trade payables at period end:
Euro  1,254   41
US dollar  —   2
Derivative asset (forward foreign exchange contracts) — Euro      472   — 
           7,044   43
The table below shows the Group’s sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates on its Euro-related financial instruments:
   28 November 2010 29 November 2009
  Increase/ Increase/ Increase/ Increase/
 (decrease) (decrease) (decrease) (decrease)

10% appreciation of the Euro  760   1,453   5   —
10% depreciation of the Euro  (734)  (1,324)  (5)  — 
A strengthening of the Euro, as indicated, against sterling at 28 November 2010 would have increased/(decreased) equity and profit or loss by  
the amounts detailed above.  This analysis is based on foreign currency exchange rate variances that the Group considered to be reasonably 
possible at the end of the period.  The analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.
Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on its interest bearing borrowings and floating rate cash and cash equivalents.  The Group’s interest 
rate risk policy seeks to minimise finance charges and volatility by structuring the interest rate profile into a diversified portfolio of fixed rate and 
floating rate financial assets and liabilities.
At the balance sheet date the interest rate profile of the Group’s interest bearing financial instruments was:
   28 November  29 November
   2010 2009
    £’000 £’000

Sensitivity analysis
An increase of 100 basis points (1.0%) in interest rates at the balance sheet date will increase equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown 
below.  100 basis points was deemed an appropriate rate, considering the current short-term interest rate outlook.  This calculation assumes  
that the change occurred at the balance sheet date and had been applied to risk exposures existing at that date.  This analysis assumes that all 
other variables remain constant and considers the effect on financial instruments with variable interest rates.

26 Capital management
The Board’s objective is to ensure the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and sustain future development of the business, providing 
returns to shareholders and benefits to other stakeholders through an appropriate balance of debt and equity financing.  
The Board’s policy is to keep borrowings within existing facilities and to negotiate and obtain additional resources required to fund the Group’s 
working capital requirements for the foreseeable future.
The Board closely manages its trading capital, which it defines as its net assets plus net debt.  Net debt is calculated as total debt (borrowings  
and finance leases as shown in the balance sheet), less short-term investments and cash and cash equivalents.  The Group has performance  
based loan covenants in place over certain facilities.  Management monitors the performance targets on a period basis considering actual and 
forecast results and they maintain constant communication with all of the Group’s Lenders.  Throughout the year the Group has complied with  
all covenants imposed by those Lenders.  The main areas of capital management revolve around the management of the components of  
working capital including monitoring stock turn, age of stock, age of debtors, debtor days, creditor days, balance sheet re-forecasting, period 
projected loss, weekly cash flow forecasts, and daily cash balances.  Major investment decisions are based on reviewing the expected future cash 
flows and all major capital expenditure requires approval from the Board.  There were no major changes in the Group’s approach to capital 
management during the period.
At the balance sheet date the Group’s performance in remaining within its borrowing facilities, including standby overdraft facilities, as measured 
by the headroom available was as follows:
   28 November  29 November
   2010 2009
   Notes £’000 £’000
T otal facilities available     191,373   137,775 
Facilities drawn down  18  (74,114) (120,065)
Undrawn facilities at end of period    117,259   17,710 
Short-term investment  15 30,000 —
Cash and cash equivalents gross of drawn overdraft facility  16  124,780   13,157 
T otal undrawn facilities, short-term investment and cash available at the end of the period    272,039   30,867 
27 Loss per share
Basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the loss attributable to equity holders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares and 
convertible preference shares in issue during the period, excluding ordinary shares held pursuant to the Group’s JSOS and accounted for as 
treasury shares, adjusted to reflect the conversion of the ordinary shares and preference shares from Ocado Limited to Ocado Group plc on  
a 1:100 basis on 9 February 2010.  The loss for the period is equally attributable to the shareholders of ordinary shares and convertible 
preference shares.  For more information see Note 23.
Diluted loss per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares and convertible preference shares outstanding 
to assume conversion of all dilutive potential shares, adjusted to reflect the conversion of the ordinary shares and the convertible preference 
shares from Ocado Limited to Ocado Group plc as mentioned above.  The Company has two categories of potentially dilutive shares, namely 
share options and shares held pursuant to the Group’s JSOS.
There was no difference in the weighted average number of shares used for the calculation of basic and diluted loss per share as the effect of  
all potentially dilutive shares outstanding was anti-dilutive. 88

parent company of the Group.  Notwithstanding the change in the legal parent of the Group, this transaction has been accounted for as a

new legal parent having been acquired by the existing Group.

On 15 October 2010 a dedicated cell (the “Ocado Cell”) was established in Atlas Insurance PCC Limited (the “Cell Company”) by the issue 
of non-participating redeemable preference shares to Ocado Holdings Limited.  The Cell Company is incorporated in the Republic of Malta 
with registration number C 5601 and is authorised under Malta’s Insurance Business Act (1998) to carry on general insurance business and is 
constituted as a protected cell company under the Maltese Companies Act (Cell Companies Carrying on Business of Insurance) Regulations 
(2004).  On 20 October 2010 the Cell Company entered into an agreement with Ocado Holdings Limited to provide the Group with insurance 
facilities conducted through the Ocado Cell.  The Group has effective control over the financial and operating activities of the Ocado Cell and 
therefore consolidates the Ocado Cell in its financial statements in accordance with SIC 12 “Consolidation – Special Purpose Entities”.  The 
Group uses the Ocado Cell to provide self-insurance for its vehicle fleet and public and product liability claims.  This strategy of self-insurance for 
elements of business risk is used by many large companies in order to reduce costs and exercise greater control of their insurance needs.  The 
risk of self-insuring is managed within the Group through stop-loss insurance being taken out with a third party to cover claims over £100,000 
each and £3 million in aggregate.  The provisions as at 28 November 2010 include a provision for insurance claims incurred but not reported of 
£115,000 (2009: £nil).

Ocado Group plc  Annual report and accounts for the 52 weeks to 28 November 2010
Independent auditors’ report
to the members of Ocado Group plc
We have audited the parent company financial statements of Ocado 
Group plc for the year ended 28 November 2010 which comprise 
the company balance sheet, the company statement of cash flows, 
the company statement of changes in equity and the related notes.  
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and as applied 
in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only 
for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 
3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose.  
We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility 
for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report 
is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly 
agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.  This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the 
parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements.
 Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the parent company financial statements: 
● ● give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as 
at 28 November 2010 and of its cash flows for the year then 
ended;
● ● have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
● ● have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006.  
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
 In our opinion: 
● ● the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and 
● ● the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial 
year for which the parent company financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the parent company financial 
statements.  
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where 
the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our 
opinion: 
● ● adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent

Chairman’s Statement
Ocado Group plc  Annual report and accounts for the 52 weeks to 28 November 2010
1 General information
Ocado Group plc is incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.  The address of its registered office is Titan Court, 3 Bishops Square, 
Hatfield Business Park, Hatfield, Hertfordshire, AL10 9NE.
The period represents the 51 weeks ending 28 November 2010.  There are no comparative figures as the Company was incorporated during 
the period, on 8 December 2009.
2 Accounting policies
(a) Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and International Financial 
Reporting Interpretation Committee (IFRIC) interpretations as endorsed by the European Union, and those parts of the Companies Act 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements are presented in sterling, rounded to the nearest thousand (£’000) unless otherwise stated.  It has been prepared 
under the historical cost convention.
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that the Company will continue to be able to meet its 
liabilities as they fall due for the foreseeable future.
Exemptions
The Directors have taken advantage of the exemption available under Section 408 of the Companies Act and not presented an income 
statement or a statement of comprehensive income for the Company alone.  The loss for the period has been disclosed in the statement of 
changes in equity.
(b) Use of assumptions and estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during 
the reporting period.  The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed 
to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and 
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
These estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.  Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period 
in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects 
both current and future periods.
(c) Standards, amendments and interpretations adopted by the Company in 2009/10 or issued, but are not yet effective and have not been 
early adopted by the Company
All accounting policies which are applicable to the Group and which have been adopted by the Group in prior periods were adopted by the 
Company on incorporation.  No new accounting standards, amendments and interpretations have become effective during the period since 
the incorporation of the Company.  
The following IFRSs, IFRIC interpretations and amendments, effective for periods beginning on or after the date shown below,  have been issued 
but are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Company:

early adopted by the Company continued
The adoption of these standards, interpretations and amendments is not anticipated to have a material effect on the results of the Company.
(d)  Foreign currency translation
T ransactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions 
or valuation where items are re-measured.  Foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from 
the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income 
statement.  
(e)  Administrative expenses
Administrative expenses consist of fees for professional services, bank charges and any other costs of an administrative nature.
(f) Taxation
Current taxation
Current tax is accounted for on the basis of tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.  Current tax is charged or 
credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged to equity, in which case the current tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amount in the financial statements.  Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax 
liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other when there is a legally enforceable right to set-off current taxation assets against 
current taxation liabilities and it is the intention to settle these on a net basis.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which 
case the deferred tax is also recognised in equity.
(g) Employee benefits
Share-based payments
Employees (including Directors) of the Company’s subsidiaries receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby 
employees render services in exchange for rights over shares (“equity-settled transactions”).  The cost of equity settled transactions with 
employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted.
Subsidiaries are recharged for the amount recognised as share-based payments relating to awards to their employees.  These recharges are 
recognised as an increase in the investment in the relevant subsidiaries in accordance with IFRS 2.
For details of Group share schemes see Note 24 in the consolidated financial statements.
(h) Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions 
of the instrument.
The Company classifies its financial instruments in the following categories:
● ● Available-for-sale;
● ● Loans and receivables; and
● ● Other financial liabilities at amortised cost.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets and liabilities were acquired.  Management determines the classification 
of its financial instruments at initial recognition or in certain circumstances on modification. 98

2 Accounting policies continued
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories.  
They are included in non-current assets unless the investment matures or management intends to dispose of it within 12 months of the end of 
the reporting period.  Management consider that the Group’s investments fall within this category, as explained below.
Investments
Investments are classified as either held for trading or available-for-sale.  There are currently no investments classified as held for trading.
Available-for-sale investments are held at fair value if this can be reliably measured.  If the equity instruments are not quoted in an active market 
and their fair value cannot be reliably measured the available-for-sale investment is carried at cost, less accumulated impairment.  Unless the 
valuation falls below its original cost, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value of available-for-sale assets are recognised directly in equity.  
On disposal the cumulative net gain or loss is transferred to the statement of comprehensive income.  Impairments and valuations below costs 
are recognised in the income statement.  Dividends are recognised in the income statement when the right to receive payment is established.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.  They  
are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period.  These are classified as non-
current assets.  The Company’s loans and receivables comprise “Other receivables,” “Short-term investment” and “Cash and cash equivalents” in 
the balance sheet.
Other receivables
Other receivables are non-interest bearing and are recognised initially at fair value, and subsequently at amortised cost, reduced by appropriate 
allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Short-term investment
Short-term investment comprises treasury deposits with a maturity of greater than three months at period end.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash at bank and in hand, demand deposits with banks and short-term deposits with a maturity of three 
months or less at the balance sheet date.
Other financial liabilities at amortised cost
Financial liabilities are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.  
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
(i) Investments
Investments in group undertakings are valued at cost, less accumulated impairment.

10 Share capital and premium
The Company has authorised share capital of 600 million ordinary shares of 2 pence each at 28 November 2010.
The movements in the number of allotted, called up and fully paid ordinary and convertible preference shares and called up share capital and 
share premium are set out below:

At 28 November 2010    553,428,201 — 11,068 — 206,094
Convertible preference shares were convertible into the same number of ordinary shares, either at the option of the holder or on the 
occurrence of certain trigger events, including a public listing.  The convertible preference shares ranked pari passu with ordinary shares, with 
the exception that on return of assets on a liquidation, reduction of capital or otherwise, the holders of the convertible preference shares shall 
be entitled in respect of their preference shares (in proportion to the number of such shares held by each of them) in priority to all other 
shareholders, to the surplus assets of the Company remaining after payment of its liabilities, the subscription price for their preference shares 
together with a sum equal to any arrears of dividends declared calculated down to the date of the return of assets.
On 9 February 2010, the Company acquired the entire share capital of Ocado Limited.  As a result of this transaction, the ultimate shareholders 
in Ocado Limited received shares in the Company in direct proportion to their original shareholdings in Ocado Limited.  Shareholders were 
issued 185,715,900 ordinary shares and 247,474,900 preference shares on the basis of 1:100 ordinary and preference shares for each Ocado 
Limited share held.
On 16 February 2010, pursuant to an order of the Court confirming the reduction of capital of the Company, the Company’s share capital  
was reduced by decreasing the nominal value of each ordinary and preference share issued pursuant to the Scheme of Arrangement from  
110 pence to 2 pence.  This created distributable reserves of £467.8 million.
On 26 July 2010 the Company’s shares were admitted to the Premium Listing segment of the Official List of the UK Listing Authority and to 
trading on the main market of the London Stock Exchange (the “Listing”).  In conjunction, the Company made an initial public offering (“IPO”) 
of 118,968,225 new 2 pence ordinary shares at a price of 180 pence per share.  Also in conjunction, 247,474,900 convertible preference shares 
converted to ordinary shares.  
Costs related directly to the new issue of shares in the amount of £6.9 million have been deducted from the share premium account.  
Attributable IPO costs are allocated between the share premium account and profit and loss account in proportion to the number of primary 
and secondary shares traded on Admission.  Other costs attributable to the Listing have been expensed.

11 Financial instruments
(a) Fair value of financial instruments
The fair values of financial instruments are measured by using the following fair value hierarchy:
● ● Quoted priced (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1)
● ● Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset and liability, either directly or indirectly (level 2)
● ● Inputs for the assets or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is unobservable inputs) (level 3)
Set out below is a comparison by category of carrying amounts and fair values of all financial instruments that are carried in the financial 
statements.  The fair values of financial assets and liabilities are based on prices available from the market on which the instruments are traded 
where available.  The fair values of short-term deposits, receivables and payables are assumed to approximate to their carrying values but for 
completeness are included in the analysis below.

(b) Credit risk
The Company’s exposure to credit risk arise from holdings of cash and cash equivalents, other receivables (excluding prepayments) and a  
short-term investment.
Exposure to credit risk
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.  This is shown in the table in Note 11(a) above.
Cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposit
The Company’s exposure to credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is managed by cash deposits only being placed with banks and financial 
institutions which carry Moody’s ratings of Aa3/P1 for long-term and short-term deposits.
Other receivables
Other receivables at the period end consist primarily of amounts due from subsidiary undertakings.  Management provide for irrecoverable  
debts when there are indicators that a balance may not be recoverable.
The ageing of other receivables (excluding prepayments) and the short-term investment at the balance sheet date was:

There were no unimpaired balances at the period end where the Company had renegotiated the terms of the other receivables.  Management 
has not provided for irrecoverable debts against any of its other receivable balances. 102

(c) Liquidity risk
T o manage the working capital needs of the business the Company is reliant on being able to negotiate sufficient financing arrangements.  The 
Company monitors cash flow as part of its day to day control procedures and the Board considers cash flow projections on a monthly basis.   
For further details on the Group’s cash management strategy see Note 26 in the consolidated financial statements.

(d) Market risk
Currency risk
The Company engages in foreign currency transactions to a very limited extent.  No financial assets are held in foreign currencies.  Due to the 
Company’s lack of exposure to currency risk no sensitivity analysis has been performed.
Interest rate risk
The Company has no interest bearing financial liabilities, and its interest bearing financial assets consists of only cash and cash equivalents and a 
short-term investment.  These financial assets are exposed to interest rate risk as the Company holds money market deposits at floating interest 
rates.  The risk is managed by investing cash in a range of cash deposit accounts with UK banks split between fixed term deposits, notice accounts 
and money market funds.
At the balance sheet date the interest rate profile of the Company’s interest bearing financial instruments was:
  28 November
   2010
  £’000
Fixed rate instruments
Financial assets  70,000
Variable rate instruments
Financial assets  74,361
Sensitivity analysis
An increase of 100 basis points (1.0%) in interest rates at the balance sheet date will increase equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown 
below.  100 basis points was deemed an appropriate rate, considering the current short-term interest rate outlook.  This calculation assumes  
that the change occurred at the balance sheet date and had been applied to risk exposures existing at that date.  This analysis assumes that all 
other variables remain constant and considers the effect on financial instruments with variable interest rates.

12 Capital management
The Board’s objectives and policies for the Company are consistent with those of the Group.  Full details are provided in Note 26 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
13 Loss per share
Basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the loss attributable to equity holders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares and 
convertible preference shares in issue during the period adjusted to reflect the conversion of the ordinary shares and preference shares from 
Ocado Limited to Ocado Group plc on a 1:100 basis on 9 February 2010.  The loss for the period is equally attributable to the shareholders of 
ordinary shares and convertible preference shares.  For more information see Note 10.
Diluted loss per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares and convertible preference shares outstanding 
to assume conversion of all dilutive potential shares, adjusted to reflect the conversion of the ordinary shares and the convertible preference 
shares from Ocado  Limited to Ocado Group plc as mentioned above.  The Company has two categories of potentially dilutive shares, namely 
share options and shares held pursuant to the Group’s JSOS.
There was no difference in the weighted average number of shares used for the calculation of basic and diluted loss per share as the effect of all 
potentially dilutive shares outstanding was anti-dilutive.
Basic and diluted loss per share has been calculated on the following basis:

Ocado Holdings Limited is a 100% owned subsidiary of Ocado Group plc and the only directly held subsidiary.  It was incorporated in the UK  
on 5 February 2010 with registration number  07148670.
Ocado Limited is a 100% owned subsidiary of Ocado Holdings Limited.  It is incorporated in the UK with registration number  3875000.
Ocado Information T echnology Limited is a 100% owned subsidiary of Ocado Holdings Limited.  It was incorporated in Ireland on 19 January 
2010 with registration number 479792.  On 21 January 2010 Ocado Limited granted Ocado Information T echnology Limited a licence to use 
Ocado Limited’s intellectual property outside of the UK, and in consideration Ocado Information T echnology Limited issued a promissory note 
which was settled by the issue of 5,075,840 ordinary shares of 1 Euro each.  On 17 June 2010, Ocado Holdings Limited acquired the entire 
ordinary share capital of Ocado Information T echnology Limited from Ocado Limited.
Jalapeno Partners Limited is a 100% owned subsidiary of Ocado Limited.  It is incorporated in the UK with registration number 04204963.  It is a 
dormant company as defined by Section 1169 of the Companies Act.  The only balances in the accounts of Jalapeno Partners Limited are share 
capital of £1 and an intercompany debtor of £1.
On 9 February 2010, the Group, previously headed by Ocado Limited, underwent a reorganisation by virtue of which Ocado Limited’s 
shareholders in their entirety exchanged their shares for shares in Ocado Group plc, a newly formed company, which then became the ultimate 
parent company of the Group.  Notwithstanding the change in the legal parent of the Group, this transaction has been accounted for as a  
reverse acquisition under IFRS 3 (revised) “Business Combinations” and the consolidated financial statements are prepared on the basis of the 
new legal parent having been acquired by the existing Group.
On 15 October 2010 a dedicated cell (the “Ocado Cell”) was established in Atlas Insurance PCC Limited (the “Cell Company”) by the issue 
of non-participating redeemable preference shares to Ocado Holdings Limited.  The Cell Company is incorporated in the Republic of Malta 
with registration number  C 5601 and is authorised under Malta’s Insurance Business Act (1998) to carry on general insurance business and is 
constituted as a protected cell company under the Maltese Companies Act (Cell Companies Carrying on Business of Insurance) Regulations 
(2004).  On 20 October 2010 the Cell Company entered into an agreement with Ocado Holdings Limited to provide the Group with  
insurance facilities conducted through the Ocado Cell.  The Group has effective control over the financial and operating activities of the Ocado 
Cell and therefore consolidates the Ocado Cell in its financial statements in accordance with SIC 12 “Consolidation – Special Purpose Entities”.  
The Group uses the Ocado Cell to provide self-insurance for its vehicle fleet and public and product liability claims.  This strategy of self- 
insurance for elements of business risk is used by many large companies in order to reduce costs and exercise greater control of their insurance 
needs.  The risk of self-insuring is managed within the Group through stop-loss insurance being taken out with a third party to cover claims  
over £100,000 each and £3 million in the aggregate.  The provisions as at 28 November 2010 include a provision for insurance claims incurred 
but not reported of £115,000 (2009: £nil).

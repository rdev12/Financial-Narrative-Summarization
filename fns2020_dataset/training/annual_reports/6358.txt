Irene Cowden
Group Human Resources
Director
Irene Cowden is Human
Resources Director of Group 4
Securicor, having previously
been appointed to the
Securicor plc board in August
2002. She joined the Securicor
group in 1977 and held senior
management appointments
specialising in employee
relations, compensation and
benefits, and organisation
development. 07
We have a clear strategy to ensure that the organisation
derives maximum value from its people in pursuit of
the group’s vision and objectives. The strategy states
that “we will recruit and develop the best people in
the industry to help create an environment in which
they are able to develop their potential and feel
motivated to deliver excellent performance for our
customers and shareholders”.
As a global leader we believe that our people bring
to the business a depth of cultural diversity which is
unprecedented in the security industry. This level of
diversity is a great strength for Group 4 Securicor and
we are continually learning from each other and sharing
best practices across the world. With over 90% of our
employees working outside the UK, they face a range of
issues including differing phases of market development,
differing legislation and unique customer needs.
To ensure that our people are able to meet these
challenges wherever they operate in the world, we
adopt a performance management culture throughout
the organisation, supported by systems and processes
to ensure that our people remain close to their
customers, can make quick and sound decisions and
are fully accountable for their actions.
Our vision and business model demand exemplary
leadership with global frameworks which are
developed and applied to local markets. To ensure that
we continue to develop strong leaders throughout our
businesses, we have introduced a leadership programme
through which we can grow our in-house talent.
This programme provides an accelerated pathway for
those employees with high potential to develop their
leadership skills, thus enabling them to progress rapidly
to senior management positions.
The leadership programme has been designed using best
practice examples from global organisations, adapted to
address our unique needs. Each part of the programme
is designed around our business model and business
lines in ways that enable participants to gain real-time
experiences of the challenges in all areas of our business.
We recognise that having good leaders is only one
part of running a successful business; we know that we
need to ensure that all of our people feel committed
to delivering excellent customer service and feel proud
to work for the organisation. In order to ensure that
our front-line employees fully understand our vision
and values, we use a wide variety of channels to
communicate and consult with them including
newsletters, team briefings and intranets.
The wellbeing, physical security, pay and other
conditions of our staff lie at the heart of what we
believe in. As a global company, we work with over
60 unions and with staff representatives and
employees to ensure that we operate in the best
interests of our customers and employees. Indeed,
we have higher levels of union membership in our
companies throughout the world than the industry
norm and are proud of our productive relationships
with employees and their representatives. 08 > Group 4 Securicor > ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2004
Chairman’s Statement
The merger of Securicor and the security businesses
of Group 4 Falck was completed on 19 July 2004.
The proposed merger was first announced in February
2004 and it was completed within five months, a huge
tribute to the commitment and determination of those
within Securicor and Group 4 Falck who worked on the
transaction, and to the efficiency and professionalism of
the various teams of professional advisers. I thank them
all for their hard work.
This first set of published results of Group 4 Securicor
is unfortunately not straightforward, due to the merger
having taken place mid-year. In accounting terms, Group 4,
which was what remained after the Falck businesses
were demerged from Group 4 Falck at the same time
as the merger with Securicor, is treated as having
acquired Securicor, and thus the statutory results of
the group for 2004 include a full year’s trading of the
security businesses of Group 4 Falck but, in respect of
the Securicor businesses, only the trading from 20 July
(the first day the Group 4 Securicor plc shares were
listed) to 31 December 2004. As this would give an
incomplete picture of the trading in 2004 of all the
businesses comprised in the new group, we have
included on pages 43 and 44 unaudited pro forma
financial information. This shows what the results would
have looked like if the merger had been completed at
the beginning of the year and will thus act as a more
useful indicator of likely future performance.
Results
The figures I refer to in this section are taken from
the pro forma financial information for the reason
stated above.
Profit before interest, taxation, amortisation and
exceptional items was £218.9m, derived as to
£154.5m from manned security, £28.6m from security
systems, £59.6m from cash services and £2.4m from
discontinued operations, less head office costs of £26.2m.
The overall profit margin on sales from continuing
business was 5.7%. Organic turnover growth was 6.2%.
Dividend
The directors recommend a final dividend of 1.85p or
DKK 0.1981 per share, payable on 12 July 2005.
Board changes
It was stated at the time of the merger that I would
retire in September 2005 and that my successor as
chairman would be appointed on the recommendation
of the company’s Nomination Committee. It was
further announced that Nick Buckles would succeed
Lars Nørby Johansen as chief executive at the
appropriate time.
The board has determined that, with the businesses
performing well, integration on track and the new
management team working together successfully, Nick
Buckles should assume the chief executive role this
summer. It has therefore been agreed that Lars Nørby
Johansen will step down as chief executive and leave
the board after the annual general meeting on 30 June.
Lars was one of the main architects of Group 4
Securicor. I have, as chairman, found him a most inspiring
and visionary chief executive and it has been a privilege
to work with him. His creativity is outstanding and is
envied by many. He leaves the company in a healthy and
prosperous position and we wish him continued success
in whatever he decides to do in the future.
Colin Sharman, joint deputy chairman and senior
independent director, has already announced that he
too will step down from the board later this year.
He has a number of other high-profile directorships
and feels it is impossible to do adequate justice to
them all. He will be missed. I thank him warmly, in
particular for his help with the merger negotiations,
and we all wish him well for the future.
Given the changes referred to above, the board believes
that it would be beneficial for me to remain on the
board for longer than was originally envisaged and they
have asked me to stay, as chairman, until the annual
general meeting in June 2006. The board has agreed,
following a recommendation from the Nomination
Committee, that I should then be succeeded as chairman
by Alf Duch-Pedersen who is one of the two deputy
chairmen. Alf was a non-executive director of Group 4
Falck from 2000 until the merger and he is currently
chief executive of the Danish company, Danisco A/S,
a position from which he will retire in August 2006.
I am delighted that Grahame Gibson became an
executive director on 1 April 2005. Grahame joined
Group 4 in 1983, since when he has enjoyed a wide
range of senior management experience within the
security industry.
All the directors, except for Lars Nørby Johansen, are
required to stand for election at the annual general
meeting on 30 June 2005. Biographical details of the
directors are on page 29.
Sir David Gore-Booth, who had joined the Group 4
Falck board in 2000 and then came onto the Group 4
Securicor board, died in October 2004 after a long
illness. David was a colourful and forthright individual,
extremely knowledgeable, and a fine contributor to
the board.
Staff tributes
This group is all about people. Around the globe,
our employees are our ambassadors – I am extremely
proud of all of them, and grateful for their efforts.
Many of them frequently have to work at unsocial
hours, such is the nature of the security business.
To all of them, I extend my best wishes and sincerest
thanks for their friendship and support.
Future prospects
We have established a solid base for future
development and we expect continued good progress
in 2005.

A solid base Chief Executive’s Overview
There is no doubt that 2004 proved to be an interesting
and challenging year in which our abilities in a
number of key commercial areas were put to the test.
On 2 February 2004 we announced that Group 4 Falck A/S and Securicor plc
were in merger talks which would result in the creation of Group 4 Securicor.
Creating Group 4 Securicor 
During the period between the announcement and
completion of the merger, a vast amount of work
was undertaken.
> An integration office was established which enabled
us to plan the integration of the organisations in the
utmost detail without sharing sensitive customer data
> Synergy benefits resulting from the merger were
carefully identified, reviewed and refined through our
internal processes and an independent external audit
> Key positions within the organisation were defined
and individuals to take up those roles, throughout
the businesses and at board level, were identified
and agreed
> The merger detail was presented to the European
Commission and conditions for approval of the
transaction were agreed
> GSL, Group 4 Falck’s outsourcing business, was
divested
> Falck A/S, Group 4 Falck’s safety business, was
de-merged and listed separately on the Copenhagen
Stock Exchange
> The relevant shareholder approvals were obtained
to enable the transaction to be completed
> Extensive employee communications programmes
were established to ensure that staff were kept
informed during every stage of the process
> Group 4 Securicor was created
At the same time we continued to focus on the key
business issues to ensure that we entered into the
merger in the best possible condition.
Commitment to stakeholders
When Group 4 Securicor was established, there were a
number of key commitments made to our stakeholders:
The merger would create a global leader in the
provision of security services – our organisation
operates in more than 100 countries, a geographic
footprint which is unrivalled in our industry.
As a result of the transaction we would provide
consolidation in a number of key markets which would
enable us to deliver on our internal cost synergies.
By applying the Group 4 Falck security systems
expertise across the wider geographic footprint, we
would be better placed to provide integrated security
solutions in line with future demand.
By using the expertise of Securicor’s market-leading
cash services businesses across the wider group, we
would improve performance and drive growth as well
as make substantial cost savings.
Our combined platform across emerging markets
provided us with a unique market position through
which we would be able to support the growing
needs of our international customer base.
Delivery of our targeted £30 million of synergy benefits
would provide a significant margin improvement.
Facing up to our challenges
All of the preparation which took place during the
period after the initial merger announcement was
essential in enabling us to achieve the merger plan
and to focus on customer needs during a period
of significant change.
I am pleased to report that our customer retention
remained high during 2004 as we concentrated on
customer service and keeping our customers informed
throughout the process.
The workforce has remained highly motivated and we
have made good progress in building on our existing
strong relationships with employees and their
representatives.
We were pleased to have achieved the divestment of
the Securicor business in Luxembourg and the Group
4 Falck cash services business in Scotland, which was
one of the conditions of the merger approval from
the European Commission. We hope to conclude the
divestment of the Group 4 Dutch security business,
another European Commission requirement, during
the first half of 2005.
We exited 2004 slightly ahead of our integration and
synergy delivery plan and remain confident that we will
achieve the majority of our published synergy target of
£30 million per annum in 2005.
There remain a few geographic gaps in our global
footprint, namely Iberia, Latin America and Australia.
We aim to fill these gaps in the future through strategic,
value-enhancing acquisitions.
Overall we have performed strongly in 2004, despite
the potential distractions of the merger and the
integration of the businesses. There are still some
challenges ahead, but there are also some great
opportunities for us to continue to develop our global
position as a leading provider of security solutions.
Delivering on our promises
On 14 March 2005 we announced that the CEO
succession, which we had planned during the merger
process, would take place at the end of June when I
will step down from the Board of Group 4 Securicor
and Nick Buckles will take over as CEO.
When I look back, I am proud of what we have
achieved in a very short space of time through the
commitment and hard work of everyone in the
organisation. Looking to the future, I am certain that
Nick and the management team have the experience,
capability and determination to deliver on our
promises and we can look forward to the remainder
of 2005 and beyond with high expectations and the
confidence that the organisation will achieve its goals.
I’ve enjoyed my time in the security industry and
specifically as CEO of Group 4 Falck and then Group
4 Securicor. I know that the business is in safe hands
and wish my colleagues all the very best for the future.

Operating Review
The new group is large and spans many countries
around the world. This can provide challenges for developing the
business, but we believe the key to success is a combination of strong central
direction and good local management, with just the right level of processes and
controls to ensure that we have detailed plans in place and that business
performance against those plans is reviewed regularly.
Security Solutions
for the
future
It is our philosophy that, whilst the corporate centre
sets the overall strategy, targets and frameworks in
which the businesses operate, it is important for each
business to develop and apply those principles in a
way which is appropriate for the local market
conditions. Our managers are experts in understanding
local issues and adapting their plans to achieve the best
possible performance.
The fundamentals of our strategy start with our people.
Ensuring that we have the right people in the right job
may sound very basic, but in our industry it is essential.
They should be experts in their particular sector of
the security industry and their local markets and have
the leadership and management skills to drive the
business forward. They should also be incentivised
to focus on the aspects of the business which really
matter and drive growth and margin improvement.
The culture of the organisation has to be right, as the
way we do business differentiates us in the eyes of
customers and employees. We want customers to
be more than satisfied with the service we provide
and we aim to develop long-term mutually beneficial
partnerships with them. We also want employees to
feel proud to be part of the organisation and we do
everything we can to help drive this feeling throughout
the business units.
We develop detailed strategies and plans which
set clear goals and milestones to drive the business
towards its targets and form the basis for future
review. This also ensures that we assess the risks to
our business and have contingency plans in place to
mitigate those risks.
Processes are in place to support divisional initiatives
where they can be of benefit to a number of business
units – these cover areas such as security and
operational procedures, market segmentation and
pricing. Our divisional business line structure enables
us to develop and spread best practice throughout
the group and to learn from developments in
different markets.
We conduct regular reviews where we assess
operational, financial and personal performance
to ensure that the businesses objectives
are on track. They also enable us to take
appropriate action at the right time
should any issues arise.
With this balance of central direction
and review combined with local
expertise and entrepreneurship, we are
confident that the business will continue
to deliver on its targets to the benefit of
all its stakeholders. I am proud to be part
of the organisation and am excited about
what the future holds for the group.

Profit margins
In 2003 we achieved a pro forma
profit margin of 5.3% overall. The
synergies which will be achieved as
a result of the merger are expected
to increase profit margins by 0.8%
with a further 0.9% coming from
operational improvements, giving
an overall medium-term EBITA
margin target of 7%+.
Group 4 Securicor Targets
When Group 4 Securicor was created, we set some challenging but achievable medium-term targets in a
number of areas, including organic growth, profit margin and cost savings (synergies) associated with the
merger. We aim to achieve these targets within 2-3 years.
Organic growth
The organic growth target
represents a blended rate of
6% per year. 2004 growth was
6.2% due to some exceptional
growth in New Markets and
the US.

Profit margin
targets (before
group costs) can
also be further
broken down on
a business line
basis as follows:
Integration and synergies
Part of the rationale for bringing together Securicor
and the security businesses of Group 4 Falck was the
potential for synergies across the businesses. Following
a detailed review of the organisations and a substantial
audit process, we identified £30 million in cost savings
spread across the businesses, which would represent
a 0.8% improvement in group EBITA margin. These
targets were announced in June 2004.
Synergy targets
The majority of these savings were to be made at the corporate, regional and business unit head office level,
with the impact on operational staff being minimal. Integration of the organisations has gone very well to date,
with some significant milestones being achieved:
• New management structures were in place very quickly after the merger was completed
• The cultural integration of the two companies has been successful
• The new group headquarters opened in September 2004 in the UK
• The group financial systems consolidation was completed early in 2005
• The Copenhagen head office closed in February 2005
• Integration of the major business units has gone very well
• Customer and employee retention has remained high throughout the integration process
• “Business as usual” focus has continued in those businesses not integrating – representing 80% of the group
When the synergy targets were announced, we expected to
achieve the total benefit within three years after the merger
completion in July 2004, with the majority being achieved
within two years. The phasing for annualised savings is shown
in the chart opposite:
When we presented the 2004 preliminary results on 14 March
2005, we were pleased to announce that we were ahead of
our phasing plan for achieving the synergy targets and that we
expected to achieve the full £30 million run-rate, ahead of our
plan, by the end of 2005. The actual effect in the 2004 calendar
year was approximately £2.5 million and it is expected to be
£18 million in 2005.
Overall profit margin targets
Planned synergy timings The provision of manned security services to customers,
including governments, public authorities, commercial
companies and retailers. Services include traditional guarding and
reception duties, aviation security , event security , risk management, mobile patrol
and response services and justice services. The latter services include the custody
and rehabilitation of adult and juvenile prisoners, electronic tagging and monitoring
of offenders, prisoner escorting and immigration services.

The Wackenhut Corporation have been providing
security services to Bank of America since 1993 when
they won a tender process from a customer trying to
rationalise from contracting with 27 different security
suppliers. The contract has grown over time to become
Wackenhut’s single largest commercial contract,
employing over 2,400 full-time employees across
30 states.
Over the course of the contract Bank of America and
Wackenhut have, together, implemented several
pioneering initiatives designed to lower robbery rates.
One of these came from research which concluded that
having police officers or security guards inside a bank
only moved the risk of violence inside the building and
that it was better to have an armed, uniformed officer
stationed outside the bank branch. Wackenhut
employees now serve as this highly visual deterrent to
would-be robbers, coping with the extremes of weather
that come from being stationed outside.
Another innovation is the use of Wackenhut bank
protection officers (BPOs), armed officers who are
highly qualified, trained in the use of weapons and who
wear a distinctive uniform. The BPO programme and
its deployment was the “brainchild” of Bank of America
and Wackenhut. Law enforcement interviews with
apprehended bank robbers have confirmed BPO
appearance and placement as reasons why Bank of
America locations were not targeted.
The fact that Wackenhut remains the sole provider of
security services to Bank of America after 12 years can
be attributed to the excellent service provided by the
dedicated Wackenhut team and the strong partnership
that exists between the two organisations.

Security at Schiphol Airport, Amsterdam, is very strictly controlled as at any major international airport.
Schiphol deploys 2,400 private security operatives, the majority of these (1,800) being supplied by Falck
Airport Security, part of Group 4 Securicor.
Head of Security at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, Ron Louwerse comments:“As a private company,
Schiphol has a statutory role to fulfil and hires in private security companies to implement this, under the
supervision of the Royal Military Police.The Dutch Ministry of Justice sets the rules, based largely on the
EU Regulation of 2002”.
Falck Airport Security performs the checks on passengers and crew in two of the three departure halls,
in addition to fulfilling a number of specialist security tasks. Profile agents interview the passengers on
high-risk flights and inspect their travel documents.‘Apollo agents’ also provide security for the aircraft
in the case of high-risk flights. In addition, Falck Airport Security inspects all registered baggage.
Group 4 Securicor is active at many airports throughout the world and is constantly updating its
knowledge of the latest technologies and developments in the area of airport security. Ron Louwerse
states:“This is one of the reasons why we decided to call in Falck Airport Security.Their international
dimension enables the firm to contribute knowledge and know-how.”
Ron Louwerse continues:“I think we can be satisfied with the way we provide security at Schiphol with
Falck Airport Security, ICTS-NAS and the Royal Military Police.This does not mean, however, that we do
not continuously strive to improve security still further.”

Market positions
Across the manned security division, we have some
strong market positions in key regions.
Europe
In the UK, our largest manned security business in
Europe and the second largest within the group, we
achieved organic turnover growth approaching 4% in
2004 which was very strong given that management
were also focusing on integration of the two UK
security businesses. The integration of the operational
systems was completed on 7 March 2005 which was
a major milestone in the integration programme.
At the same time, this business also had to plan for
the implementation of new security industry regulation
which would involve extra training and licencing of staff
across the company. These licences are being awarded
throughout 2005 and will be compulsory for UK
security staff in 2006.
Customer retention was strong in the UK security
business throughout 2004 at approximately 88%.
There was growth in existing contracts and some new
business wins which helped to generate a small margin
improvement over 2003.
The business is not expected to grow substantially
in 2005 as we continue to manage the integration
process and implement the licencing and training
requirements of the UK Security Industry Authority.
We had planned to integrate the two security
businesses in The Netherlands but the European
Group 4 Securicor trading in 2004
Commission approval for the overall merger required
divestment of the Group 4 Falck security company.
Separating this business proved to be a complex
exercise for the Dutch management team towards the
end of 2004.
The Dutch market remained difficult throughout 2004,
but we did see some improvements towards the end
of the year and into the early part of 2005. Turnover
in 2004 was slightly below the performance in the
previous year, but profit margins were maintained.
In our other key businesses in Europe, the
performance of the security business in Germany
improved, with greater focus on price increasing in
a market in which this has historically been difficult.
Good direct cost and overhead control, coupled with
implementation of the integration programme, meant
that our planned cost savings began to come through
towards the end of the year.
In France we had very strong double digit profit
growth, some very good contract wins and improved
margins overall.
For reporting purposes, the UK Justice Services
business forms part of the European manned security
division. In this business we achieved a very strong
profit performance in the final year of the first national
electronic monitoring contract.

We have also commenced a new immigration contract
which will be implemented fully by May 2005 and we
were successful in winning three of the five new areas
for electronic tagging and monitoring of offenders –
a new UK contract commencing in April 2005 which
expands our UK market share to 60%.
Elsewhere in Europe, the performance of the security
business in Sweden was disappointing. We have made
a number of management changes and have started
to see the first signs of an improved performance.
Our businesses in Ireland, Luxembourg, Greece and
the Baltic States delivered double digit growth and in
Belgium there was improved growth and an improved
profit performance.
North America
In North America, Wackenhut performed very
strongly in 2004 with organic growth of around 11%
in a very competitive market. Profit margins were
maintained overall in line with 2003, despite the
company taking on a large amount of new business,
which generated some start-up costs.
Employment and healthcare-related costs continued to
be high but manageable in 2004. In 2005, we will focus
on achieving our price increase targets to cover these
growing costs. Growth in Wackenhut is expected to
continue at above the rate of GDP , but we do not
expect it to be as high as the levels achieved in 2004.
In Cognisa, turnover has reduced overall, but we have
seen good growth in the transportation segment. The
business continues to operate at a slight loss and we
expect it to remain at that level in 2005.
In Canada, a large aviation security contract was lost
during the year, so overall organic growth was negative.
There has been good growth in the non-aviation
sector and the business is performing well overall.
New Markets
In New Markets (those outside North America and
Europe) we achieved our target of 10% organic
growth. The largest manned security business in the
region is in South Africa, where we had a number
of issues in 2004 including the loss of some large
contracts and the defection of some of the senior
management. There was also a higher than expected
statutory wage award and a delay in commencing the
integration programme. Most of these issues have now
been addressed and the performance of this business
is expected to improve.
Elsewhere in New Markets there was good growth in
India, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates and Kazakhstan
and throughout most of the small businesses in
developing markets.
In Asia, despite some deflationary economies within
the region, we achieved good growth and margin
improvements.

Group 4 Securicor trading in 2004
Overall in security systems, profit margins grew by
2.2% in 2004 to 8.2%. Organic growth overall was
7.8% with new markets growing very strongly at
almost 100%.
The business model for the security systems division,
which we have introduced to all key markets, focuses
on higher growth and more profitable sectors.
In Europe, we achieved good growth in Norway,
Germany and The Netherlands and particularly in the
UK, where the export of complex access control
systems to the US was particularly strong.
The provision of a range of security systems,
including the design, installation, maintenance and monitoring of
intruder alarms, access control, CCTV and other security systems.
Two of our largest Scandinavian businesses in Sweden
and Denmark showed little growth, but Denmark still
had very strong profitability in the year.
Overall the margin progression in the security systems
division can be attributed to a focus on contract
profitability and introduction of key performance and
productivity measures. It was also affected positively by
a restructuring project which commenced in 2003.

In cash services, organic growth was 6.5% in 2004 which was
driven by an exceptionally good performance in New Markets.
Overall, margins improved from 7.6% to 7.8%.
Europe
In the European cash services businesses the overall margin
reduced slightly compared to 2003, due mainly to a poor
performance in Germany which was highlighted during the year.
The UK business continues to be our flagship cash services
company and performed strongly. One of the key aspects of
the second-half performance was a very strong improvement in
customer service levels. Integration of the cash centres and the
cash services businesses was completed in the year and the
single entity is working well.
In partnership with Alliance & Leicester Commercial Bank, we
commenced an end to end cash solution for Abbey, a major UK
financial institution, and are also bidding to win further business
in the financial institution outsourcing area.
Germany remains loss-making and growth has been flat. We
have a number of major turnaround initiatives underway which,
in conjunction with the integration of the two businesses there,
should enable the business to break even in 2005.
The Netherlands performed strongly with double digit margins
and good organic growth. This business started 2005 with a
major contract win with ABN Amro.
Other businesses in Europe which have grown well are France
and Sweden, but attack losses in both of these countries were
a key issue in the final quarter.

begin servicing their entire ATM estate, consisting of 1,400 machines,
within a month.
In order to ensure the business was able to implement this major increase

Financial Review
Basis of accounting
On 19 July 2004, the security businesses of the former
Group 4 Falck A/S (“Group 4”) combined with
Securicor plc (“Securicor”) to become Group 4
Securicor plc. As explained in note 1 to the statement
of accounting policies on page 51, the combination
between Group 4 and Group 4 Securicor plc is
accounted for as a merger and the combination
between Group 4 Securicor plc and Securicor as an
acquisition. The reported statutory results of the group
for the year ended 31 December 2004 therefore
include the full year of trading of Group 4 and the
trading of Securicor from the date of acquisition. The
2003 comparative numbers are those for Group 4,
translated from Danish Kroner into Sterling.
Also presented, on pages 43 and 44, is pro forma
financial information, showing the combined turnover,
EBITA and operating cash flow for the businesses now
comprising the group for the full year to 31 December
2004, together with comparative figures for 2003.
This pro forma financial information, which is unaudited,
has been compiled to provide guidance for investors
and analysts.
Except where otherwise stated, the analysis in this
financial review is of the statutory results for the year
to and the balance sheet at 31 December 2004.
Operating Results
The overall results are commented upon by the
Chairman in his statement and operational trading is
discussed in the Operating Review on pages 12 to 21.
Exceptional items
Exceptional charges in the year amounted to £183.6m.
They comprised five elements: (1) a loss of £57.9m in
respect of adjustments to the carrying value of assets
arising from the harmonisation of accounting estimates
and a balance sheet review across the newly combined
group, (2) a goodwill impairment charge of £51.2m,
(3) a provision of £34.5m for the anticipated loss on the
disposal of security operations in The Netherlands as
required by the European Commission, (4) restructuring
costs of £37.2m following the combination of Group 4
and Securicor, and (5) business disposal costs of £2.8m.
The total cash cost of these exceptional items will be
£36m, of which £20m has already been incurred.
Acquisitions and goodwill
The major acquisition in the year, as explained in the
basis of accounting above, was that of Securicor, the
cost of which was £771.5m, comprising the issue of
shares to the value of £710.4m and associated costs
of £61.1m, and which generated goodwill of £703.1m.
Other acquisitions, none of which were individually
significant, cost £40.6m in total and generated goodwill
of £43.6m. The contribution made by acquisitions to
the turnover and profit of the group during the year
is shown in note 1 on pages 54 to 56.
The charge for goodwill amortisation in the financial
statements for the year to 31 December 2004
amounted to £49.8m. Goodwill included in the balance
sheet as an intangible asset at 31 December 2004
amounted to £1,117.9m.
Disposals and discontinued operations
Disposals in the year, none of which were individually
significant, gave rise to an exceptional loss of £2.8m.
Group 4’s manned security operations in The
Netherlands (with the exception of aviation security
activities) are in the process of disposal and its cash
services operations in Scotland were disposed of in
March 2005. These disposals are required by the
European Commission as a condition for their
approval of the combination between Group 4 and
Securicor. During the disposal process the group only
has restricted control over these operations and in
consequence their results have not been consolidated
from 20 July 2004. The contribution to the turnover
and profit of the group from discontinued operations
as shown in note 1 on pages 54 to 56 includes the
results of these businesses up to 19 July 2004.
The European Commission also required the disposal
of Securicor’s operations in Luxembourg, which was
completed in March 2005, and in consequence its
results have not been consolidated.
The contribution to turnover and profit from
discontinued operations shown in the pro forma
financial information for the year includes not only
the results from the businesses included within
discontinued operations in the statutory figures
but also the results from Securicor’s operations in
Luxembourg up to 19 July 2004 and the results
of other Securicor operations exited prior to the
combination with Group 4.
Due to the merger that took place during the reporting
period, our accounts are complex with both pro forma and statutory numbers.
However they are brought together in the closing balance sheet. 23
“The directors recommend a final dividend of
1.85p per share. To former shareholders of Group
4 Falck A/S this represents approximately four
times the Group 4 Falck A/S dividend paid for
the year to 31 December 2003. For former
shareholders of Securicor plc the final
dividend, taken with the interim dividend
of 0.86p per share, makes a total dividend
of 2.71p per share for the year ended
31 December 2004, an increase of 12.9%
over the dividend for the year to
30 September 2003.”
Continued 
growth

Accounting standards
There are no new accounting standards applicable to
the year to 31 December 2004. FRS 17 Retirement
benefits is not fully mandatory until 2005. The
disclosures required prior to full implementation are
made in note 6 on pages 58 to 60 and pension fund
valuation is discussed later in this review. Goodwill
arising on acquisitions is capitalised and amortised over
its useful economic life which is not expected to
exceed 20 years. Provision is made for any impairment.
IFRS
As a group operating across the world we welcome
moves towards the harmonisation of accounting
standards, including the adoption of International
Financial Reporting Standards by the European Union.
We are required to report in accordance with these
standards in 2005 and this reporting will include the
restatement of 2004 results, subject to certain
specified exceptions. We will re-present the 2004
results in accordance with IFRS in June. Both Group 4
and Securicor have had IFRS conversion projects in
place since 2003 and we have identified the following
as the significant areas of difference between our
results as reported under current UK GAAP and as
they will be reported in accordance with IFRS.
Business combinations
In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations,
goodwill arising from acquisitions will cease to be
subject to an annual amortisation charge. It will instead
be held on the balance sheet indefinitely, but subject to
an annual impairment test of its recoverability based
upon the cash flows of the business streams to which
it relates. However, it is possible that certain intangible
assets other than goodwill will be identified upon
acquisition and subject to an annual amortisation
charge. In the business-to-business service industry
sector in which we operate the proportion of the
intangibles on acquisitions identified as items other
than goodwill is generally likely to be insignificant.
Pensions
In accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits, pension
funding balances will be recognised on the balance
sheet. For 2005 this is also the case under UK GAAP
with the full implementation of FRS 17 Retirement
benefits. The funding deficits currently disclosed in
accordance with the transitional rules of FRS 17 may be
slightly higher under the asset valuation rules of IAS 19.
Share-based payments
In accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, a
charge to the profit and loss account of the fair value
at grant date of items such as share awards and share
options is made over the vesting period to which the
items relate. This will have limited impact on the results
of the group, as share awards, which are cash costs,
are chargeable to the profit and loss account under
current UK GAAP; all Group 4 Falck A/S share options
were cashed out at the time of the combination with
Securicor and most Securicor options became
exercisable at the same time.
Joint ventures and associates
In accordance with IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures,
joint ventures will be proportionately consolidated
rather than shown within a single net investment line
in the balance sheet. This will impact the balance sheet
disclosure of our investment in special purpose entities
made in respect of PFI projects in the UK justice
market. In accordance with IAS 28 Investments in
Associates, our share of the profit from associates
will be shown as a single post-tax item rather than
analysed across profit and loss account categories.
Dividends
In accordance with IAS 1 Presentation of Financial
Statements, dividends will be neither a charge to the
profit and loss account nor accrued. They will be shown
as a movement within reserves when they are declared.
Financial instruments
IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and
Measurement requires that derivatives be carried on
the balance sheet and marked to market, save those
that are designated at inception as fulfilling a specified
hedging function and can be demonstrated to have
been effective in that function. This could result in
greater profit and loss account volatility. It is, however,
anticipated that most of the group’s long-term hedging
activities will qualify for hedge accounting, under which
the derivative contract is accounted for so as to
match the treatment of the hedged item. The group
will be adopting the optional exemption from the
requirement to apply IAS 39 retrospectively in the
restatement of the profit and loss account for the year
to 31 December 2004.
The application of IFRS changes neither the dynamics
of our businesses nor the group’s cash flows. In addition,
there will not be a significant impact upon reported
operating results.
Financial Review continued… 25
On 24 July 2004 the investors in the former Group 4
Falck’s US$400m private placement lending
arrangement were repaid and were also paid a make
whole payment of $15.2m. In addition, related swap
contracts were terminated at a cost of $4m.
At 31 December 2004 net debt of £595.8m
represented a gearing of 65%. The group has
substantial capacity to finance growth, which will be
enhanced by future cash generation from the group’s
focus upon security activities.
Interest rates
The group’s investments and borrowings, including
those negotiated after 31 December 2004, are at
variable rates of interest linked to LIBOR. The group’s
interest risk policy requires treasury to fix short term
net debt of between 40% and 80% and medium term
net debt of between 20% and 40%. There were no
swaps outstanding at 31 December 2004.
Foreign currency
The group has many overseas subsidiaries and
associates denominated in various different currencies.
Treasury policy is to manage significant translation
risks in respect of net operating assets and income
denominated in foreign currencies. The methods
adopted are to use borrowings denominated in 
foreign currency supplemented by forward contracts.
No forward contracts were outstanding at 
31 December 2004.
Dividends
The directors recommend a final dividend of 1.85p per
share. To former shareholders of Group 4 Falck A/S this
represents approximately four times the Group 4 Falck
A/S dividend paid for the year to 31 December 2003.
For former shareholders of Securicor plc the final
dividend, taken with the interim dividend of 0.86p per
share, makes a total dividend of 2.71p per share for the
year ended 31 December 2004, an increase of 12.9%
over the dividend for the year to 30 September 2003.
In proposing this final dividend, the board considered
both the appropriate level of dividend cover and the
future strategy and prospective earnings of the group.
The company intends to follow a progressive dividend
policy, with future dividends increasing broadly in line
with earnings. Dividend cover in the current year is 5.2
(based on normalised earnings per share) but this is
not comparable with future intentions as it excludes
both an interim dividend and the results of Securicor
prior to 20 July 2004.
Taxation
The taxation charge of £49.3m provided upon profit
before exceptional items and goodwill represents a tax
rate of 32.6%. Tax relief has been provided against
exceptional items and goodwill amortisation totalling
£36.5m. Potential tax assets amounting to £52.2m have
not been recognised as their utilisation is uncertain.
Cashflow
Cash generation in the year to 31 December 2004
was good after a strong prior year. Net cash flow from
operating activities was £157.5m (2003: £140.5m), and
free cash flow after capital expenditure was £64.8m
(2003: £69.5m).
Net cash outflow from acquisitions and disposals
amounted to £39.9m (2003: inflow £43.7m).
Net cash outflow in the year was £73.2m and the
increase in net debt, after allowing for finance leases,
borrowings acquired on acquisition of subsidiaries and
translation adjustments, was £213.4m.
Financing and treasury activities
The group’s treasury function is responsible for
ensuring the availability of cost-effective finance for
the group’s operating activities and for managing the
group’s financial risk arising from volatility in currency
and interest rates and counterparty credit. Treasury is
not a profit centre and is not permitted to speculate
in financial instruments. The board sets the treasury
department’s policies and treasury is subject to the
controls appropriate to the risks it manages.
New treasury policies have been adopted and the
hedging activity described below under interest rates
and foreign currency is being implemented during 2005.
At the time of the merger all existing committed
facilities were replaced and all material hedging
positions were closed out.
Financing
On 1 June 2004 Group 4 Securicor entered into a
£1,000m multicurrency revolving credit facility with 14
participating banks. This facility consists of a five year
committed revolving facility of £800m and a 364-day
committed revolving facility of £200m with the ability
to convert (at the company’s option) into a term loan
for a further 12 months of £200m. The group has
other available facilities of £265m.
Corporate governance
The group’s policies regarding risk management and
corporate governance are set out in the Report of
the Directors.
Pensions
The group’s major defined benefit pension schemes
are those operated in the UK, including the scheme
acquired with Securicor. The schemes are closed to all
but a small number of new entrants. The full triennial
actuarial assessment of the Group 4 schemes was
carried out as at 31 March 2002 and of the Securicor
scheme at 5 April 2003. These have been updated to
31 December 2004 and the assessment revealed the
scheme’s funding levels in respect of past service under
the different regulatory measures to be as follows:
SSAP 24 Pension costs
There was a net surplus of £2m (£3m after tax).
FRS 17 Retirement benefits
This valuation indicated a shortfall of £193m
(£135m after tax).
Although the value of the assets in the funds increased
by £64m since the reported 2003 figures this was
counteracted by a reduction in bond rates, which are
used to discount liabilities for FRS 17 purposes.We
believe that, over the very long term in which pension
liabilities become payable, improved investment returns
should eliminate the deficit in the schemes in respect
of past service liabilities. However, in recognition of
the currently reported deficits, an additional cash
contribution of £15m before tax is being made to the
schemes in the year commencing 1 January 2005.
Going concern
The directors are confident that, after making enquiries
and on the basis of current financial projections and
available facilities, they have a reasonable expectation
that the group has adequate resources to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable future. For
this reason they continue to adopt the going concern
basis in preparing the financial statements.

Chief Financial Officer

Corporate Social Responsibility
Group 4 Securicor is committed to being 
a socially responsible corporate citizen.
Health and Safety
The group has a published Health & Safety policy
which acts as a minimum standard for all subsidiary
companies throughout the world. Subsidiary operating
companies must either adopt the group standard as it
is or use it as the basis for their own company policy,
ensuring at the same time that they comply with local
legislation. In adopting these standards, we seek to
create a workplace and work systems which enable
staff to feel safe and secure and where management is
seen to take a proactive interest in staff welfare.
Nick Buckles is the director responsible for reporting
to the board on health and safety matters, assisted by
the Group HR Director, Irene Cowden. Responsibility
is devolved and delegated through divisional presidents
to the managing director of each operating company,
who in turn must make one of their company’s
directors responsible for health and safety. Each
company appoints a suitably-qualified person to
develop the company’s own policies and procedures
and to undertake management and employee training.
Risk assessment processes must be developed and a
procedure put in place for monitoring compliance
with policies and procedures. Accident reporting and
analysis will be undertaken at both company and 
group level.
Ethics
The group has a Business Ethics Policy which clarifies
the way the group interacts with customers, suppliers,
employees, government bodies, investors and the
world at large and includes guidance on, amongst
other matters, business practice and entertainment,
equal opportunities, use of the internet and political
contributions. The group statement is treated as a
minimum standard.
Group 4 Securicor is a member of Transparency
International, a non profit-making, independent, non-
governmental organisation, dedicated to increasing
government accountability and to curbing both
national and international corruption.
Employment
The group employs over 360,000 employees in over
100 different countries. Our success depends on the
commitment and competence of our employees and
our human resource strategies are therefore aimed
at ensuring that employees are trained to be totally
competent in their roles and have the opportunity
to develop to their full potential. Formal career and
succession management processes help support the
movement of managers within and between the
various group businesses as part of their career paths.
They also enable us to share knowledge and expertise
across the businesses.
We believe it is important for employees to be treated
fairly and with dignity and respect. Such treatment is
the basis for an environment which engenders team
spirit and a commitment to the group which in turn
helps to maintain good staff retention levels.
Communication and consultation with employees takes
place on a wide range of issues. There are a wide
variety of channels for communication including
newsletters, team briefings and intranets, as well as
formal representational relationships with staff
associations, trades unions and works councils.
Our policy of equal opportunity ensures that decisions
relating to the recruitment, development, promotion
and training of individual employees are based solely
on job requirements. 27
Community involvement
Group 4 Securicor has selected the protection,
support, education and development of children as a
specific area of focus for its charitable and community
involvement in 2005 and beyond. With its involvement
in so many different countries, the group has entered
into a corporate partnership with Save the Children.
A substantial sum has been put aside to assist Save the
Children with their many projects around the world.
At the same time, the group has committed to
providing financial support to other projects which
benefit needy and underprivileged children. Through
this arrangement, employees will receive funding to assist
with activities which help children in their local area.
The group has a large number of employees in four
of the countries most directly affected by the 2004
tsunami disaster, namely India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and
Thailand. Two of our employees in Aceh, Indonesia, are
missing, presumed dead. We made a donation of
£100,000 to Save the Children, with a request that the
benefit be shared between the four countries named.
In addition, we have set up a scheme under which we
are matching, pound for pound, tsunami-related
donations made to Save the Children by our staff.
Charitable T rust
Prior to the merger, Securicor had a charitable trust
which made numerous modest financial donations to
charities supporting a wide range of causes. In 2005,
Group 4 Securicor will focus on the support
of child-related projects around the world and the
charitable trust has therefore been discontinued.
Trailwalker
Trailwalker, first held in 1981 in Hong Kong, is a gruelling challenge over
100km of demanding terrain. All funds raised by the event support Gurkha education
projects in Nepal and the work of Oxfam in over 80 countries. Securicor Hong Kong has taken part in
the event every year since 1999, raising over HK$560,000 in sponsorship.
Wackenhut Golf Event
In the United States, Wackenhut has held an annual golf event for the last
eight years to benefit local and national US charities, all of which work to
support needy or deprived children. Over this period, Wackenhut has donated some
US$600,000, raised through sponsorship for the golf. The 2004 event was attended by 140 golfers and
the monies raised were donated to The Boys and Girls Club, Junior Achievement,The Victory Junction
Gang,The Miami Transplant Foundation,Tremors Foundation and the Hospice of Palm Beach.
Magic Cents
In 2004 Group 4 Belgium sponsored the Magic Cents initiative organised
by Child Planet. The company collected over one million cardboard boxes, which had been
distributed to a chain of supermarkets and post offices and filled with coins by children, and delivered
them free of charge to the National Bank of Belgium. The money raised helps finance projects which aim
to improve the lives of children staying in hospital.
Group 4 Securicor companies around the world give direct
support to various community projects local to them, three
examples of which are shown below. 28 > Group 4 Securicor > ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2004

Report of the Directors
For the year ended 31 December 2004
The directors have pleasure in presenting their Annual Report together with the audited financial statements of Group 4 Securicor plc and the consolidated financial
statements of that company and its subsidiaries, associated undertakings and joint ventures (“the group”) for the year ended 31 December 2004.
Merger of Securicor plc and the security businesses of Group 4 Falck A/S
On 24 February 2004, Securicor plc and Group 4 Falck A/S (“Group 4 Falck”) announced that they had agreed terms upon which Securicor and the security
businesses of Group 4 Falck would merge. The implementation of the merger involved establishing a new holding company named Group 4 Securicor plc.
Group 4 Securicor plc was formed on 11 December 2003 as a private limited company under the name Precis (2395) Limited which was changed to Group 4
Securicor Limited on 19 February 2004. It was re-registered as a public company on 14 May 2004. As a result of a Scheme of Arrangement of Securicor plc which
became effective on 19 July 2004, Group 4 Securicor plc became the ultimate holding company of the Securicor plc group of companies and, on the same date and
as the result of a recommended offer for its shares, acquired Group 4 A/S, the holding company of the former security businesses of Group 4 Falck.
Under Financial Reporting Standard 6 (FRS 6), Group 4 A/S was treated as the acquiror of Group 4 Securicor plc and accordingly was combined with Group 4
Securicor plc using merger accounting. This combined entity then accounted for its combination with Securicor plc using the acquisition method of accounting.
The statutory results for Group 4 Securicor plc for the year to 31 December 2004 therefore include the full year of trading of the security businesses of Group 4
Falck and the trading of the businesses of Securicor plc from 20 July 2004 to 31 December 2004. However, the directors consider that it would be of assistance to
shareholders to show pro forma combined financial information for the full year, in addition to that required by statute. Certain additional information is therefore
included in this report and in the Remuneration Report on pages 37 to 42.
Group 4 Securicor plc has its primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and a secondary listing on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange.
1 Principal activities of the group
Group 4 Securicor plc is a parent company with subsidiaries, associated undertakings and joint ventures.
The principal activities of the group comprise the provision of manned security services (including justice services), security systems and the management and
transportation of cash and valuables.
2 Group results
The consolidated result for the year and the appropriation thereof are shown in the consolidated profit and loss account on page 47.
Details of major business activities during the year, future developments and prospects of the group are contained on pages 2 to 27.
3 Dividends
The directors propose the following net dividend for the year – Final dividend of 1.85p (DKK 0.1981) per share payable on 12 July 2005.
Shareholders on the Danish VP register will receive their dividends in Danish Kroner. Shareholders who hold their shares through CREST or in certificated form
will receive their dividends in sterling unless they elect, by so indicating on their proxy card, to receive Danish Kroner.
4 Business acquisitions, disposals and developments
In July 2004 Group 4 Securicor plc became the ultimate holding company of Securicor plc by virtue of a Scheme of Arrangement of Securicor plc.
In September 2004 Group 4 Technology acquired HISEC, a Copenhagen-based designer and manufacturer of intruder alarm equipment and system components.
In January 2005 Group 4 Securicor plc initiated a compulsory redemption process to acquire, for cash, the remaining Group 4 A/S shares which it did not

5 Capital
The authorised and issued share capital of Group 4 Securicor plc at 31 December 2004 is set out on page 74 (note 21 to the consolidated financial statements).
Resolution 16 set out in the Notice of Meeting on page 90 is an ordinary resolution granting the directors power to enable them to allot shares up to an
aggregate nominal value of £105,000,000, whilst Resolution 17 is a special resolution granting the directors power to enable them to allot shares for cash (a) in

Resolution 18 is a special resolution seeking authority to make market purchases of the company’s shares. The maximum number of shares which could be
purchased under this authority is 126,400,000, being approximately 10% of the number of shares currently in issue (1.264,926,253). The directors have no
present intention of utilising this authority but believe it appropriate to obtain this flexibility in accordance with common business practice.
Information concerning the company’s shares held under option is set out on page 75 (note 21 to the consolidated financial statements).
6 Research and development expenditure
Research in connection with the development of new services and products and the improvement of those currently provided by the group is carried out
continuously. Research and development expenditure written off to profit and loss during the year amounted to £4.1m (2003: £0.3m).
7 Payment of suppliers
It is the company’s and the group’s policy to pay suppliers in accordance with the payment terms negotiated with them. Thus, prompt payment is normally made
to those suppliers meeting their obligations. The company and the group do not follow any formal code or standard on payment practice.
At 31 December 2004 the trade creditors of Group 4 Securicor plc, the parent company, represented 33 days of annual purchases.
At 31 December 2004 the consolidated trade creditors of the group represented 37.5 days (2003: 36.6 days) of annual purchases.
8 Employee involvement
The group keeps employees informed about current activities, progress and general matters of interest by various methods including:
(a) staff meetings, newsletters, bulletins and similar items produced by various individual companies;
(b) the group intranet.
The group’s policy and practice is to encourage the recruitment and subsequent training, career development and promotion of disabled persons according to
their aptitudes and abilities, and the retention and retraining of employees who become disabled.
9 Political and charitable contributions
The group remains committed to support of charities, the community, job creation and training. Charitable contributions by the group during the year amounted
to £328,000 (2003: £138,000).
There were no political contributions requiring disclosure under the Companies Act.
10 Substantial holdings
The directors have been notified of the following substantial shareholdings at 20 April 2005 in the ordinary capital of Group 4 Securicor plc:
Skagen Limited (beneficial ownership of Jørgen Philip-Sørensen) 171,939,961 (13.6%)

11 Auditors
A resolution to appoint KPMG, chartered accountants, as auditor to the company and for their remuneration to be fixed by the directors will be submitted to
the Annual General Meeting. The financial statements on pages 47 to 86 have been audited by Baker Tilly, who previously acted as auditor to Securicor plc and
who were appointed by the directors to carry out the company’s first audit jointly with PricewaterhouseCoopers. However, PricewaterhouseCoopers resigned
as joint auditors in January 2005. 33
Report of the Directors (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2004
12 Directors
The directors, biographical details of whom are contained on page 29, were appointed on 19 May 2004, with the exception of Trevor Dighton who was
appointed on 6 May 2004 and Grahame Gibson who was appointed on 1 April 2005.

In accordance with the Articles of Association of Group 4 Securicor plc, all the directors will retire at the Annual General Meeting. With the exception of Lars
Nørby Johansen they will, being eligible, offer themselves for election. The board believes that all the non-executive directors possess experience and expertise
relevant to the company’s operations, that they are all committed to the success of the company and that they should, therefore, all be elected at the Annual
General Meeting.
The contracts of service of Messrs Buckles and Dighton are terminable at 12 months’ notice.The contract of service of Grahame Gibson expires on 1 April 2007
but will, with effect from 1 April 2006, be replaced by a contract terminable at 12 months’ notice. None of the non-executive directors has a contract of service.

Corporate Governance Report
The board’s report on the company’s corporate governance performance for the year ended 31 December 2004 is based on the Combined Code on Corporate
Governance published in July 2003 (“the Combined Code”).
The Combined Code requires companies to disclose how they apply the code’s principles, and to confirm that they comply with the code’s provisions or, where they
do not comply, to provide an explanation.
(a) Application of Combined Code principles
The board comprises the non-executive chairman (Jørgen Philip-Sørensen), two non-executive deputy chairmen (Alf Duch-Pedersen and Lord Sharman), five
other non-executive directors, the chief executive, the deputy chief executive, the chief financial officer and one other executive director. The board considers all
the non-executive directors, with the exception of Mr Philip Sørensen, to be independent. The senior independent director is Lord Sharman.
All continuing directors are subject to election by shareholders at the next Annual General Meeting following their appointment and will submit themselves for
re-election at least every three years.
Membership of the three board committees is as follows:
Audit Committee Remuneration Committee Nomination Committee
Lord Sharman (chairman) Alf Duch-Pedersen (chairman) Jørgen Philip-Sørensen (chairman)
Waldemar Schmidt Lord Condon Lord Condon
Malcolm Williamson Thorleif Krarup Alf Duch-Pedersen
Bo Lerenius Lord Sharman
The terms of reference of each of the above committees are available on the company’s website.
It is intended that the chairmen of the three committees will be available to answer questions at the Annual General Meeting.
The board met on four occasions during the year ended 31 December 2004. There were three board meetings and one strategy day, at which presentations on
the group’s principal businesses were made to the board by senior executives and at which the group’s acquisition and growth strategy was discussed. All
directors were present at all meetings except for Thorleif Krarup who was absent for one board meeting and for the strategy day. At each meeting, the board
receives reports from the chief executive, the chief financial officer and the company secretary and an investor relations report which includes a summary of
comments received from major shareholders since the previous board meeting. In addition, the board receives monthly management accounts accompanied by
an update report from the chief executive.
There is a detailed schedule of matters reserved to the board which are set out under five separate categories: (1) Board and management; (2) Operations; (3)
Finance; (4) Business control; and (5) Secretarial. By way of example, board approval is required for (a) acquisitions, disposals, investments and capital projects
exceeding £4m; (b) any changes to the group’s business strategy, and (c) the annual trading, capital expenditure and cashflow budgets.
In the year under review, the Audit Committee met once and the Remuneration Committee met three times. There were no meetings of the Nomination
Committee, although it has met since the beginning of the current year. All members attended each of the meetings except for Thorleif Krarup and Bo Lerenius
who were absent for one of the meetings of the Remuneration Committee.
The board has appointed an external consultancy to conduct an evaluation of the performance of the board as a whole. Each of the directors has completed a
questionnaire seeking views on the current performance of the board and on ways in which its performance can be improved. The results are being collated by
the consultancy and will then be discussed with the chairman before being shared with the board. Later in the year, it is intended that the evaluation will be
extended to cover the performance of individual board members and of the three board committees. The board considers that, as the board and its committees
have only been functioning since July 2004, it is premature to carry out a complete evaluation process at this time.
The executive directors hold regular meetings with individual institutional shareholders to discuss the group’s strategy and financial performance, although price
sensitive information is never divulged at these meetings. It is intended that all the directors will attend the Annual General Meeting and will be available to
answer questions from shareholders.
  35
Corporate Governance Report (continued)
The Nomination Committee has appointed an external search consultancy to identify suitable candidates for non-executive positions on the board.
Audit Committee meetings are also attended by representatives of the group’s auditors, the chief financial officer, the head of internal audit and the company
secretary. The committee considers the group’s annual and interim financial statements and any questions raised by the auditors on the financial statements and
financial systems. It also considers, amongst other matters, risk management procedures and internal controls and it requires the auditors, who perform certain
non-audit work for the company, to provide a Statement of Independence to the committee at the year-end, setting out the auditors’ internal procedures for
avoiding conflicts. The Audit Committee also meets with the group’s auditors in the absence of management. Lord Sharman is the member of the committee
with recent and relevant financial experience.
(b) Compliance with provisions of Combined Code
Save as set out below, the company complied throughout the period from 20 July 2004 (the date its shares were admitted to listing on the London Stock
Exchange) until 31 December 2004 with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code.
Non-compliance with Combined Code
(i) Provision A3.1 of the Combined Code provides that the chairman should be independent and that, in assessing independence, major shareholdings should be
taken into consideration. Jørgen Philip-Sørensen, a member of the founding family of Group 4 and currently the company’s largest shareholder, is also non-
executive chairman. He became chairman of Group 4 Falck in 2000, prior to which he had been chairman of Group 4 Securitas (International) BV since 1964.
He currently holds approximately 13.6% of the company’s shares. The board believes that Mr Philip-Sørensen’s presence on the board is of benefit to the
company given his vast experience of putting businesses together and his extensive knowledge of the security industry. Mr Philip-Sørensen will retire in June 2006
when, following a recommendation from the Nomination Committee, he will be succeeded as chairman by Alf Duch-Pedersen, currently joint deputy chairman.
(ii) Provision B1.6 of the Combined Code recommends that notice or contract periods should be set at 12 months or less. The service contract of Lars Nørby
Johansen, the company’s chief executive, entitles him to a period of notice from the company of 24 months for a two year transitional period with effect
from 19 July 2004, after which his employment may be terminated on 12 months’ notice. The board has agreed with Mr Nørby Johansen that he will step
down as chief executive and leave the board after the Annual General Meeting on 30 June 2005.
(c) Risk Management and Internal Control
The directors acknowledge their responsibility for the group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. The system is designed to manage rather
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The risks associated with the group’s activities are reviewed regularly by the board, which considers major risks and evaluates their impact on the group. Policies
and procedures, which are reviewed and monitored by the head of internal audit, are in place to deal with any matters which may be considered by the board
to present significant exposure.
Prior to the merger, the Group 4 Falck businesses did not have a risk management process which accorded with the internal control guidance for directors on
the Combined Code. From the date of the merger, the formal risk management process previously used within the Securicor businesses is being introduced
across all the group businesses.
The key features of this process are:
> A common risk management framework is used to provide a profile of those risks which may have an impact on the achievement of business objectives.
> Each significant risk is documented, showing an overview of the risk, how the risk is managed, and any improvement actions. The risk profiles ensure that
internal audit reviews of the adequacy, application and effectiveness of risk management and internal controls are targeted on the key risks.
> Risk review exercises are undertaken at least twice a year and updated risk profiles are prepared. Similar exercises are undertaken as part of the integration
process for all major acquisitions. 36 > Group 4 Securicor > ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2004
Corporate Governance Report (continued)
The process, which is reviewed regularly by the board and accords with the internal control guidance for directors on the Combined Code, is carried out under
the supervision of divisional risk management committees, which meet quarterly and report to the group risk management committee. This latter committee,
which also meets quarterly and which reports to the Audit Committee, includes both the chief executive and the chief financial officer. Divisional and group risk
profiles are reviewed and updated at each meeting.
Company risk review exercises will be implemented throughout the group during 2005, with the results being reviewed by the divisional and group risk
management committees.
The Audit Committee undertakes a high level review of risk management and internal control. Both the divisional risk management committees and the group
risk management committee receive internal audit reports and regular reports on risks. They monitor the actions taken to reduce risks.
The internal control system includes clearly defined reporting lines and authorisation procedures, a comprehensive budgeting and monthly reporting system, and
written policies and procedures. In addition to a wide range of internal audit reports, senior management also receive assurance from other sources including
security inspections, third party reviews, company financial control reviews, external audit reports, summaries of whistleblowing activity, and risk and control 
self-assessment returns.
The board has reviewed the group’s risk management and internal control system for the year to 31 December 2004 by considering reports from both the
Audit Committee and the group risk management committee and has taken account of events since 31 December 2004.

Remuneration Report
This report provides details of the remuneration of each of the directors and sets out the company’s remuneration policies for the current financial year and, subject
to ongoing review, for subsequent financial years. The report will be put to the Annual General Meeting for approval by the shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee met three times during the period under review. The members of the committee, all of whom are considered to be independent,
are Alf Duch Pedersen (Chairman), Lord Condon,Thorleif Krarup and Bo Lerenius.The committee is responsible for setting all aspects of the remuneration of the
chairman, the executive directors and certain other of the most senior executives in the company. It is also responsible for the operation of the company’s share
plans. Its terms of reference are available on the company’s website.
Advice was provided to the committee by New Bridge Street Consultants LLP , compensation consultants, who were appointed by the committee. The terms of their
appointment are available on the company’s website. New Bridge Street Consultants did not provide any other services to the company during the period under review.
Lars Nørby Johansen, chief executive, and Nick Buckles, deputy chief executive, provided guidance to the committee on remuneration packages for senior executives
within the group. Further guidance was received from the group’s HR director, Irene Cowden. The committee’s remit includes the chairman, the executive directors,
the four other members of the group’s executive committee and the company secretary.
Remuneration policy
The policy for the remuneration of the executive directors and the executive management team aims to achieve:
> the ability to attract, retain and motivate high calibre executives;
> a strong link between executive reward and the group’s performance;
> alignment of the interests of the executives and the shareholders;
> provision of incentive arrangements which focus on both annual and longer-term performance.
A significant proportion of total remuneration is related to performance, through participation in both short-term and long-term incentive schemes. For base target
performance, the performance-related element amounts to around 40% of the total package. For stretch target performance, the performance-related element
amounts to around 60% of the total package. The committee believes that the current balance is appropriate, although it is kept under review.
Elements of remuneration
(a) Base salary and benefits
The salaries of the executive directors and the other members of the executive committee were set at 19 July 2004, on completion of the merger, and will be
reviewed on 1 January each year, save that the first review will not take place until 1 January 2006. Interim salary reviews may be carried out following significant
changes in responsibility. The salaries take account of an extensive benchmarking exercise which was undertaken at the time of the merger and also reflect
responsibility, individual performance, internal relativities and salary and other market information supplied by New Bridge Street Consultants. The overall
objective is to achieve salary levels which provide a market competitive base salary, with the opportunity to earn above median remuneration through the
company’s incentive schemes. Benefits include pension arrangements and the provision of company cars, health insurance and life assurance.
(b) Performance-related bonus schemes
The executive directors participated in a performance-related bonus scheme for the six months to 31 December 2004 (which broadly reflected the period from
the merger in July 2004), payments under which were dependent on the attainment of defined PBITA profit targets of the group for that period, adjusted for the
effect of any exceptional items and discontinued operations and using constant exchange rates. The committee’s original intention was to use a range of
performance measures but, after further consideration, it concluded that PBITA best reflected the various key drivers of business success within the group. For
achievement of profits slightly below the budgeted profit target, a bonus payment of 15% of base salary at 31 December 2004 was due. For achievement of the
budgeted target, a bonus payment of 25% of base salary at 31 December 2004 was due, increasing on a straight-line basis up to a bonus payment of 50% of
base salary for achievement of a stretch profit target. On an annualised basis, these bonus amounts were thus equivalent to, respectively, 30%, 50% and 100% of
base salary. The amounts of the bonuses paid to the executive directors under this scheme are set out in the table on page 39. The bonuses were paid in cash
for amounts up to 25% of base salary (50% on an annualised basis) and in the form of deferred shares for the balance. Any deferred shares will normally only be
transferred to the executive director if he remains in employment (otherwise than where he leaves in certain specified circumstances) for a period of three
years from the date of the award of the shares. Given the successful financial results, a maximum bonus was earned in respect of the period.
For the current year, the executive directors participate in an annual performance-related bonus scheme, payments under which are dependent on the attainment
of defined PBTA profit targets of the group, adjusted for the effect of any exceptional items and discontinued operations and using constant exchange rates.
For achievement of profits slightly below the budgeted profit target, a bonus payment of 25% of base salary at 31 December 2005 will be due. For achievement
of the budgeted target, a bonus payment of 50% of base salary at 31 December 2005 will be due, increasing on a straight-line basis up to a bonus payment of
100% of salary for achievement of a stretch profit target. Any such bonus up to the value of 50% of the executive director’s salary will be paid in cash with any
excess balance being awarded in the form of deferred shares. Any deferred shares will normally only be transferred to the executive director if he remains in
employment (otherwise than where he leaves in certain specified circumstances) for a period of three years from the date of the award of the shares.
The PBITA and PBTA budgeted targets used for the above schemes are the same as the company’s budgeted PBITA and PBTA for the corresponding period. 38 > Group 4 Securicor > ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2004
Remuneration Report (continued)
(c) Synergy bonus
For an initial transitional period running from 1 July 2004 until 31 December 2005 (and as explained in the Group 4 Securicor Listing Particulars), the executive
directors participate in an additional bonus scheme, payment under which is dependent upon achievement of specified merger synergy savings. For the six
months to 31 December 2004, achievement of a specified target amount of savings entitled the executive directors to an award of deferred shares in the
company equal in value to 12.5% of base salary, rising to 25% for achievement of a specified stretch target. The synergy savings achieved by the end of
December 2004 were ahead of initial expectations and a maximum payout was earned for that period. For the 12 months to 31 December 2005, achievement
of a specified target amount of savings will entitle the executive directors to an award of deferred shares in the company equal in value to 25% of base salary,
rising to 50% for achievement of a specified stretch target. Any deferred shares will normally only be transferred to the executive director if he remains in
employment (otherwise than where he leaves in certain specified circumstances) for a period of three years from the date of the award of the shares.
Bonus payments do not form part of salary for pension purposes.
(d) Performance Share Plan (Long-term incentive plan)
The Performance Share Plan was introduced in July 2004. Under the plan, the executive directors and certain other senior executives receive conditional
allocations of the company’s shares which are released to them only on the achievement of demanding performance targets.
The maximum annual award of shares under the plan is one times base salary, save that, in exceptional circumstances, the Remuneration Committee may
determine that an award of up to one and a half times salary may be made. The extent to which allocations of shares under the plan vest will be determined, as
to half of the award, by the company’s normalised earnings per share growth relative to the RPI over a single three-year period and, as to the second half of the
award, by the company’s ranking by reference to TSR (total shareholder return, being share price growth plus dividends paid) using the FTSE-100 constituent
companies as at the date of the award as a comparator group, again over a single three-year period. There is no provision for retesting.
The following targets apply to the first half of awards granted in the year under review, with the three-year EPS (earnings per share) period ending on
31 December 2006:
Average annual growth in EPS Proportion of allocation vesting
RPI + 10% per annum (30% over three years) 25%
RPI + 20% per annum (60% over three years) 100%
RPI + 10-20% per annum Pro rata between 25% and 100%
Less than RPI + 10% per annum Nil
The following targets apply to the second half of each such award:
Ranking of the company against the FTSE-100
constituent companies by reference to TSR Proportion of allocation vesting
Upper quartile 100%
Between median and upper quartile Pro rata between 25% and 100%
Median 25%
Below median Nil
In addition, there will only be a transfer of shares if (a) the growth in EPS of the company has exceeded the growth in RPI by 10% over a performance period of
three financial years, and (b) the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the company’s TSR performance is reflective of the company’s underlying performance.
The performance conditions will continue to apply (pro rata to the time the allocation has been held) if an employee leaves the group, or in the event of a
change of control or restructuring of the company.
The company’s current policy is to use market purchased shares to satisfy Performance Share Plan awards.
The committee believes that a combination of earnings per share growth and total shareholder return is the most appropriate performance measure for the
Performance Share Plan, as it provides a transparent method of assessing the company’s performance. The company calculates whether the EPS performance
targets have been achieved by reference to the company’s audited accounts which provide an accessible and objective measure of the company’s earnings per
share, whilst TSR comparative data will be supplied by New Bridge Street Consultants. The committee will also ensure that the EPS targets are measured on a
consistent basis and are not artificially impacted, either to the benefit or to the detriment of participants, by the change in accounting standards to International
Financial Reporting Standards.
The committee also believes that continued shareholding by senior executives will strengthen the alignment of their interests with shareholders’ interests.
Accordingly, executive directors of the company will be expected to retain shares to the value of 30% of the after-tax gains made on the vesting of performance
share plan awards until they have built up a shareholding equivalent to one times base salary.

Remuneration Report (continued)
Fees, service contracts and letters of appointment
The chairman’s annual fee is £160,000. The annual fee for the non-executive directors, which is set by the chairman and the executive directors, is £40,000, with a
further £40,000 for the role of deputy chairman, £10,000 for the chairmanship of each of the Audit and Remuneration Committees and £10,000 for the role of
senior independent director. No other fees are paid for membership of the board committees. These fees are subject to periodic review which takes into account
comparative fee levels in other groups of a similar size and the anticipated time commitment for the non-executive directors.
The service contracts of those who served as executive directors during the period are dated as follows:
Nick Buckles 2 June 2004
Trevor Dighton 2 June 2004
Lars Nørby Johansen 3 June 2004
The contracts of Messrs Buckles and Dighton are terminable by the company on 12 months’ notice, whilst the contract of Mr Nørby Johansen was terminable by the
company on 24 months’ notice until 19 July 2006 after which it would have been terminable on 12 months’ notice.The contracts are terminable by the executive directors
on twelve months’ notice.There are no liquidated damages provisions for compensation payable upon early termination, but the company reserves the right to pay salary in
lieu of notice. It is the group’s policy that, save for a limited period in respect of Mr Nørby Johansen, it should be able to terminate service contracts of executive directors
on no more than 12 months’ notice and that payments for termination of contract are restricted to the value of salary and other contractual entitlements for the notice
period.The chairman and the other non-executive directors do not have service contracts but letters of appointment which provide for initial three-year terms which
began on 19 May 2004. All directors are required to stand for re-election by the shareholders at least once every three years.
It is the company’s policy that executive directors may each hold not more than one external non-executive appointment and may retain any associated fees, save that 
Mr Nørby Johansen was permitted to retain the three non-executive appointments which he held prior to the merger. None of the other executive directors currently holds
an external non-executive appointment. Mr Nørby Johansen received aggregate fees of DKK 585,000 (£53,342) for the year ended 31 December 2004 in respect of his three
non-executive appointments.
Performance Graph
The performance graph below shows the total cumulative shareholder return of the company from its first day of listing, 20 July 2004, until 31 December 2004, based on
a hypothetical shareholding worth £100, compared with the return achieved by the FTSE-100 constituent companies over the same period.The directors believe this to
be a more appropriate form of broad equity market index against which to base a comparison than the support services sector, where there are no companies directly
comparable to Group 4 Securicor.The FTSE-100 index has also been selected for comparative total shareholder return purposes in the company’s performance share plan.

Each of Nick Buckles and Trevor Dighton, who were previously employed within the Securicor plc group, has a deemed interest in 206,332 ordinary shares held in
the Securicor Employee Benefit Trust.
Directors’ Pension Entitlements
Nick Buckles and Trevor Dighton participate in the non-contributory category of the group’s defined benefit pension scheme. The normal retirement age for the category
is 60 and members achieve the maximum of 2/3rds of their final pensionable salary at normal retirement age after 20 years’ service (10 years’ service for those who
joined the company prior to 17 March 1987). The pension of 2/3rds accrues uniformly between the date of joining the scheme and normal retirement age. An actuarial
reduction is applied to pensions payable before normal retirement age and an increase is applied where retirement is deferred beyond normal retirement age.
For death before retirement a capital sum equal to four times pensionable salary is payable, together with a spouse’s pension of 50% of the member’s prospective
pension at the age of 60 plus a return of any contributions paid prior to the admission to the non-contributory category.
For death in retirement, a spouse’s pension of 50% of the member’s pre-commutation pension is payable.
Post retirement pension increases are payable at the rate of 5% per annum in respect of pension earned up to 31 December 1994 and in line with the increase in
the Retail Prices Index subject to a maximum of 5% in respect of pension earned after that date.
The committee is reviewing pension arrangements in light of the UK tax changes due to come into force in April 2006. It is intended that any measures taken will
not increase the company’s current pension liabilities as a result of the tax changes.The company does not intend to compensate individuals for changes in personal
tax liabilities arising from the legislation.
Pension entitlements and corresponding transfer values increased as follows during the 12 months ended 31 December 2004 (all figures are in £’000s).

Notes
(i) Pension accruals shown are the amounts which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of the year.
(ii) Transfer values have been calculated in accordance with version 8.1 of guidance note GN11 issued by the actuarial profession.
(iii) The value of net increase (4) represents the incremental value to the director of his or her service during the year, calculated on the assumption that service
terminated at the year-end. It is based on the increase in accrued pension (2).
(iv) The change in transfer value (5) includes the effect of fluctuations in such value due to factors beyond the control of the company and the directors, such as
stock market movements.
(v) Mr Dighton is currently capped for pension purposes and therefore only accrues pension on benefits up to the statutory cap. Securicor plc previously agreed to
pay Mr Dighton a salary supplement equal to 30% of any salary in excess of the cap.This payment was suspended from 6 April 2003, as it may be more tax
efficient if such amounts are paid into the pension scheme after April 2006, although the structuring of such payment would not be determined until the
company’s ongoing pensions review has been concluded.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The following statement, which should be read in conjunction with the report of the auditor set out on page 46, is made with a view to distinguishing for
shareholders the respective responsibilities of the directors and of the auditor in relation to the financial statements.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and
of the group and of the profit or loss of the group for that year. In preparing those financial statements, the directors are required to:
> select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
> make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
> state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;
> prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company and the group will continue in business for
the foreseeable future.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy the financial position of the company and of the group
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the
assets of the group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are also responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Group 4 Securicor plc website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
  46 > Group 4 Securicor > ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2004
Independent auditor’s report to the members of Group 4 Securicor plc
We have audited the financial statements on pages 47 to 86. We have also audited the disclosures required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985
contained in the directors’ Remuneration Report (“the auditable part”).
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken
so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work,
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
United Kingdom Accounting Standards are set out in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the auditable part of the directors’ Remuneration Report in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory
requirements, and United Kingdom Auditing Standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the auditable part of the
directors’ Remuneration Report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the directors’
report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and transactions with the company and other members of
the group is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Report reflects the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 Combined Code specified for our
review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not.We are not required to consider whether the board’s statements on
internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. This other information
comprises only the directors’ report, the unaudited part of the directors’ Remuneration Report, the Chairman’s Statement, the Financial Review, the Corporate
Governance Report, the Operating Review, the Chief Executive’s Overview, the Combined unaudited pro forma financial information and the Summary financial
information in Danish Kroner. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the
financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test
basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the auditable part of the directors’ Remuneration Report. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies
are appropriate to the company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient

Statement of accounting policies
1 Basis of accounting
As a result of a Scheme of Arrangement of Securicor plc, which became effective on 19 July 2004, Group 4 Securicor plc became the ultimate holding company
of the Securicor plc group of companies and, on the same date, and as a result of a recommended offer for its shares, acquired Group 4 A/S, the holding
company of the former security businesses of Group 4 Falck A/S. In accordance with the provisions of Financial Reporting Standard 6: Acquisitions and mergers
and, on the basis that the transaction has been effected by using a new parent, Group 4 A/S was identified as the acquiror, and the combination with Group 4
Securicor plc has therefore been accounted for using merger accounting principles. The acquisition of Securicor plc by Group 4 A/S has been accounted for under
the acquisition method of accounting. The results for Group 4 Securicor plc for the year to 31 December 2004 therefore include the full year of trading of the
security businesses of the former Group 4 Falck A/S and the trading of the businesses of Securicor plc for the period from 20 July 2004 to 31 December 2004.
The comparative results for the year to 31 December 2003 are those of the security businesses of the former Group 4 Falck A/S. These were reported in the
Listing Particulars for Group 4 Securicor plc of 4 June 2004 in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and UK accounting standards applicable as at that date.
The comparative results were stated in the Listing Particulars in Danish Kroner and have been translated into the financial statements into £ sterling using the
rates as reported in the Listing Particulars. The report on the Listing Particulars made by the reporting accountants of the security businesses of the former
Group 4 Falck A/S businesses was unqualified.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the UK. A summary of the group’s principal accounting
policies is given below. These accounting policies have been adopted by the enlarged group. The directors have reviewed the impact of these accounting policies
on the financial statements of the group, as previously reported, and are of the opinion that none of the adjustments arising are of such significance as to give
rise to the need for a prior year adjustment. The directors have also reviewed the accounting estimates of the previous years and have harmonised these in the
preparation of the financial statements. Due to its size, the financial effect of these revisions is disclosed as an exceptional item, within operating profit.
2 Accounting convention
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention.
3 Foreign exchange translation
Foreign currency transactions arising from normal trading activities are translated at the average rate applicable to the accounting period. Assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies have been translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet dates. Foreign exchange adjustments,
including those arising on consolidation and on borrowings arranged to finance overseas investments, have been transferred to reserves as disclosed in note 22
to the consolidated financial statements. All other exchange adjustments are taken to the profit and loss account.
4 Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial results of Group 4 Securicor plc, its subsidiary undertakings and the group’s share of the results
and net assets of its associates and joint ventures for the year ended 31 December 2004.
Associated undertakings and joint ventures
Associated undertakings are entities in which a member of the group holds a long-term minority equity interest, but over which it is in a position to exert a
significant influence. The financial statements include the relevant proportion of the results of associated undertakings based on the last audited financial
statements and subsequent management accounts where year ends are not coterminous.
In the consolidated balance sheet the investments in associated undertakings are shown as the group’s share of underlying net assets under the heading
“Investment in associated undertakings”.
Joint ventures are entities in which a member of the group holds a long-term interest and shares control under a contractual agreement. The financial statements
include the group’s share of results based on the last audited financial statements and subsequent management accounts where year ends are not coterminous.
In the consolidated balance sheet the share of gross assets and gross liabilities is shown under the heading “Net investment in joint ventures”. 52 > Group 4 Securicor > ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2004
Statement of accounting policies (continued)
4 Basis of consolidation (continued)
Dominant influence
For those associated undertakings and joint ventures where the group exercises dominant influence by virtue of a common control contract the accounting
treatment follows that of subsidiary undertakings.
Quasi-subsidiaries
Entities which do not meet the legal definition of a subsidiary, but in which the group has 100% of the economic interest and exposure to substantially all of the
risks and rewards of ownership, are treated as quasi-subsidiaries in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 5 : Reporting the substance of transactions.
Accordingly, the accounting treatment of such entities follows that of subsidiary undertakings.
5 Accounting for acquisitions and disposals
The results of businesses acquired or disposed of are consolidated from or to the effective dates of acquisition or disposal. On the acquisition of subsidiary
undertakings or businesses, the acquisition cost is allocated against the fair value of net assets acquired, after adjustments to bring accounting policies into line
with those of the group.
6 Group turnover
Turnover represents sales, excluding value added tax and sales tax by group companies to external customers. Turnover in the manned security and cash services
products and in security systems services is recognised in the period in which the service is provided. Turnover is recognised on security systems installations
upon completion in respect of product sales and in accordance with the percentage of completion method in respect of bespoke systems. According to this
method, revenue, expenses and income are accounted for in the period in which the service is related.
7 Research and development expenditure
Research expenditure is written off in the year in which it is incurred. Development expenditure represents expenditure incurred in establishing new services
and products of the group. Such expenditure is capitalised to the extent that it meets criteria defined in Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 13:
Accounting for research and development. In all other circumstances the expenditure is written off in the year in which it is incurred. Capitalised development
expenditure is amortised over the period during which the expenditure is revenue-producing up to a maximum of ten years. The directors review the capitalised
development expenditure on an ongoing basis and, where appropriate, provide for any impairment in value.
8 Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost net of depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets other than
freehold or long leasehold land. Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of fixed assets to their estimated residual values by equal annual instalments over
their expected economic life as follows:
Freehold and long leasehold buildings up to 2%
Short leaseholds (under 50 years) over the life of the lease
Equipment 10% - 33.33%
Motor vehicles 10% - 33.33%
9 Stocks
Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost represents expenditure incurred in the ordinary course of business to bring stock to its
present condition and location and includes appropriate overheads. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be
incurred to completion and disposal. Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items where appropriate.
10 Current asset investments
Current asset investments comprise investments in securities and investments in subsidiary undertakings excluded from consolidation and in the process of
disposal. Listed securities are stated at the lower of cost and their net realisable value. A distinction is made in their presentation between those which fall within
the definition of “Liquid resources” given in Financial Reporting Standard 1: Cash flow statements and those which do not.
  53
Statement of accounting policies (continued)
11 Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using tax rates and laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 19: Deferred tax in full on timing differences between the recognition of gains and
losses in the financial statements and their recognition in tax computations, except that a net deferred tax asset is recognised only when it can be regarded as
more likely than not that it will be recovered. Provision is made for deferred tax that would arise upon the remittance of earnings from overseas subsidiaries
only to the extent that dividends have been accrued as receivable. Deferred tax is provided at current rates and is not discounted. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are offset where they relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority and arise in the same taxable entity or group.
12 Goodwill and amortisation
Goodwill, being the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value attributed to the net tangible assets at acquisition, is capitalised and amortised over its
useful economic life, which is expected to be twenty years. Provision is made for any impairment.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions made on or before 30 September 1998 was charged directly to reserves. The profit or loss on disposal or closure of a business
includes any attributable goodwill previously charged to reserves.
13 Provisions
Provisions are made when an obligation exists for a future liability in respect of a past event and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated.
The costs of meeting lease requirements on unoccupied properties are provided for at a discounted rate. Interest is calculated at an applicable interest rate and
charged to the profit and loss account in external interest payable. Restructuring provisions are made for the costs of a business reorganisation where the plans
are sufficiently detailed and where the appropriate communication to those affected has been undertaken at the balance sheet date.
Expenditure incurred in the year is charged to the relevant provision.
14 Leases
Assets held under finance leases are included as tangible fixed assets at their capital value and depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful
economic life. The capital element of future rentals is included within creditors and finance charges are allocated to accounting periods over the period of the lease.
Except for unoccupied properties (see note 13 above), annual rentals payable or receivable under operating leases are charged or credited to the profit and loss
account as incurred and future rental obligations are disclosed in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements.
15 Pensions
The group operates various funded pension schemes that are established in accordance with local conditions and practices within the countries concerned.
The principal defined benefit schemes are located in the UK. The regular cost of providing benefits is charged to operating profit over the service lives of the
members of the schemes on the basis of a constant percentage of pensionable pay. Variations from the regular cost arising from periodic actuarial valuations of
the schemes are allocated to operating profit over the expected remaining service lives of the members.
The principal schemes in use for new employees are defined contribution schemes.
The group has adopted the interim disclosure requirements of Financial Reporting Standard 17: Retirement benefits as shown in note 6 to the consolidated
financial statements.
16 Financial instruments
The financial instruments utilised by the group are interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts. These instruments are held to manage the interest rate
exposure of borrowings and currency exposures arising from operational transactions. Interest differentials arising from derivatives are recognised by adjusting
net interest payable. Gains or losses on forward contracts taken out to hedge certain transactions are recognised in the profit and loss account at the same time
as the transactions to which they relate.
17 Share awards
The estimated cost of share awards is spread evenly over the vesting period. 54 > Group 4 Securicor > ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2004

6. Pension arrangements
The group operates various funded pension schemes which are established in accordance with local conditions and practices within the countries concerned.
The majority of schemes are of a defined contribution structure, including the contracted-in defined contribution schemes which are the main schemes for new
UK employees. In The Netherlands, employees are members of an industry-wide defined benefit scheme, but as it is not possible to separately identify the
group’s share of the assets and liabilities of the scheme it is accounted for as a defined contribution scheme. Wackenhut Services, Inc. (“WSI”) is the administrator
of several defined benefit plans in the United States. WSI is responsible for making periodic cost-reimbursable deposits to the various defined benefit plans as
determined by independent actuaries. In each instance, the US Department of Energy (“DOE”) acknowledged within the contract entered between the DOE
and WSI its responsibility for all unfunded pension and benefit liabilities. Therefore, these plans are accounted for as defined contribution schemes. The group
operates defined benefit schemes in a number of countries but the only schemes of significance to the group are in the UK. Contributions made to defined
contribution schemes and to defined benefit schemes other than in the UK totalled £42.8m (2003: £39.5m).
In the UK, the membership of the Group 4 pension scheme is about 5,000. The membership of the Securicor scheme, responsibility for which the group
assumed on 20 July 2004 with the acquisition of Securicor plc, is about 21,000. The assets of both UK defined benefit schemes are held in separate trustee-
administered funds. The pension costs are assessed on the advice of qualified independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The cost recognised
in the profit and loss account in respect of UK defined benefit schemes amounted to £4.5m (2003: £2.7m), compared to contributions made of £4.2m (2003:
£1.9m). Regular actuarial assessments of the schemes are carried out, the latest being at 31 March 2002 in respect of the scheme demerged from the former
Group 4 Falck A/S and at 5 April 2003 in respect of the Securicor scheme. Both schemes were certified by an independent actuary as meeting the Minimum
Funding Requirement solvency level, in that the market value of assets exceeded the assessment of the schemes’ liabilities on a current funding level basis. Both
valuations have been updated to 31 December 2004. At that date the market value of the schemes’ assets was £845.8m. The most significant actuarial
assumptions used in the calculation of liabilities were that the long-term composite rates of return on investments would be 2.3% above the risk-free return,
2.3% to 3.3% above the rate of annual salary increases and 4.3% above the rate of pension increase. The assets comprise 100% of the schemes’ liabilities on
actuarial assumptions which take account of future service and earnings increases.
Variances arising on the actuarial valuation of the defined benefit schemes are reviewed regularly and, in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting
Practice 24 (SSAP 24): Accounting for pension costs, recognised in the profit and loss account over the average remaining service lives of the schemes’ members.
A provision of £4.5m (2003: £4.2m) is included in the balance sheet in respect of additional SSAP 24 charges. An additional cash contribution of £15m before
tax has been made in the year commencing 1 January 2005, with no profit and loss account impact. The contribution rates in respect of future service benefits
are currently at an average of 11% of pensionable earnings in the Group 4 scheme and 14% in the Securicor scheme.
Financial Reporting Standard 17 (FRS 17): Retirement benefits was issued by the Accounting Standards Board in November 2000 but is not fully mandatory until
the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2005. Prior to this, transitional arrangements require the disclosure of certain items by way of note.

The market value of assets in the UK defined benefit schemes at 31 December 2004 and the expected rates of return are as follows:

Related deferred tax asset 57.8 14.2 14.4
Net pension liability (135.0) (33.0) (33.4)
The analysis of the movement in the scheme deficits during the year calculated in accordance with FRS 17 is as follows:
2004 2003
£m £m
Deficit in Group 4 scheme at 1 January 2004 (47.2) (47.8)
Opening adjustment in respect of Global Solutions Limited demerger (6.9) –
Deficit in Securicor scheme at 20 July 2004 (127.0) –
Current service cost (8.4) (4.3)
Contributions 6.6 3.8
Expected return on scheme assets 33.9 5.4
Interest cost on scheme liabilities (35.1) (7.0)
Actuarial (loss)/gain (8.7) 2.7
Deficit at 31 December 2004 (192.8) (47.2)
FRS 17 specifies that pension liabilities should be discounted at an appropriate high quality corporate bond rate. The directors consider that it is appropriate to
apply the AA corporate bond rate which most closely approximates to the timescale of the liability profile and the asset portfolio of the schemes and have
therefore used such a rate, being 5.9%, at 31 December 2004. The effect of a 0.1% movement in the discount rate is to alter reported liabilities by
approximately £14m.
The Group 4 pension scheme also included the employees of Global Solutions Limited, which was one of the businesses demerged from the security businesses
of the former Group 4 Falck A/S on 19 July 2004. The pension disclosures are presented as if that demerger had always been effective. An adjustment of £6.9m
has been made to the 1 January 2004 position as reported in the Listing Particulars on 4 June 2004 in respect of the effect of the demerger.
The UK defined benefit schemes are largely closed to new members. Under the projected unit method of actuarial valuation prescribed by FRS 17 the current
service cost will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
If the pension schemes deficit calculated as above in accordance with FRS 17 had been recognised in the financial statements, the group’s net assets and profit
and loss account reserve would have been disclosed as follows:
2004 2003

Factors that may impact the group’s tax charges in the future include:
1. No deferred tax has been provided in respect of the remittance of earnings from overseas subsidiaries except to the extent that dividends have been
accrued as receivable.
2. Tax losses to the value of £52.2m have not been recognised as deferred tax assets as their utilisation is uncertain and/or long-term.

In the opinion of the directors the earnings per share figure of most use to shareholders is the normalised one. This figure better allows the analysis of trends
over time and the comparison of different businesses. The adjustments made in this calculation are to:
(a) Remove the impact of goodwill amortisation. This charge does not aid comparability as it only applies to goodwill arising on acquisitions rather than
internally-generated goodwill and it only applies to acquisitions after 1998.
(b) Remove discontinued operations, so that the measure is on a broadly consistent basis from year to year.
(c) Remove the impact of one-off exceptional items that are not comparable from year to year.

Details of fair value adjustments are as follows:
i) The adjustment to tangible fixed assets is to reflect the market value of properties and the fair value in use of other assets at the date of acquisition
ii) The adjustment to current assets is to value them at the date of acquisition in accordance with group accounting policies
iii) The fair value adjustment for deferred tax balances relates to the recognition only of deferred tax assets at amounts considered recoverable in the short term
iv) An adjustment to the carrying value of Securicor Luxembourg SA, an investment held exclusively for resale, to reflect the net realisable value. The divestment
of the operations of Securicor Luxembourg SA was required by the European Commission as a condition for approval of the acquisition of Securicor plc
v) The recognition of corporation tax and other liabilities in existence at the date of acquisition
vi) The recognition of obligations and the provision for certain contingent liabilities in existence at the date of acquisition
vii) The share of fair value adjustments attributable to minority shareholders.
The fair values of net assets acquired are provisional and represent estimates following a preliminary valuation exercise. These may be adjusted to reflect any
development in the issues to which they relate. Final values will be incorporated into the 2005 group financial statements.
The acquired business of Securicor plc contributed £585.8m to turnover and £43.9m to profit before interest, taxation, goodwill amortisation and exceptional
items for the part year under Group 4 Securicor plc ownership. It also contributed £103.0m to the group’s net operating cash flows, paid £1.7m in respect of
taxation and utilised £23.4m for capital expenditure and financial investment. 64 > Group 4 Securicor > ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2004

Investments in securities primarily comprise listed securities held by the group’s wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiaries. The market value of these
investments at 31 December 2004 was £59.8m (2003: £56.3m), as quoted on the relevant market as at that date.
All subsidiary undertakings have been included within the consolidated financial statements of the group with the exception of those businesses which the group
is required by the European commission to dispose of as a condition of approval of the acquisition of Securicor plc.These businesses comprise Falck Nederland
and its subsidiaries, Group 4 Cash Services UK and Securicor Luxembourg.
The subsidiary operations of Falck Nederland and Group 4 Cash Services UK which were owned by the group prior to the acquisition of Securicor plc, have
been excluded from the consolidated financial statements because severe long-term restrictions hindered the exercise of the rights of the parent over the
subsidiaries’ management during the process of divestment.These subsidiary undertakings have therefore been de-consolidated from 20 July 2004.They are
shown within current asset investments as they are held for re-sale and at their carrying value as at that date, less an impairment charge of £34.5m in respect of
the net realisable value of Falck Nederland.The investment in Securicor Luxembourg, which was acquired as part of Securicor plc, was held exclusively for resale.
The results of this subsidiary undertaking have not been consolidated and are shown as an investment at fair value at 31 December 2004.
The operations of Falck Nederland are in the process of being disposed of, whilst the operations of Group 4 Cash Services UK and of Securicor Luxembourg
were sold on 4 March 2005. Details of significant transactions which took place between the companies listed above and the group are disclosed in note 28.

18. Financial instruments
Financial instrument disclosures, excluding short-term debtors and creditors other than bank borrowings as permitted under Financial Reporting Standards 13
(FRS 13): Derivatives and other financial instruments: disclosures, are as follows:
Currency risk
The group conducts business in many currencies. Transaction risk is fairly limited as wherever possible each business operates in local currency, including financing
activities. However, the group publishes its financial statements in sterling and it is in consequence subject to foreign exchange risk due to the translation of the
results and net assets of its foreign subsidiaries. The group hedges a substantial portion of its exposure to fluctuations in the translation into sterling of its
overseas net assets by holding borrowings in foreign currencies. Exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign currency net borrowings are recognised
in the statement of total recognised gains and losses to offset exchange differences on foreign currency equity investments, in accordance with Statement of
Standard Accounting Practice 20: Foreign currency translation. At 31 December 2004, the group’s US dollar (including dollar-related) and euro (including euro-
related) net assets before net borrowings respectively were approximately 82% and 46% hedged by net borrowings.
Interest rate risk
The group has an exposure to interest rate risk and, within this category of market risk, is most vulnerable to changes in US dollar, sterling and euro interest
rates. To manage interest rate risk, the group manages its proportion of fixed to variable rate borrowings within limits approved by the directors, primarily by
utilising interest rate swaps and, where appropriate, forward rate agreements to manage short term interest rate exposures. At 31 December 2004 the group
had no existing swaps or forward rate agreements.

The weighted average interest rate in respect of financial liabilities at fixed rates at 31 December 2004 is 5% and the weighted average period for which the
rates are fixed is two years. Interest-bearing financial liabilities at floating rates comprise revolving credit loans and bank overdrafts and bear interest based on
short-term interbank rates (predominantly 3-month LIBOR). The weighted average period to maturity of the non-interest bearing liabilities, which comprise
other creditors falling due after more than one year (note 19) and other provisions (note 20), is two years.

Interest-bearing financial assets principally comprise money market deposits, current account balances and cash held in ATMs and in 2004 bore interest at a
weighted average rate of 1.5%. Non-interest bearing financial assets comprise securities and long-term receivables, excluding £5.0m in respect of pension fund
contributions, and the weighted average period to maturity is two years. Investments held by captive insurance companies are not included within financial assets

Commitment fees are paid on the undrawn portion of these facilities. Borrowings on the facilities will be at prevailing LIBOR rates, dependent on the period of
drawdown, plus an agreed margin. The committed bank facilities are subject to financial covenants and any non-compliance with covenants may lead to an
acceleration of maturity. The group was fully in compliance with its financial covenants throughout the years to 31 December 2004 and 31 December 2003.
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities
Set out below is a year end comparison of fair and book values of all the group’s financial instruments by category. Fair values are determined by reference to

Currency exposures
Currency exposures arise where monetary assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the business in which they
are held. In operating businesses such assets and liabilities are intercompany balances. Gains and losses on these monetary assets and liabilities are recorded in
the profit and loss account. The following table shows the net currency exposure of the group:

The insurance reserves are held by the wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiaries in Guernsey, Luxembourg and the US which underwrite the group’s 
cash-in-transit, general liability, workers’ compensation and auto liability policies. The provisions are subject to regular actuarial review and are adjusted as
appropriate. The value of the final insurance settlements and the timing of the expenditure is uncertain.
Pensions
The pension provision represents the liability for pension obligations, including those disclosed in note 6 above in respect of UK defined benefit schemes, under
SSAP 24.
Other provisions
Other provisions mainly comprise those for restructuring and onerous property leases. Restructuring provisions include amounts for redundancy payments 
and the cost of closure of activities in acquired businesses. An onerous property provision is provided against future liabilities for all properties sub-let at a shortfall
and for long-term idle properties.The provision is based on the value of future net cash outflows relating to rent, rates, service charges and costs of marketing 
the properties. 74 > Group 4 Securicor > ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2004

21. Share capital (continued)
At 31 December 2003, the authorised share capital of the company was £100 divided into 100 ordinary shares with a nominal value of £1 each, of which two
were issued. On 6 May 2004, the authorised share capital of the company was increased from £100 to £50,000 by the creation of 49,900 ordinary shares of £1
each; 49,998 of the authorised but unissued ordinary shares of £1 each were re-designated and converted into 49,998 non-voting, non-dividend bearing
redeemable preference shares of £1 each; and each of the two issued ordinary shares of £1 each were subdivided into 20 ordinary shares of 5 pence each. On
11 May 2004, the company allotted the 49,998 redeemable preference shares fully paid.The redemption of these shares is mandatory at a nil premium.
Redemption occurs automatically on the availability of distributable reserves. On 2 June 2004, the Company increased its authorised share capital from £50,000
to £500,000,000 by the creation of 9,999,000,000 ordinary shares of 5 pence each. Immediately upon creation a share consolidation was undertaken whereby
every five ordinary shares of 5 pence each were consolidated into one ordinary share of 25 pence each. On 19 July 2004, pursuant to the combination of the
security businesses of the former Group 4 Falck A/S with Securicor plc, 655,834,513 ordinary shares of 25 pence each were issued to the 90.0% of the
shareholders of the former Group 4 Falck A/S who accepted the initial offer and 542,222,079 ordinary shares of 25 pence each were issued to the shareholders
of Securicor plc. On 4 October 2004, 65,970,476 ordinary shares of 25 pence each were issued to a further 9.1% of the shareholders of the former Group 4
Falck A/S who accepted the mandatory offer. The consolidated balance sheet shows the shares issued to the shareholders of the former Group 4 Falck A/S
within the opening balance at 1 January 2004, in accordance with the treatment of this transaction as a merger as explained in the statement of accounting
policies, note 1.

The group owns all of the shares in Wackenhut Services, Inc. (“WSI”), under US Foreign Ownership Controlling Interest provisions. WSI provides security
services to US Government agencies including security services on sites deemed to be strategically sensitive. Whilst the group is represented on the WSI board
through shareholder proxies, operational control remains with an independent board reporting directly to the US government. The results of WSI are
consolidated into the group’s results on the basis that WSI is considered to be a “quasi-subsidiary” in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 5: Reporting
the substance of transactions.
The financial results of WSI prepared in accordance with group accounting policies and included in the consolidated financial statements, are as follows:

24. Contingent liabilities
The company’s wholly-owned US subsidiary, Argenbright Security, Inc. (‘Argenbright’) was responsible for passenger checkpoint security screening for two of the
flights involved in the terrorist atrocities of 11 September 2001, being the United Airlines flight from Newark to San Francisco and the American Airlines flight
from Washington to Los Angeles. The hijacked planes performing these flights crashed respectively in rural Pennsylvania and into the Pentagon,Washington.
The directors believe that, in respect of those two flights, Argenbright carried out its security screening services properly and in accordance with its contractual
and regulatory duties and that it should have no liability for the losses that occurred subsequently. However, the events of 11 September were so extraordinary
that it is impossible at this stage to state with certainty that no findings against Argenbright will be made.
Argenbright is being sued and a number of lawsuits have been served upon it. Securicor plc has also been named in some of the lawsuits.
At 11 September 2001, Argenbright, which is a stand-alone limited liability corporation, had in place aviation liability insurance which included cover for acts of
terrorism and which, the directors believe, provided insurance cover of US$1billion for each of the two flights referred to above.
Additionally, contingent liabilities exist in respect of agreements entered into in the normal course of business.

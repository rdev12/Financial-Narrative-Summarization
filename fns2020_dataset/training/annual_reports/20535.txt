Adventis Group plc Report and Accounts 2004
This is my first statement as Chairman
of Adventis Group plc having been
appointed on 19 April 2004, prior to 
the admission to AIM on 1 July 2004.
In particular, our first six months as a
publicly quoted company have been
extremely encouraging with not only 
a significant rise in both turnover and
profit, but also with the achievement 
of the early part of our long-term
strategy through the announcement 
of a significant joint venture and a 
major acquisition.
It is pleasing to note that, in a year
when the management had to focus
on admission to AIM, both continued
successful business performance and
long term strategic development could
be achieved.This is encouraging for
our future business plans and reflects
the strength of talent within Adventis.
T oday, the group consists of six 
operating companies in three locations
employing over 80 people, providing a
broad range of marketing services to a
large range of clients.
The successful launch of AdventisNMG
Limited, as a venture with NMG
Financial Services Consulting Limited,
represents the beginning of our strategy
to offer the full range of services 
to the financial services industry.
The acquisition of Affiniti (UK) Ltd,
a specialised UK healthcare advertising
agency, was completed after the end
of the 2004 financial year. It builds
on the foothold the group already had
in this profitable market and is likely to
act as the vehicle for all future
healthcare activity.
The group comprises a talented and
commercially experienced team.The 
past year has been a turning point for 
the group in terms of funding and
strategy.Trading in 2005 has made a
positive start and is ahead of last year 
and therefore the outlook for 2005
remains encouraging. Our existing
businesses continue to perform well.

Peter Mitchell, Non-Executive Chairman 3 Chief Executive Officer’s statement
Report and Accounts 2004  Adventis Group plc
“I am pleased to report a strong set of maiden preliminary
results for the year ended 31 December 2004. Group billings
of £12.09m were up 32% (2003: £9.16m) and pre-tax profit
of £0.77m was up 83% (2003: £0.42m). In addition, we
benefited from healthy margins and strong cash flow.”
I am pleased to report a strong set of
maiden preliminary results for the year
ended 31 December 2004. Group billings
of £12.09m w e re up 32% (2003: £ 9 . 1 6 m )
and pre-tax profit of £0.77m was up
83% (2003: £0.42m). In addition, we
benefited from healthy margins and stro n g
cash flow.The earnings per share for
2004 of 2.2p was ahead of the previous
year at 1.7p.The board is recommending
a final dividend of 0.40p per share,
making a total for the year of 0.85p.
The group operates in a highly
competitive market place.The diversified
marketing services industry is highly
labour intensive, reflecting the reliance
on creative skill and knowledge.There is
a rising demand for specialists in various
marketing fields. Our revenues are
generated predominantly in the form
of fees for project specific work. It is
against this background that I am pleased
to report results that reflect the hard
work of all the team at Adventis.
Business strategy
The group enjoyed a more buoyant
market and most areas of the business
were able to generate higher revenues
at good margins. Since our admission
to AIM on 1 July 2004, where we raised
£2.60m net of expenses for the
group, we have pursued our business
strategy of increasing the market share
for our media services in the residential
and commercial property sectors.
Furthermore, we continue to expand
the services we provide in our other
target markets, currently comprising the
financial services and healthcare sectors.
Acquisitions and joint ventures
In August 2004, we formed A d v e n t i s N M G
Limited as a ve n t u re with NMG Financial
Services Consulting Limited, a h i g h l y
specialised management consulting firm,
providing a comprehensive range of
services to the global financial industry.
The NMG global network has unrivalled
access to financial institutions with
clients such as ISIS, Scottish Widows,
Charcol and HBOS and is able to act 
as a very effective business introducer.
In early January 2005, we completed
the acquisition of Affiniti (UK) Ltd,
a specialised UK healthcare advertising
agency with clients such as Allergan,
Sanofi Pasteur MSD, Chiron Vaccines,
Eden Biopharm, Leo Pharma, Napp
and Serono.This acquisition builds on
the foothold Adventis Group already
has in this profitable market and is likely
to act as the vehicle for all future
healthcare activity.
On 30 March 2005, having secured
the services of a senior executive from
another media company, we announced
the commencement of Adgenda Media
Limited.Adgenda will provide media
broking services to property and financial
services related companies.

Adventis Group plc Report and Accounts 2004
Operational review
The following is a summary of activity
by business sector for the year ended
31 December 2004.
Residential property marketing sector 
Our residential property marketing
sector has a broad base of clients from
international names such as Savills to
many UK developers such as Capital
& Provident, Galliard and Devington
Homes. It provides a broad range of
consultancy and creative services across
the industry and has continued to
grow this creative business with
encouraging margins.
Commercial property marketing sector
Our commercial property marketing
sector won several major long-term
projects in 2004 such as the Hub in
Birmingham and the South West
Regional Development Agency
(SWERDA) in Cardiff.These project
successes continue to give the business
a positive order book for the current
year. Margins remained under pressure
in this competitive business area.
Media planning and buying sector
Our media planning and buying sector
has full NPA (Newspapers Publishing
Association) recognition. Media broking
is highly cash generative and works very
much in tandem with our residential
property marketing sector’s creative
business. Business volumes continue
to grow at good margins.The addition 
of a second media company within the
group will consolidate our position
within this sector.
Financial services sector
The new venture,AdventisNMG
Limited, which specialises in financial
services, commenced trading in
September 2004 and traded profitably
for the period ended 31 December 2004.
A senior executive from a similar
organisation was recruited and has been
successful in exploiting the many leads
generated by AdventisNMG Limited.
A series of projects were concluded
in 2004 and the outlook is positive
for 2005.
Outlook
Since our admission to AIM, the group
has enjoyed a higher profile within
the industry and national media.This
increased awareness greatly facilitates
our mergers and acquisitions activity.
All staff serving at the time of the
flotation participated in a share option
scheme and this has contributed to
excellent staff morale and retention.
Our strong cash flow and balance sheet
will assist and help to support further
strategic developments and we continue
to explore ways of growing the group
while ensuring our profit record is
maintained.

continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the
financial statements.
Corporate governance
Although the company is not obliged to comply with the
revised Combined Code on Corporate Governance issued in
July 2003 (the ‘Code’), the board is committed to ensuring
good standards of Corporate Governance and has taken steps
to comply with the Code’s principles in so far as practicable
for a company of this size.
Board of directors 
The board meets regularly to determine the policy and business
strategy of the group and has adopted a schedule of those
matters that are reserved as the responsibility of the board.
The Chief Executive Officer leads the development of business
strategies within the group’s operations.The board consists 
of two executive directors and three non-executive directors,
including the non-executive Chairman.The Chairman was
considered independent on appointment although none of the
non-executive directors can be considered independent for the
purposes of the Code. However, the board considers that there
is an appropriate balance between the executives and non-
executives, and that no individual or small group dominates 
the board’s decision taking.The board’s members have a wide
range of expertise and experience and it is felt that concerns
may be addressed to any of the non-executive directors.
Notice of the group’s Annual General Meeting is sent to
shareholders with a copy of this report and accounts.
Board committees
The board has delegated certain authorities to committees,
each with formal terms of reference, which are available on
request to the Company’s Registered Office.The members
of the committees are detailed on page 5.
Audit committee 
The audit committee consists of the three non-executive
directors and meets at least twice a year to consider the 
scope of the annual audit, interim reviews, to assess the
auditors, and the effectiveness of the group’s systems of 
internal control and to review the requirement for internal
audit (which the committee believes is not currently justified,
given the current size of the group).The committee has 
access to the group’s auditors.The Chief Executive Officer 
and Finance Director may be invited to attend committee
meetings, but are not members.
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee consists of the three non-
executive directors and meets at least twice a year to 
determine company policy on senior executive remuneration,
to make detailed recommendations to the board regarding 
the remuneration packages of the executive directors and
consider the awards under the group’s option schemes.The
Chief Executive Officer is consulted on remuneration packages 
and policy, but does not attend discussions regarding his own
package.The remuneration and terms and conditions of
appointment of the non-executive directors are determined 
by the board.
Nomination committee 
The nomination committee consists of the three non-
executive directors and meets at least once each year to 
evaluate individual board members’ effectiveness, to review
the composition and balance of the board and to recommend
candidates to the board for vacancies, as required. 8 Report of the directors
Adventis Group plc Report and Accounts 2004
Internal control and risk management
The board has implemented a formal system of controls which
accords with the guidance given in the Turnbull Report and
acknowledges its responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness
of the systems in place to manage risk and provide reasonable,
but not absolute, assurance with regard to the safeguarding of
group assets against misstatement or loss.The key elements of
the system of internal control are:
• clear definition of delegated authorities and preparation 
of annual budgets for board approval;
• close involvement by operating management in the day to 
day business of the group, facilitating prompt identification
of risks and action, both financial and operational;
• regular reporting of individual business performance to the
board and the review of results against planned performance;
•
regular assessment and review of risks and controls and
specific annual assessment by the audit committee of the
effectiveness of the systems in place.The audit committee
reports to the board on its findings.
Auditors
During the year, ChantreyVellacott DFK were appointed
auditors to the company.A resolution to re-appoint Chantrey
Vellacott DFK as auditors to the company will be proposed
at the Annual General Meeting and special notice of this
resolution has been received. ChantreyVellacott DFK also
provide non-audit services to the company, principally advice
on taxation, but the audit committee is satisfied that such work
is best undertaken by ChandreyVellacott DFK and their
objectivity is not impaired by reason of this further work.

W1U 1HH 9 Statement of directors’ responsibilities
Report and Accounts 2004  Adventis Group plc
The following statement, which should be read in conjunction
with the auditors’ report regarding the respective responsibilities
of directors and auditors, set out on page 10, is made with a
view to distinguishing for shareholders those respective
responsibilities in relation to the accounts.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial
statements for each financial year which give a true and fair
view of the state-of-affairs of the company and group and
of the profit or loss of the group for that period. In preparing
those financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and
prudent;
•
state whether applicable accounting standards have been
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and
explained in the financial statements;
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group will
continue in business.
The directors confirm that they have complied with the above
requirements in preparing the financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the group and to enable them to ensure
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act
1985.They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the
group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention
and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 10 Independent auditors’ report to the shareholders of Adventis Group plc
Adventis Group plc Report and Accounts 2004
We have audited the financial statements of Adventis Group plc
for the year ended 31 December 2004 which comprise the
consolidated profit and loss account, consolidated group and
company balance sheets, consolidated cash flow statement,
reconciliation of shareholders funds and related notes.These
financial statements have been prepared under the historical
cost convention and the accounting policies set out therein.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a
body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act
1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might
state to the company’s members those matters we are required
to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other
purpose.T o the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors 
As described in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities,
the company’s directors are responsible for the preparation
of financial statements in accordance with applicable law
and United Kingdom Accounting Standards.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
United Kingdom Auditing Standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial
statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.We also report
to you if, in our opinion, the Report of the directors is not
consistent with the financial statements, if the company has not
kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration
and transactions with the company is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the financial statements
and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial
statements.This other information comprises only the Report
of the directors, and the Chairman’s statement and the Chief
Executive Officer’s statement.We consider the implications for
our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements
or in any apparent misstatement within it.
Basis of audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom
Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board.An
audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant
to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It
also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and
judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the
financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the company’s circumstances, consistently applied
and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated
the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the
financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair
view of the state of the company’s and group’s affairs as at
31 December 2004 and of the profit of the group for the year
then ended and have been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985.

1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(a) Basis of accounting
The accounts on pages 11 to 28 have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable
United Kingdom accounting statements.
(b) Consolidation
The consolidated accounts include the results of the company and its subsidiary undertakings up to 31 December 2004.
Intra-group sales and profits are eliminated on consolidation.
(c) Goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses, representing any excess of the fair value of the
consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired is capitalised and written off on a straight
line basis over its useful economic life, which is considered to be 20 years.
Negative goodwill arising on consolidation is included within intangible fixed assets and released to the profit and loss account in
the periods in which the fair values of the non-monetary assets purchased on the same acquisition are recovered, whether through
depreciation or sale. Any negative goodwill in excess of the fair values of the non-monetary assets acquired is recognised in the
profit and loss account over the period expected to benefit, which is considered to be 20 years.
(d) Turnover
Turnover represents commissions and fees receivable excluding VAT.
(e) Fixed assets
Fixed assets are stated at historical cost less provision for depreciation or amortisation and any impairment.
(f) Depreciation
Provision for depreciation is made at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of tangible fixed assets over
their estimated useful lives as follows:
Furniture and office equipment 15% reducing balance
Computer equipment and software 33% reducing balance
Leasehold improvements over the period of the lease
(g) Work in progress
Work in progress is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 16 Notes to the accounts  Year ended 31 December 2004
Adventis Group plc Report and Accounts 2004
(h) Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation to pay more tax or a right to pay less tax, at a
future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise, based on current tax rates and law.Timing differences arise from the
inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in years different from those in which they are included
in financial statements. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that the directors consider that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
(i) Accounting for leases
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised at their fair value on the inception of the leases and
depreciated over the shorter of the period of the lease and the estimated useful economic lives of the assets. Finance charges are
allocated over the period of the lease in proportion to the capital amount outstanding and are charged to the profit and loss
account. Payments under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account as they fall due.
(j) Pension costs
The group operates a staff stakeholder pension plan.The group also operates a number of defined contribution individual
pension plans. Contributions in respect of defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the profit and loss account
when they are payable.

Report and Accounts 2004  Adventis Group plc      Savills marketing
During 2004, Adventis was responsible
for the re-branding of FPDSavills to
Savills. This was a major exercise
encompassing all areas of design from
office signage and interiors to advertising
and marketing. With over sixty locations
and more than one hundred and fifty
different publications this project focused
equally on the project management and
organisational skills of Adventis as on the
creative solutions.
Adventis is also responsible for all on-
going marketing, PR and advertising
for Savills (L&P) Ltd. We are continually
involved in a wide range of marketing
activities from corporate branding, print
and production to media buying.
The Highland Club, Inverness
Developments specifically designed
as second homes, either at home or
overseas, have become affordable to
many of us in recent years. Such a
project is the Highland Club on the
banks of Loch Ness developed by
The Raven Group.
Our brief was to produce marketing
material that sold the dream without
the necessity of constant visits to site.
The specially commissioned crest, which
formed their identity, reflects both the
history of the building and its Scottish
location whilst the use of architecturally
correct line drawings helps a purchaser
to easily locate the properties for sale
and appreciate the scale and layout of
the development.
The brochure was runner-up in the
‘Best Residential Brochure’ at the
PAMADA awards 2004. International Art Consultants
Adventis was commissioned to produce
a new corporate brochure for International
Art Consultants as an introduction to their
wide range of services in the art world.
By combining a folder format with select
illustrations from previous commissions,
it encouraged prospective clients to make
contact with the company. Produced
to coincide with their new identity, each
mailing could be accompanied by other
single sheets and information relevant
to the particular inquiry.
Howard de Walden Estates Limited
Within the last 5 years, Howard de
Walden Estates has transformed
Marylebone in London from an
economically undistinguished area.
Their goal was to build up a
community spirit and bring back
the traditional high street.
Now that the area has come of age,
Howard de Walden was eager to
produce a vehicle to present the
opportunities for prospective
purchasers, tenants and customers.
The brief was to encapsulate the
unique spirit of the estate and provide
a showcase for the diversity, culture
and history of the area.
The brochure won ‘Best Photography’
and ‘Best Corporate Brochure’ at
the PAMADA awards 2004.
Discovery Dock, London Docklands 
Over the past three years Adventis has
run a series of advertising campaigns 
to launch and publicise the completion
of the various phases of the Discovery
Dock development overlooking Canary
Wharf. Premium Media provided a
media planning and buying service
across a plethora of media types. 
The ability to plan regionally, nationally
and internationally and access up-to-
date research facilities has allowed
Adventis to be pro-active in the
campaign management. Maples and Calder
Experience shows that updating
the identity of an established yet
expanding international off-shore
law firm like Maples and Calder is
often a matter of evolution, rather
than revolution.
However, the result is more than just
a new logo. A complete overhaul of
over 500 individual items of stationery
and literature, along with a complete
set of identity guidelines and new
advertisements has given the company
a visual appearance that is more
modern, integrated and assertive.
Cardiff Waterside, Wales
On behalf of Morley Fund Management,
Adventis was commissioned to brand a
new business destination to complement
the environment and lifestyle. We are
involved in the marketing strategy, print
material, signage and marketing suite.
Local, national and international
advertising
Whether in local, national or
international press, an advertisement
should reflect the style of the project
and be tailored to its target audience.
From the launch of a former school,
to a dream holiday home in Provence
or the launch of a new classically
styled show apartment or townhouse,
the message should be clearly spelled
out with emphasis on the three key
elements of any property ad - location,
what it is and the price. Print collateral
Adventis Group is responsible for a wide
range of high quality brochures and
other allied material. Shown right is a
range of print material from within the
commercial property sector. Often
regarded as a standard requirement by
our clients, we prefer to add value by
the design and quality of production.

sought after area with prices equalling
quite expensive parts of London.
Adventis was commissioned by Angel
Property to design and produce a
brochure with individual inserts for
each of the 8 new build town houses
and 9 apartments created from the old
Pottery. We also created an innovative
web site (www.thedartmouthpottery.com),
signage and a creative ad campaign in
Bricks & Mortar (The Times), The Daily,
Telegraph and the Evening Standard.
This resulted in all the units being sold
off-plan. Galliard Homes
In the summer of 2004, Galliard Homes
launched a new investment project in
Central London. Premium Media

Lapps Quay, Cork
Lapps Quay is an important new mixed-
use development in central Cork, one of
Europe’s up and coming business cities.
Adventis’ task was to produce a
marketing brochure which would
highlight the potential of the City of Cork
and emphasise that the project is moving
forward. The brochure was designed to
have maximum impact and included
information aimed at encouraging
potential tenants and investors to take
the city seriously.
It was runner-up in the ‘Regeneration
and Mixed Use category’ at the PAMADA
awards 2004. Wimbledon Gate, London 
Adventis was asked to prepare branding
for a pre-let campaign for a new office
development of 58,000 sq ft by McKay
Securities Group. The quality of the
computer generated images and
brochure have helped to create several
major enquiries. Temple Quarter, Bristol
Adventis was appointed by South West of
England Regional Development Agency
(SWERDA) as marketing and communications
consultants for Temple Quarter, a multi-
phase, mixed-use regeneration project of
some 115 acres based around Bristol Temple
Meads Station. The project is multi-faceted
and includes the provision of offices, a
10,000 seat new indoor arena, new homes,
open spaces and squares, a new waterfront,
leisure facilities, a new hotel, restaurants,
bars, cafes, shops and a new transport hub.
Adventis has created a brand identity
for Temple Quarter and its sub-brands of
Bristol Arena, Temple Quay and Temple
Meads. A set of guidelines to demonstrate
the application of the new branding to all
marketing materials has been produced,
along with a range of marketing materials.
Centrale, Croydon
For this major retail development
in Croydon by St Martins Property
Company, Adventis was asked to

at the entrance to the new town of

of a marketing suite, permanent
park signage and advertising.
Adventis has worked closely with
Morley Fund Management, who
funded Phase 2 at Cambourne,
rolling out the marketing programme
to produce building specific brochures,
letting boards and advertising.
IVAX
Creating a range of patient-focused
medicine packaging that not only
met the requirements of our client
but also addressed the needs of
pharmacists and added value to
the end-user, was a challenge.
There were over 350 products to
consider, and the stringent rules
of the Medicines Control Agency
to satisfy.
The new design makes all
information more accessible,
while a more attractive font and
subtle changes to language make
packs more readable and easier
to understand. A vibrant palette
of colours not only helps the
pharmacists correctly identify the
right product and strength, but is
designed to promote a greater
sense of wellbeing in patients.  Adventis Group plc

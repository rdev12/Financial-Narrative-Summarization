We are a leading underground precious metals company, 
focusing on the exploration, mining, processing and sale 
of silver and gold in the Americas.
Key highlights Hochschild Mining 
has come a long way in 
the decade since our 
listing on the London 
Stock Exchange. 
We have successfully navigated a volatile industry 
environment with several phases of international 
expansion, internal restructuring, mine construction 
and delivered consistently on annual production targets 
and low cost organic growth while maintaining a 
constant focus on our duties as a responsible operator. 
This has placed the Company in an ideal position to 
continue to generate long-term value for 
all stakeholders.
Over the last few years we have maintained a consistent 
strategy and in 2016 I was pleased that, as a signal of its 
ongoing success, the Board was able to reinstate the 
interim dividend in August and now can also announce 
a proposed final dividend payout of $7 million.”

Strategic report We are confident of our 
enormous potential...
Operationally, 2016 was characterised by a strong first full year from 
our top-tier Inmaculada operation in Peru. There were also improved 
contributions from Arcata – its best since 2010 – and from our 
Argentinian mine, San Jose, reflecting a much more promising 
economic environment in the country.
In line with the production growth, cost reduction continued for a 
fourth straight year and together with a supportive precious metal 
price environment, the Company generated strong cashflow 
throughout the year. Consequently, the Company has been able to 
follow through decisively on our promise to reduce leverage by 
repaying $127 million of debt during the year and building up a 
healthy cash balance. We are now in an increasingly solid financial 
position to manage our remaining debt profile whilst giving 
management the flexibility to invest in further organic growth  
options and continue to return capital to shareholders.
Hochschild has always aimed to invest in mineralised districts with the 
possibility to grow over time and in this regard we are excited by the 
potential of our portfolio. The discovery and subsequent resource 
growth of our new Pablo vein district at Pallancata demonstrates our 
ability to reinvigorate existing operations, at a low cost through local 
exploration. We believe that there are significant further opportunities 
to capitalise on latent processing capacity at our plants as well as to 
extend the lives of our mines and expand their capacity. The Board is 
confident that the ambitious exploration programme announced in 
the third quarter will deliver substantial low cost resources and provide 
the Company with further growth optionality in the years to come.
Precious metal prices once again experienced periods of volatility in 
2016 although both silver and gold did rise to levels not seen since 
2013 thereby providing the Company with an unanticipated boost to 
already strong cashflow generation. However, the subsequent sharp 
decline in prices at the end of the year illustrated the ongoing 
unpredictability of our markets and consequently I am encouraged  
by the Company’s continuing emphasis on cost control and 
debt repayment.
Sustainability
Despite the progress made in 2016 as the third consecutive year 
without any fatalities, it is with huge regret that an accident at the 
Inmaculada mine early in 2017 resulted in two deaths. On behalf of 
the Board, I would like to convey our deepest condolences to the 
families of the victims involved. The accident serves as a reminder of 
the high level of risks emanating from mining operations in general.  
I would like to thank those across the Group whose efforts are focused 
on making our operations a safe place to work and to whom I pledge 
the Board’s unequivocal support in the belief that every accident 
is avoidable.
With regards to our environmental efforts, I am pleased to report that 
the Group continued to improve its environmental performance and 
maintained its corporate ISO 14001 certification. Furthermore, as part 
of our ongoing focus on aligning remuneration with our strategic 
goals, a new environmental scorecard has been adopted, performance 
against which bonus entitlements will be calculated for senior 
management over and above the usual operational and 
financial metrics.
Our relations with local communities are of the utmost importance 
and we dedicate significant resources in recognition of the social 
licence granted to us. Details on the varied programmes that the  
Group has run focusing on our core themes of education, health and 
socio-economic development can be found in our Sustainability Report 
and online.
Board
I wish to thank the employees across the business and my fellow Board 
members for their dedication and support over the year. At the Board 
level, the stabilised operating environment during the year led to the 
resumption of our Non-Executive succession plan and I was delighted 
that we were able to announce the appointment, in November, of 
Eileen Kamerick and, from the start of this year, Sanjay Sarma. Each 
brings a varied skill set to the board table and we look forward to our 
future board discussions. It leaves me to pay special thanks, on behalf 
of the Board, to Roberto Dañino and Nigel Moore who have served as 
Directors since the IPO in 2006 and will be retiring at the forthcoming 
AGM. Their contribution over the past decade has been invaluable and 
we wish them the very best for the future.
Outlook 
The Company is determined to retain emphasis on our low cost organic 
growth strategy and the ongoing repayment of debt particularly given 
the already unpredictable nature of 2017 so far. We are confident in 
the sizeable potential shown in the areas surrounding our operations 
as well as our team’s ability to bring early stage projects through the 
pipeline and combined with an embedded cost control culture, the 
prospects for further shareholder return are very strong.

Chairman’s statement
4 Hochschild Mining plc Annual Report 2016 And there is still 
plenty more to come.
We are positioned to deliver sustainable and significant 
growth in total shareholder returns.
2016 has proved to be a watershed year for the Company. We are now 
fully benefitting from the results of our growth and cost focused 
strategy with a consistent record of operational excellence driving 
significantly improved cashflows, reduced leverage and increased 
shareholder returns. Furthermore, our exploration team is working on 
a variety of opportunities for securing additional low cost growth in 
the areas surrounding our mines which we believe will allow for 
capacity improvements and life-of-mine extensions at our operations.
Operations
A consistent delivery of annual production targets has become a 
trademark of our Company and 2016 was no exception. We produced a 
record 35.5 million attributable silver equivalent ounces, an 11% 
improvement on our original 32 million ounce target, with 
Inmaculada’s output at almost 17 million ounces (229 million gold 
equivalent ounces). In its first full year, the all-in sustaining cost at this 
world class operation was a highly competitive $8.7 per silver 
equivalent ounce ($644 per gold equivalent ounce) which resulted 
from robust operational delivery. We also saw a successful year at 
Arcata, which produced just over 8 million ounces at a cost of $13.7 per 
silver equivalent ounce. At San Jose, continuing operational consistency 
combined with a vastly improved fiscal environment in Argentina led 
to an 18% reduction in AISC and strongly improved cashflow 
generation. The renewed Pallancata mine experienced a transitional 
year as we prepare to move production to low cost feed from the new 
Pablo vein district during 2017. We have maintained our focus on cost 
control at all operations, and the resulting 13% reduction in overall 
all-in sustaining costs to $11.2 per silver equivalent ounce demonstrates 
the effectiveness of our policies. As a management team, we are 
committed to ensuring a safe working environment and we will 
redouble our efforts in the area of safety in light of the tragic  
accident at Inmaculada earlier this year. 
Exploration
In September, following a number of years of prospective work by our 
brownfield team, we announced the launch of a new long-term 
exploration programme with the expectation of not only replacing our 
production but materially improving our reserves and resources by 
2020. We are confident that this key organic growth strategy can 
deliver further low cost growth through the potential to fill our 
existing spare plant capacity as well as increase our visible resource 
life-of-mine. Part of the programme focuses on the Pablo vein at 
Pallancata and, in 2016, we successfully increased the quality and 
quantity of resources with the discovery of the high grade Pablo Piso 
structures. T otal resources from this new vein system have now 
increased to 40 million silver equivalent ounces from 23 million a year 
ago. In addition, in order to ensure a high future conversion of our

Strategic report
Chief Executive’s review resources to reserves, we have made the prudent decision to exclude 
material in our deposits that has a low probability of being mined.  
This has reduced our overall operational resources by almost 15% but 
represents a more robust approach to classification.
Financial position
The proactive management of our balance sheet in order to de-risk the 
Company has been a clear aim during the construction and 
subsequent first 18 months of operation at Inmaculada from its 
commissioning. The strong cashflow from the operations has ensured 
that in 2016 we made considerable further progress in reducing our 
debt position. $127 million of short- to medium-term lines were repaid 
and we still ended the year with a healthy cash and cash equivalents 
position of $140 million. In 2017, our aim is to continue to strengthen 
the financial position in anticipation of the Company’s option to 
redeem some or all of the remaining Senior Notes from January 2018 
and thereby reduce our financing costs. It is worth adding that 
currently, we no longer have any hedging agreements in place.
Financial results
As mentioned above, our average price achieved improved in 2016, by 
5% for gold and by 6% for silver and consequently when combined 
with the 25% production increase, revenue rose strongly, by 47% in 
2016 to $688 million (2015: $469 million). The improved cost 
performance led to Adjusted EBITDA of $329 million (2015: 
$139 million), an increase of 137% versus 2015, reflecting a year of 
higher margin contribution from Inmaculada. This strong cashflow 
generation has finally offset the finance costs arising from our 2014 
bond issue and adjusted earnings per share therefore rose to $0.11 per 
share from a loss of $(0.14) per share. We ended the year with net debt 
of $187 million (2015: $351 million) which translates to a leverage 
ratio of 0.57x (2015: 2.5x), significantly below guidance for the year.
Outlook
Overall, 2017 is expected to be another record year for the Company 
with attributable production set to rise to 37 million silver equivalent 
ounces (or 500,000 gold equivalent ounces) driven by another 
17 million ounces from Inmaculada and a first contribution from our 
highly prospective new Pablo vein at Pallancata with production there 
expected to be second-half weighted. The all-in sustaining cost per 
silver equivalent ounce is forecast to be between $12.2 and $12.7 
which reflects a stable underlying unit cost and includes an increased 
investment in brownfield growth as well as a tailings dam expansion 
at Inmaculada and the initial infrastructure for the development 
of Pablo.

translates to a leverage ratio of 0.57x, significantly

Chief Executive’s review continued Our business model 
drives long‑term 
sustainable growth
Creating 
value
We believe that our consistent and sustainable business model will 
not only create long-term value for our stakeholders but also sets 
Hochschild Mining apart, offering an attractive investment proposition.
During the last decade, we have emphasised that a key attribute of 
this model is our focus on exploration. Our operational assets and the 
projects that we have advanced through our pipeline depend on our 
in-house geological expertise and the resulting ability to enhance their 
resources and hence their value through exploration success.
This has been supported by the depth of our management’s 
experience in the Americas as well as a disciplined but flexible financial 
strategy. We recognise that, at all levels of our business, the 
contribution of our talented workforce and their commitment to our 
corporate values is a fundamental aspect of this model. These values 
promote an ethical approach and good corporate governance as well 
acknowledging our responsibilities to our wider stakeholders.

Business model and investment case With an investment 
case that sets us apart
Operational 
and geological 
expertise
We primarily operate 
underground epithermal deposits 
in the Americas. For over half 
a century, we have developed a 
unique in-depth knowledge base 
of the regional business 
environment and legislative 
framework where we operate. 
Historically, we have been able 
to consistently meet annual 
production targets, increase our 
resource base and achieve 
positive results from brownfield 
exploration at existing mines. 
This has been achieved despite 
periods of significant volatility in 
precious metal markets as well as 
dynamic political and 
economic environments.
What sets us apart?
We have a particular expertise 
in mining mid-sized, narrow, 
epithermal veins in complex 
geological conditions, remote 
areas and changing 
political environments.
World class 
flagship mine
Inmaculada is a world class 
precious metal mine located 
in the Group’s Southern Peru 
Cluster close to several of our 
other mining assets. The 
presence of high grades of gold 
and silver in a single vein, Angela, 
characterised by its impressive 
width and favourable rock quality, 
allows the mine to achieve a 
highly competitive cost position. 
However, whilst the deposit has 
a more than adequate reserve 
life, there is significant 
exploration potential in the 
district including probable 
extensions to the main Angela 
vein as well other vein systems 
identified in the Company’s 
concession area.
What sets us apart?
The brownfield exploration team 
have identified geological upside 
in the surrounding area which is 
expected to allow the Company 
to potentially expand this world 
class operation’s capacity and 
drive costs still lower.
Consistent 
financial strategy
With volatile underlying markets, 
the Company’s financing 
initiatives are a key underpin to 
our business strategy. Hochschild 
has long-standing and flexible 
financial relationships, allowing 
it to invest in near-term growth, 
manage the current operations 
and provide access to further 
liquidity should the need arise.
What sets us apart?
Whilst the Company enjoys 
robust existing global banking 
relationships and has raised both 
debt and equity to fund project 
construction, our long-standing 
Peruvian presence also allows us 
favourable access to significant 
local sources of finance.
Focus on 
exploration
The Group has continuously 
placed a strong emphasis on 
exploration as a key component 
of its business model to secure 
long-term sustainability of the 
core producing assets as well as 
finding new projects to expand 
its portfolio. T o this end, in 2016 
the Company launched a new 
brownfield exploration 
programme aimed at achieving 
five years of mine life in reserves 
and an additional five years of 
mine life in resources by 2020.
What sets us apart?
The value of ounces discovered 
at the Company in less than 
10 years exceeds $5 billion in 
revenue and the brownfield team 
believe that, following a long 
period of prospection, there is still 
potential at all our assets to find 
low cost ounces.
We believe we have an attractive portfolio of assets 
which can deliver long-term profitable growth.

Business model and investment case continued Experienced 
management 
team
The Group’s management team 
has extensive experience in 
sustainable mining, developing 
successful projects and adding 
economic mineral reserves. This 
experience has enabled us to 
operate efficiently and profitably 
through volatile commodity price 
cycles for more than 50 years. 
Hochschild’s team has also 
managed joint venture 
operations and successfully 
integrated several acquisitions 
and business expansions.
What sets us apart?
The management team has 
considerable experience in the 
Americas: operating different 
types of deposits; driving 
successful cost reduction 
programmes; planning and 
building high value projects in 
short spaces of time; acquiring 
and divesting companies; and 
working with local communities.
Commitment 
to sustainability
We have a historical commitment 
to safety as well as social and 
environmental sustainability , with 
operational safety being one of 
our core values. In addition, the 
Group considers its surrounding 
communities as its long-term 
business partners and commits 
skilled professionals as well as 
financial resources to support 
programmes in three different 
categories: health, safety and 
sustainable development. As a 
result of these programmes, the 
Group has been able to operate 
collaboratively with its neighbours 
in the Southern Peru Cluster for 
more than 50 years.
What sets us apart?
Our mines are located in remote 
parts of Peru where Hochschild 
is amongst the very few 
organisations with a meaningful 
presence in the area. 
We therefore look to form 
partnerships with regional 
authorities to provide much 
needed support to the local 
communities focusing on 
education, health and promoting 
sustainable economic 
development. As a mining 
operator, we have a zero 
tolerance to incidents relating 
to safety and the environment 
supported by recognised 
management information 
systems and controls.

CASE STUDY
A key example of our strategy in action is the discovery, 
approval, financing and construction of our flagship 
Inmaculada mine in only six years. The deposit was first drilled 
in early 2009 and by 2012, its feasibility study had been 
approved by the Board. Mine development was able to begin 
in 2012 with construction of the processing plant 
commencing in 2014 on receipt of the requisite government 
permits. Hochschild purchased the remaining minority 
interests in late 2013 and funded this acquisition and the 
construction of the project through existing cash resources 
and the issuing of a senior note in January 2014. First 
production was achieved in June 2015 and the mine was then 
ramped up to full production within three months.

Strategic report We have long 
market experience...
We have operated in shifting commodity markets for over 
fifty years and are used to managing the Company whatever 
the global and political economic circumstances.
Demand
Gold investment demand rose sharply in 
2016, after declining for four consecutive 
years, to 20.0 million ounces, up from 
13.6 million ounces in 2015. Another 
important component was central banks 
who remained net buyers of gold during 
2016 and, on a net basis, added 
approximately 21.55 million ounces of 
gold to their holdings. The primary goal 
for their purchases was the same as it 
has been the past few years – to diversify 
their monetary reserve assets by adding 
gold as well as foreign exchange reserves, 
presently held primarily in U.S. dollars.
Demand
Investors were net buyers of 98.1 million 
ounces of silver in 2016. The net 
additions to investor holdings were lower 
than the average of 147 million ounces 
added to investor inventories annually 
between 2009 and 2015, but were still 
very high historically. This was in stark 
contrast to 1990-2005, when investors 
were consistent net sellers of silver.
The largest source of demand for silver 
is jewellery and silverware. Silver use 
in these products rose to a record 
301.9 million ounces in 2016 although 
the rate of increase slowed significantly 
in 2016 to 1.5% from a 7% increase 
in demand from this sector in 2015. 
This can primarily be attributed to silver 
price strength during 2016 relative to 
2015 with jewellery demand typically 
sensitive to the price.
Gold fabrication demand is estimated to 
have totalled 95.1 million ounces in 
2016, down 1.1% from 2015. One of the 
primary factors that weighed during 
2016 was the strengthening of gold 
prices during the first eight months of 
the year. Another factors was the 
strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus 
the domestic currencies of some of the 
major consumers of gold.
Demand from the electronics sector, the 
second largest use of silver, rose by 0.4% 
to a record 224.7 million ounces in 2016. 
Demand from electronics manufacturers 
declined during the first seven months 
of the year but picked up in August 2016 
and is expected to continue into 2017. 
In 2016, the photovoltaic industry 
surpassed photography to become the 
third largest use of silver with 
government support in various countries 
playing a key role in driving higher 
demand for solar panels. Demand 
is estimated to have reached around 
74 million ounces in 2016, up 18.8%.
Gold
Gold prices broke their losing streak, rising 7.9% 
on an annual average basis during the year after 
declining for three consecutive years between 2013 
and 2015. While gold started 2016 on a very strong 
note, rising 20% during the first ten weeks, prices 
weakened sharply during the last quarter of the 
year. Prices declined during that period on renewed 
expectations of a U.S. interest rate hike, which was 
announced in December 2016, along with the 
prospects for three more rate hikes in 2017. Markets 
also turned very optimistic on U.S. economic growth 
following Donald T rump’s election as U.S. president 
and pushed higher everything from stocks to base 
metals and the dollar. Meanwhile, bonds and 
gold declined.
Silver
Annual average silver prices broke a four-year losing 
streak in 2016 averaging $17.17 in 2016, up 9.6% 
over 2015. Shorter term speculative investors 
combined with longer term investors to drive the 
price of silver higher during the first half of 2016 
with reasons including investor expectations on 
the pace of U.S. interest rate rises, further global 
loosening of monetary policy and the surprise Brexit 
vote. However, the same explanation as gold drove 
the price of silver down during the last quarter of 
2016. Silver prices ended 2016 at $15.98, down from 
their intraday high of $21.22 on 5 July 2016 but still 
15.8% higher than their settlement price of $13.80 
at the end of 2015.

Market experience Supply
T otal gold supply, which is composed 
primarily of mine supply and secondary 
or scrap supply, rose to 125.0 million 
ounces in 2016, up 1.6% from 2015. 
The growth during the year was 
primarily driven by an increase in mine 
production. which has been rising on 
account of the large number of new 
projects that came onstream in 
response to the rise in prices between 
2002 and 2011. After falling sharply for 
three consecutive years, gold secondary 
supply stabilised somewhat in 2016 
at 30.1 million ounces.
Supply
T otal supply of silver, from mine 
production, secondary supply, 
government disposals, and net exports 
from transitional economies, is 
estimated to have declined by 2% to 
987.8 million ounces in 2016. Global 
silver mine supply is estimated to have 
slipped to 886.1 million ounces in 2016, 
down from 889.9 million ounces in 2015 
due to scheduled closures and planned 
production cutbacks during the year 
at a mix of primary mines as well as 
by-product mines. T otal secondary 
supply is estimated to have slipped 1%, 
significantly slower than sharper 
declines in scrap recovery between 
2013 and 2015.

What could drive 
precious metal 
prices in 2017?
• Economic and 
political uncertainty
• Central bank purchases of gold
• Rising mine supply (gold)/ 
further supply declines (silver)
• Steady scrap supply
• Rising fabrication demand 
from jewellery, electronics, 
and solar panels (silver)
• Flat fabrication demand
• Price weakness leading 
to increased retail demand
What do we do 
in response?
• We have always aimed 
to ensure our operations

throughout the price cycle 
with a keen focus on cost

• Hochschild’s aim is to be a 
100% hedge free company. 
However, during the period 
of the construction of 
Inmaculada and the 
subsequent repayment of our

measures to hedge a portion 
of production in order to 
ensure sustainable cashflows 
despite significant moves in

Costs
The Company’s all-in sustaining cost was reduced by 13% in 2016 to 
$11.2 per silver equivalent ounce driven by Inmaculada’s very 
competitive $8.7 per silver equivalent ounce ($644 per gold equivalent 
ounce). A full year of production at Inmaculada, better than expected 
grades and operational initiatives contributed to the reduction. Please 
see page 25 of the Financial Review for further details on costs.
The all-in sustaining cost per silver equivalent ounce in 2017 is 
expected to be between $12.2 and $12.7 which includes the previously 
announced increased budget for brownfield exploration as well as 
further expenditure on the development of the Pablo vein. Excluding 
the increased investment in resource growth as well as the one-off 
investment in Pablo infrastructure, the all-in sustaining cost forecast is 
between $11.5 and $12.0 per silver equivalent ounce.

Production
Inmaculada has delivered a very successful first full year 
with production reaching a better than expected 229 
thousand gold equivalent ounces (16.9 million silver 
equivalent ounces) consisting of 162.7 thousand 
ounces of gold and 4.9 million ounces of silver. 
Throughout the year, grades and silver recoveries 
achieved were better than expected in the original 
mine plan in addition to higher tonnage per day being 
processed through the plant (3,850 tonnes versus 3,500 
tonnes per day). 
Costs
The all-in sustaining costs were better than expected in 
the original plan at $8.7 per silver equivalent ounce. 
This was driven by higher production resulting from 
stronger gold grades as well as operational efficiencies 
versus plan. AISC in 2017 is expected to be between 
$9.5 and $10.0 per silver equivalent ounce reflecting 
lower gold grades and a $15 million investment in the 
expansion of the tailings dam.

Production
The Pallancata mine produced 3.5 million silver 
equivalent ounces in 2016 (2015: 4.9 million ounces) 
comprising 2.6 million ounces of silver and 12.4 
thousand ounces of gold. This result reflected a 
transitional year before the introduction of commercial 
production from the new Pablo vein in 2017. 
During the fourth quarter, there was a reduction in the 
mine’s output due to a road blockade by members of a 
local community which halted production from early 
November 2016. The dispute was subsequently 
resolved with production re-commencing on 
25 January 2017.
Costs
All-in sustaining costs at Pallancata were $16.3 per 
silver equivalent ounce (2015: $15.7 per ounce). The 
moderate increase versus 2015 was due to capital 
invested in developing the access and infrastructure for 
Pablo as well as the effects of stoppage causing a 
significant fall in tonnage affecting unit costs. This was 
partially offset by increased grades and operational 
efficiencies. Costs are expected to fall substantially in 
2017 when the Pablo vein begins production.

Production
San Jose has again proved to be a solid performer with 
production of 13.7 million silver equivalent ounces 
consisting of 6.7 million ounces of silver and 95 
thousand ounces of gold. This was in line with the 2015 
result (13.9 million ounces) with a moderate increase in 
tonnage offsetting slightly lower grades. 
Costs
At San Jose, all-in sustaining costs were reduced by 18% 
to $11.5 per silver equivalent ounce (2015: $14.1 per 
ounce) mainly driven by the significant fiscal changes in 
Argentina in the first half of the year. These included 
the elimination of export taxes and the restoration of 
the Patagonian port rebate (see below). 
In November 2015, the Argentinian government 
restored the right to receive a rebate from goods 
exported through Patagonian ports (previously 
cancelled in 2009) and was applicable to Hochschild at 
a rate of approximately 9% of the FOB value of its 
exports. However, in the fourth quarter of 2016, the 
benefit was once again cancelled.
www.hochschildmining.com 21
Strategic report Reserves and resources 
T otal reserves and resources for core operations remained strong, 
reducing slightly to 183 million and 476 million silver equivalent 
ounces respectively driven by:
The reduction in the silver price assumption used for cutting both 
reserves and resources from $20.0 per ounce as at 31 December 2015 
to $16.5 per ounce as at 31 December 2016 while maintaining the gold 
price assumption at $1,200 per ounce. The resulting impact in reserves 
and resources has been a small decrease, as previously anticipated in 
the sensitivity table published in the 2015 Preliminary 
Results statement.
In addition, the Group chose to eliminate resources with a low 
probability of conversion into reserves at Arcata, San Jose and the 
existing Pallancata veins. The reduction was mostly from inferred 
resources with low grades and resources located far from existing mine 
infrastructure. At Pallancata, the adjustment affects mineral from 
bridges and pillars in the original Pallancata vein where extraction 
would impact the stability of the mine structure. Resources at 
Inmaculada and at the Pablo vein have not been affected. 
The decrease was partially offset by the addition of resources from the 
Pablo vein at Pallancata which is now over 40 million ounces with silver 
equivalent grade improving significantly to 529 silver equivalent grams 
per tonne. 
These adjustments do not affect the Group’s mine plans, future 
production or cost guidance. The Group believes that it will improve 
conversion ratios from resources into reserves and ensure a high 
quality resource base.

BROWNFIELD EXECUTION PLAN
22 Hochschild Mining plc Annual Report 2016
Operating review continued Exploration 
In September 2016, the Company announced details of a new five-year 
brownfield exploration plan. Significant brownfield potential has been 
identified which is expected to extend LOM at all operations and 
deliver additional low cost growth. 
Inmaculada
In 2016, historical drill results were reviewed by the brownfield team 
and targets for 2017 were defined. The 2017 programme includes 
approximately 50,000 metres of resource drilling in the east of the 
deposit at the Millet and Olinda structures which is expected to start 
towards the end of the second quarter, subject to obtaining the 
requisite permits. In addition, 7,200 metres of potential drilling is 
planned to start in March 2017 in the east and also at the 
Puquiopata area.
Arcata
At Arcata, 8,166 metres were drilled during the year to test  
North-South structures in the central area of the mine as well as in the 
T unel 4 zone, Roxana and Macarena veins in order to extend existing 
structures and identify new ones. Some highlights are 
presented below:
Vein Results

DDH-939-LM16:1.3m @ 3.6 g/t Au & 2,655 g/t Ag
In 2017, almost 45,000 metres of resource drilling is planned mostly in 
the first half of the year with the focus on the Paralelas, T unels 2,3 and 
4 and Ramal Mario Sur veins whilst 13,000 metres of potential drilling 
is planned in the second half of 2017 at the Alexia, Macarena East, 
T unel 2,3 and 4, T res Reyes, Luisa and Marciano structures.
Pallancata
During 2016, drilling was carried out at the new Pablo vein in 
Pallancata. The results confirmed the presence of several extensional 
vein sets adjacent to the main Pablo structure – Pablo Pisos (now 
renamed). In addition, the Company has identified an area in Pablo Piso 
that hosts higher grade mineralisation. T otal inferred resources from 
the Pablo and associated structures have now reached 40.4 million 
silver equivalent ounces which is a 78% increase on the December 
2015 figure and demonstrates the significant potential already 
discovered in the Pablo vein system.

Farallon areas.
San Jose
At San Jose 1,240m was drilled in the fourth quarter mainly in the 
Aguas Vivas area with the programme continuing into 2017. In 
addition in 2017, 20,800 metres of drilling is also planned in the 
Platifero, Clara and Saavedra Norte structures.

Strategic report The reporting currency of Hochschild Mining plc is U.S. dollars. In 
discussions of financial performance the Group removes the effect of 
exceptional items, unless otherwise indicated, and in the income 
statement results are shown both pre and post such exceptional items. 
Exceptional items are those items, which due to their nature or the 
expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, need to be 
disclosed separately on the face of the income statement to enable a 
better understanding of the financial performance of the Group and  
to facilitate comparison with prior years. 
Revenue
Gross revenue
Gross revenue from continuing operations increased by 47% to 
$722.0 million in 2016 (2015: $492.5 million) driven by a significant 
increase in sales resulting from the first full year of production  
from the Company’s Inmaculada mine as well as a rise in precious 
metal prices.
1
Silver
Gross revenue from silver increased by 30% in 2016 to $358.7 million 
(2015: $275.3 million) as a result of a 22% increase in the total amount 
of silver ounces sold to 21,091 koz (2015:17,263 koz) driven by the first 
full year contribution from Inmaculada as well as increased sales from 
Arcata and San Jose. In addition, silver revenue also benefited from a 
6% increase in the average silver price received.
Gold
Gross revenue from gold increased 67% in 2016 to $363.4 million 
(2015: $217.2 million) as a result of a 60% rise in the total amount of 
gold ounces sold in 2016 (299.0 koz) as well as a 5% increase in the 
average gold price received. The increase in gold sales came from the 
first full year of output from the predominantly gold-producing 
Inmaculada operation.
Gross average realised sales prices 
The following table provides figures for average realised prices (which 
are reported before the deduction of commercial discounts and include 
the effects of the hedging agreements in place during the year) and 
ounces sold for 2016 and 2015:
Average realised prices

Gold ounces sold (koz) 298.96 187.39
Avg. realised gold price ($/oz) 1,215 1,159
Commercial discounts
Commercial discounts refer to refinery treatment charges, refining fees 
and payable deductions for processing concentrates, and are deducted 
from gross revenue on a per tonne basis (treatment charge), per ounce 
basis (refining fees) or as a percentage of gross revenue (payable 
deductions). In 2016, the Group recorded commercial discounts of 
$34.1 million (2015: $23.6 million). The increase is explained by the 
higher production and the decision to switch the production of Arcata 
back to concentrate as opposed to the previous year when most was 
sold as doré. The ratio of commercial discounts to gross revenue in 
2016 was 5% (2015: 5%). 
Net revenue
Net revenue increased by 47% to $688.2 million (2015 $469.1 million), 
comprising net gold revenue of $354.4 million and net silver revenue of 
$333.5 million. In 2016, gold accounted for 51% and silver 49% of the 
Company’s consolidated net revenue (2015: gold 45% and silver 55%) 
with the increase in the gold contribution due to a full year of sales 
from the predominantly-gold Inmaculada mine.

Financial Review Costs
T otal cost of sales was $487.7 million in 2016 (2015: $403.7 million). 
The direct production cost excluding depreciation was higher at 
$293.8 million (2015: $265.1 million) due to the first full year of 
Inmaculada. Depreciation in 2016 was $185.7 million (2015: 
$139.5 million) with the increase due to Inmaculada’s depreciation of 
assets. Other items, which principally includes personnel related 
provisions, was $1.8 million in 2016 (2015: $9.3 million). Change in 
inventories was $6.5 million in 2016 (2015: ($10.3 million)).

26 Hochschild Mining plc Annual Report 2016
Financial Review continued Administrative expenses
Administrative expenses before exceptional items increased by 26% to 
$48.0 million (2015: $38.1 million) primarily due to increased 
personnel expenses.
Exploration expenses
In 2016, exploration expenses were flat at $9.2 million (2015: 
$9.3 million). In addition, the Group capitalises part of its brownfield 
exploration, which mostly relates to costs incurred converting potential 
resource to the Inferred or Measured and Indicated category . In 2016, 
the Company capitalised $1.3 million relating to brownfield exploration 
compared to $2.6 million in 2015, bringing the total investment in 
exploration for 2016 to $10.5 million (2015: $11.8 million). 
Selling expenses
Selling expenses decreased by 35% versus 2015 to $14.2 million (2015: 
$21.7 million) mainly due to the elimination of export duties at San 
Jose. Selling expenses in 2016 consisted mainly of logistic costs for the 
sale of concentrate in addition to approximately 1.5 months of export 
duties on concentrate until its elimination on 12 February 2016. 
Previously, export duties in Argentina were levied at 10% of revenue for 
concentrate and 5% of revenue for doré.
Other income/expenses
Other income before exceptional items was $33.1 million (2015: 
$8.0 million). This mainly consisted of income from the Patagonian 
port benefit ($16.9 million) reintroduced towards the end of 2015, 
incremental revenue from logistic services provided to third parties  
and a reduction in mine closure provisions ($6.3 million). 
Other expenses before exceptional items were reduced to $13.9 million 
(2015: $15.3 million). 
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA increased by 137% over the period to $329.0 million 
(2015: $138.8 million) driven primarily by the significant effect of a full 
year’s contribution from the low cost Inmaculada mine as well as 
higher metal prices.
Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as profit from continuing operations 
before exceptional items, net finance costs and income tax plus 
non-cash items (depreciation and changes in mine closure provisions) 
and exploration expenses other than personnel and other exploration 
related fixed expenses.

Finance income 
Finance income before exceptional items of $1.1 million reduced 
slightly from 2015 ($1.9 million) and mainly includes interest received 
on deposits.
Finance costs
Finance costs before exceptional items decreased from $31.4 million  
in 2015 to $30.5 million in 2016, principally due to the reduction of 
interest resulting from the repayment of $50.0 million of the 
medium-term loan, $57.5 million of short-term loans and $20.0 million 
of the amounts owed to Graña y Montero. In 2015, interest expenses 
were net of amounts capitalised during the construction of 
Inmaculada in line with IFRS.
Foreign exchange losses 
The Group recognised a foreign exchange loss of $1.8 million (2015: 
$5.6 million loss) as a result of exposures in currencies other than the 
functional currency specifically the Peruvian Nuevo Sol and 
Argentinian Peso.
Income tax
The Company’s pre-exceptional income tax charge was $47.6 million 
(2015: $20.4 million). The substantial increase in the charge is 
explained by the Company’s significant increase in profitability in the 
period, as well as an increase in the mining royalties paid in Peru, the 
level of which is based on the operating margin achieved by the 
Company´s Peruvian operations.
Exceptional items 
Exceptional items in 2016 totalled a $6.4 million loss after tax (2015: 
$173.3 million loss). Exceptional items principally included: a penalty 
payment for changing the energy supplier at Arcata ($4.3 million) 
which will result in energy cost savings; a $2.7 million gain on the 
reversal of the mining reserve tax in Argentina (eliminated by the 
Argentinian Government) in addition to the reversal of the associated 
interest on the reserve tax ($1.0 million); costs related to the stoppage 
at Pallancata ($2.5 million); costs related to improvements to the Ares 
tailings dam ($2.2 million); write-off of a now uncontested fee payable 
to a local authority of $1.8 million; and a property, plant and 
equipment (“PP&E”) write-off of $1.6 million. 
These items excluded the exceptional tax effect that amounted to a 
$2.2 million tax charge (2015: $36.9 million tax credit).

Operating cash flow increased from $133.3 million in 2015 to

contribution from the Inmaculada mine in addition to higher prices. 
Net cash used in investing activities decreased to $127.4 million in 
2016 from $223.3 million in 2015 mainly due to the completion of the 
Inmaculada mine in the middle of 2015. Finally, cash from financing 
activities changed to $132.2 million used in the year from $61.0 million 
generated in 2015, primarily due to the $107.4 million of debt 
repayment in 2016 versus the raising of short-term debt in Peru in 
2015 ($75.0 million). As a result, total cash flows resulted in a net 
increase of $56.5 million from a net decrease of $29.0 million in 2015

The Group’s movement in the working capital position improved by

reduction in 2015. This was primarily explained by: lower trade and 
other receivables ($41.2 million) mainly due to VAT recoveries of 
$22.0 million and a reduction in trade receivables of $25.0 million; 
positive movement in other financial (liability)/assets of $21.9 million 
from an asset position in 2015 (explained by hedging contracts), to a 
liability position in 2016 resulting from the embedded derivative 
associated with provisional pricing; and lower inventories 
($13.2 million). These effects were partially offset by lower trade and

28 Hochschild Mining plc Annual Report 2016
Financial Review continued Significant progress was made  
in 2016 on a number of fronts in 
acknowledgement of the social 
licence to operate that has been 
granted to us
Dear Shareholder
In 2016, the Group made significant progress across numerous areas  
in acknowledgement of the social licence to operate that has been 
granted to us. However, it is with great regret that we recently 
announced the accident at Inmaculada which resulted in two fatalities.  
I would like to echo the comments of the Company Chairman in 
conveying our sincere condolences to the families of those involved 
and underline the Board’s collective commitment to ensuring the 
safety of our operations.
2016 in context
Even though 2016 saw an improvement in the trading environment  
for the Company, there was continued volatility in precious metal 
prices. Given management’s focus on rebuilding the Company’s 
financial health, there has been a continual need for the many teams 
at Hochschild to prioritise the resources available to them and to 
maximise the impact of their programmes.
Safety
The accidents earlier in the year serve as a reminder of the risks in 
general in the mining industry and why it is crucial that we expend 
time and effort in constantly monitoring our practices and providing 
training to those operating in and around our mines so that our 
collective goal of zero tolerance to accidents is always at the forefront.
In isolation, 2016 represented a third consecutive year without any 
fatalities. However, in light of the fatalities in early 2017, we consider  
it imperative that we fully understand the reasons behind the latest 
accident and that all necessary steps are taken so that we can continue 
our path in reassuring colleagues of their safety. 
In terms of overall performance during the year, the Group saw 
increases of 19% in accident frequency and 24% in accident severity. 
Changes in the nature of the Group’s operations did indeed take place 
from year to year, primarily with Inmaculada transitioning from project 
to core asset, however, we do not adjust our zero appetite to breaches 
of safety. 
Our communities and the environment
In 2016, we continued to prioritise the resources committed to our 
communities with the ongoing focus on our three core areas: 
education, health and socio-economic development. Whilst the trading 
conditions did not allow us to launch any new programmes, we built 
on the significant achievements to date by increasing the reach of the 
medical services offered to our rural communities as well as 
successfully transferring our IT infrastructure project in Chalhuanca, as 
planned, to the regional and municipal authorities. Further details on 
these initiatives, as well as those of our Argentina operations can be 
found in this report and on our website. 
With regards to our environmental performance, we have made 
significant progress in terms of our usage of water, with sizeable 
reductions in water consumption at our Peruvian operations and a 
notable increase in the amount of water recycled.
I hope you will find this report informative. If you should have any 
questions or comments, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Strategic report
Sustainability Governance of Corporate Social 
Responsibility (“CSR”)
The Board has ultimate responsibility for establishing Group policies 
relating to sustainability and the CSR Committee has been established 
with the responsibility of focusing on compliance and ensuring that 
appropriate systems and practices are in place.
What is Hochschild Mining’s approach to 
sustainability?
The Company has adopted a number of policies demonstrating our 
commitment to:
• a safe and healthy workplace;
• managing and minimising the environmental impact of our 
operations; and
• encouraging sustainability by respecting the communities of the 
localities in which we operate.
For further information on how we prioritise our resources and the 
Committee’s terms of reference, please visit www.hochschildmining.

Management of sustainability 
The Board has ultimate responsibility for establishing Group policies 
relating to sustainability and ensuring that appropriate standards are 
met. The CSR Committee has been established as a formal committee 
of the Board with delegated responsibility for various sustainability 
issues, focusing on compliance and ensuring that appropriate systems 
and practices are in place Group-wide to ensure the effective 
management of sustainability-related risks. 
Safety
Given the inherently high risk profile of mining, safety is our 
highest priority.
2016 HIGHLIGHTS
• Continued implementation of the internally designed 
behaviour-based safety programme
• New Inmaculada mine achieved Level 7 certification of the 
DNV GL management system (2015: Level 5)
The Hochschild approach to safety
Mining has an inherently high risk profile and safety is our highest 
priority. Ensuring the safety of the Group’s employees is considered 
crucial in measuring the successful implementation of corporate 
strategy to which the Board and management are committed.
Our achievements in 2016
• In relation to the Group’s Safety Management System (designed by 
the risk management firm DNV GL), the safety team completed the 
necessary preparatory steps as well as the requisite training in 
advance of the migration to the 7
th
 edition of the International 
Safety Rating System;
As Chairman of the CSR Committee, Roberto Dañino has Board level 
responsibility for sustainability issues to whom the Vice President of 
Operations and the Vice President of Legal and Corporate Affairs report 
for sustainability issues. 
The CSR Committee’s work in 2016
During the year, the CSR Committee: 
• approved the 2015 Sustainability Report for inclusion in the 2015 
Annual Report;
• monitored the execution of the yearly plan in each of the four key 
areas of focus including progress updates;
• considered the priorities of the environmental team and their 
work plan;
• considered the status of the Group’s community initiatives; and
• reviewed the environmental and community relations related risks 
and related work plans.
Given the exposure of the Group’s strategy to Sustainability Risks 
(comprising Health & Safety, Community Relations and Environmental 
risks), the full Board received regular presentations on how such risks 
are managed. Furthermore, the Board received presentations from 
management on the blockade at Pallancata that was ongoing at the 
year-end but which ended early this year.
Reporting of targets and indicators
As part of the Company’s ongoing strategy to make more information 
available online, detailed sustainability related performance indicators 
as well as targets for 2017 are available on the Company’s website.
• The Inmaculada mine, which only commenced commercial 
production in the second half of 2015 succeeded in obtaining DNV 
Level 7 certification and is therefore on a par with the Group’s other, 
more established operations;
• The continued implementation of a bespoke suite of behaviour-
based safety procedures at the Peruvian operations. 
These procedures incorporate the use of a five-step process to observe 
and register safety checks. Positive reinforcement is a core part of this 
observation, which is undertaken through awards events at the 
operating units to acknowledge those who have demonstrated safety 
excellence in their operational activities.
Fatalities in February 2017
The Group regretted to announce in February 2017 that as a result of 
rockfall, two contractors were fatally injured at the Inmaculada mine.
The ongoing investigations are focusing on identifying the underlying 
causes of the accident and will result in the taking of all necessary 
steps to ensure that such accidents are avoided.

The Group’s Health & Hygiene department is tasked with providing an 
integrated approach to employee welfare.
2016 HIGHLIGHTS
• Participation of the Corporate Health Manager in industry 
discussions on new laws affecting health and safety at work 
• Additional monitoring and reporting of occupational health 
issues extended to the San Jose operation 
The Hochschild approach to health and hygiene
Underlining the importance we place on our people and their 
wellbeing, the Group’s Health & Hygiene department is tasked with 
providing an integrated approach to employee welfare. Whilst the 
Health team is focused on ensuring that employees have access to the 
relevant services and infrastructure to ensure that treatment can be 
provided, the Hygiene team looks to reinforce the importance of the 
quality of life at work through the prevention of occupational illness.
Given the nature of the work and the two-week shift patterns which 
result in frequent periods of absence from families, the Group 
recognises the importance of ensuring the mental wellbeing of its 
employees. For this reason, the Group’s Health & Hygiene teams are 
also trained in occupational psychology.
Our Health & Hygiene teams undertake their work in line with the 
following guiding principles:
• Prevention comes first
• Maximising quality of life
• Adopting measures for the long-term benefit of our people
• Proactively identifying and controlling hazards at source
• Contributing to the continuous improvement in the Group’s Health 
& Safety culture
Our achievements in 2016
In 2016, the Health team, in collaboration with other departments, 
including the Safety team, continued to go beyond its traditional area 
of prevention and sought to influence the way that employees 
approach their tasks.
During the year:
• senior members of the team participated in discussions with respect 
to new legal requirements and provided training to team 
members; and
• a comprehensive programme aimed at minimising, if not 
eradicating, exposure to harmful levels of noise was implemented 
during the year. This involved:
• the procurement of specialist monitoring equipment to gauge 
the level of exposure;
• the examination of over 700 workers at the Peruvian 
operations; and
• the preparation of informational material highlighting the risks 
and encouraging the use of protective equipment which is 
readily available.

• Workforce trained: 89% (2015: 79%)
• Average number of hours of training per year per employee: 
27.28 hours (2015: 33.33 hours)
The Hochschild approach to our people
Training and development
The quality of our people is key to the success of the business in 
achieving its strategic objectives and our ongoing objective is therefore 
to attract and retain high quality personnel. The Company’s Human 
Resource team seeks to achieve this by providing competitive 
remuneration, a positive working environment through the promotion 
of social and recreational activities, and ongoing 
professional development.
Group values, labour relations and human rights
Amongst the primary responsibilities of the Human Recources team is 
the clear communication of the Group’s corporate values: Integrity, 
T eamwork, Quality and Excellence, Responsibility and Commitment to 
our People. These values are embodied in our Code of Conduct which, 
amongst other things, sets out our undertakings to treat all employees 
fairly and to respect the right to be free of harassment or intimidation 
in the workplace. We recognise the core labour rights principles and, in 
this respect, support the right to freedom of association and 
collective bargaining.
Approximately 57% of our total workforce is represented by a trade 
union or similar body. As a signatory of the Global Compact of the 
United Nations, Hochschild Mining respects the human rights of all of 
the Company’s stakeholders including those of our employees, our 
contractors and suppliers, as well as the members of our 
local communities.
The importance placed by the Company on human rights is reflected in 
the Group’s training programme which seeks to ensure that all 
employees are aware of their rights and the Company’s commitments.
Activities in 2016
The people-focused initiatives during the year included the following:
Developing our people
In light of the limited budgetary resources, training and development 
programmes were targeted on key technical areas. In Peru, managers 
from across the mining units participated in various leadership-
based courses.
Managing our talent
The People Review process was undertaken which maps talent within 
the organisation and identifies key positions and succession plans.
Creating a better place to work and Enhancing the Working 
Environment 
The Group continues to make use of an Organisational Climate Survey 
which has been widely acknowledged as a key tool to measure levels of 
satisfaction amongst employees and to identify opportunities for 
further development. During the year, the Company continued using 
the 2016 Climate Survey results to improve conditions in our mining 
units and administrative offices.
The Group continually reviews its offering of non-financial benefits 
which currently comprise flexible working hours for Head Office staff 
over the summer period and the holding of regular social events.

Sustainability continued Working with our communities
2016 HIGHLIGHTS
• Prioritising the Group’s resources which have targeted high 
impact initiatives 
• Facilitating digital inclusion among the communities that live 
in the areas surrounding our mine operations
Our view of working with our communities
Hochschild has historically fostered a culture of collaborating with 
local communities surrounding our projects and operations to 
promote sustainable development. This is a key tenet of the Group’s 
corporate strategy that underpins our approach to mining that we 
succinctly describe as “Operating Responsibly” .
Community relations in practice
Despite the restrictions in financial resources resulting from the 
trading challenges during the year, the Group continued to prioritise 
the ongoing implementation of its social programmes with the 
communities thereby minimising any direct impact. This was largely 
achieved through more efficient internal processes and synergies in 
order to maximise the resources available for allocation.
Our achievements in 2016
During the year we accomplished the goals set for our high impact 
initiatives, further details of which are provided below.
Education
Elementary Education 
Support programmes have been implemented across various locations 
close to our Peruvian and Argentinian operations ranging from the 
provision of school meals to employment of qualified teaching staff. 
For the fourth consecutive year, the Company has supported 
approximately 340 students in 11 schools close to the new Inmaculada 
mine with the Maestro Lider initiative which seeks to enhance 
elementary literacy and numeracy.
For more information on our Sustainability indicators visit  
www.hochschildmining.com
Secondary Education 
The fourth year of the Secondary Programme of Maestro Lider has also 
been successful, with the launch of the pre-University Academy and a 
vocational orientation fair. In total, around 500 students and almost 
100 teachers participated.
Scholarships 
Through the Group’s Argentinian and Peruvian operations, Hochschild 
has provided scholarships so that students can benefit from further 
technical studies or college. In 2016, over 80 scholarships were granted.
T raining for Work 
From the Group’s Argentinian operations, almost 40 students were 
sponsored on an Introduction to Mining course and almost 30 students 
embarked on vocational courses in mining/drilling. All students were 
from the local town of Perito Moreno and were subsequently 
employed by the Group.
Donation to UTEC 
The Group facilitated a donation of US$1m to UTEC, a new  
university established in Lima offering a wide range of vocational 
training programmes.
Health
Medico de Cabecera (the T ravelling Doctor programme) 
This hugely successful programme, which aims to provide free access 
to medical care, workshops for health prevention and health education 
for local communities, continues to receive high levels of demand from 
all of our operations. In 2016, over 11,000 medical consultations were 
carried out and over 200 preventative campaigns run.
Socio-economic development
Digital Chalhuanca 
This flagship project which, in addition to bringing wi-fi access to the 
community of Chalhuanca, also sought to encourage digital inclusion. 
In its fifth year of implementation, the Group oversaw the planned 
transfer of the facility to the Regional and Municipal authorities who 
will now look to ensure that the project continues to provide invaluable 
benefits to the local community while also looking to extend its reach. 
Business Networks 
Close to the Inmaculada mine, the Group has supported families with 
their agricultural and artisanal enterprises to promote financial 
independence and to improve nutrition. 
How we performed against our 2016 community objectives
Target Status Commentary
T o increase the scope of opportunities for community-led 
commercial enterprises to provide support services for the 
Inmaculada mine.
We have designed the necessary protocols to carry out this 
initiative. We are in the process of aligning local suppliers 
with certain requirements of the mine.
T o secure the support of co-sponsors for the Group´s 
social programmes
We successfully negotiated contributions from the State for 
our Business Networks project, which will be disbursed in 
2017 and 2018. In addition, support from the local 
Municipalities was also secured.
T o facilitate the use of technology by local communities close to our 
operations through the establishment of digital centres.
Four digital centers were inaugurated in the districts of 
Oyolo, Anizo, San Javier de Alpabamba and San Francisco de 
Rivacayco, with state-of-the-art technology as well as a 
training plan for the digital inclusion of participants.

Hochschild recognises that environmental and social responsibility 
extends beyond the life of our operations and as a result, mine closure 
plans are in place to restore areas where mining activity has ceased. 
During the year, a review of a number of these plans was undertaken 
with the support of internationally recognised consultants.
Our achievements in 2016
• Continued resourcing of the environmental team with more than 
100 people working in related operational roles and 
environmental management;
• New Environmental Corporate policy launched going beyond 
compliance and promoting an environmentally conscious culture 
through, among other things, the promotion of efficient use 
of resources
• Supported the business by securing the:
• approval of Pallancata´s revised Environmental Impact 
Assessment (“EIA ”);
• approval of Inmaculada’s environmental permit to reflect new 
components and increased plant capacity; and
• environmental permits for the Arcata, Ares and Pallancata 
exploration projects.

Sustainability continued Introduction
As with all businesses, management of the Group’s operations and 
execution of its growth strategies are subject to a number of risks, the 
occurrence of which could adversely affect the performance of the 
Group. The Group’s risk management framework is premised on the 
continued monitoring of the prevailing environment, the risks posed by 
it, and the evaluation of potential actions to mitigate those risks.
The Risk Committee is responsible for implementing the Group’s policy 
on risk management and monitoring the effectiveness of controls in 
support of the Group’s business objectives. It meets four times a year 
and more frequently if required. The Risk Committee comprises the 
CEO, the Vice Presidents and the head of the internal audit function. A 
‘live’ risk matrix is reviewed which maps the significant risks faced by 
the business and updated at each Risk Committee meeting and the 
most significant risks as well as potential actions to mitigate those 
risks are reported to the Group’s Audit Committee, which has oversight 
of risk management on behalf of the Board.
2016 Risks
The key business risks affecting the Group set out in this report remain 
largely unchanged compared to those disclosed in the 2015 Risk 
Management report with the exceptions that:
Managing risk on  
behalf of the Board
The Audit Committee oversees the process of managing 
risk on behalf of the Board taking into account the Board’s 
appetite for each specific risk
• the risks associated with the Delivery of Projects are no longer 
considered to be significant as the Inmaculada asset transitioned to 
a core operation in the second half of 2015; and
• Refinancing Risk has been removed as a significant risk following the 
recovery in the commodities sector and the improvement in the 
Group’s balance sheet.
The year-on-year changes in the profile of specific risks can be 
explained as follows:
• Operational Performance risks are considered by the Board to have 
reduced following the commencement of production at 
Inmaculada; and
• Community Relations, Safety and Legal/Regulatory risks are 
regarded as having heightened due to (a) the above-mentioned 
transition of Inmaculada since the impact of those risks could 
become more severe in the context of an operating asset and (b) the 
changing social and political environment in the countries where 
the Group operates.
In addition, in order to provide a more accurate view of the change in 
the profile of environmental-related risks, the table below 
distinguishes between changes in the level of (a) the environmental 
risks arising from operations, which are considered to have reduced in 
light of the infrastructure work carried out during the year; and (b) the 
risks arising from regulatory action which are considered to have 
increased as a reflection of the regulator’s more stringent approach.

Risk Impact Mitigation Commentary
Commodity 
price
Change in risk 
profile vs 2015: 
UNCHANGED
Adverse movements in 
precious metal prices could 
materially impact the Group 
in various ways beyond a 
reduction in the results of 
operations. These include 
impacts on the feasibility of 
projects, the economics of 
the mineral resources and 
heightened personnel and 
sustainability related risks.
• Constant focus on maintaining a low  
all-in sustaining cost of production and an 
efficient level of administrative expense
• Flexible hedging policy that allows the 
Company to contract hedges to mitigate 
the effect of price movements taking  
into account the Group’s asset mix and 
forecast production
 See Our Market Review on pages 12  
to 13 for further details
The focus on conserving capital and optimising cash flow 
continued in 2016 through:
• controlling operating and administrative costs;
• optimising sustaining capital expenditure;
• reducing debt; and
• reducing working capital.
In addition to the above, the Inmaculada mine, which 
started commercial production in the second half of 2015, 
brought about a reduction in average production costs and 
diluted fixed costs.
Even though no part of 2017 production has been hedged, 
the Group’s flexible policy enables the Board to approve 
hedging contracts to protect cashflow as and when 
appropriate.

Risk Impact Mitigation Commentary
Operational 
performance
Change in risk 
profile vs 2015: 
REDUCED
Failure to meet production 
targets and manage the cost 
base could adversely impact 
the Group’s profitability.
• Close monitoring of operational 
performance, costs and capital expenditure
• Negotiation of long-term supply contracts 
where appropriate
2016 budgets across the Group continued to focus on 
maintaining controlled levels of administrative expenses 
and sustaining capital expenditure.
Production goals at all operations were met or, in the case 
of Inmaculada, exceeded with the focus on the extraction 
of profitable ounces.
The Group benefited from operational flexibility through a 
full-year’s production at Inmaculada.
Management closely monitors the wide range of risks that 
could affect operational performance to, among other 
things, ensure the adequacy and safety of key mining 
components, such as tailing dams, waste rock deposits and 
pipelines to service ongoing operations. Close liaison 
between relevant departments ensures that procurement, 
construction and any permitting are undertaken as 
appropriate.
Business 
Interruption
Change in risk 
profile vs 2015: 
HIGHER
Assets used in the Group’s 
operations may break down 
and cause stoppages with 
material effects.
• Insurance coverage to protect against 
major risks
• Management reporting systems to support 
appropriate levels of inventory
• Annual inspections by insurance brokers 
and insurers with recommendations 
addressed in order to mitigate operational 
risks
In light of the transition of Inmaculada from project to core 
asset and the high proportion of production sourced from 
that asset, the change in the risk profile vs 2015 reflects its 
heightened impact.
Mitigating actions during the year include the following:
• Insurance advisors conducted site visits and completed 
a full review of operational risks to ensure that adequate 
property damage and business interruption risk 
management processes and insurance policies are in 
place at our operations.
• Management reporting systems ensured that an 
appropriate level of inventory of critical parts is 
maintained.
• Adequate preventative maintenance programmes, 
supported by the SAP Maintenance Module, are in place 
at the operating units.
Exploration 
and Reserve  
& Resource 
Replacement
Change in risk 
profile vs 2015: 
UNCHANGED
The Group’s operating 
margins and future 
profitability depend upon its 
ability to find mineral 
resources and to replenish 
reserves.
• Implementing and maintaining an annual 
exploration drilling plan
• Ongoing evaluation of acquisition and joint 
venture opportunities to acquire additional 
ounces
• High-end software programmes 
implemented to improve the estimate of 
mineral resources
In 2016 all brownfield exploration goals were achieved, 
including the discovery of additional resources at the Pablo 
vein at Pallancata.
The continued focus on cost control has resulted in our 
exploration activity being primarily focused on current 
operations.
In 2017, exploration of new projects and appraisal of 
acquisition/joint venture opportunities restarted given the 
Group’s improved financial position.
As mentioned in the CEO’s statement, the Company has 
undertaken a conservative re-evaluation of its Reserves and 
Resources which (a) reflects lower commodity price 
assumptions and (b) excludes material that has a low 
probability of being mined.
Reserves stated in this 
Annual Report are estimates.
• Engagement of independent experts to 
undertake annual audit of mineral reserve 
and resource estimates
• Adherence to the JORC code and guidelines 
therein
The Group has engaged P&E Consultants to undertake the 
annual audit of mineral reserve and resource estimates.
 See pages 139 to 141 for further details
Personnel: 
Recruitment 
and retention
Change in risk 
profile vs 2015: 
LOWER
Inability to retain or attract 
personnel through a 
shortage of skilled personnel.
• The Group’s approach to recruitment and 
retention provides for the payment of 
competitive compensation packages, well 
defined career plans, and training and 
development opportunities
The Group has continued with its initiatives to improve  
the retention of employees. These include the use of 
non-financial benefits (e.g. flexible working arrangements 
for Head Office staff) and tailored personal development 
plans
The improvement in the sector as a whole is the principal 
reason why the profile of this risk has reduced relative  
to 2015.
Personnel: 
Labour 
relations
Change in risk 
profile vs 2015: 
UNCHANGED
Failure to maintain good 
labour relations with 
workers and/or unions may 
result in work slowdown, 
stoppage or strike.
• Development of a tailored labour relations 
strategy focusing on profit sharing, working 
conditions, management style, 
development opportunities, motivation and 
communication
Given the losses incurred in previous years by the Peruvian 
operating entity, there continues to be no statutory profit 
sharing for Peruvian mineworkers.
Management has conducted monthly meetings with 
mineworkers and unions during 2016 to ensure a complete 
understanding of their requirements and concerns and to 
keep all parties updated on the Group’s financial 
performance with the aim of preparing the groundwork for 
the 2017 union negotiations.

Change in risk 
profile vs 2015: 
HIGHER
Changes in the legal, tax and 
regulatory landscape could 
result in significant 
additional expense, 
restrictions on or 
suspensions of operations 
and may lead to delays in the 
development of current 
operations and projects.
• Local specialist personnel continually 
monitor and react, as necessary, to policy 
changes
• Active dialogue with governmental 
authorities
• Participation in local industry organisations
As an electoral year, 2016 saw the mining industry in Peru 
become the subject of heightened political debate. In the 
period leading to the elections and during the transition to 
a new administration, no new governmental measures 
were taken and various permitting processes saw their 
timelines extended which continues to be the case.
Even though the new government that assumed office in 
July 2016 is supportive of business, the risk of social 
conflicts has become heightened in certain parts of the 
country to which the authorities remain sensitive.
In addition, a number of new laws were introduced during 
the year relating to, among other things (a) the permissible 
limits of chemicals in stored tailings and (b) various aspects 
of health and safety at mining operations.
In Argentina, 2016 was marked by relative stability 
following the Presidential elections in October 2015 where 
the new government placed inward investment as a key 
priority.
With regards to specific developments:
• the Supreme Court agreed to hear the merits of the 
Company’s claim challenging the constitutionality of a 
proposed Reserves tax which was subsequently 
withdrawn by the relevant Province; and
• in late 2016, the Argentinian Government removed  
the benefit received by those exporting through 
Patagonian ports.

Risk Impact Mitigation Commentary
Health and 
safety
Change in risk 
profile vs 2015: 
HIGHER
Group employees working in 
the mines may be exposed 
to health and safety risks.
Failure to manage these risks 
may result in occupational 
illness, accidents, a work 
slowdown, stoppage or strike 
and/or may damage the 
reputation of the Group and 
hence its ability to operate.
• Health and Safety operational policies and 
procedures reflect the Group’s zero 
tolerance approach to accidents
• Use of world class DNV safety management 
systems
• Dedicated personnel to ensure the safety of 
employees at the operations via stringent 
controls, training and prevention 
programmes
• Rolling programme of training, 
communication campaigns and other 
initiatives promoting safe working practices
• Use of reporting and management 
information systems to monitor the 
incidence of accidents and enable 
preventative measures to be implemented
The change in risk profile vs 2015 primarily reflects:
• the fact that Inmaculada was an operating asset for the 
whole of 2016; and
• the increased use of less mechanised processes at 
Pallancata in light of the narrower veins being mined.
In 2016, the Group achieved its on-going objective of Zero 
Fatalities for the third consecutive year. As reported earlier 
in the Chairman’s statement and Sustainability Report, the 
Board was saddened to report the fatalities that occurred 
at the Inmaculada mine in the first quarter of 2017.

taken to reinforce the Group’s safety values can

required to undertake 
corrective actions or 
extensive remedial clean-up 
action or pay for 
governmental remedial 
clean-up actions or be 
subject to fines and/or 
penalties.
• The Group has a team responsible for 
environmental management
• The Group has adopted a number of 
policies and procedures to limit and 
monitor its environmental impact
Environmental permitting and oversight have become 
more rigorous, leading to delays in project execution and 
increases in fines from the environmental regulator. 
In 2016, the Group has taken a series of measures to 
mitigate this risk, including:
• establishing a Permitting Committee, with the 
participation of all relevant departments, that meets 
bi-weekly to assess the status of all permitting 
applications and ensure that the process is carried out 
as efficiently as possible;
• the launch of new Environmental Key Performance 
Indicators;
• implementation of state-of-the-art water quality 
management tool that allows for real time monitoring 
of all water discharges from the operations;
• completing the staffing of the environmental team with 
professionals working in related operational and 
environmental management roles;
• strengthening our environmental culture, improving 
overall housekeeping throughout our operations, 
reducing water consumption and solid waste generation;
• continuing to improve water treatment infrastructure, 
at Pallancata, Inmaculada, Arcata and the closed Sipan 
mine; and
• reviewed and updated Mine Closure Plans, in some 
cases with the support of internationally renowned 
environmental consultants
Community 
Relations
Change in risk 
profile vs 2015: 
HIGHER
Communities living in the 
areas surrounding 
Hochschild’s operations may 
oppose the activities carried 
out by the Group at existing 
mines or, with respect to 
development projects and 
prospects, may invoke their 
rights to be consulted under 
new laws.
These actions may result  
in loss of productions, 
increased costs and 
decreased revenues and in 
longer lead times and 
additional costs for 
exploration and bringing 
assets into production and 
lead to an adverse impact on 
the Group’s ability to obtain 
the relevant permissions for 
current or future projects.
• Constructive engagement with local 
communities
• Community Relations strategy focuses on 
promoting education, health and nutrition, 
and sustainable development
• Allocation of budget and personnel for the 
provision of community support activities
• Policy to actively recruit workers from local 
communities
The higher risk profile vs 2015 reflects the increase in the 
incidence of social conflicts in the areas surrounding the 
Group’s operations. Such conflicts have led to temporary 
stoppages at other mining operations such as Las Bambas 
and Constancia.
Protests by a community close to the Pallancata mine 
resulted in a blockade by community members from 
November 2016 until mid-January 2017. Even though the 
mine stopped producing from 1 December, Pallancata’s 
targeted production was not impacted. Government 
intervention resulted in the lifting of the blockade after an 
informal mediation between the Company and the 
relevant community representatives.
Working groups with stakeholders groups near Inmaculada 
continue to meet periodically.
In addition, the Group continues to actively engage with 
other local communities to fully understand their needs 
and to implement an action plan, to the extent possible.
The risk of additional stoppages or blockades will continue 
to be present if the working groups do not reach long-term 
agreements between the parties involved.

sustainability risks can be found in the Sustainability 
report on pages 29 to 34
38 Hochschild Mining plc Annual Report 2016
Risk management & viability continued Viability
In accordance with provision C.2.1 of the Code, the Directors have 
assessed the viability of the Group taking into account the Group’s 
current position and the potential impact of the principal risks which 
could threaten the business model, future performance, solvency or 
liquidity of the Group.
Period of Viability Statement
As per provision C2.2 the Directors have reviewed the length of time to 
be covered by the Viability Statement, particularly given its primary 
purpose of providing investors with a view of financial viability that 
goes beyond the period of the Going Concern statement. 
It has been concluded that three years is the appropriate time horizon 
in light of:
i. the inherent uncertainty of longer-term forecasting in a cyclical 
industry which, in the case of precious metals, is largely driven by 
global macro-economic factors; and
ii. the large number of external variables that need to be taken into 
account in establishing any meaningful forecast of the 
Group’s business.
Approach to Assessing Viability
In assessing the Group’s viability, the Directors have considered the 
principal risks to which the Group is exposed as set out in the earlier 
part of this report. This includes those where either the likelihood of 
the risk has increased, or the impact of the risk has become more 
severe. In particular, the Directors have considered forecasts which 
reflect the impact of: 
• Depressed precious metal price scenarios. This is a key input for 
stress-testing and involved the preparation of forecasts using (i) 
lowest metal prices over the past five years for both gold and silver 
($1,100/Au oz and $14/Ag oz respectively); and (ii) below-spot prices 
of $1,100/Au oz and $16/Ag oz. 
Should prices fall further than the lowest of these scenarios, the 
Board would oversee the implementation of contingency actions, 
such as the elimination of discretionary expenditure, the reduction if 
not the elimination of dividend distributions and other initiatives to 
reduce costs across the business so as to maximise the production 
of profitable ounces.
• Risks that severely threaten forecast production levels. The principal 
risks that could jeopardise production are those arising from (a) 
geological risk that could result in the variability of our reserves and 
production volume and grades; (b) community unrest that could 
result in temporary stoppages; (c) environmental incidents that 
could also temporarily affect an operation’s production schedule; 
and (d) delays in obtaining operational permits. 
Management prepares operational and financial forecasts based on 
a life of mine plan assuming only reserves and resources which have 
an adequate degree of certainty. For this reason, forecasts do not 
reflect the potential of incremental resources added as a result of 
exploration activity which could be easily converted to actual 
production given the availability of spare capacity at its plants. This 
state of preparedness, together with the mitigating actions 
described above, have been designed to control the impact of 
production risks or facilitate the swift recovery from the impact of 
those risks; and
• Plausible future contingencies for example, governmental/
regulatory action such as environmental liabilities, controls against 
which are described in the table above. 
The viability statement analysis has also taken into account other 
mitigating actions available to the Group upon the occurrence of one 
or more of the principal risks. Such actions include:
• Hedging the price at which sales contracts are settled;
• Operational strategies to anticipate, minimise and overcome 
production-related risks;
• The implementation of cost and capital expenditure reduction 
programmes; 
• Working capital management; and
• Active debt financing management.
For examples of the mitigating actions taken by the Board during the 
year under review, please refer to the Commentary in the Risk 
Management section of this report.
Conclusion
While it is always possible that combinations of weak precious metal 
prices and adverse operational risks could threaten the solvency and 
liquidity of the Company over the next three years, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over three years being 
the period of their assessment.

the date of this report are given on page 40. 
Eileen Kamerick and Sanjay Sarma were appointed to the Board on 1 
November 2016 and 1 January 2017 respectively and all other Directors

With the exception of Roberto Dañino and Nigel Moore, who will be 
retiring at the conclusion of the forthcoming AGM, each of the Directors 
will be retiring and seeking re-election by shareholders at the AGM in 
line with the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
Directors’ and officers’ liability insurance 
The Company’s Articles of Association contain a provision whereby each 
of the Directors is indemnified by the Company in respect of liability in 
relation to: (i) any negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust 
relating to the Company or any associated company; (ii) execution of 
his/her duties as Director of the Company; and (iii) the activities of the 
Company or any associated company as trustee of an occupational 
pension scheme. For these purposes, associated company has the 
meaning given to it by Section 256 of the Companies Act 2006. 
However, a Director will not be indemnified for any liability incurred by 
him/her to the Company or Group companies; any criminal or 
regulatory fines; the costs of defending any criminal proceedings in 
which he is convicted; or the costs of defending any civil proceedings 
brought by the Company in which judgment is given against him/her. 
The Company has purchased and maintains liability insurance for its 
Directors and officers as permitted by law. 
Political and charitable donations 
The Company does not make political donations. During the year, the 
Group spent US$4.389m
1
 on social and community welfare activities 
surrounding its mining units (2015: US$3.971m). 
1 Including at San Jose, the Group’s joint venture in which it has a 51% interest  
Relationship agreement 
Pelham Investment Corporation (the ‘Major Shareholder’), Eduardo 
Hochschild (who, together with the Major Shareholder are collectively 
referred to as the ‘Controlling Shareholders’) and the Company entered 
into a relationship agreement (‘the Relationship Agreement’) in 
preparation for the Company’s IPO in 2006 and which was amended 
and restated during 2014. 
The principal purpose of the Relationship Agreement is to ensure  
that the Group is capable of carrying on its business for the benefit  
of the shareholders of the Company as a whole, and that transactions 
and relationships with the Controlling Shareholders and any of  
their respective associates are at arm’s length and on normal 
commercial terms. 
Further details of the Relationship Agreement with regard to the 
conduct of the Major Shareholder are set out in the Corporate 
Governance report on page 45 and, with regard to the right to  
appoint Directors to the Board, are set out on page 46. 
As required by the FCA Listing Rules, the Directors confirm that, with 
respect to the year under review: 
i. the Company has complied with the independence provisions 
included in the Relationship Agreement; and 
ii. so far as the Company is aware: 
a. the independence provisions included in the Relationship 
Agreement have been complied with by the Controlling 
Shareholders or any of their associates; and 
b. the procurement obligation included in the Relationship 
Agreement has been complied with by the Controlling 
Shareholders. 
Conflicts of interest 
The Companies Act 2006 allows directors of public companies to 
authorise conflicts and potential conflicts of interest of directors where 
the Company’s Articles of Association contain a provision to that effect. 
Shareholders approved amendments to the Company’s Articles of 
Association at the AGM held on 9 May 2008, which included provisions 
giving the Directors authority to authorise matters which may result in 
the Directors breaching their duty to avoid a conflict of interest. 
The Board has established effective procedures to enable the Directors 
to notify the Company of any actual or potential conflict situations and 
for those situations to be reviewed and, if appropriate, to be authorised 
by the Board, subject to any conditions that may be considered 
necessary. In keeping with the approach agreed by the Board, Directors’ 
conflicts were reviewed during the year under review. 
Directors of the Company who have an interest in matters under 
discussion at Board meetings are required to declare this interest and to 
abstain from voting on the relevant matters. Any related party 
transactions are approved by a committee of the Board consisting solely 
of Independent Directors. In addition, the Directors will be able to 
impose limits or conditions when giving any authorisation, if they think 
this is appropriate.

Going concern 
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect 
its future development, performance and position are set out in the 
Strategic Report from the Inside Front Cover to page 39. The financial 
position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowings 
are described in the Financial Review on pages 24 to 28. In addition, note 
36 to the financial statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies 
and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management 
objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities; 
and its exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk.  
As described in the Market experience on pages 12 and 13, 2016 saw 
continued volatility in precious metal prices which experienced steady 
and significant increases by the early part of the second half of the year 
which subsequently trended downwards by the year-end. 
The Group has reported record levels of production of 35.5 million 
attributable silver equivalent ounces and successfully reduced costs 
across its operations with Inmaculada, in particular, performing 
significantly better than anticipated. 
As part of its risk management responsibilities, the Board continually 
reviews a list of contingency measures that could be implemented in the 
event that price conditions deteriorate. 
In conclusion, having considered financial forecasts and projections 
which take into account (i) possible changes in commodity price 
scenarios; and (ii) the contingency measures that could be taken to 
alleviate pressure on the balance sheet in the event of a fall in prices, the 
Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and the 
Company have adequate resources, including access to contingent 
resources, that would see it continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements. 
AGM 
The eleventh AGM of the Company will be held at 3 pm on 11 May 2017 
at the offices of Linklaters LLP. The shareholder circular incorporating the 
Notice of AGM will be sent separately to shareholders or, for those who 
have elected to receive electronic communications, will be available for 
viewing at www.hochschildmining.com 
The shareholder circular contains details of the business to be 
considered at the meeting. 
Auditor 
A resolution to reappoint Ernst & Young LLP as Auditor will be put to 
shareholders at the forthcoming AGM. 
Statement on disclosure of information to auditor 
Having made enquiries of fellow Directors and of the Company’s 
Auditor, each Director confirms that, to the best of his/her knowledge 
and belief, there is no relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s Auditor are unaware. Furthermore, each Director has taken 
all the steps that he/she ought to have taken as a Director in order to 
make himself/herself aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s Auditor are aware of that information. 
This confirmation is given, and should be interpreted, in accordance with 
the provisions of Section 418(2) of the Companies Act 2006. 
Statement of directors with respect to the annual 
report and financial statements 
As required by the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Directors confirm 
that they consider that the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Comp any’s performance, business model 
and strategy. 
Statement of directors’ responsibilities 
The Directors confirm that to the best of their knowledge: 
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable 
set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and 
• the Management Report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face. 
Disclaimer 
Neither the Company nor the Directors accept any liability to any person 
in relation to this Annual Report except to the extent that such liability 
could arise under English law. Accordingly, any liability to a person who 
has demonstrated reliance on any untrue or misleading statement or 
omission shall be determined in accordance with Section 90A of the 
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.

Corporate governance report 
44 Hochschild Mining plc Annual Report 2016 
Dear shareholder 
One of my key roles as Chairman is to ensure that the Board operates 
effectively with the right set of skills demanded of us as Directors to 
ensure that we can oversee the successful implementation of the 
Group’s strategy. 
After the challenges faced by the business in the aftermath of the 
significant falls in silver and gold prices, the relative trading stability of 
2016 provided the Board with a fuller opportunity to review its 
effectiveness and to implement the succession plan that had been put 
on hold. 
As reported more fully in the Nominations Committee report below, we 
were delighted to be able to announce the appointments of Eileen 
Kamerick and Sanjay Sarma as Non-Executive Directors. These 
appointments were made with succession in mind since, as already 
announced, Roberto Dañino and Nigel Moore will be stepping down at 
the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. Both have served as Directors 
since the Company’s listing in 2006 and the Board has benefited 
enormously from their contributions. 
A key aspect of the Corporate Governance Code is the ongoing 
refreshing of the Board and hence, Eileen and Sanjay’s appointments 
will bring not only added diversity to the Board, but also different 
perspectives given their background and professional experience; in the 
case of Eileen, in relation to matters of audit and risk, and in the case of 
Sanjay, the potential for innovation within the mining industry.  
As Directors, we are rightly expected to have a deep understanding of 
the business and the environment in which we operate. We were able to 
achieve this during 2016 through various means. Given the increased 
proportion of gold produced by the Group, as part of the annual 
strategic Board session, the Directors received a presentation from a 
representative of the World Gold Council which provided a detailed 
update on the economics driving demand and the outlook for the sector. 
In addition, at the operational level, a site visit was organised for Board 
members to visit our newest operation, Inmaculada which incorporated 
presentations from managers in the mine and the plant. Finally, the 
Board is kept updated on the ongoing changing landscape of regulation 
and market practice that affects the Company and the Board from its 
advisers, both externally and internally. 
The continuation of the highly valued internal Board evaluation has, yet 
again, produced a number of improvements in the way the Board 
undertakes its role. It has also sourced themes from the Directors on 
areas for future consideration that have been, and will be incorporated 
into the annual Board schedule. Further details on this process can be 
found on page 47. 
If you should have any queries arising from this report, please do not 
hesitate to contact me. 
Eduardo Hochschild 
Chairman 
7 March 2017 
 
 
Introduction 
This report, together with the Directors’ Remuneration Report, describes 
how the Company has applied the Main Principles of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (‘the Code’) (2014 edition) in respect of the year ended 
31 December 2016. A copy of the Code is available on the website of the 
Financial Reporting Council (‘FRC’) at www.frc.org.uk 
Disclosures to be included in the Corporate Governance report in 
relation to share structure, shareholder agreements and the Company’s 
constitutional provisions pursuant to the Disclosure Guidance and 
Transparency Rules are provided in the Supplementary Information 
section on pages 54 to 56. 
Statement of compliance 
The Board confirms that, in respect of the year under review, the Group 
has complied with the provisions contained in the Code with the 
exception that the Company did not fully comply with the requirement 
that performance-related incentive schemes should include 
arrangements to recover or withhold variable pay when appropriate to 
do so (ie clawback or malus). As stated in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report, the Company reviewed the use of clawback during the year 
which, following legal advice, would be difficult to enforce in the 
countries in which we operate. As previously reported, malus is 
incorporated in the Group’s incentive schemes, pursuant to which any 
vested award may be reduced in the event of an unacceptable position 
arising in relation to safety, environment, community and legal 
compliance. 
The Board 
The Board is responsible for approving the Company’s strategy and 
monitoring its implementation, for overseeing the management of 
operations and for providing leadership and support to the senior 
management team in achieving sustainable added value for 
shareholders. It is also responsible for enabling the efficient operation of 
the Group by providing adequate financial and human resources and an 
appropriate system of financial cont rol to ensure these resources are 
fully monitored and utilised. 
There is an agreed schedule of matters reserved for the Board which 
includes the approval of annual and half-yearly results, the Group’s 
strategy, the annual budget and major items of capital expenditure. 
Composition 
At all times during the year, the Board comprised a majority of 
Independent Non-Executive Directors. At the end of the year, the Board 
comprised the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer and seven Non-
Executive Directors, of whom six are considered, by the Board, to be of 
independent judgement and character. 
Chairman and Chief Executive 
The Board is led by the Chairman, Eduardo Hochschild who is also the 
majority shareholder of the Company with a 54% holding. 
The Board has approved a document which sets out the division of 
responsibilities between the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. This 
document was last reviewed and amended by the Board in 2015 in light 
of the change in Eduardo Hochschild’s role to Non-Executive Chairman. 
As Chairman, Eduardo Hochschild is responsible for leading the Board of 
Directors and ensuring that the Board is enabled to play a full and 
constructive part in the development and determination of the Group’s 
strategy and overall commercial objectives. 
Ignacio Bustamante, as the Chief Executive Officer, is responsible for the 
formulation of the vision and long-term corporate strategy of the Group 
the approval of which is a matter for the full Board. 
The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for leading an executive team 
in the day-to-day management of the Group’s business.

Governance
 
www.hochschildmining.com 45 
In light of his majority shareholding, the Chairman is not considered to 
be independent. However, during the one-to-one interviews conducted 
with each Board member, the Directors continue to assert that no 
undue influence is exercised. 
The reasons for this are twofold. Firstly, the composition of the Board 
ensures that the significant presence of Independent Directors ensures 
that the views of minority shareholders are well represented. Secondly, 
the undertakings provided in the Relationship Agreement (as described 
below) ensure that the Company and its subsidiaries are capable of 
carrying on their business independently of Eduardo Hochschild and his 
associates. 
The Relationship Agreement was reviewed by the Board in 2014 
following the implementation of new Listing Rules applicable to listed 
companies with controlling shareholders (the ‘New Listing Rules’). As a 
result, an amended and restated Relationship Agreement was approved 
and adopted which, in addition to being the subject of a general update, 
incorporated revised independence provisions reflecting the language of 
the New Listing Rules. 
Under the terms of the agreement, each of Eduardo Hochschild and 
Pelham Investment Corporation (being the entity through which  
he holds his shares in the Company) (the “Major Shareholder”) 
undertakes that: 
i. all transactions with the Company (and its subsidiaries) will be 
conducted at arm’s length and on normal commercial terms  
ii. neither of them (nor their associates) (the ‘Relevant Parties’) will take 
any action that would have the effect of preventing the Company 
from complying with its obligations under the Listing Rules; 
iii. the Relevant Parties will not propose, and neither will they procure 
the proposal of, a shareholder resolution intended or which appears 
to be intended to circumvent the proper application of the Listing 
Rules; and 
iv. the Relevant Parties will not take any action that would preclude or 
inhibit any member of the Group from carrying on its business 
independently of any of them. 
Certain confirmations are required to be given by the Board under the 
New Listing Rules with regards to the Company’s compliance with the 
independent provisions which can be found in the Directors’ Report on 
page 42. 
Senior Independent Director 
Enrico Bombieri is the Senior Independent Director and, as such, acts as a 
central point of contact for the Non-Executive Directors collectively but 
also acts as a conduit between the Non-Executive Directors and the 
executive management team. 
Although no such meetings were held, Mr Bombieri makes himself 
available to meet with major shareholders during the year if concerns 
have not been addressed by the executive team. 
Non-Executive Directors 
All of the Company’s Non-Executive Directors hold, or have held, senior 
positions in the corporate sector and bring their experience and 
independent perspective to enhance the Board’s capacity to help 
develop proposals on strategy and to oversee and grow the operations 
within a sound framework of corporate governance. 
Details of the tenure of appointment of Non-Executive Directors are 
provided in the Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
 
Independence of the Non-Executive Directors 
The Board considers that all of the Non-Executive Directors are 
independent of the Company with the exception of Roberto Dañino in 
light of his previous role as an Executive Director and his ongoing role as 
Special Adviser to the Chairman and senior management team. 
In reaching this conclusion, the Board has taken into account the fact 
that Jorge Born and Nigel Moore (the “IPO Non-Executive Directors”) 
were appointed to the Board in 2006 shortly before the Company’s IPO 
and have therefore served as Directors for more than nine years. This 
being the case, however, the Board collectively feels that the tenure of 
each IPO Non-Executive Director is not considered to be of a nature to 
materially interfere with the exercise of his independent judgment. 
As previously announced, Roberto Dañino and Nigel Moore will be 
retiring from the Board at the conclusion of the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting.  
Board meetings held in 2016 
During the year, four scheduled Board meetings were held which were 
attended by all directors. Directors usually receive a full pack of papers 
for consideration at least five working days in advance of each scheduled 
Board meeting. In the event a Director is unable to attend a Board or 
Committee meeting, comments are encouraged to be fed back to the 
Chairman of the relevant meeting who ensures that the absent 
Director’s views are represented. 
Senior executives of the organisation are invited to attend Board 
meetings and to make presentations on their areas of responsibility. 
In addition to the regular updates from across the business, the principal 
matters considered by the Board during 2016 were:  
Financial 
• stress-tested financial projections in support of the going concern and 
viability statements;  
• considered recommendations of the Audit Committee to adopt the 
2015 Annual Report and Accounts and the 2016 Half-Yearly Report 
including the resumption of the interim dividend; 
• reviewing the Group’s ongoing financial position and alternative debt 
financing options; 
• appointment of RBC Europe as joint corporate broker; and 
• the 2017 budget. 
Strategy 
• the Group’s strategic plan which was supplemented by a 
presentation from the World Gold Council on the economic 
conditions affecting the demand for gold and the outlook for the 
metal; and 
• presentation on the long-term trends impacting the markets for 
metals and minerals.

In between Board meetings, Directors are kept informed of latest 
developments through monthly management reports on the 
Company’s operations, exploration activity and financial situation. 
 
Appointments and re-election of Directors 
Board nominations are recommended to the Board by the Nominations 
Committee. The process undertaken during the year in relation to the 
appointment of Eileen Kamerick is further detailed in the Nominations 
Committee report on page 51. 
The Company has adopted the practice of seeking the annual re-election 
of Directors in keeping with the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
Biographies of the Directors can be found on page 40. 
Under the terms of the Relationship Agreement, the Major Shareholder 
has (i) the right to appoint up to two Non-Executive Directors to the 
Board for so long as the Major Shareholder holds an interest of 30% or 
more in the Company and (ii) the right to appoint one Non-Executive 
Director for so long as it has an interest of 15% or more in the Company, 
and in each case to remove any such Director(s) previously appointed. 
The Relationship Agreement continues for so long as the Company’s 
shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange or until such times as 
the Controlling Shareholders (including Eduardo Hochschild) cease to 
own or control in aggregate a minimum of 15% of the issued share 
capital or voting rights of the Company. 
To date, the Major Shareholder has not exercised this right. 
Board development 
It is the responsibility of the Chairman to ensure that the Directors 
update their knowledge and their skills and are provided with the 
necessary resources to continue to do so. This is achieved through the 
various means described as follows. 
Induction 
New Board appointees are offered the opportunity to meet with key 
management personnel and the Company’s principal advisers as well as 
undertaking visits to the Group’s operations. 
Briefings 
The Directors receive regular briefings from the Company Secretary on 
their responsibilities as Directors of a UK listed company and on relevant 
developments in the area of corporate governance. In addition, the 
Directors have ongoing access to the Company’s officers and advisers. 
Advice 
The Company has procedures by which members of the Board may take 
independent professional advice at the Company’s expense in the 
furtherance of their duties.

 2016 BOARD EVALUATION 
• In keeping with past practice, the 2016 Board evaluation proce ss was undertaken through one-to-one interviews conducted by the Senior 
Independent Director assisted by the Company Secretary. 
• The interviews were structured to seek Directors’ views on a number of subject areas including those outlined below. 
 
 The Committees 
• Composition and overall workings 
• Specific aspects of each Committee’s role and scope of 
responsibilities 
The Board 
• The composition of the Board, focusing on the skills mix after the 
planned retirements from the Board 
• The effectiveness of the Non-Executive Directors as a collective 
group 
• The workings of the Board 
• Strategic planning and governance 
 Risk and Culture 
• A review of the process of managing risk within the risk appetite of 
the Board 
• Exploring views on the Group’s corporate culture and the perceived 
alignment between the culture around the Board table with that 
across the organisation 
In addition to the above, Directors were requested to provide feedback 
on the performance of the Chairman and fellow Board members. 
 
 
Company Secretary 
The Company Secretary is appointed and removed by the Board and is 
responsible for advising the Board on governance matters and the 
provision of administrative and other services to the Board. All the 
Directors have access to the Company Secretary. 
Board evaluation 
The Board is committed to the process of continuous improvement 
which is achieved in particular by the internally led Board evaluation 
process. 
Implementation of 2015 Board evaluation 
A number of actions were taken during the year following the 2015 
Board evaluation process. These included: 
• re-formatting of the reports to the Corporate Social Responsibility 
(‘CSR’) Committee to facilitate a better understanding of the CSR 
related risks to which the Group is exposed; 
• a wider benchmarking review of executive remuneration conducted 
by the Remuneration Committee; 
• suggestions on the form and content of the annual strategic review; 
and 
• a presentation to the Audit Committee on the Group’s IT security 
framework. 
2016 Board evaluation 
Evaluation of the Board and Committees 
The findings relating to the evaluation of the Board and the Committees 
were considered collectively by the Chairman and Enrico Bombieri as the 
Senior Independent Director and the resulting recommendations were 
discussed and, where appropriate, approved by the Board. 
Evaluation of the Chairman 
The findings of the Chairman’s performance evaluation were collated by 
Enrico Bombieri and put to the Non-Executive Directors before being 
relayed to the Chairman. 
 
Outcome 
The principal recommendations arising from the 2016 Board evaluation 
process can be summarised as follows: 
• improved feedback between the Committees and the full Board, 
particularly in relation to remuneration matters; 
• focus on the succession plans in pl ace to ensure the development of 
talent to Vice President level; 
• the use of a third-party facilitator to support the annual strategic 
session; and 
• supplementing the monthly Board reports with additional 
information to keep the Directors abreast of external perspectives on 
the Company and the operations. 
External Board evaluation 
Since the process was introduced, the Directors unanimously consider 
that it has resulted in a number of recommendations that have 
improved the way the Board and the Committees function. For this 
reason and the focus of the management team to control costs during 
2016, an externally led evaluation was not undertaken. The Board 
acknowledges the benefits of an external appraisal of the overall 
governance structure and processes and, while it is minded to continue 
using an internal evaluation, the format of the 2017 evaluation will be 
kept under review. 
The Board’s Committees 
The Board has delegated authority to the Audit Committee, CSR 
Committee, Nominations Committee and Remuneration Committee. 
Reports from each of these committees on their activities during the 
year appear on the following pages. Further information on the activities 
of the CSR Committee and Remuneration Committee can be found in 
the Sustainability Report and Directors’ Remuneration Report 
respectively.  48 Hochschild Mining plc Annual Report 2016

Committee which are described later in this report, in 2016 we 
looked at a variety of issues. For example, one of the key 
responsibilities of the Committee is to ensure that processes are in 
place to identify significant risks to the business and to oversee the 
programme of the necessary mitigation plans. In this regard, the 
Committee received a presentation in order to fully appreciate the 
level of exposure to any form of unauthorised access to the Group’s 
many IT systems. 
Another significant matter during the year was the tender for the 
Group audit engagement which the Committee decided to 
organise given the rotation of the signing partner at EY, which has 
been the Group’s auditors sinc e 2006. The process commenced 
with the issue of a Request For Proposal that was sent to 
shortlisted audit firms who were selected on set criteria which 
included proven expertise in the mining sector and more 
fundamentally, a sizeable presence in Peru where the Group is 
headquartered, as well as experience of auditing UK listed entities.  
Presentations were then given to a Working Group comprising 
members of the Audit Committee, the CFO and other senior 
members of management. In conclusion, it was decided that Ernst 
& Young LLP would be retained as the Group’s external auditors. 
The performance of EY will of course continue to be closely 
monitored by the Committee. 
Finally, we welcomed Eileen Kamerick as an additional Committee 
member from 1 November 2016; she will be succeeding me as 
Audit Committee Chair following my retirement from the Board at 
the forthcoming AGM.

Attendees 
The lead partner of the external Auditor, Ernst & Young LLP, the 
Chairman of the Company, the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief 
Financial Officer and the Head of Internal Audit attend each Audit 
Committee meeting by invitation. 
The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee. 
Activity during the year 
The following matters featured amongst those considered by the 
Committee during the year: 
• Financial reporting – The 2015 Annual Report and Accounts and the 
2016 Half-Yearly Report were reviewed by the Committee before 
recommending that they be adopted by the Board. In its review of 
these financial reports, the Audit Committee reviewed accounting 
policies, estimates and judgements applied in preparing the relevant 
statements and the transparency and clarity of disclosures contained 
within them. 
• Review of audit plans – In line with its usual practice, the Committee 
considered reports from the external Auditor on the scope and 
structure of the review of the half-yearly results and audit of the 
annual results. 
• Risk management – Consideration and challenge of risk management 
assessments which incorporate a risk matrix detailing (i) the most 
significant risks facing the Group; (ii) an evaluation reflecting the 
likelihood of the occurrence of the risk and the extent of the potential 
impact on the Group, and (iii) commentary on the steps taken to 
manage each specific risk. See pages 35 to 38 for a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Group during the year. 
• Internal audit – The Audit Committee continued to oversee and 
challenge the Group’s adoption of a risk-based approach to internal 
audit. The Audit Committee Chairman receives a quarterly report 
from the Head of Internal Audit which sets out specific areas covered,  www.hochschildmining.com 49
Governance
 
www.hochschildmining.com 49 
improvements being recommended and introduced, and proposals 
for the programme over the following three months. The CEO and 
CFO also receive copies of this report and robustly support the 
activities of the Internal Audit function. 
• Internal control – Through the processes described on the following 
page, the Audit Committee reviewed the adequacy of the Group’s 
internal control environment and risk management systems. 
• Whistleblowing – The Audit Committee reviewed the adequacy of the 
Group’s Whistleblowing Policy, taking into account the reports 
received through the various online and offline channels established 
by the Group. 
• Fraud and bribery – The Audit Committee continued to review and 
challenge the actions taken by management to promote ethical and 
transparent working practices. 
• External audit – As described earlier in the Committee Chairman’s 
letter, a tender for the Group’s audit engagement in Q1 2016 resulted 
in the decision to retain Ernst & Young LLP as the Company’s external 
Auditor. The Audit Committee oversees the relationship with the 
external Auditor and, as part of this responsibility, the Audit 
Committee reviewed the findings of the external Auditor and 
management letters, and reviewed and agreed audit fees. The Audit 
Committee evaluates the Auditor’s performance each year taking into 
account written feedback prepared by the CFO, the Group Financial 
Controller and relevant finance managers from the operations. The 
issues raised are considered in detail at the Audit Committee meeting 
held mid-year resulting in an action plan the execution of which is 
assessed in the following year’s auditor evaluation. 
• Auditor Objectivity – In light of the new Ethical Standard, the Audit 
Committee considered and approved a revised form of Policy on the 
Use of External Auditors for the Provision of Non-Audit Services (see 
later section for more details). 
• Governance – The Audit Committee received updates from the 
Auditor and the Company Secretary on regulatory and other 
developments impacting the Committee’s role. In addition, the 
Committee reviewed its terms of reference during the year, which 
were revised to reflect good market practice. 
• Committee objectives – The Audit Committee has continued its 
initiative of setting specific objectives for itself and management with 
a view to ensuring the diligent fulfilment of its responsibilities. 
The objectives for 2016 resulted in: 
• the tender for the Group audit engagement which resulted in the re-
appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the Group’s external Auditor; 
• continued focus on the Internal Audit function’s testing of the control 
environment for any weaknesses resulting from the Cash 
Optimisation Plan (the Group’s cost-reduction programme); 
• closer oversight of the preparation of the Company’s first Viability 
Statement; and 
• a review of the Group’s IT security and assessment of the risk of 
disruption or unauthorised access by third-parties. 
During the year, the Committee members held meetings with the 
external Auditor without executive management to discuss matters 
relating to the 2015 annual audit and the 2016 half-yearly report. There 
were no matters of significance to report from these meetings. 
Significant audit issues  
As recommended by the Code, the following is a summary of the 
significant issues considered by the Committee in relation to the 2016 
financial statements and how these issues have been addressed. 
Impairments 
The Audit Committee assessed management’s analysis which 
concluded that there were no indicators of impairment (or impairment 
reversals) in relation to the carrying value of tangible and intangible 
fixed assets of the Group’s cash-generating units (‘CGUs’). 
 
The Audit Committee challenged management’s evaluation and agreed 
that in the absence of any such indicators, full impairment assessments 
would not be required in respect of any of the Group’s CGUs except for 
the Volcan project in Chile, which was tested for impairment as required 
under IFRS and concluded that no impairment or reversal of impairment 
would be required. 
Going Concern Assessment 
Due to the ongoing volatility of commodity prices, the Board and the 
Committee (under its delegated authority) regularly considered 
management forecasts on the Group’s financial position and thereby its 
qualification as a going concern. 
The Board has considered cash flow forecasts and undertaken sensitivity 
analysis of the key assumptions. 
The Audit Committee considered the processes undertaken by the 
Auditor to obtain reassurance that supports the continued application 
of the going concern methodology which included reviewing the key 
assumptions. 
In conclusion, the Committee is content that the financial statements 
are in accordance with relevant accounting standards and guidance. 
Please refer to the Directors’ Report on page 43 for its confirmation to 
shareholders on the appropriateness of the Going Concern assumption 
and the Risk Management section of the Directors’ approach to the 
longer term Viability Statement. 
Adequacy of Tax Provisions 
The Audit Committee considered the potential fines or losses that the 
Group may be subject to in light of open tax reviews and the uncertainty 
with respect to the quantum and timing of these liabilities. 
The Audit Committee considered management’s assessment of  
these potential exposures and the work of the external Auditor which 
focused on: 
• corroborating management’s assessments; 
• changes to those assessments relative to prior years and the 
appropriate treatment in light thereof; and 
• the views of external counsel in support of management’s 
assessment. 
In conclusion and having had regard to management’s assessment, the 
Committee agrees with the treatment and disclosure of the potential 
liabilities identified. 
Mine Rehabilitation Provisions 
The Audit Committee considered the judgement exercised by 
management in assessing the amounts required to be paid by the 
Company to rehabilitate the Group’s mines which, in 2016 were 
reviewed by an external consultant. 
In its assessment of the analysis undertaken by management and the 
independent third-party, the Audit Committee took into account: 
• the basis of the estimation of future rehabilitation costs; 
• the discount rate applied; 
• significant changes in estimates and the basis and level of new costs; 
and 
• the accounting for the changes in the provisions. 
The Audit Committee concluded that the provision is appropriate.

Related Party Transactions 
The Audit Committee considered the accounting aspects of the 
transaction undertaken during the year by which the Group facilitated a 
donation of $1m to the Universidad de Ingenieria y Tecnologia (“UTEC”), 
an educational establishment considered to also be under the control of 
Eduardo Hochschild, the Company’s major shareholder. 
The Audit Committee assessed the work carried out by the Auditor 
which confirmed that all of the required disclosures are appropriate and 
have been included in the financial statements.  
Auditor independence 
The Audit Committee continues to oversee the implementation of 
specific policies designed to safeguard the independence and objectivity 
of the Auditor, which includes the Group’s policy on the provision of 
non-audit services.  
Policy on the use of Auditor for non-audit services 
Following the issue of the new consolidated Ethical Standard for 
Auditors by the Financial Reporting Council, the Audit Committee 
adopted a revised Policy on the use of the Auditor for non-audit services 
(the “Revised NAS Policy”). 
The Revised NAS Policy lists those non-audit services that the external 
Auditor is specifically prohibited from providing. In summary, these 
include (a) tax services; (b) bookkeeping; (c) payroll services; (d) 
designing or implementing internal control or risk management 
procedures with regards to financial information or related technology 
systems; (e) valuation services; (f) certain legal services; and (g) corporate 
finance type services. Certain of these services may be provided by the 
auditor subject to the satisfaction of certain criteria ensuring the 
Auditor’s objectivity and the Audit Committee’s approval. The Revised 
NAS Policy is more stringent than the preceding version since it now 
requires (i) the Audit Committee and Chief Financial Officer to approve 
all non-audit services undertaken by the external auditor and (ii) that the 
cost of non-audit services rendered by the external Auditor, in any 
financial year, cannot exceed 50% of the total audit fee for that year.  
Safeguards 
Additional safeguards to ensure auditor objectivity and independence 
include: 
• six-monthly reports to the Audit Committee from the Auditor 
analysing the fees for non-audit services rendered; and 
• an annual assessment, by the Audit Committee, of the Auditor’s 
objectivity and independence in light of all relationships between the 
Company and the audit firm. 
2016 Audit and non-audit fees 
Details of fees paid to the external Auditor are provided in note 31 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Internal control and risk management 
Whilst the Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of 
internal control including risk management and for reviewing its 
effectiveness, responsibility for the periodic review of the effectiveness 
of these controls has been delegated to the Audit Committee. 
Notwithstanding this delegation of authority, the Board continues to 
monitor the strategic risks to which the Company is exposed in the 
context of a risk appetite that is under continuous review. 
 
Internal controls are managed by the use of formal procedures designed 
to highlight financial, operational, environmental and social risks and 
provide appropriate information to the Board enabling it to protect 
effectively the Company’s assets and, in turn, maintain shareholder 
value. 
The process used by the Audit Committee to assess the effectiveness of 
risk management and internal control systems comprises: 
• reports from the Head of the Internal Audit function; 
• reviews of accounting and financial reporting processes together with 
the internal control environment at Group level. This involves the 
monitoring of performance and the taking of relevant action through 
the monthly review of key performance indicators and, where 
required, the production of revised forecasts. The Group has adopted 
a standard accounting manual to be followed by all finance teams, 
which is continually updated to ensure the consistent recognition and 
treatment of transactions and production of the consolidated 
financial statements; 
• review of budgets and reporting against budgets; and 
• consideration of progress against strategic objectives. 
The system of internal control is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and it must be 
recognised that such a system can only provide reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
Audit Committee’s assessment 
Based on its review of the process, the Audit Committee is satisfied that 
the internal controls are in place at the operational level within the 
Group. 
Board’s assessment 
Risk Management 
Throughout the year, the Board considered its risk appetite which was 
considered to be appropriate. The Board confirms that its assessment of 
the principal risks facing the Company, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity, 
and which are set out in the Risk Management & Viability section, was 
robust. 
Internal Control 
As detailed above, the Board, through the delegated authority granted to 
the Audit Committee, monitors the ongoing process by which critical 
risks to the business are identified, evaluated and managed. This process 
is consistent with the FRC’s ‘Guidance on Risk Management, Internal 
Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting’ published in 2014. 
The Directors confirm that, with the support of the Audit Committee, 
the effectiveness of the Company’s system of risk management and 
internal controls has been reviewed during the year under review. These 
covered material controls, which included controls covering operational, 
financial and compliance matters. The controls operated effectively 
during the financial year although, as is the case for many large 
companies, additional controls were implemented or further 
strengthened during the year. The Audit Committee was made aware of 
the control changes and there was no significant impact on the financial 
results. The Directors confirm that no significant failings or weaknesses 
were identified as a result of the review of the effectiveness of the 
Group’s system of internal control.

Nominations Committee 
Dear Shareholder 
One of the key responsibilities of the Nominations Committee is 
the implementation of a succession plan that will see a refreshing 
of skills around the Board table and a diversity of approaches that 
will enhance our collective ability to oversee the delivery of the 
Group’s strategy. 
We were therefore delighted that in preparation for Nigel Moore’s 
retirement at the forthcoming AGM, we were able to announce the 
appointment of Eileen Kamerick as a Non-Executive Director who 
will assume the chair of the Audit Committee in May 2017. Eileen’s 
appointment was the culmination of an extensive search process 
overseen by the Nominations Committee which I detail later in this 
report. We were also very fortunate to secure the appointment of 
Sanjay Sarma as an additional Non-Executive Director from 1 
January 2017. As a Professor of Mechanical Engineering at MIT 
with a personal interest in innovation in the mining industry, 
Sanjay brings a new perspective to the Hochschild Board. 
In addition, the Committee maintained its focus on the 
development of the Directors’ knowledge through the provision of 
briefings on various topics of relevance, including the outlook for 
the commodity markets and changes to law and regulation 
affecting Directors’ duties.

perceived or potential conflicts of interest 
Membership 
There were no changes to the membership of the Committee during 
2016.  
The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee. 
 
Activity during the year 
The principal matters considered during the year were: 
• oversight of the selection of candidates to succeed Nigel Moore in 
anticipation of his retirement from the Board; 
• matters in connection with the appointments of Eileen Kamerick and 
Sanjay Sarma as Non-Executive Directors including the review of any 
conflicts of interest; 
• the format of the 2016 Board evaluation process. As explained earlier 
in this report, it was decided that in light of the extensive benefits 
that have been brought about by past internally led-evaluations and 
the ongoing focus on cost-control, the Board favoured the 
continuation of this approach in 2016. The format of the 2017 Board 
evaluation will, however, be kept under review; and 
• the findings of the 2016 Board evaluation process (see earlier section 
of the Corporate Governance report). 
Appointments to the Board 
In seeking candidates for appointment to the Board, regard is given to 
relevant experience and the skills required to complete the composition 
of a balanced Board, taking into account the challenges and 
opportunities facing the Company. 
The process of appointing Eileen Kamerick was undertaken by the 
Committee with support from Ogers Berndtson who prepared a ‘long 
list’ comprising a diverse list of potential candidates meeting prescribed 
criteria. A subset of this long list was drawn up and initial interviews 
were held by a working group established by the Committee. 
The Committee subsequently discussed the results of the interviews 
and, following a recommendation from the working group, Committee 
members met with Eileen prior to recommending her appointment to 
the Board. 
Sanjay Sarma’s expertise and personal interest in mining innovation 
were already known to the Board and therefore, in relation to his 
appointment, neither search consultants nor open advertising were 
used. 
Diversity Policy  
The Board acknowledges that diversity brings new perspectives which 
can drive superior business performance and promote innovation. 
However, as has been stated in past Annual Reports, the Board is keen to 
commit to the overriding principle that every Board member and 
potential appointee must be able to demonstrate the skills and 
knowledge to be able to make a valued contribution to the Board. This 
merits-based approach will continue to apply and the Board does not 
intend to set diversity targets. As demonstrated by the most recent 
appointments, where the opportunity also arises to increase Board 
diversity (whether of gender, culture or professional background) this 
would be considered to be an additional benefit.

Corporate Social Responsibility Committee 
Dear Shareholder 
Despite making significant progress in safety across our operations 
in 2016, it was with sincere regret that we reported on the two 
fatalities that occurred at the Inmaculada mine in the early part of 
2017. The Committee and indeed the Board as a whole are deeply 
committed to ensuring the safety of our colleagues and we will 
ensure that all necessary steps are taken on completion of the 
internal review. 
With regards to the environment, the Group has implemented 
numerous initiatives to mitigate the impact of our operations.  
The use of a new scorecard to measure our environmental 
performance will be reflected in the remuneration of senior 
employees and is one way in which we are looking to embed an 
environmentally-conscious culture across the Group. 
Details of the work we have done during the year with local 
communities in the core areas of education, health and economic 
development as well as the matters mentioned above can be

Remuneration Committee 
Dear Shareholder 
The focus of the Remuneration Committee during 2016 was 
threefold: firstly, to ensure that we offer our senior executives 
levels of remuneration that are commensurate with those paid by 
our peers which prompted a wide-ranging benchmarking analysis; 
secondly that we seek to implement the shareholder-approved 
Remuneration Policy in line with good market practice; and finally, 
that we continue to monitor emerging practice with a view to 
implementing a simple remuneration structure that aligns senior 
executive pay with the successful achievement of the Group’s 
objectives.  
Further details on the Company’s remuneration policy, the 
Committee’s work in 2016 and how we seek to reflect the 
experience of our wider stakeholders in executive pay can be found

Current share repurchase authority 
The Company obtained shareholder approval at the AGM held in May 
2016 for the repurchase of up to 50,557,150 shares which represented, 
at that time, 10% of the Company’s issued share capital (‘the 2016 
Authority’). Whilst no purchases have been made by the Company 
pursuant to the 2016 Authority, it is intended that shareholder consent 
will be sought on similar terms at this year’s AGM when the 2016 
Authority expires. 
 
Additional share capital information 
This section provides additional information as at 31 December 2016. 
(a) Structure of share capital 
The Company has a single class of share capital which is divided into 
ordinary shares of 25 pence each, which are in registered form. 
Further information on the Company’s share capital is provided in note 
27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
(b) Rights and obligations attaching to shares 
The rights attaching to the ordinary shares are described in full in the 
Articles. 
In summary, on a show of hands and on a poll at a general meeting or 
class meeting, every member present in person or, subject to the below, 
by proxy has one vote for every ordinary share held. However, in the case 
of a vote on a show of hands, where a proxy has been appointed by 
more than one member, the proxy has one vote for and one vote against 
if the proxy has been instructed by one or more members to vote for the 
resolution and by one or more members to vote against the resolution. 
Members are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of their 
rights to attend and to speak and vote on their behalf at a general 
meeting or class meeting. A member that is a corporation is entitled to 
appoint more than one individual to act on its behalf at a general 
meeting or class meetings as a corporate representative. 
(c) Transfer of shares 
The relevant provisions of the Articles state that: 
• registration of a transfer of an uncertificated share may be refused in 
the circumstances set out in the CREST Regulations and where, in the 
case of a transfer to joint holders, the number of joint holders to 
whom the uncertificated share is to be transferred exceeds four; 
• the Directors may, in their absolute discretion, decline to register any 
transfer of any share which is not a fully paid share. The Directors may 
also decline to recognise any instrument of transfer relating to a 
certificated share unless the instrument of transfer: 
(i) is duly stamped (if required) and is accompanied by the relevant 
share certificate(s) and such other evidence of the right to transfer  
as the Directors may reasonably require; and (ii) is in respect of only 
one class of share. The Directors ma y, in their absolute discretion, 
refuse to register a transfer if it is in favour of more than four persons 
jointly; and 
• the Directors may decline to register a transfer of any of the 
Company’s shares by a person with a 0.25% interest, if such a person 
has been served with a notice under the Companies Act after failure 
to provide the Company with information concerning interests in 
those shares required to be provided under the Companies Act. 
(d) Restrictions on voting 
No member shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting or class 
meeting in respect of any shares held by him or her, if any call or other 
sum then payable by him or her in respect of that share remains unpaid. 
Currently, all issued shares are fully paid. 
In addition, no member shall be entitled to vote if he or she failed to 
provide the Company with information concerning interests in those 
shares required to be provided under the Companies Act. 
(e) Deadlines for voting rights 
Votes are exercisable at the general meeting of the Company in respect 
of which the business being voted upon is being heard. 
Votes may be exercised in person, by proxy or, in relation to corporate 
members, by a corporate representative. Under the Articles, the deadline 
for delivering proxy forms cannot be earlier than 48 hours (excluding 
non-working days) before the meeting for which the proxy is being 
appointed.

Shareholder agreements 
The Relationship Agreement entered into prior to the IPO between, 
amongst others, the Major Shareholder (as defined in the Relationship 
Agreement) and Eduardo Hochschild (collectively ‘the Controlling 
Shareholders’) and the Company: 
• contains provisions restricting the Controlling Shareholders’ rights to 
exercise their voting rights to procure an amendment to the Articles 
that would be inconsistent with the Relationship Agreement; and 
• contains an undertaking by the Controlling Shareholders that they 
will, and will procure that their Associates will, abstain from voting on 
any resolution to approve a transaction with a related party (as 
defined in the FCA Listing Rules) involving the Controlling 
Shareholders or their Associates. 
Significant agreements 
A change of control of the Company following a takeover bid may cause 
a number of agreements to which the Company, or any of its trading 
subsidiaries, is party to take effect, alter or terminate. Such agreements 
include commercial trading contracts, joint venture agreements and 
financing arrangements. Further details are given below of those 
arrangements where the impact may be considered to be significant in 
the context of the Group. 
(a) $350m 7.75% Senior Notes 
Under the terms and conditions of the $350 million 7.75% Senior Notes 
due 2021, upon the occurrence of a change of control followed by a 
ratings downgrade which results in a change of control repurchase 
event (as defined in the indenture), the Company may be required by 
each holder of the notes to offer to purchase the notes at a price equal to 
101% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid 
interest and additional amounts, if any, to the purchase date. 
In summary, a Change of Control means the occurrence of one or more 
of the following events: (1) the disposition (other than by way of merger 
or consolidation) of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company 
and its subsidiaries taken as a whole to any person other than (i) to the 
Company or one of its subsidiaries or (ii) to a Permitted Holder (being 
Eduardo Hochschild or a permitted transferee); (2) the consummation of 
any transaction (including any merger or consolidation) the result of 
which is that (i) any person other than a Permitted Holder becomes the 
‘beneficial owner’ of more than 50% of the Company’s outstanding 
Voting Stock (as defined) or (ii) the Permitted Holders cease to be the 
beneficial owners, directly or indirectly, of at least a majority of the 
outstanding Voting Stock of the Company; (3) the Company 
consolidates with, or merges with or into any person, or any person 
consolidates with, or merges with or into, the Company, in any such 
event pursuant to a transaction in which any of the outstanding Voting 
Stock of the Company or such other person is converted into or 
exchanged for cash, securities or other property, other than any such 
transaction where the shares of the Voting Stock of the Company 
outstanding immediately prior to such transaction constitute, or are 
converted into or exchanged for, a majority of the Voting Stock of the 
surviving person immediately after giving effect to such transaction; (4) 
the first day on which the majority of the members of the Board of 
Directors of the Company cease to be Continuing Directors (as defined); 
(5) the Company shall for any reason cease to be the beneficial owner (as 
defined) of 100% of the Voting Stock of Compañía Minera Ares S.A.C.; or 
(6) the adoption of a plan relating to the liquidation or dissolution of 
Compañía Minera Ares S.A.C. 
 
(b) Long-Term Incentive Plans 
Awards made under the Group’s Long-Term Incentive Plan, Enhanced 
Long-Term Incentive Plan and Restricted Share Plan shall, upon a change 
of control of the Company, vest early unless a replacement award is 
made. Vesting will be prorated to take account of the proportion of the 
period from the award date to the normal vesting date falling prior to 
the change of control and the extent to which performance conditions 
(and any other conditions) applying to the award have been met.

Summary of constitutional and other provisions 
Appointment of Directors 
Under the terms of the Articles 
Directors may be appointed by the Company by ordinary resolution or by 
the Board. A Director appointed by the Board holds office only until the 
next following AGM and is then eligible for election by shareholders but 
is not taken into account in determining the Directors or the number of 
Directors who are to retire by rotation at that meeting. 
The Directors may from time to time appoint one or more of their body 
to be the holder of any executive office for such period (subject to the 
Companies Act) and on such terms as they may determine and may 
revoke or terminate any such appointment. 
Each Director is subject to periodic re-election by shareholders at 
intervals of no more than every three years. Each Director (other than 
the Chairman and any Director holding executive office) shall retire at 
each AGM following the ninth anniversary of the date on which he was 
elected by the Company. 
Approach to appointment adopted by the Board 
Under law, the Company is entitled to adopt such practices which are no 
less stringent than those set out in the Articles. Accordingly, 
notwithstanding the above, the Board has adopted the 
recommendation of the UK Corporate Governance Code that all 
Directors should seek annual re-election by shareholders. 
2014 Listing Rules 
Following the implementation, in 2014, of new Listing Rules by the 
Financial Conduct Authority (in its capacity as the UK Listing Authority), 
as a company with a controlling shareholder, the election or re-election 
of any independent director must be approved by: (i) all shareholders of 
the Company; and (ii) the independent shareholders of the Company 
(i.e. any person entitled to vote on the election of directors of the 
Company that is not a controlling shareholder). 
If either shareholder resolution to elect or re-elect the independent 
director is defeated, the Company may propose a further resolution to 
elect or re-elect the proposed independent director provided that the 
further resolution must not be voted on within 90 days from the date of 
the original vote but it must then be voted on within a period of 30 days 
from the end of the 90 day period. It may then be passed by a simple 
majority of the shareholders of the Company voting as a single class. 
Removal of Directors 
The Company may, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of 
the Companies Act by ordinary resolution of which special notice has 
been given, remove any Director before the expiration of his term of 
office. The office of Director shall be vacated if: (i) he is prohibited by law 
from acting as a Director; (ii) he resigns or offers to resign and the 
Directors resolve to accept such offer; (iii) he becomes bankrupt or 
compounds with his creditors generally; (iv) a relevant order has been 
made by any court on the grounds of mental disorder; (v) he is absent 
without permission of the Directors from meetings of the Board for six 
months and the Directors resolve that his office be vacated; (vi) his 
resignation is requested in writing by not less than three quarters of the 
Directors for the time being; or (vii) in the case of a Director other than 
the Chairman and any Director holding an executive office, if the 
Directors shall resolve to require him to resign and within 30 days of 
being given notice of such notice he so fails to do. 
Relationship Agreement 
In addition, under the terms of the Relationship Agreement: 
• for as long as the Major Shareholder has an interest of 30% or more  
in the Company, it is entitled to appoint up to two Non-Executive 
Directors and to remove such Directors so appointed; and 
• for as long as the Major Shareholder has an interest of 15% or more  
of the Company, it is entitled to appoint up to one Non- Executive 
Director and to remove such Director so appointed. 
Amendment of Articles of Association 
Any amendments to the Articles may be made in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act by way of special resolution. 
Powers of the Directors 
Subject to the Articles, the Companies Act and any directions given by 
special resolution, the business and affairs of the Company shall be 
managed by the Directors who may exercise all such powers of the 
Company. 
Subject to applicable statutes and other shareholders’ rights, shares may 
be issued with such rights or restrictions as the Company may by 
ordinary resolution decide or, in the absence of any such resolution, as 
the Directors may decide. Subject to applicable statutes and any 
ordinary resolution of the Company, all unissued shares of the Company 
are at the disposal of the Directors. At each AGM, the Company puts in 
place annual shareholder authority seeking shareholder consent to allot 
unissued shares, in certain circumstances for cash, in accordance with 
the guidelines of the Investor Protection Committee. 
Repurchase of shares 
Subject to authorisation by shareholder resolution, the Company may 
purchase its own shares in accordance with the Companies Act. Any 
shares which have been bought back may be held as treasury shares or, 
if not so held, must be cancelled immediately upon completion of the 
purchase, thereby reducing the amount of the Company’s issued share 
capital. The minimum price which must be paid for such shares is 
specified in the relevant shareholder resolution. 
Dividends and distributions 
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, the Company may by 
ordinary resolution from time to time declare dividends not exceeding 
the amount recommended by the Directors. The Directors may pay 
interim dividends whenever the financial position of the Company, in 
the opinion of the Directors, justifies their payment. If the Directors act 
in good faith, they are not liable to holders of shares with preferred or 
paripassu rights for losses arising fr om the payment of interim dividends 
on other shares. 
  Directors’ remuneration report 
www.hochschildmining.com 57 
Dear Shareholders 
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for the year ending 31 December 2016. 
This report is split into three sections: the Annual Statement, the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy and the Annual Report on Remuneration. 
The Remuneration Policy remains consistent with that approved by 
shareholders at the 2015 AGM, and is reproduced in summary form to 
provide context to the decisions taken by the Remuneration Committee 
during the year. The Annual Report on Remuneration will be subject to 
an advisory vote at the 2017 AGM. 
In 2016, the Remuneration Committee focused on ensuring that 
Hochschild Mining’s executive remuneration structure remains effective 
whilst avoiding unnecessary complications. This has the dual benefit of 
ensuring that our schemes are under stood by both shareholders and 
participants, whilst also driving strong corporate performance and  
pay-performance alignment.  
To this end, the Committee followed with great interest the 
consultation launched by the Executive Remuneration Working Group 
aimed at simplifying pay for senior management. In parallel, the 
Committee has reviewed existing practices and, where considered  
 
 
 
 
desirable, has adopted certain decisi ons to ensure that we operate our 
incentives in line with good market practice. Such matters include the 
calculation of annual bonuses with reference to the actual salary paid 
during the year (and not the salary at the end of the year) and the 
implementation of share ownership and share retention guidelines for 
senior employees. 
Having submitted our Remuneration Policy to shareholders for approval 
at the 2015 Annual General Meeting, we will continue to monitor 
developing remuneration trends and will seek to incorporate those 
aspects considered to be of relevance in the policy to be published in our 
2017 Remuneration Report. 
I would encourage our shareholders to contact me through the 
Company Secretary with any feedback on any parts of our existing 
Remuneration Policy or any aspect of this year’s Remuneration Report. 
I hope you find this report to be informative.  
Enrico Bombieri 
Chairman, Remuneration Committee  
 
This report has been prepared according to the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 (‘the Act’), Regulation 11 and Schedule 8 of the 
Large and Medium–Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 and other relevant 
requirements of the FCA Listing Rules. In addition, the Board has applied 
the principles of good corporate governance set out in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, and has considered the guidelines issued by its 
leading shareholders and bodies such as the Investment Association and 
the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association (formerly the National 
Association of Pension Funds). 
Directors’ remuneration policy (unaudited)  
The principal objectives of the Remuneration Committee’s agreed 
Remuneration Policy are to: 
• attract, retain, and motivate the Group’s executives and senior 
management; 
• provide management incentives that align with and support the 
Group’s business strategy; and 
• align management incentives with the creation of shareholder value. 
The Group seeks to achieve this alignment over both the short- and 
long-term through the use of an annual performance-related bonus, 
which rewards the achievement of a balanced mix of financial, 
operational and other relevant performance measures, and the use of a 
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) which is linked to relative Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR). There is an additional incentive designed 
specifically for the CEO in the form of the Enhanced LTIP (ELTIP), which 
was approved by shareholders at the 2011 AGM. 
The Committee takes into consideration the remuneration 
arrangements for the wider employee population in making its 
decisions on remuneration for senior executives. Remuneration 
decisions are also driven by external considerations, in particular relating 
to the global demand for talent in the mining sector. 
As no changes have been made to the Remuneration Policy, which 
shareholders approved at the 2015 AGM, the full policy is not repeated 
here. The Policy Table and service contracts/letters of appointment of 
the Board are included below for information, and the full policy can be 
found in the 2014 Annual Report and Accounts.

Objective  Details  Opportunity Performance metrics
Base salary 
To support 
recruitment and 
retention 
 Salary is reviewed annually, 
usually in March, or following 
a significant change in 
responsibilities. Salary levels 
are targeted to be 
competitive and relevant to 
the global mining sector, with 
reference to the relative cost 
of living. The Committee also 
takes into consideration 
general pay levels for the 
wider employee population. 
 Any salary increases are applied in line with the 
outcome of the annual review. 
To avoid setting expectations of Directors and 
other employees, no maximum salary is set under 
the Remuneration Policy. In respect of existing 
Executive Directors, it is anticipated that any 
salary increases will be in line with the wider 
employee population over the term of this policy.
In exceptional circumstances (including, but not 
limited to, a material increase in job size or 
complexity), the Committee has discretion to 
make appropriate adjustments to salary levels to 
ensure they remain competitive. 
 None 
Benefits 
To provide benefits in 
line with market 
practice in relevant 
geographies 
 Executive Directors receive 
compensation for time 
services and profit share, both 
of which are provided for by 
Peruvian law, as well as 
certain allowances which 
may include medical 
insurance, the use of a car 
and driver, 
 For the profit share, an amount equal to 8% of the 
relevant Peruvian company’s taxable income for 
the year is distributable to its employees. 
This amount is mandated by Peruvian law, and 
any increases are not within the control of the 
Group. The amount receivable is determined with 
reference to annual base salary (plus the annual 
bonus, if any) and the number of days worked 
during the calendar year. 
The value of the other benefits varies by role and 
individual circumstances; eligibility and costs are 
reviewed periodically. 
The Committee retains the discretion to approve 
a higher cost of benefits in exceptional 
circumstances (for example relocation) or in 
circumstances where factors outside the 
Company’s control have changed materially (for 
example increases in insurance premiums).

 Performance measures, 
targets and weightings are 
set at the start of the year.  
At the end of the year, the 
Committee determines the 
extent to which targets have 
been achieved, taking into 
account the individual 
performance of each 
Executive Director. 
Bonus payments are normally 
delivered in cash. The 
Committee has discretion to 
defer all or a portion of the 
bonus, payable in cash or 
Hochschild shares, under the 
Deferred Bonus Plan for up to 
three years. 
Deferred bonus is subject to 
malus, i.e. forfeiture or 
reduction, in exceptional 
circumstances such as 
material misstatement or 
gross misconduct. 
 For Executive Directors, the maximum annual 
bonus opportunity is 150% of salary. 
The bonus earned is 67% of maximum for 
threshold level performance and 83% for target 
performance. 
 Performance is determined by the Committee on an annual 
basis by reference to Group financial measures, e.g. Adjusted 
EBITDA, as well as the achievement of personal or strategic 
objectives, for example production and social responsibility. 
The financial and strategic/personal objectives are typically 
weighted between 70% and 80% and 20% and 30% of 
maximum, respectively. The Committee retains discretion to 
vary the weightings +/- 20% for individual measures within the 
financial element, to ensure alignment with the business 
priorities for the year. Performance targets are generally 
calibrated with reference to the Company’s budget for the year. 
Each objective in the scorecard has a ‘threshold’, ‘target’ and 
‘maximum’ performance target, achievement of which 
translates into a score for each objective. 
The Committee uses its judgement to determine the overall 
scorecard outcome based on the achievement of the targets and 
the Committee’s broad assessment of Company performance. 
A review of the quality of earnings is conducted by the 
Committee to determine whether any adjustments should be 
made to the reported profit for the purpose of bonus outcomes. 
This ensures that bonus outcomes are not impacted by 
unbudgeted non-recurring or one-off items, or circumstances 
outside of management’s control such as material changes in 
commodity prices that could distort the overall quality of 
earnings. 
The Committee has the discretion to reduce bonus payments on 
the occurrence of an adverse event related to health and safety, 
the environment or community relations. 
Details of the measures, weightings and targets applicable for 
the financial year under review are provided in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration, unless they are considered to be 
commercially sensitive.

Objective  Details Opportunity Performance metrics
Long-Term Incentive 
Plan (LTIP) 
To directly incentivise 
sustained shareholder value 
creation through operational 
performance and to support 
the recruitment of senior 
positions and longer 
term retention 
 Executive Directors may be granted 
awards annually as determined by the 
Committee. 
The vesting of these awards is subject 
to the attainment of specific 
performance conditions. 
Awards are in the form of cash. Awards 
made under the LTIP have a 
performance and vesting period of at 
least three years. 
If no entitlement has been earned at 
the end of the relevant performance 
period, awards lapse. 
The CEO is required to invest at least 
20% of vested LTIP awards into 
Hochschild shares until such time as he 
has accumulated a shareholding with a 
value of 200% of salary. 
 The maximum cash 
payments to participating 
Executive Directors in any 
three-year period may not be 
more than six times salary (or 
eight times salary in 
exceptional circumstances). 
The equivalents of these 
upper limits also apply to 
annual awards, that is an 
annual grant limit of no more 
than 200% of salary in normal 
circumstances. 
 Vesting of LTIP awards is subject to continued employment and 
the Company’s performance over a three-year performance 
period. 
Vesting is based on the Company’s TSR performance relative to 
specific sector-based comparator groups. 
Vesting of 70% of awards is based on the Company’s TSR rank 
relative to a tailored comparator group. Vesting for threshold 
performance is 25% of maximum, with 75% for upper tercile 
performance and 100% for upper quintile performance. 
Vesting of 30% of awards is based on the Company’s TSR 
outperformance of the FTSE350 Mining Index. Vesting for 
threshold performance is 25% of maximum, with 100% for stretch 
performance. 
The Committee reviews, and may adjust, the comparator groups 
against which performance is measured, and their weightings, 
from time to time to ensure they remain appropriate. More 
generally, the performance measures applied to LTIP awards are 
reviewed periodically to ensure they remain aligned with 
shareholder interests. 
The Committee can reduce or prevent vesting if it determines 
either that (i) the overall underlying business performance of the 
Company is not satisfactory or (ii) an unacceptable position has 
occurred regarding safety, the environment, community relations, 
and/or compliance with legal obligations of the Company. 
Details of the comparator groups and targets used for specific LTIP 
grants are included in the Annual Report on Remuneration. 
Enhanced Long-Term 
Incentive Plan 
To support retention for the 
CEO over a longer term 
horizon and to achieve 
stronger alignment with 
shareholder interests through 
the use of conditional shares 
 An award in the form of conditional 
shares was made to the CEO in 2011 to 
reinforce his alignment with 
shareholder interests and to ensure his 
total remuneration package remained 
competitive. 
Awards vest based on the Company’s 
TSR performance compared with a 
tailored comparator group over four, 
five and six years. 
Unvested awards are subject to malus, 
i.e. forfeiture or reduction, in 
exceptional circumstances such as 
material misstatement or gross 
misconduct. 
The CEO is required to retain 50%  
of the after-tax vested ELTIP shares  
until such time as he has accumulated 
a shareholding with a value of 200%  
of salary. 
 The ELTIP award in 2011 was 
over shares with a face value 
on the date of grant 
equivalent to 600% of the 
CEO’s salary (362,196 
conditional shares). In line 
with the approval granted by 
shareholders at the 2011 
AGM, the Committee made a 
second ELTIP award to the 
CEO in 2014 of 600% of his 
salary (951,900 conditional 
shares). Dividend equivalents 
are payable over the vesting 
period in respect of the shares 
that vest. No further awards 
are intended to be granted 
under this plan. 
 Awards vest based on the Company’s TSR performance compared 
with a tailored comparator group over four, five and six years. 
The vesting on the ELTIP award is based 100% on the Company’s 
TSR rank compared with a sector peer group. 
25% of the award vests on four-year TSR performance, 25% on 
five-year TSR performance, and 50 % on six-year TSR performance. 
The vesting for threshold (median) performance is 25% of 
maximum, with 75% for upper quartile performance and 100% for 
upper decile performance. 
The Committee can reduce or prevent vesting if the Committee 
determines either that (i) the overall underlying business 
performance of the Company is not satisfactory or (ii) an 
unacceptable position has occurred regarding safety, the 
environment, community relations, and/or compliance with legal 
obligations of the Company. 
Details of the tailored comparator group are included in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration. 
In addition to the above elements of remuneration, the Committee may consider it appropriate to grant an award under a differen t structure in 
order to facilitate the recruitment or retention of an individual, exercising the discretion available under Listing Rule 9.4.2 R (which provides for 
awards outside the normal long-term incentive structure provided the ‘arrangement is established specifically to facilitate, in unusual circumstances, 
the recruitment or retention of the relevant individual’). 
The Committee also retains discretion to make non-significant changes to the policy without going back to shareholders. 
Payments from existing awards

1 Mr. Hochschild, previously Executive Chairman, became Non-Executive Chairman effective 1 January 2015. 
2 Mr Moore will be retiring from the Board at the forthcoming AGM on 11 May 2017. 
3 Pursuant to a contract between Mr Dañino and Ares dated 28 December 2010, a fee is payable to Mr Dañino in respect of his eng agement as Special Adviser to the Chairman and the 
senior management team. The contract provides for a one-year te rm which renews automatically for further one-year periods and can be terminated by either party on 30 days’ 
written notice. In 2015, the fee was waived in light of the chal lenging trading conditions faced by the Company. The fee was reinstated with effect from 1 January 2016. 
4 Mr Dañino will be retiring from the Board at the forthcoming AGM on 11 May 2017. 
The Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in the Company’s performance-related incentive plans and do not rec eive any pension 
contributions. As part of his change of role from Executive to Non-Executive Chairman, the Committee agreed that Mr. Hochschild would retain his 
eligibility for benefits received in respect of his time as an Executive Director, consisting primarily of personal security, c ar and driver, and medical 
insurance. 
The Non-Executive Directors’ fees have been set at a level to reflect the amount of time and level of involvement required in o rder to carry out their 
duties as members of the Board and its Committees. 
Details of the policy on fees paid to our Non-Executive Directors are set out in the table below: 
Objective  Details Opportunity Performance metrics
To attract and retain Non-
Executive Directors of the 
highest calibre with broad 
commercial and other 
experience relevant to the 
Company. 
 Fee levels are reviewed from time to time, with any 
adjustments effective from 1 March each year. 
The fee paid to the Chairman is determined by the 
Committee, and fees to Non-Executive Directors are 
determined by the Board. 
Additional fees are payable for acting as Chairman of 
the Audit and Remuneration Committees and as 
Senior Independent Director. 
Fee levels are reviewed by reference to FTSE- listed 
companies of similar size and complexity. Time 
commitment, level of involvement required and 
responsibility are taken into account when reviewing 
fee levels. 
Fees for the year ending 31 December 2016 are set out 
in the Annual Report on Remuneration on page 63. 
 Non-Executive Director fee increases are applied in line with 
the outcome of the fee review. 
Other than reinstating NED fees to their levels prior to 1 
August 2013 at the discretion of the Board, it is expected that 
NEDs’ fees will only be increased during the term of this 
policy in line with general market levels of NED fee inflation. 
In the event that there is a material misalignment with the 
market or a change in the complexity, responsibility or time 
commitment required to fulfil a Non-Executive Director role, 
the Board has discretion to make an appropriate adjustment 
to the fee level. 
The maximum aggregate annual fee for all Directors 
provided in the Company’s Articles of Association is  
£3 million p.a.

Annual report on remuneration 
The following section provides details of how Hochschild’s Remuneration Policy was implemented during the financial year ending 31 December 2016. 
Remuneration Committee membership 
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Enrico Bombieri and its other members are Graham Birch and Nigel Moore (from 11 August 2016). 
Sir Malcolm Field was a member of the Committee until his retirement from the Board on 20 May 2016. All of the members of the R emuneration 
Committee were, and continue to be, independent Non-Executive Directors. The composition of the Remuneration Committee and its terms of 
reference comply with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code and are available for inspection on the Company’s webs ite at 
www.hochschildmining.com. 
Members of senior management attend meetings at the invitation of the Committee. During the year, such members included the Cha irman, the 
CEO and the Vice President of Human Resources. No Director or senior executive is present when his own remuneration arrangement s are 
considered by the Committee. 
  
60 Hochschild Mining plc Annual Report 2016  
www.hochschildmining.com 61 
The Committee’s terms of reference 
The duties of the Remuneration Committee are to determine and agree with the Board the broad policy for the remuneration of the Executive 
Directors, the other members of senior management and the Company Secretary, as well as their specific remuneration packages in cluding pension 
rights and, where applicable, any compensation payments. In determining such policy, the Remuneration Committee shall take into account all 
factors which it deems necessary to ensure that members of the se nior executive management of the Group are provided with appro priate 
incentives to encourage strong performance and are rewarded in a fair and responsible manner for their individual contributions to the success of 
the Group. 
The Remuneration Committee met four times during the year (details of members’ attendance at meetings are provided in the Corpo rate 
Governance report on page 52) and undertook the items of business noted below. 
March 2016 
• Confirmed the lapse of 2013 LTIP awards and the second tranche of 2011 ELTIP awards; 
• Reviewed remuneration policy, including consideration of the wider application of malus provisions and the introduction of claw back, and 
consideration of the Company’s shareholding guidelines for executives;

the Group’s Vice Presidents; 
• Reviewed and approved the CEO’s salary for 2016;  
• Considered and approved the 2015 Directors’ Remuneration Report; and 
• Approved the grant of 2016 LTIP awards.

• vesting of the first tranche of RSP awards; 
• vesting of subsisting LTIP awards; and 
• the proposed 2017 LTIP grant. 
Advisers 
During the year, in order to enable the Committee to reach informed decisions on executive remuneration, advice on market data and trends was 
obtained from independent consultants, Kepler, a brand of Mercer (which is part of the MMC group of companies). Kepler reports directly to the 
Committee Chairman, and is a signatory to and abides by the Code of Conduct for Remuneration Consultants (which can be found at 
www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com). Other than advice on remune ration, no other services were provided by Kepler to the Comp any (or any 
other part of the MMC group of companies with the exception of unrelated insurance brokerage services). The fees paid to Kepler in respect of work 
carried out in 2016 (based on time and materials) totalled £33,532, excluding expenses and VAT. 
The Committee undertakes due diligence periodically to ensure that Kepler remains independent of the Company and that the advic e provided is 
impartial and objective. The Committee is satisfied that the advice provided by Kepler is independent.

Governance Directors’ remuneration report continued 
62 Hochschild Mining plc Annual Report 2016 
The Board is mindful of the shareholders who voted against the Annual Report on Remuneration, which related principally to the salary increase 
awarded to the CEO in November 2015, and the use of year-end salary to calculate his bonus entitlement. As set out in the 2015 report, the salary 
increase related to the commencement of production from Inmaculada in August 2015. The Committee believes the size of the increase is justified 
in the context of market pay data which was reviewed again during 2016 as part of an extensive benchmarking analysis and strong Company and 
individual performance. In respect of the bonus calculation, the Committee acknowledges that this approach may not be considere d appropriate 
where salary is reviewed later in the year, and has revised the approach to align with best practice with effect from 2016. 
The Committee is committed to listening to and engaging with the views of our shareholders and takes an interest in voting outc omes. The 
Committee will continue to be transparent in our remuneration decision-making and to engage with our shareholders on remunerati on matters.

Performance-related annual bonus in respect of 2016 performance 
Objectives for the 2016 bonus were set by the Committee at the beginning of the year and a provisional assessment of performanc e during the year 
was undertaken at the December Committee meeting, which was confirmed in March 2017.  
Further details of the bonuses paid for 2016, including the spec ific performance metrics, weightings and performance against ea ch of the metrics,

The determination of the bonus payout is at the discretion of the Committee, taking into account performance during the year ag ainst the above 
scorecard. Each objective in the scorecard has a ‘threshold’, ‘target’ and ‘maximum’ performance target, achievement of which t ranslates into a score 
for each objective. 
Objectives which are considered critical to the Group are given higher weightings, such that outperformance in these areas cont ributes more 
significantly to the overall bonus outcome. The weighted average of the scores is calculated, and is translated into a bonus ou tcome of between 0% 
and 150% of salary for the CEO, which is used in the Committee’s judgement in determining the actual bonus awarded. 
The Committee assessed performance against the scorecard and the CEO’s performance in 2016. A number of adjustments were made i n line with 
the Company’s usual practice to maintain the quality of earnings by primarily disregarding the impact of factors outside of man agement’s control 
such as the price of silver and gold (as compared to the budgeted prices) and the impact of any hedging approved by the Board. The Committee’s 
assessment of performance resulted in the award of a bonus to the CEO of 125% of salary (83.3% of maximum).

2014 LTIP Vesting 
On 12 March 2014, Ignacio Bustamante was granted an award under the LTIP with a face value of US$1,000,000. Vesting was depende nt on three- 
year relative TSR performance against both a tailored peer group (70% of the total award) and the constituents of the FTSE350 M ining Index (30% of 
the total award). There was no retesting of performance. Further details of the performance conditions are shown in the table b elow.

The Committee has considered the extent to which the performance conditions attached to the 2014 LTIP award had been satisfied. Since the 
Company’s TSR in the performance period between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2016 ranked 73rd percentile versus that for the tailored peer 
group and outperformed the median of the constituents of the FTSE350 Mining Index by c.21%, 90.4% of this award will vest on 12 March 2017, 
subject to continued employment on that date. 
2011 ELTIP Vesting 
On 28 April 2011, Ignacio Bustamante was granted an award under the ELTIP. Vesting was dependent on four-, five- and six-year r elative TSR 
performance against a tailored peer group. There was no retesting of performance. Further details of the performance conditions are shown in the 
table below:

LTIP 
On 9 March 2016, Ignacio Bustamante was granted a cash-settled award under the LTIP with a face value of US$1,400,000. 
Vesting is dependent on three-year relative TSR from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2018, with 70% of the award based on TSR per formance 
against a tailored peer group and 30% of the award based on TSR performance against the constituents of the FTSE350 Mining Inde x. 
Awards vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to continued employment, and are subject to potential malus if, before vesting, the 
Committee determines either that (i) the overall underlying business performance of the Company is not satisfactory or (ii) an unacceptable position 
has occurred regarding safety, the environment, community relations, and/or compliance with legal obligations of the Company. A wards are settled 
in cash and the CEO will be required to invest at least 20% of any amount vesting into Hochschild shares, until such time as he has achieved the 
relevant shareholding guideline.

Governance The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and Company financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Parent Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the 
Directors have prepared the financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the EU. 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Group and the Parent Company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the 
Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable IFRS have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Parent Company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Parent Company and enable them to ensure that its financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to 
safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations the Directors are also responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ report, Directors’ remuneration 
report and Corporate governance statement that comply with that law and those regulations. The Directors are responsible for the maintenance 
and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Overview of our audit approach
Risks of material 
misstatement
• Recoverability of the carrying value of the Group’s mining assets
• Revenue recognition
• Mine rehabilitation provisions
Audit scope • We performed an audit of the complete financial information of 3 of the 18 components and performed audit procedures on 
specific selected accounts of 2 additional components.
• The components where we performed full and specific audit procedures accounted for 99% of Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the 
Financial Review on page 27 of the Annual Report) on an absolute basis, 100% of revenue and 96% of total assets.
Materiality Overall Group materiality of US$6.3m (2015: US$2.6m) which represents approximately 2% of Adjusted EBITDA. The increase in the 
materiality is primarily due to the improved financial performance as a result of the overall increase in prices and additional production 
from Inmaculada.

Governance
Independent auditor’s report to the members of Hochschild Mining plc Our assessment of risk of material misstatement
We identified the risks of material misstatement described below as those that had the greatest effect on our overall audit strategy, the allocation 
of resources in the audit and the direction of the efforts of the audit team. In addressing these risks, we have performed the procedures below 
which were designed in the context of the financial statements as a whole and, consequently, we do not express any opinion on these 
individual areas.
Details of why we identified these risks of material misstatements and our audit response are set out in the below table. This is not a complete list 
of all the procedures we performed in respect of these areas. The arrows in the table indicate whether we consider the financial statement risk 
associated with this focus area to have increased, decreased or stayed the same compared to 2015.
Risk Our response to the risk Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee
Recoverability of the carrying value 
of the Group’s mining assets
Refer to the Audit Committee Report 
(page 48); Accounting policies (page 
81); and Notes 16, 17 and 18 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements. 
At 31 December 2016 the carrying 
value of property, plant and 
equipment, evaluation and 
exploration assets and intangible 
assets was US$1,140.8m (2015: 
US$1,211.7m). 
IFRS requires companies to test their 
assets by cash generating units 
(CGUs) for impairment (or 
impairment reversals) whenever an 
indicator exist. An intangible asset 
with an indefinite useful life is tested 
for impairment at least annually and 
whenever there is an indication that 
the asset might be impaired.
As at 31 December 2016, 
management assessed that there 
were no impairment or impairment 
reversal indicators present and 
therefore no assessment of the 
recoverable amount of the Group’s 
mining assets has been performed. 
Given the ongoing volatility in 
commodity prices, we continue to 
consider there is a risk that the 
carrying values of the Group’s mining 
assets, including property, plant and 
equipment, exploration and 
evaluation assets and intangible 
assets might not be recoverable or 
could require a reversal of 
impairments previously recognised. 
Our approach focused on the following procedures: 
• Obtained an understanding of management’s process around 
impairments and impairment reversals assessment, including 
the effective implementation of all relevant controls.
• Audited management’s assessment of whether any indicators 
of impairment under IAS 36 and IFRS 6 were present at  
31 December 2016, including a challenge of the validity and 
completeness of the indicators and consulted with our 
valuation specialist where appropriate:
• Compared and assessed the changes to the spot and  
analyst forecasts of future gold and silver prices as at  
31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015;
• Obtained relevant support of management’s position on 
market interest rates and other macro-economic factors,  
in particular whether the economic changes in the 
Argentinian economy would suggest a potential indicator  
of impairment; and
• Discussed with management the approved mine plans or 
budgets, taking into account the updated reserves and 
resources estimates.
• Obtained the recoverable value model from management for 
the Volcan CGUs, which includes water permits (which are 
deemed to have an indefinite useful life under Chilean law): 
• Assessed the appropriateness of the methodology applied in 
preparing the model; 
• T ested the recoverable value model for accuracy, performed 
sensitivity analyses on significant inputs, and challenged the 
appropriateness of key assumptions as compared with third 
party/independent sources or other evidence; and
• Compared the calculated recoverable value to the associated 
carrying value, assessing whether any impairment charge or 
reversal of previously recognised impairment charge is 
required; and
• Considered the appropriateness, sufficiency, and clarity of the 
impairment-related disclosures provided in the financial 
statements and disclosures of sensitivities.
We performed audit procedures at the Group level over this risk 
area covering 100% of the risk amount.
As a result of the audit procedures performed, we have 
concluded that management’s impairment indicator 
analysis for the Group’s CGUs has been carried out 
appropriately and in accordance with the requirements 
of IFRS. 
We concur with management’s analysis that there are 
no impairment indicators nor impairment reversal 
indicators present at 31 December 2016  
and therefore a full impairment assessment is  
not required.
We concur with management’s assessment that the 
carrying value of the Volcan CGU is not impaired or 
requires a reversal of impairment as at 31 December 
2016. 
We concluded that the related disclosures in the Group 
financial statements are appropriate.
70 Hochschild Mining plc Annual Report 2016
Independent auditor’s report to the members of Hochschild Mining plc continued Risk Our response to the risk Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee
Revenue recognition
Refer to the Audit Committee Report 
(page 48); Accounting policies (page 
81); and Note 5 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements. 
For the year ended 31 December 
2016 the Group recognised revenue 
from operations of US$688.2m 
(2015: US$469.1m).
We continue to consider revenue 
recognition as an area of higher risk 
which drives our audit strategy and 
allocation of resources. The number 
of sales contracts and complex terms 
under which title, risks and rewards 
pass to the customer increases the 
risk of measurement and cut-off 
errors. We have also identified risks in 
relation to the calculation of the 
adjustment for provisional pricing, 
including the estimate of silver and 
gold in the concentrate sold. 
Our audit focused on the following procedures:
• Obtained an understanding of the key controls around the 
revenue recognition process to ensure that they were designed 
and implemented effectively, supporting the prevention, 
detection or correction of material errors in the reported 
revenue figures; 
• T ested the operating and effectiveness of key controls (where 
this was deemed a more efficient approach than substantive 
testing), including those controls over provisional pricing;
• Read the terms and conditions of material sales contracts and 
ensured they have been accounted for in line with the Group’s 
revenue recognition policy; 
• Performed detailed substantive testing procedures over the 
revenue transactions, including cut-off testing to ensure 
revenue is recognised in the correct period; 
• For open sales where provisional pricing applies, we compared 
the fair value price assumption to market forward rates and 
recalculated the provisional price adjustment to ensure that 
this item was properly measured. Also we performed a 
subsequent review for the sales closed near the date of 
reporting to check that the final amounts issued on sale 
settlement are materially consistent with the estimation made 
at year-end;
• For the silver and gold price hedging arrangements entered 
during the year, we engaged an EY internal specialist to audit 
management’s hedging documentation, forming an 
independent view that the application of hedge accounting 
was appropriate. We also recalculated the resulting realised 
losses recognised within revenue;
• T ested reconciliation of year-end inventory (additional cut-off 
procedures) by agreeing the movements of production and 
sales transactions to the respective reports; and
• Reviewed the financial statements to assess whether all 
required disclosures in respect of revenue and the provisional 
pricing have been included in the Group financial statements.
We performed audit procedures in two components under full 
scope audit, covering 100% of this risk amount.
As a result of the procedures performed, we have been 
able to conclude that the Group has appropriately 
accounted for the revenue transactions in accordance 
with IFRS, and the calculation of the provisional pricing 
adjustment and the values of the realised loss on the 
hedging arrangements have been performed in 
accordance with the requirements of IFRS and the 
Group’s accounting policies. We noted that in all cases 
management’s assumptions and estimates were 
reasonable. 
Mine rehabilitation provisions 
Refer to the Audit Committee Report 
(page 48); Accounting policies (page 
81); and Notes 26 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements 
At 31 December 2016 management 
has recorded a mine rehabilitation 
provision of US$102.4m (2015: 
US$120.1m). 
Management is required to provide 
for the costs of environmental 
rehabilitation and site restoration in 
accordance with IAS 37 ‘Provisions, 
contingent liabilities and contingent 
assets’. 
Given the high level of judgement 
and estimation applied in assessing 
the method, timing and quantum of 
the cash flows required to 
rehabilitate mines, this is an area of 
audit focus. We noted that the 
provision has decreased and 
therefore we challenged 
management’s measurement.
Our approach consisted of the following procedures: 
• Obtained an understanding of management’s process to 
calculate the future restoration costs;
• Obtained and read copies of the mine closure reports issued by 
the external specialists engaged by the Group to update the 
mine closure plans, and held discussions directly with the 
specialists, to understand their work and assess the sufficiency 
of the Group’s restoration provisions;
• Reviewed any significant changes in estimates or new 
restoration costs and challenged the rationale behind the 
updates;
• Assessed the objectiveness and completeness of the external 
and internal specialists used by management;
• Audited the significant changes in estimates and challenged 
the reasoning behind these. For this purpose we held 
discussions with management and the third-party specialist as 
well as performed comparison to prior year figures and 
enquired about significant variances;
• Performed an overall recalculation of the provision, including 
challenging the discount rate applied; and
• Assessed the accounting for the changes to these provisions, 
and ensured that these changes and the provisions were 
appropriately reflected and disclosed in the Group financial 
statements.
We performed audit procedures in two components under full 
scope audit, covering 100% of this risk amount.
As a result of the procedures performed we concluded 
that the provisions for mine rehabilitation activities 
have been recognised appropriately in accordance with 
IFRS, and that all required disclosures have been 
included in the Group financial statements. Based on 
the information available, we consider that the 
judgements and assumptions made by management 
and the external specialists appear to be reasonable.
www.hochschildmining.com 71
Governance As part of our audit, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there is evidence of 
bias by the Directors that may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. The above is not a complete list of all risks identified by 
our audit.
Our audit approach and assessment of risks of material misstatements change in response to changes in circumstances affecting the Hochschild 
Mining plc business and impacting the Group financial statements. Since the 2015 audit, we have made the following change to our risks of 
material misstatements: 
• The risk relating to the recoverability of the carrying value of the Group’s mining assets has been reduced relative to the prior year as no 
impairment assessment of the recoverable value of the Group’s mining assets was performed (excluding intangible assets with indefinite 
useful life), as there were no impairment or impairment reversal indicators present as at 31 December 2016.
• As at 31 December 3016, the mine rehabilitation provision decreased by US$17.0m mainly as a result of the review performed by external 
specialists. We now consider mine rehabilitation provision to be a risk of material misstatement given it had the greatest effect on the 
allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
• We no longer consider ‘Going concern’ to be a risk of material misstatement on the basis of the higher level of operating cash inflows and 
improved net cash positions of the Group, as compared to the prior year. 
• We no longer consider ‘T ax contingencies’ to be a risk of material misstatement as there have been no significant changes from prior year in 
terms of timing and potential impact that could have a significant effect on the risk arising from tax exposures. Consequently, this issue no 
longer has the greatest effect on the allocation of resources in the audit.
The scope of our audit 
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for each 
entity within the Group. T aken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We take into account size, 
the organisation of the group and effectiveness of group-wide controls, the industry in which the Group operates, changes in the business 
environment and other factors, such the risks of material misstatement, when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity.
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage of 
significant accounts in the Group financial statements, of the 18 reporting components of the Group, we selected three components covering 
entities within the UK, Peru and Argentina, which represent the principal business units within the Group. On these components we performed 
an audit of the complete financial information (“full scope components”) which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics. 
In addition to this, at the Group level we performed audit procedures on specific accounts on two components that we considered had the 
potential for the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the Group financial statements either because of the size of these accounts or 
their risk profile (“specific scope components”).
The reporting full scope and specific scope components where we performed audit procedures accounted for 97% (2015: 97%) of the Group’s 
Adjusted EBITDA (on an absolute basis), 100% (2015: 100%) of the Group’s revenue and 96% (2015: 97%) of the Group’s total assets. 
The remaining components represent 3% of the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA and none is individually greater than 1% of the Group’s Adjusted 
EBITDA. For these components, we performed other procedures, including analytical review and testing of consolidation journals to respond to 
any potential risks of material misstatement to the Group financial statements.

72 Hochschild Mining plc Annual Report 2016
Independent auditor’s report to the members of Hochschild Mining plc continued Involvement with component teams 
In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the components 
by us, as the primary audit engagement team, or by component auditors from other EY global network firms operating under our instruction. Of 
the three full scope components, audit procedures were performed on two directly by the Peruvian and Argentinian EY member firms, while the 
third component was audited by the Group team.
For the components, where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the appropriate level of involvement to enable us to 
determine that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole.
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits that is designed to ensure that the Senior Statutory Auditor visits each 
of the primary operating locations where the Group audit scope was focused. The primary audit team and Senior Statutory Auditor visit the Peru 
operating location twice every year, and the Argentina operating location is visited at least once every two years. During the current year’s audit 
cycle, visits were undertaken to the component team in Peru. The last visit to the Argentina operating location was in February 2015 and next visit 
is expected to take place in 2017. For all locations subject to a full audit, in addition to any location visits, the primary team interacted regularly 
with the component teams during various stages of the audit and was responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process. The primary 
team also participated in the component teams’ planning, discussed the audit approach with the component teams and any issues arising from 
their work, reviewed key audit working papers and attended all closing meetings either in person or by call. The Group audit team tested the 
consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm the conclusion that there were no significant risks of material 
misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject to full audit or an audit of specified account 
balances. This, together with the additional procedures performed at Group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the Group 
financial statements.
Our application of materiality 
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in 
forming our audit opinion. 
 
 
Starting basis
• Profit from continuing operations before exceptional items, net finance cost, foreign exchange loss and 
income tax
 
 
Adjustments
• Add: Depreciation and amortisation in cost of sales and in administrative expenses
• Add: Exploration expenses other than personnel and other exploration related fixed expenses
• Add: Other non-cash expenses
 
 
Materiality
• Adjusted EBITDA - US$329.0m
• Materiality: 2% of Adjusted EBITDA
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the Group to be US$6.3 million (2015: US$2.6 million), which is approximately 2% (2015: 2%) of Adjusted EBITDA. 
We consider that Adjusted EBITDA provides us with an earnings-based measure that is significant to users of the financial statements on which 
we could set our materiality. This was deemed to be a critical measure for users of the financial statements, given the focus on this metric by the 
Group’s shareholders, investors and external lenders, specifically as an Adjusted EBITDA measure is used to assess the Group’s compliance with 
key restrictive covenants on the Group’s borrowings.
Our materiality amount provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of risk assessment procedures, identifying and assessing the risk 
of material misstatement and determining the nature and extent of further audit procedures. Materiality is assessed on both quantitative and 
qualitative grounds.

Governance Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability 
that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment and the number and monetary 
amounts of individual uncorrected misstatements identified in prior periods as well as the nature of the misstatements, our judgement was that 
performance materiality for the Group was 75% (2015: 75%) of our planning materiality, namely US$4.7m (2015: US$2.0m). We have set 
performance materiality at this percentage due to our understanding of the Group’s control environment and that there have been no significant 
events that would alter our expectation that there is a low likelihood of misstatements that would be material individually or in aggregate to the 
financial statements. 
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken based 
on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is based on the relative scale and risk of 
the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component. In the current year, the range of 
performance materiality allocated to components was US$3.8m to US$3.0m (2015: US$2.0m to US$1.1m). 
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of US$315k (2015: US$130k), 
which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative 
grounds. 
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant 
qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that 
the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies 
we consider the implications for our report.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 68, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. T o the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
• based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: 
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the financial statements; and
• the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

Independent auditor’s report to the members of Hochschild Mining plc continued Matters on which we are required to report by exception
ISAs (UK and Ireland) 
reporting
We are required to report to you if, in our opinion, financial and non-financial information in the 
Annual Report is: 
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or 
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the 
Group acquired in the course of performing our audit; or 
• otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our 
knowledge acquired in the course of performing the audit and the Directors’ statement that they 
consider the Annual Report and accounts taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the entity’s performance, business 
model and strategy; and whether the Annual Report appropriately addresses those matters that we 
communicated to the Audit Committee that we consider should have been disclosed.
We have no exceptions to report.
Companies Act 2006 
reporting
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Company and its environment obtained in  
the course of the audit, we have identified no material misstatements in the Strategic Report or 
Directors’ Report. 
We are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for 
our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
We have no exceptions to report.
Listing Rules review 
requirements
We are required to review:
• the directors’ statement in relation to going concern, set out on page 43, and longer-term viability, 
set out on page 39; and
• the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the 
ten provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.
We have no exceptions to report.
Statement on the Directors’ assessment of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or  
liquidity of the entity
ISAs (UK and 
Ireland) reporting
We are required to give a statement as to whether we have anything material to add or to draw 
attention to in relation to:
• the Directors’ confirmation in the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of 
the principal risks facing the entity, including those that would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity;
• the disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being 
managed or mitigated;
• the Directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate 
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any 
material uncertainties to the entity’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve 
months from the date of approval of the financial statements; and
• the Directors’ explanation in the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the 
entity, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, 
and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the entity will be able 
to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, 
including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing material to add 
or to draw attention to.

4 On 1 June 2016, Empresa de Transmisión Aymaraes S.A.C. (“Aymara es”) absorbed Empresa de Transmisión Callalli S.A.C. Although the Group’s interest in this company did not exceed 
50% in 2015, it was considered as a subsidiary in accordance with IFRS 10, as the Group had all of the following elements: (1) power over the investee in the relevant activities, (2) 
exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and (3) the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor’s returns. 
5 Asociación Sumac Tarpuy (“Sumac Tarpuy”) is an unincorporated entity, which received donations from Compañía Minera Ares S.A. C. (‘Ares’), and spent this money at  
the direction of Ares on community and soci al welfare activities located close to its mine units. Accordingly, the Group consol idated this entity. On 17 May 2016 Ares transferred all its 
rights over Sumac Tarpuy to Inversiones ASPI S.A. (see note 4). 
2 Significant accounting policies  
(a) Basis of preparation  
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the 
European Union (EU) and the Companies Act 2006.  
The basis of preparation and accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 
2015 are set out below. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for the reva luation of certain 
financial instruments that are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period, as explained below. These accounting policies have been 
consistently applied, except for the effects of the adoption of new and amended accounting standard. 
The financial statements are presented in US dollars ($) and al l monetary amounts are rounded to the nearest thousand ($000) ex cept when 
otherwise indicated.  
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis. Details of the factors which have been taken into accou nt in assessing the 
Group’s going concern status are set out within the Directors’ report. 
Changes in accounting policy and disclosures  
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of 
the consolidated financial statement for the year ended 31 December 2015. Amendments to standards and interpretations which cam e into force 
during the year did not have a significant impact on the Group’s financial statements. 
Standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been previously adopted 
by the Group  
Certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for the Group ’s accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 or later periods but which the Group has not previous ly adopted. Those that are ap plicable to the Group 
are as follows:  
• IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. 
This standard outlines the principles an entity must apply to measure and recognise revenue. The Group is planning to apply the standard when it 
becomes mandatory, analysing all the variables during the first quarter of 2017, including the method of implementation and the restatement of 
the previous year financial information. IFRS 15 is not expected to have a significant effect on the financial statements. 
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. 
IFRS 9 is the replacement of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. The standard includes requirements for recognition and 
measurement, impairment, derecognition and general hedge accounting. IFRS 9 should be applied retrospectively in accordance wit h IAS 8 
Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, subject to certain exemptions and exceptions. The Group do not anticipate a 
significant effect over the financial statements. 
• IFRS 16 Leases, applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. 
• IFRS 16 specifies how an IFRS reporter will recognise, measure, present and disclose leases. The standard provides a single les see accounting 
model, requiring lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset has a low 
value. Lessors continue to classify leases as operating or finance, with IFRS 16’s approach to lessor accounting substantially unchanged from its 
predecessor, IAS 17.The Group is analysing the adoption of this new standard and expected not to have a significant impact on t he Group´s 
financial position or performance. 
• IAS 7 Statement of cash flows, applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017. 
 The amendments require entities to provide disclosures about changes in their liabilities arising from financing activities, i ncluding both changes 
arising from cash flows and non-cash changes. The adoption of these amendments would not have impact on the Group´s financial p osition  
or performance. 
• IAS 12 Income Taxes, applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017. 
 The amendments clarify the accounting for deferred tax assets for unrealised losses on debt instruments measured at fair value . Entities are 
required to apply the amendments retrospectively. The adoption of these rules would not have impact on the Group´s financial po sition  
or performance.   82 Hochschild Mining plc Annual Report 2016

2 Significant accounting policies continued 
• IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions - Amendments to IFRS 2, applicable for annual periods beginning on 
or after 1 January 2018. 
The amendments are related to the classification and measurement of share-based payment transactions and it does not require to restate prior 
periods. The adoption of these amendments would not have impact on the Group´s financial position or performance. 
The Group is analysing the effect of the standards and plans to adopt the new standards on the required effective date. 
(b) Judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty  
Many of the amounts included in the financial statements involve the use of judgement and/or estimation. These judgements and e stimates are 
based on management’s best knowledge of the relevant facts and ci rcumstances, having regard to prior experience, but actual res ults may differ 
from the amounts included in the financial statements. Information about such judgements and estimates is contained in the acco unting policies 
and/or the notes to the financial statements.  
Significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements made by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements include: 
Significant estimates: 
• Determination of useful lives of assets for depreciation and amortisation purposes – note 2(e). 
Estimates are required to be made by management as to the useful lives of assets. For depreciation calculated under the unit of -production 
method, estimated recoverable reserves and resources are used in determining the depreciation and/or amortisation of mine-speci fic assets. This 
results in a depreciation/amortisation charge proportional to the depletion of the anticipated remaining life-of-mine production. Each item’s life, 
which is assessed annually, has regard to both its physical life limitations and to present assessments of economically recover able reserves and 
resources of the mine property at which the asset is located. These calculations require the use of estimates and assumptions, including the 
amount of recoverable reserves and resources. Changes are accounted for prospectively. 
• Determination of ore reserves and resources – note 2(g). 
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating ore reserves and resources. Assumptions that are valid at the time of e stimation may 
change significantly when new information becomes available. Changes in the forecast prices of commodities, exchange rates, pro duction costs 
or recovery rates may change the economic status of reserves an d resources and may, ultimately, result in the reserves and reso urces being 
restated. 
• Review of non-financial asset carrying values and impairment charges or reversals – 2(i), 16, 17 and 18. 
The assessment of asset carrying values requires the use of esti mates and assumptions such as lo ng-term commodity prices, discount rates, 
future capital requirements, exploration potential and operating performance. Changes in these assumptions will affect the reco verable amount 
of the property, plant and equipment, evaluation and exploration assets, and intangibles. 
• Estimation of the amount and timing of mine closure costs – notes 2(m) and 26. 
The Group assesses its mine closure cost pr ovision annually. Significant estimates and assumptions are made in determining the provision for 
mine closure cost as there are numerous factors that will affect the ultimate liability payable. These factors include estimate s of the extent and 
costs of rehabilitation activities, technological changes, regulato ry changes, cost increases, mine life and changes in discoun t rates. Those 
uncertainties may result in future actual expenditure differing from the amounts currently provided. The provision at the balan ce sheet date 
represents management’s best estimate of the present value of the future closure costs required.  
• Significant estimates and assumptions for cash-settled transactions – notes 26(3). 
The Group initially measures the cost of cash-settled transactions with employees using the Monte Carlo model to determine the fair value of the 
liability incurred. The liability needs to be remeasured at the end of each reporting period up to the date of settlement, with any changes in fair 
value recognised in the profit or loss. This requires a reassessment of the estimates used at the end of each reporting period, including the 
anticipated potential changes to the Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) performance, the number of participants in the plan, and levels of interest 
rates. The assumptions and models used for esti mating fair value are discussed in note 26(3). 
• Significant estimates and assumptions for asse ts classified as held for sale- note 23. 
To determine whether an asset should be classified as an asset held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5, consideration should be given as to 
whether the sale ‘highly probable’. The three main criteria are: There is a plan in place to sell the asset, the sale is due to complete within 12 
months of the year end; and that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or the sale withdrawn. As dis closed in note 23, 
despite the final payment date for the sale of San Felipe property being within twelve months, all the three criteria to be con sidered “highly 
probable” (as defined by IFRS 5) have not been met and therefore the property has not been classified as an assets held for sale.

Critical judgements: 
• Production start date. 
The Group assesses the stage of each mine under development/construction to determine when a mine moves into the production pha se, this being 
when the mine is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. 
The criteria used to assess the start date are determined based on the unique nature of each mine development/construction proj ect, such as the 
complexity of the project and its location. The Group considers various relevant criteria to assess when the production phase i s considered to have 
commenced. At this point, all related amounts are reclassified from ‘Construction in progress’ to the corresponding type of ‘Pr operty, plant and 
equipment.’ Some of the criteria used to identify the production start date include, but are not limited to: 
• Level of capital expenditure incurred compared with the original construction cost estimate 
• Completion of a reasonable period of testing of the mine plant and equipment 
• Ability to produce product in saleable form (within specifications) 
• Ability to sustain ongoing production of product 
When a mine development project moves into the production phase, the capitalisation of certain mine development costs ceases and  
costs are either regarded as forming part of the cost of inventory or expensed, except for costs that qualify for capitalisatio n relating to  
mining asset additions or improvements, underground mine development or mineable reserve development. It is also at this point that 
depreciation/amortisation commences. 
Based on the above criteria in determining when Inmaculada moved into the production phase, it was determined by management tha t  
the start date was 1 August 2015. 
• Determination of functional currencies – note 2(d). 
The determination of functional currency requires management judgement, particularly where there may be several currencies in w hich 
transactions are undertaken and which impact the economic environment in which the entity operates.  
• Income tax – notes 2(r), 14, 28 and 34. 
Judgement is required in determining whether deferred tax assets are recognised in the statement of financial position. Deferre d tax assets, 
including those arising from un-utilised tax losses require management to assess the likelihood that the Group will generate ta xable earnings 
in future periods, in order to utilise recognised deferred tax assets. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecast cash flows  
from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ 
significantly from estimates, the ability of the Group to realise the net deferred tax assets recorded at the balance sheet dat e could be impacted. 
Judgement is also required when determining the provision for taxes as the tax treatment of some transactions cannot be finally determined until  
a formal resolution has been reached with the tax authorities. Provisions are also made for uncertain exposures which can have an impact on both 
deferred and current tax. Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that the benefit will be obtained and tax provi sions are made if it is 
possible that a liability will arise. The final resolution of these transactions may give rise to material adjustments to the i ncome statement and/or 
cashflow in future periods. The Group reviews each significant tax liability or benefit each period to assess the appropriate a ccounting treatment. 
• Recognition of evaluation and exploration assets and transfer to development costs – notes 2(f), 16 and 17. 
Judgement is required in determining when the future economic benefit of a project can reasonably be regarded as assured, at wh ich point 
evaluation and exploration expenses are capitalised. This includes the assessment of whether there is sufficient evidence of th e probability  
of the existence of economically recoverable minerals to justify the commencement of capitalisation of costs; the timing of the end of the 
exploration phase; the start of the development phase; and the commencement of the production phase. For this purpose, the futu re economic 
benefit of the project can reasonably be regarded as assured when the Board authorises management to conduct a feasibility stud y, mine-site 
exploration is being conducted to convert resources to reserves, or mine-site exploration is being conducted to confirm resourc es, all of which are 
based on supporting geological information. 
• Recoverable values of mining assets – notes 16, 17 and 18. 
The values of the Group’s mining assets are sensitive to a range of characteristics unique to each mine unit. Key sources of es timation for all assets 
include uncertainty around ore reserve estimates and cash flow pr ojections. In performing impairment reviews, the Group assesses the 
recoverable amount of its operating assets principally with refe rence to fair value less costs of disposal, assessed using disc ounted cash flow 
models. There is judgement involved in determining the assumptions that are considered to be reasonable and consistent with tho se that would 
be applied by market participants. Key judgements include the estimation of future gold and silver prices, mine production proj ections and the 
application of discount rates which reflect the macro-economic risk in Peru and Argentina as applicable.

(c) Basis of consolidation  
The consolidated financial statements set out the Group’s financial position, performance and cash flows as at 31 December 2016 and  
31 December 2015 and for the years then ended, respectively.  
Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Group regardless of the amount of shares owned by the Group. Control is achie ved when the Group 
is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those retur ns through its power over 
the investee. Non-controlling interests’ rights to safeguard thei r interest are fully considered in assessing whether the Group controls a subsidiary. 
Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has:  
• power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investe e);  
• exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and  
• the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns. 
Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights results in control. To support this presumption and when the Group has less than a 
majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power  
over an investee, including: 
• the contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee;  
• rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and  
• the Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights.  
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three 
elements of control. 
Basis of consolidation  
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and contin ue to be consolidated 
until the date that such control ceases.  
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction, affecting retained earnings.  
If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it (i) derecognises the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsid iary; (ii) derecognises the 
carrying amount of any non-controlling interest (‘NCI’); (iii) derecognises the cumulative translation differences, recorded in equity; (iv) recognises  
the fair value of the consideration received; (v) recognises the fair value of any investment retained; (vi) recognises any sur plus or deficit in profit  
or loss; and (vii) reclassifies the parent’s share of components previously recognised in other comprehensive income to profit or loss or retained 
earnings, as appropriate. 
An NCI represents the equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly and indirectly, to the parent company and is presented separately  
within equity in the consolidated statement of financial position, separately from equity attributable to owners of the parent. 
Losses within a subsidiary are attributable to the NCI even if that results in a deficit balance. 
Business combinations  
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate o f the consideration 
transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any NCI in the acquiree. The choice of measurement of NC I, either at fair 
value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets, is determined on a transaction by transaction basis. Acquisition costs 
incurred are expensed and included in administrative expenses.  
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recog nised for the NCI,  
and any previously interest held, over the net identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Assets acquired and li abilities assumed in 
transactions separate to the business combinations, such as the settlement of pre-existing relationships or post-acquisition re muneration 
arrangements, are accounted for separately from the business combination in accordance with their nature and applicable IFRSs. Identifiable 
intangible assets meeting either the contractual-legal or the separability criterion are recognised separately from goodwill. C ontingent liabilities 
representing a present obligation are recognised if the acquisition date fair value can be measured reliably. 
(d) Currency translation  
The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined by the currency of the primary economic environment in which  
it operates. For the holding companies and operating entities this currency is US dollars and for the other entities it is the local currency of  
the country in which it operates. The Group’s financial information is presented in US dollars, which is the Company’s function al currency.  
Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity are initially recorded in the functiona l currency using the 
exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are reme asured at the rate  
of exchange ruling at the statement of financial position date. Exchange gains and losses on settlement of foreign currency tra nsactions which  
are translated at the rate prevailing at the date of the transactions, or on the translation of monetary assets and liabilities which are translated at 
period-end exchange rates, are taken to the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign curren cies that are 
stated at historical cost are translated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Exchange 
differences arising from monetary items that are part of a net investment in a foreign operation are recognised in equity and t ransferred to income 
on disposal of such net investment.   www.hochschildmining.com 85
Financial statements
 
 
www.hochschildmining.com 85 
 
Subsidiary financial statements expressed in their corresponding functional currencies are translated into US dollars by applyi ng the exchange rate 
at period-end for assets and liabilities and the transaction date exchange rate for income statement items. The resulting diffe rence on consolidation 
is included as cumulative translation adjustment in equity.  
(e) Property, plant and equipment  
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost compri ses its purchase 
price and directly attributable costs of acquisition or construction required to bring the asset to the condition necessary for the asset to be capable  
of operating in the manner intended by management. Economical and physical conditions of assets have not changed substantially over this period.  
The cost less residual value of each item of property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life. Each item’s est imated useful life  
has been assessed with regard to both its own physical life limitations and the present assessment of economically recoverable reserves and 
resources of the mine property at which the item is located. Estimates of remaining useful lives are made on a regular basis fo r all mine buildings, 
machinery and equipment, with annual reassessments for major items. Depreciation is charged to cost of production on a units of production basis 
for mine buildings and installations and plant and equipment used in the mining production process, or charged directly to the income statement 
over the estimated useful life of the individual asset on a straight-line basis when not related to the mining production proce ss. Changes in 
estimates, which mainly affect units of production calculations, are accounted for prospectively. Depreciation commences when a ssets are available 
for use. Land is not depreciated.  
An asset’s carrying amount is written-down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated 
recoverable amount. 
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the net proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within o ther 
income/expenses, in the income statement.  
The expected useful lives under the straight-line method are as follows:  
 Years
Buildings 3 to 33
Plant and equipment 5 to 10
Vehicles 5
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to be  
ready for its intended use are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed where incur red. For borrowings 
associated with a specific asset, the actual rate on that borrowi ng is used. Otherwise, a weighted average cost of borrowing is used. The Group 
capitalises the borrowing costs related to qualifying assets wi th a value of US$1,000,000 or more, considering that the substan tial period of time  
to be ready is six or more months. 
Mining properties and development costs  
Purchased mining properties are recognised as assets at their cost of acquisition or at fair value if purchased as part of a bu siness combination.  
Costs associated with developments of mining properties are capitalised. 
Mine development costs are, upon commencement of commercial production, depreciated using the units of production method based on  
the estimated economically recoverable reserves and resources to which they relate.  
When a mine construction project moves into the production stage, the capitalisation of certain mine construction costs ceases and costs are  
either regarded as part of the cost of inventory or expensed, except for costs which qualify for capitalisation relating to min ing asset additions or 
improvements, underground mine development or mineable reserve de velopment. In addition, the revenue generated by the sale of t he inventory 
produced during the pre-operating stage is recognised as a deduction of the costs capitalised for this project. 
Construction in progress and capital advances 
Assets in the course of construction are capitalised as a separate component of property, plant and equipment. Once the asset m oves into the 
production phase, the cost of construction is transferred to th e appropriate category. Construction in progress is not deprecia ted.  
Subsequent expenditure  
Expenditure incurred to replace a component of an item of property, plant and equipment is capitalised separately with the carr ying amount  
of the component being written off. Other subsequent expenditure is capitalised if future economic benefits will arise from the expenditure.  
All other expenditure including repairs and maintenance expenditures are recognised in the income statement as incurred.  
(f) Evaluation and exploration assets 
Evaluation and exploration expenses are capitalised when the future economic benefit of the project can reasonably be regarded as assured. 
Projects in the development phase – Exploration and evaluation costs are capitalised as assets from the date that the Board aut horises management 
to conduct a feasibility study.  
Expenditure is transferred to mine development costs once the work completed to date supports the future development of the pro perty  
and such development receives appropriate approval.

2 Significant accounting policies continued 
Identification of resources – Costs incurred in converting infe rred resources to indicated and measured resources (of which reserves are a component) 
are capitalised as incurred. Costs incurred in identi fying inferred resources are expensed as incurred.  
(g) Determination of ore reserves and resources  
The Group estimates its ore reserves and mineral resources based on information compiled by internal competent persons. Reports to support these 
estimates are prepared each year and are stated in conformity with the 2012 Joint Ore Reserves Committee (JORC) code. 
It is the Group’s policy to have the report audited by a Competent Person.  
Reserves and resources are used in the units of production calculation for depreciation as well as the determination of the tim ing of mine closure 
cost and impairment analysis.  
(h) Intangible assets  
Right to use energy transmission line 
Transmission line costs represent the investment made by the Group during the period of its use. This is an asset with a finite useful life equal to that 
of the mine to which it relates and that is amortised applying the units of production method for that mine. 
Water permits 
Water permits represent the cost that allow the holder to withdraw a specified amount of water from the ground for reasonable, beneficial  
uses. This is an asset with an indefinite useful life. 
Legal rights 
Legal rights correspond to expenditures required to give the Group the right to use a property for the surface exploration work , development  
and production. This is an asset with a finite useful life equal to that of the mine to which it relates and that is amortised applying the units of 
production method for that mine. 
Other intangible assets  
Other intangible assets are primarily computer software which are capitalised at cost and are amortised on a straight-line basi s over their useful life 
of three years. 
(i) Impairment of non-financial assets  
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.  
The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment and evaluation and exploration assets are reviewed for impairment if even ts or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If there are indicators of impairment, an exercise is un dertaken to determine 
whether the carrying values are in excess of their recoverable amount. Such review is undertaken on an asset-by-asset basis, ex cept where such 
assets do not generate cash flows independent of other assets, and then the review is undertaken at the cash-generating unit le vel.  
The assessment requires the use of estimates and assumptions such as long-term commodity prices, discount rates, future capital requirements, 
exploration potential and operating performance. Changes in these assumptions will affect the recoverable amount of the propert y, plant and 
equipment and evaluation and exploration assets. 
If the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment provision is recorded to reflect 
the asset at the lower amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.  
Calculation of recoverable amount  
The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their value in use (VIU) and fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD) to se ll. FVLCD is based 
on an estimate of the amount that the Group may obtain in a sale transaction on an arm’s length basis. VIU is based on estimate d future cash flows 
discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to 
the asset. For an asset that does not generate cash inflows largely independent of those from other assets, the recoverable amo unt is determined for 
the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.  
The recoverable values of the CGU are determined using a FVLCD methodology. FVLCD was determined using a combination of level 2 and level 3 
inputs to construct a discounted cash flow model to estimate the amount that would be paid by a willing third party in an arm's length transaction.  
Reversal of impairment  
An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairm ent loss is 
reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determine d, net of 
depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

(j) Inventories  
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost is determined using the weighted average method.  
The cost of work in progress and finished goods (ore inventories) is based on the cost of production. For this purpose, the cos ts of production include: 
• costs, materials and contractor expenses which are directly attributable to the extraction and processing of ore; 
• depreciation of property, plant and equipment used in the extraction and processing of ore; and 
• related production overheads (based on normal operating capacity). 
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expens es. 
(k) Trade and other receivables  
Current trade receivables are carried at the original invoice amount less provision made for impairment of these receivables. N on-current receivables 
are stated at amortised cost. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence t hat the Group will not 
be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivable which on average, do not exceed 30 days. T he amount of the 
provision is the difference between the carrying amount and the re coverable amount and this difference is recognised in the inc ome statement.  
(l) Share capital  
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Any excess above the par value of shares received upon issuance of those shares is cl assified as share premium. 
In the case the excess above par value is available for distribution, it is classified as merger reserve and then transferred t o retained earnings. 
(m) Provisions  
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (l egal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is pr obable that an outflow  
of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect of the time 
value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that refl ects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the 
provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.  
Mine closure cost  
Provisions for mine closure costs are made in respect of the estimated future costs of closure and restoration and for environm ental rehabilitation 
costs (which include the dismantling and demolition of infrastructure, removal of residual materials and remediation of disturb ed areas) in the 
accounting period when the related environmental disturbance occurs. The provision is discounted and the unwinding of the disco unt is included in 
finance costs. At the time of establishing the provision, a corresponding asset is capitalised and is depreciated over future p roduction from the mine 
to which it relates. The provision is reviewed on an annual basis for changes in cost estimates, discount rates and operating l ives.  
Changes to estimated future costs are recognised in the statement of financial position by adjusting the mine closure cost liab ility and the related 
asset originally recognised. If, for mature mines, the related mine assets net of mine closure cost provisions exceed the recov erable value, that portion 
of the increase is charged directly to the income statement. Similarly, reductions to the estimated costs exceeding the carryin g value of the mine 
asset, that portion of the decrease is credited directly to th e income statement. For closed si tes, changes to estimated costs are recognised 
immediately in the income statement. 
Workers’ profit sharing and other employee benefits  
In accordance with Peruvian legislation, companies in Peru must provide for workers’ profit sharing equivalent to 8% of taxable income of each year. 
This amount is charged to the income statement within personnel expenses (note 10) and is considered deductible for income tax purposes. The 
Group has no pension or retirement benefit schemes.  
Other  
Other provisions are accounted for when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation for which it is probable there will be an outflow of 
resources for which the amount can be reliably estimated.  
(n) Share-based payments 
Cash-settled transactions 
The fair value of cash-settled share plans is recognised as a liability over the vesting period of the awards. Movements in tha t liability between 
reporting dates are recognised as personnel expenses. The fair value of the awards is taken to be the market value of the share s at the date of award 
adjusted by a factor for anticipated relative TSR performance. Fair values are subsequently remeasured at each reporting date t o reflect the number 
of awards expected to vest based on the current and anticipated TSR performance.

2 Significant accounting policies continued 
Equity-settled transactions 
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in other reserves in equity, over the period in which the 
performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled. The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until 
the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equ ity instruments that 
vest. The income statement expense for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning an d end of that 
period and is recognised in personnel expenses (note 10).  
(o) Contingencies  
Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements and are disclosed in notes to the financial statements un less their occurrence  
is remote.  
Contingent assets are not recognised in the financial statements, but are disclosed in the notes if their recovery is deemed pr obable. 
(p) Revenue recognition  
The Group is involved in the production and sale of gold and silver from doré and concentrate containing both gold and silver. Doré bars are either 
sold directly to customers or are sent to a third-party for further refining into gold and silver before they are sold. Concent rate is sold directly  
to customers. 
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be re liably measured.  
Revenue associated with the sale of gold and silver from doré and concentrate is recognised in the income statement when all si gnificant risks and 
rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer, usually when title has passed to the cust omer. Revenue excludes any appli cable sales taxes. 
The revenue is subject to adjustment based on inspection of the product by the customer. Revenue is initially recognised on a p rovisional basis using 
the Group’s best estimate of contained gold and silver. Any subsequent adjustments to the initial estimate of metal content are recorded in revenue 
once they have been determined.  
In addition, certain sales are ‘provisionally priced’ where the selling price is subject to final adjustment at the end of a pe riod, normally ranging  
from 15 to 90 days after the start of the delivery process to the customer, based on the market price at the relevant quotation point stipulated  
in the contract. Revenue is initially recognised when the conditions set out above have been met, using market prices at that d ate. The price exposure 
is considered to be an embedded derivative and hence separated from the sales contract at each reporting date. The provisionall y priced metal is 
revalued based on the forward selling price for the quotational period stipulated in the contract until the quotational period ends. The selling price  
of gold and silver can be measured reliably as these metals are actively traded on international exchanges. The revaluation of provisionally priced 
contracts is recorded as an adjustment to revenue.  
Income from services provided to related parties (note 30) is recognised in revenue when services are provided.  
Deferred revenue results when cash is received in advance of revenue being earned. Deferred revenue is recorded as a liability until it is earned. Once 
earned, the liability is reduced and revenue is recorded. The Group analyses when revenue is earned or deferred. 
(q) Finance income and costs  
Finance income and costs comprise interest expense on borrowings, the accumulation of interest on provisions, interest income o n funds invested, 
unwind of discount, gains and losses from the change in fair va lue of derivative instruments an d gains and losses on the dispos al of available-for-
sale investments.  
Interest income is recognised as it accrues, taking into account the effective yield on the asset.  
(r) Income tax  
Income tax for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the exte nt that it relates to 
items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.  
Current tax expense is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted at the statement of financial position 
date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.  
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amo unts of assets and 
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes, with the following exceptions: 
• where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction tha t is not a business 
combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss; and  
• in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where t he timing of 
the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is re alised or the liability is 
settled based on the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial pos ition date.  
   www.hochschildmining.com 89
Financial statements
 
 
www.hochschildmining.com 89 
 
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can  
be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be r ealised.  
(s) Uncertain tax positions  
An estimated tax liability is recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable th at the Group will be 
required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The provision is the be st estimate of the 
consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date, taking into account risks and uncertainties surrounding the 
obligation. Separate provisions for interest and penalties are also recorded if appropriate.  
Movements in interest and penalty amounts in respect of tax provisions are not included in the tax charge, but are disclosed in the income 
statement. Tax provisions are based on management’s interpretation of country specific tax law and the likelihood of settlement . This involves a 
significant amount of judgement as tax legislation can be complex and open to different interpretation. Management uses in-house tax experts, 
professional firms and previous experience when assessing tax ri sks. Where actual tax liabilities differ from the provisions, a djustments are made 
which can have a material impact on the Group’s profits for the year. Refer to note 34(b) for specific tax contingencies.  
(t) Leases  
Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised at the 
inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or , if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are 
apportioned between finance charges and the reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant periodic rate of inter est on the remaining 
balance of the liability. Finance charges are reflected in the income statement. The depreciation policy for leased assets is c onsistent with that for 
similar assets owned.  
A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ow nership. Operating lease 
payments are recognised as an expense in the income st atement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  
(u) Financial instruments  
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes party to the contracts that give rise to them and are cl assified as loans or 
borrowings, receivables, payables, financial instruments fair va lued through profit and loss, available-for-sale financial asse ts or as derivatives 
designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge (refer to note 2(y)), as appropriate. The Group determines the classifi cation of its financial 
assets and liabilities at initial recognition and, where allowed and appropriate, re-evaluates this designation at each financi al year-end. When financial 
assets and liabilities are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, being the transaction price plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair 
value through profit or loss and borrowings, directly attributabl e transaction costs. The Group considers whether a contract co ntains an embedded 
derivative when the entity first becomes a party to it. The embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract if it is not measured at fair value 
through profit or loss and when the economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contract. R eassessment only occurs  
if there is a change in the terms of the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows that would otherwise be required. All regular way purchases 
and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date, being the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the a sset. Regular way 
transactions require delivery and receipt of assets within the time frame generally established by regulation or convention in t he marketplace. The 
subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification, as follows:  
Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss  
Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss includes financial assets held for trading and financial assets designat ed upon initial recognition 
as at fair value through profit and loss.  
Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling in the near term. Derivativ es, including separated 
embedded derivatives, are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments or a financial guarantee 
contract. Gains or losses on financial assets held for trading are recognised in the income statement.  
Loans and receivables  
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify 
as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or available-for-sale. Such assets are carried at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money is significant. Gains and losses are recognised in the inco me statement when the 
loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.  
Available-for-sale financial assets  
Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such or are not classified as loans and receivables, 
held-to-maturity investments or financial assets at fair value through profit and loss. After initial recognition, available-fo r-sale financial assets are 
measured at fair value with unrealised gains or losses being recognised as a separate component of equity until the investment is derecognised  
or until the investment is determined to be impaired at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity is included in the  
income statement.  
Loans and borrowings  
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value. After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequ ently measured  
at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
2 Significant accounting policies continued 
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the amortisati on process.  
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liabili ty for at least twelve 
months after the statement of financial position date.  
Impairment of financial assets 
The Group assesses at each statement of fina ncial position date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impai red.  
Available-for-sale financial assets  
For available-for-sale (AFS) financial investments, the Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective eviden ce that an investment 
or a group of investments is impaired. 
In the case of equity investments classified as available-for-sale, objective evidence would include a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value 
of the investment below its cost, where ‘significant’ is estimated to be around 30% of the original cost of the investment and ‘prolonged’ is more 
than 12 months. In addition, the Group analyses any case taking into account the portfolio of projects of the investee, the key technical personnel 
and the viability of the investee to finance its projects. If an available-for-sale asset is impaired, an amount comprising the difference between its cost 
(net of any principal payment and amortisation) and its fair value is transferred from equity to the income statement. Reversal s of impairment losses 
on debt instruments are reversed through the income statement, if the increase in fair value of the instrument can be objective ly related to an event 
occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in profit or loss. Reversals in respect of equity instruments classified as available-for-sale are not 
recognised in the income statement.  
Derecognition of financial instruments  
A financial asset (or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecogn ised when:  
• the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or  
• the Group has transferred its rights to rece ive cash flows from the asset or has assu med an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full 
without material delay to a third-party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either: (a) the Group has transferred substanti ally all the risks 
and rewards of the asset; or (b) the Group has neither transfe rred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has 
transferred control of the asset. 
When the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, a nd has neither 
transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred cont rol of the asset, a new asset is recognised to the 
extent of the Group’s continuing involvement in the asset.  
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset, is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount  
of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to repay.  
A financial liability is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is discharged or cancelled or expires. Where an existing financial 
liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability a re substantially modified, 
such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability , such that the difference 
in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss.  
(v) Dividend distribution  
Dividends on the Company’s ordinary shares are recognised when they have been appropriately authorised and are no longer at the Company’s 
discretion. Accordingly, interim dividends are recognised when they are paid and final dividends are recognised when they are d eclared following 
approval by shareholders at the Company’s Annual General Meeting. 
(w) Cash and cash equivalents  
Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the statement of financial position at cost. For the purposes of the statement of fina ncial position, cash and 
cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and deposits held with banks that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are 
subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents, as d efined above, are shown 
net of outstanding bank overdrafts.  
Liquidity funds are classified as cash equivalents if the amount of cash that will be received is known at the time of the init ial investment and  
the risk of changes in value is considered insignificant.

Financial statements
 
 
www.hochschildmining.com 91 
 
(x) Exceptional items  
Exceptional items are those significant items which, due to their nature or the expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, need to  
be disclosed separately on the face of the income statement to enable a better understanding of the financial performance of th e Group and 
facilitate comparison with prior years. Exceptional items mainly include: 
• impairments or write offs of assets, assets held for sale, property, plant and equipment and evaluation and exploration assets; 
• gains or losses arising on the disposal of subsidiaries, investments or property, plant and equipment; 
• fair value gains or losses arising on financial instruments not held in the normal course of trading; 
• any gain or loss resulting from restructuring within the Group;  
• taxes and interests owed by the Group following a change in circ umstances surrounding tax disputes, resulting in the exposure b eing assessed  
as probable; 
• the impact of infrequent labour action related to work stoppages in mine units; 
• the penalties generated by the early termination of agreements with providers of the Group; 
• the reversal of an accumulation of prior year’s tax expenses that resulted from an agreement with the government; and 
• the related tax impact of the above items. 
(y) Hedging 
The Group uses commodity swaps and zero cost collar contracts to hedge certain of its cash flows from product sales against pri ce risk. These 
derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured at fair value. The fair value of these forward contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar ins truments. 
These forward contracts are classified as cash flow hedges as they are hedging the Group’s exposure to variability in cash flow s that is attributable  
to a particular risk associated with a highly probable forecast sales transaction. 
At the inception of a hedging relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Gro up wishes to  
apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The documentation includes ide ntification  
of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the entity will assess t he hedging 
instrument’s effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item’s fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. Such 
hedges are expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing bas is to determine their 
effectiveness in the financial reporting periods for which they were designated.  
Where the commodity forward contracts meet the strict criteria for hedge accounting, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument is recognised directly in equity, while any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. I n the case of zero  
cost collar contracts, the time value has to be accounted for at fair value through profit or loss, in consequence the change i n the time value will  
be recognised in the income statement. 
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as whe n the forecast 
transaction occurs. 
If the forecast sales transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to th e income statement.  
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, 
amounts previously recognised in equity remain in equity until the forecast sales transaction occurs. 
(z) Fair value measurement 
The Group measures financial instruments, such as, derivatives, and non-financial assets at fair value at each statement of financial position date. 
Also, fair values of financial instru ments are measured at amortised cost. 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction betwe en market participants at  
the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes 
place either: 
• In the principal market for the asset or liability, or 
• In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. 
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group. 
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, 
assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.  92 Hochschild Mining plc Annual Report 2016

92 Hochschild Mining plc Annual Report 2016 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
2 Significant accounting policies continued 
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefi ts by using  
the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest an d best use. 
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to me asure fair value, 
maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. 
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, as 
described in note 36 (e). 
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether t ransfers have occurred 
between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorization (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a 
whole) at the end of each reporting period. 
The Group determines the policies and procedures for both recurring fair value measurement and unquoted AFS financial assets, a nd for  
non-recurring measurement. 
External valuers are involved for valuation of significant assets and significant liabilities. Involvement of external valuers is decided upon annually  
by the Group after discussion with and approval by the Company’s Audit Committee. Selection criteria include market knowledge, reputation, 
independence and whether professional standards are maintained. Valuers are normally rotated every three years. The Group decid es, after 
discussions with the external valuers, which valuation techniques and inputs to use for each case. 
At each reporting date, the Group analyses the movements in the values of assets and liabilities which are required to be re-me asured or  
re-assessed as per the Group’s accounting policies. For this analysis, the Group verifies the major inputs applied in the lates t valuation by agreeing 
the information in the valuation computation to contracts and other relevant documents. 
The Group, in conjunction with its external valuers, where applicable, also compares each the changes in the fair value of each asset and liability  
with relevant external sources to determine whether the change is reasonable. 
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the natur e, characteristics  
and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above. 
3 Segment reporting 
The Group’s activities are principally related to mining operations which involve the exploration, production and sale of gold and silver. Products are 
subject to the same risks and returns and are sold through similar distribution channels. The Group undertakes a number of acti vities solely to 
support mining operations including power generation and services. Transfer prices between segments are set on an arm’s length basis in a manner 
similar to that used for third parties. Segment revenue, segm ent expense and segment results include transfers between segments at market prices. 
Those transfers are eliminated on consolidation.  
For internal reporting purposes, management takes decisions and assesses the performance of the Group through consideration of the following 
reporting segments: 
• Operating units – Arcata and San Jose, which generate revenue from the sale of gold, silver, doré and concentrate. 
• Operating unit – Pallancata, which generates revenue from the sale of concentrate. 
• Operating unit – Inmaculada, which generates revenue from the sale of gold, silver and doré.  
• Exploration, which explores and evaluates areas of interest in brownfield and greenfield sites with the aim of extending the li fe-of-mine  
of existing operations and to assess the feasibility of new mines. The exploration segment includes costs charged to the profit and loss  
and capitalised as assets. 
• Other – includes the profit or loss generated by Empresa de Transmisión Callalli S.A.C. (a power transmission company, absorbed by Empresa de 
Transmisión Aymaraes S.A.C. on 1 June 2016), Empresa de Transmisió n Aymaraes S.A.C. (a power tran smission company), Ares unit, and the Selene 
plant (used to process some of the Group’s production). 
The Group’s administration, financing, other activities (including other income and expense), and income taxes are managed at a corporate  
level and are not allocated to operating segments.  
Segment information is consistent with the accounting policies adopted by the Group. Management evaluates the financial informa tion  
based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted for use in the European Union. 
The Group measures the performance of its operating units by the segment profit or loss that comprises gross profit, selling ex penses  
and exploration expenses. 
Segment assets include items that could be allocated directly to the segment.

2 Prospects expenditure relates to detailed geological evaluation s in order to determine zones which have mineralisation potent ial that is economically viable for exploration. 
Exploration expenses are generally incurred in the following areas: mapping, sampling, geophysics, identification of local targ ets and reconnaissance drilling.  
3 Generative expenditure is early stage exploration expenditure related to the basic evaluation of the region to identify prosp ects that have the geological conditions necessary to 
contain mineral deposits. Related activities include regional and field reconnaissance, satellite images, compilation of public information and identification of exploration targets.

1 Termination benefits in 2015 paid to workers following the cashfl ow optimisation programme approved by management, amounting to US$1,514,000, corresponding to the San José 
reporting segment. 
2  Corresponds to the reversal of the reserves tax liability reco rded in previous periods and their associated interests as a r esult of the settlement agreed between Minera Santa Cruz 
S.A.C. and the Fiscal Authority in Argentina. 
3 From 16 November 2016 until the end of the year, due to actions by the communities surrounding the Pallancata mine unit, the extracting and treatment operations were 
temporarily suspended. At 31 December 2016 the fixed indirect costs related to abnormal decrease in production from the work st oppage amounted to US$2,474,000, corresponding 
to the Pallancata reporting segment. 
4 Penalty for early termination of the energy supply contra ct between Compañia Minera Ares S.A.C. and SDF Energia. 
5 A section of the Ares tailings dam lateral walls showed unusual decay. A comprehensive study was conducted to determine long- term stability and the conclusion was that certain 
areas needed to be repaired. This failure was not anticipated and required works aimed at repairing and reinforcing the walls a nd ensure the long-term sustainability of the dam had 
to be conducted. The expenditure incurred was not part of our mine closure provision and reflects an unexpected, one-off event. 
6 Provision for impairment of the account receivable with a third party due to the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the l egal dispute and hence its recoverability.  
7 As at 31 December 2016 corresponds to the write-off of non-current assets of Compañia Minera Ares S.A.C. of US$1,634,000 aris ing from events falling outside the entity's ordinary 
activities. The charge was generated by the change of the exploitation method in the Pallancata mine unit, from mechanised to c onventional. As at  
31 December 2015 corresponds to the impairment of the Pallancata mine unit of US$39,026,000, the Arcata mine unit of US$72,424, 000, the Crespo project of US$14,350,000, the 
Azuca project of US$12,766,000, the Volcan project of US$57,070,000 and the San Felipe project of US$10,927,000, and to the wri te-off of non-current assets of US$583,000. 
8 Interest on overdue tax charges owed by the Group following a change in circumstances surrounding a tax dispute with the Peru vian tax authority, resulting in  
the exposure now being assessed as ‘probable’, rather than ‘possible’. 
9 Mainly corresponds to the current tax cred it arising from the costs of the work sto ppage at Pallancata mine unit, the penalty for early termination of agreement in Compañia Minera 
Ares S.A.C., the costs incurred due to the damage to the tailings dump in the Ares mine unit and the reversal of reserves tax i n Argentina (US$1,212,000) and the deferred tax credit 
arising from the write-off of non-current assets and the account receivable (US$1,012,000). For the period ended December 2015, primarily related to the deferred tax benefit arising 
from the impairment recorded.

1 In December 2016, the Peruvian government approved an increase of the statutory income tax rate, from its current level of 28 % to 29.5% with effect from the  
1 January 2017.  
The weighted average statutory income tax rate was 30.1% for 2016 and 25.4% for 2015. This is calculated as the average of the statutory tax rates 
applicable in the countries in which the Group operates, weighted by the profit/(loss) before tax of the Group companies in the ir respective countries 
as included in the consolidated financial statements. 
The change in the weighted average statutory income tax rate is due to a change in the weighting of profit/(loss) before tax in the various 
jurisdictions in which the Group operates.  
The tax related to items charged or credited to equity is as follows:

15 Basic and diluted earnings per share  
Earnings per share (‘EPS’) is calculated by dividing profit/(loss) for the year attributable to equity shareholders of the Comp any by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares issued during the year.  
The Company has dilutive potential ordinary shares.  
As a result of the rights issue being at a discounted price, the number of ordinary shares outstanding has increased due to the bonus element 
resulting in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for all periods presented having been adjusted retrospecti vely. 
As at 31 December 2016 and 2015, EPS has been calculated as follows:  
  As at 31 December

16 Property, plant and equipment continued 
At the end of 2015, given the continued challenging environment for the mining sector, the Group carried out an impairment revi ew of all of its 
operating mines (Arcata, Pallancata, Inmaculada and San Jose), and its growth projects (Crespo, Azuca, San Felipe and Volcan). As a result of this 
review the Group recognised an impairment charge in the Pallancata mine unit of US$39,026,000, the Arcata mine unit of US$72,42 4,000, the 
Crespo project of US$14,350,000, the Azuca project of US$12,766, 000, San Felipe project of US$10,927,000 and the Volcan project of US$57,070,000. 
The impairment recognised in property plant and equipment was US$118,653,000, in evaluation and exploration assets was US$74,55 0,000 and in 
intangibles was US$13,360,000 (refer to note 17 and 18).  
The recoverable values of these CGUs were determined using a fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD) methodology. FVLCD was d etermined using  
a combination of level 2 and level 3 inputs to construct a discounted cash flow model to estimate the amount that would be paid by a willing third 
party in an arm's length transaction. The key assumptions on wh ich management has based its determination of FVLCD, and the associated 
recoverable values calculated are presented below.

1 With respect to the Azuca, Volcan and San Felipe growth proj ects, given their early stage, the Group applied a value in-situ methodology, which applies a realisable ‘enterprise value’ to 
unprocessed mineral resources. The methodology is used to determine the fair value less costs of disposal of the Azuca, Volcan which includes the water permits held by the Group, 
and San Felipe CGUs. The enterprise value used in the calculation performed at 31 December 2015 was US$6.55 per gold equivalent ounce of resources (Volcan), US$0.25 per silver 
equivalent ounce of resources (Azuca) and US$16.21 per zinc equivalent tonne of resources (San Felipe).  
The enterprise value figures are based on observable external market information.

Crespo, Azuca and San Felipe projects correspond to the exploration segment. 
Sensitivity analysis 
Other than as disclosed below, management believes that no reas onably possible change in any of the key assumptions above would cause the 
carrying value of any of its cash generating units to exceed its recoverable amount.  
The estimated recoverable amounts of the following of the Group’s CGUs are equal to, or not materially greater than, their carr ying values; 
consequently, any adverse change in the following key assumptions would, in isolation, cause an impairment loss to be recognised:

2 Corresponds to the acquisition of water permits of Andina Minera ls Group (“Andina”). They have an indefinite life according t o Chilean law. In the case of the water permits the Group 
applied a value in situ methodology, which applies a realisable ‘enterprise value’ to unprocessed mineral resources. The method ology is used to determine the fair value less costs of 
disposal of the Volcan cash-generating unit, which includes the water permits held by the Group. The enterprise value used in t he calculation performed at 31 December 2016 was 
US$6.90 (2015: US$6.55) per gold equivalent ounce of resources. The enterprise value figures are based on observable external m arket information. 
3 Legal rights correspond to expenditures re quired to give the Group the right to us e a property for the surface exploration wo rk, development and production. 
At 31 December 2016 the remaining amortisation period is from 8 to 20 years. 
4 The amortisation for the period is included in cost of sales and administrative expenses in the income statement. 
5  Corresponds to the impairment of the Crespo and Volcan projects (refer to note 16). 
The carrying amount of the Volcan CGU, which includes the water permits, is reviewed annually to determine whether it is in exc ess of its 
recoverable amount.

Sensitivity analysis 
Other than as disclosed below, management believes that no reas onably possible change in any of the key assumptions above would cause the 
carrying value to exceed its recoverable amount.  
The estimated recoverable amount is not materially greater than its carrying value; consequently, a change in the value in situ assumption could 
cause an impairment loss or reversal of impairment to be recognised in 2016:

Finished goods include ounces of gold and silver, doré and concentrate.  
Products in process include stockpile and precipitates.  
The Group either sells doré bars as a finished product or if it is commercially advantageous to do so, delivers the bars for re fining into gold and silver 
ounces which are then sold. In the latter scenario, the doré bars are classified as products in process. The amount of doré on hand at 31 December 
2016 included in products in process is US$nil (2015: US$3,827,000).  
Concentrate is sold to smelters, but in addition could be used as a product in process to produce doré.  
As part of the Group’s short-term financing policies, it acquires pre-shipment loans which are guaranteed by the sales contract s.  
The amount of expense recognised in profit and loss related to the consumption of inventory of supplies, spare parts and raw ma terials is 
US$86,754,000 (2015: US$78,525,000). 
Movements in the provision for obsolescence comprise an incr ease in the provision of US$2,162,000 (2015: US$1,046,000) and the reversal of US$nil 
relating to the sale of supplies and spare parts, that had been provided for (2015: US$nil).

23 Deferred income 
On 3 August 2011, Hochschild entered into an agreement with Impulsora Minera Santa Cruz (“IMSC”) whereby IMSC acquired the righ t to explore 
the San Felipe properties and an option to purchase the related concessions. Under the terms of this agreement the Group has re ceived the following 
non-refundable payments to date:

US$000
San Felipe contract  25,000  25,000
These payments reduce the total consideration IMSC will be requir ed to pay upon exercise of the option by 1 December 2017, and constitute an 
advance of the final purchase price, rather than an option premium and, as such, they were recorded as deferred income. On 30 N ovember 2016, 
IMSC renegotiated terms of the agreement, extending the validity of the agreement to 1 December 2017.

1 The provision represents the discounted values of the estimated cost to decommission and rehabilitate the mines at the expect ed date of closure of each of the mines. The present 
value of the provision has been calculated using a real pre-tax a nnual discount rate, based on a US Treasury bond of an appropr iate tenure adjusted for the impact of quantitative 
easing as at 31 December 2016 and 2015 respectively, and the cash flows have been adjusted to reflect the risk attached to thes e cash flows. Uncertainties on the timing for use of this 
provision include changes in the future that could impact the time of closing the mines, as new resources and reserves are disc overed. The discount rate used was 0.25% (2015: 0.07%). 
Expected cash flows will be over a period from two to nine years. 
2 Corresponds to the provision related to aw ards granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) to designated personnel of the Group. Includes the following benefits: (i) 2016 
awards, granted in March 2016, payable in March 2019 (ii) 2015 awar ds, granted in March 2015, payable in March 2018. Only emplo yees who remain in the Group’s employment on 
the vesting date will be entitled to a cash payment, subject to exceptions approved by the Remuneration Committee of the Board. The percentage of the award granted is determined 
70% by the Company’s TSR ranking relative to a tailored peer group of mining companies, and 30% by the Company’s TSR ranking re lative to a peer group of FTSE 350 companies. The 
liability for the LTIP is measured, initially and at the end of each reporting period until settled, at the fair value of the a wards, by applying the Monte Carlo pricing model, taking into 
account the terms and conditions on which the awards were grante d, and the extent to which the employees have rendered services to date. Changes to the provision of 
US$9,965,000 (2015: US$369,000) have been recorded as administrative expenses US$9,298,000 (2015: US$372,000) and exploration e xpenses US$667,000 (2014: US$-3,000 credit). 
The following tables list the inputs to the Monte Carlo model used for the LTIPs for the years ended 31 December 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively:

3 Based on the 2016 internal and external review of mine rehabilitation estimates, the provision for mine closure decreased by US$11,975,000. The net decrease mainly corresponds to 
the Arcata mine unit of US$6,648,000, the Ares mine unit of US$1,622,000, the Selene mine unit of US$698,000, the Pallancata mi ne unit of US$447,000, and the San José mine unit of 
US$4,166,000, net of the increase in Inmaculada mine unit of US$1,651,000. US$2,320,000 related to mines already closed and US$ 4,026,000 related to the Arcata mine unit which 
reduction of the estimated costs exceeded the carrying value of the mine asset. Therefore, both effects have been recognised as a credit directly in the income statement. In 2015, the 
internal review of mine rehabilitation budgets determined a reco gnition of an increase of US$15,517,000. The net increase mainl y corresponds to the Arcata mine unit of 
US$1,746,000, the Inmaculada mine unit of US$1,133,000, the Selene mine unit of US$922,000, the Crespo project of US$116,000, t he San José mine unit of US$5,071,000, and the 
Sipan mine unit of US$6,750,000 net of the decrease in Pallancata mine unit of US$171,000 of which US$7,590,000 related to mine s already closed has been recognised directly in the 
income statement.   112 Hochschild Mining plc Annual Report 2016

Consequently, the increase in carrying values, net of the related deferred tax liability, is taken directly to this account whe re it will remain until 
disposal or impairment of the investment, when the cumulative unrealised gains and losses are recycled through the income state ment.  
Unrealised gain/loss on cash flow hedges 
Correspond to the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instruments (refer to note 2(y)).

Merger reserve  
The merger reserve represents the difference between the value of the net assets of the Cayman Holding Companies (Ardsley, Garr ison, Larchmont 
and Hochschild Mining (Peru)) acquired under the Share Exchange Agreement and the nominal value of the shares issued in conside ration of such 
acquisition.  
Share-based payment reserve 
Share-based payment reserve is used to recognise the value of equity-settled share-based payment transactions provided to emplo yees, as a part  
of their remuneration.  
(i) Restricted Share Plan (‘RSP’) 
At the beginning of 2015, the Group introduced the RSP, which is a new one-off share-based long-term incentive plan for some ex ecutives and key 
employees who play a fundamental role in the performance of the business.  
On 30 December 2014 and 16 February 2015, 1,319,392 and 6,026,089 sh are options with a fair value of 86.8p (US$1.35) and 92.3p (US$1.42) per 
share were granted to the CEO and certain key employees, respectively under the RSP of the Group. Following the rights issue in October 2015, the 
number of share options were adjusted to 1,491,572 and 6,812,485 wi th a fair value of 76.7p (US$1.19) and 81.6p (US$1.25) per s hare respectively. 
The vesting of the options is subject to the satisfaction of certain performance as well as service conditions classified as no n-market conditions.  
The options vest over a five-year period in tranches of 20% of the shares after each of 2, 3 and 4 years and the balance after 5 years. 
If the service conditions are not met, the options lapse. As th e performance conditions are non-market-based they are not refle cted in the fair value 
of the award at grant date, and therefore the Company will assess the likelihood of these conditions being met with a relevant adjustment to the 
cumulative charge as required at each financial year end. 
The fair value of the option was determined with respect to the market price of the shares on the grant date. The awards do not entitle the recipients 
to dividends or payment in lieu of dividends during the vesting period.  
The carrying amount of the share based payment reserve relating to the RSP at 31 December 2016 is US$3,958,000 (2015: US$2,843, 000) with the 
amount recognised in the consolidated income statement of US$3,181,000 (2015: US$2,843,000). 
On 30 December 2016 the Group issued 1,660,805 ordinary shares under the Restricted Share Plan, to certain employees of the Gro up, including  
the CEO. 
(ii) Deferred Bonus Plan (‘DBP’) 
At the beginning of 2014, the Group introduced the DBP, as a mechanism to pay the annual bonuses to the employees. Before the a pproval of DBP 
the annual bonuses were paid entirely in cash. Under the DBP rules a part of the annual bonuses could be deferred into shares f or one or two years.  
A Deferred Bonus award granted under the Plan, and the terms of that Deferred Bonus award, must be approved in advance by the D irectors. 
The fair value of the awards was determined with respect to the market price of the shares on the grant date. The awards do not entitle the 
recipients to dividends or payment in lieu of dividends during the vesting period. The carrying amount of the share based payme nt reserve relating  
to the DBP at 31 December 2016 is US$57,000 (2015: US$138,000) with the amount recognised in the consolidated income statement of US$76,000 
(2015: US$469,000).  
On 20 March 2016, 66,727 Treasury shares were transferred to the CEO of the Group with respect to the DBP. On 20 March 2015 the Group issued 
587,015 ordinary shares under the DBP, to certain employees of the Group, including the CEO. 
(iii) Enhanced Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘ELTIP’) 
In April 2011 and March 2014, the CEO was granted awards under the ELTIP. Awards were made over conditional shares with a value , on the date of 
grant, equivalent to six times salary and which vest in tranches over an extended performance period of four, five and six year s. Further details on the 
design of the ELTIP award and numbers of awards granted are included in the Directors Remuneration Report. 
The fair value of the option was determined using the Monte Carlo model. The carrying amount of the share based payment reserve relating to the 
ELTIP at 31 December 2016 is US$1,854,000 (2015: US$1,674,000). The am ount recognised in the consolidated income statement amounts to 
US$180,000 (2015: US$327,000) which is net of a reversal of US$$383,000 (2015: US$316,000) relating to options that lapsed duri ng the year.

33 Commitments 
(a) Mining rights purchase options  
During the ordinary course of business, the Group enters into agreements to carry out exploration under concessions held by thi rd parties. Generally, 
under the terms of these agreements, the Group has the option to acquire the concession or invest in the entity holding the con cession. In order to 
exercise these options the Group must satisfy certain financial and other obligations during the term of the agreement. The opt ions lapse in the 
event that the Group does not meet its financial obligations. At any point in time, the Group may cancel the agreements without penalty, except 
where specified below.  
The Group continually reviews its requirements under the agreements and determines, on an annual basis, whether to proceed with its financial 
commitment. Based on management’s current intention regarding these projects, the commitments at the statement of financial pos ition date are 
as follows:  
  As at 31 December

(b) Operating lease commitments  
The Group has a number of operating lease agreements, as a lessee. 
The lease expenditure charged to the income statement during the years 2016 and 2015 is included in production costs (2016: US$ 12,265,000, 
2015: US$9,692,000), administrative expenses (2016: US$1,455,000, 2015: US$1,415,000), exploration expenses (2016: US$321,000,

34 Contingencies  
As at 31 December 2016 the Group is subject to various claims which arise in the ordinary course of business. No provision has been made in the 
financial statements and none of these claims are currently expected to result in any material loss to the Group.  
(a) Taxation  
Fiscal periods remain open to review by the tax authorities for four years in Peru and five years in Argentina and Mexico, preceding the year  
of review. During this time the authorities have the right to raise additional tax assessments including penalties and interest . Under certain 
circumstances, reviews may cover longer periods.  
Because a number of fiscal periods remain open to review by the tax authorities, coupled with the complexity of the Group and t he transactions 
undertaken by it, there remains a risk that significant additional tax liabilities may arise. As at 31 December 2016, the Group had exposures totalling 
US$43,931,000 (2015: US$34,969,000) which are assessed as ‘possible’, ra ther than ‘probable’. No amounts have been provided in respect of these 
items. This predominantly relates to potential tax penalties and related interest on intercompany loans.  
Notwithstanding this risk, the Directors believe that management’s interpretation of the relevant legislation and assessment of taxation is 
appropriate and that it is probable that the Group’s tax and customs positions will be sustained in the event of a challenge by the tax authorities. 
Consequently, the Directors consider that they have made adequate provision for any future outflow of resources and no addition al provision is 
required in respect of these claims or risks.  
(b) Guarantees 
The Group is required to provide guarantees in Peru in respect of environmental restoration and decommissioning obligations. Th e Group has 
provided for the estimated cost of these activities (see note 26).  www.hochschildmining.com 119

In accordance with Peruvian legislation, owners of mining concessions must pay a mining royalty for the exploitation of metalli c and non-metallic 
resources. Mining royalties have been calculated with rates ranging from 1% to 3% of the value of mineral concentrate or equiva lent sold, based on 
quoted market prices.  
In October 2011 changes came into effect for mining companies, with the following features: 
(a) Introduction of a Special Mining Tax (‘SMT’), levied on mining companies at the stage of exploiting mineral resources. The additional tax is 
calculated by applying a progressive scale of rates ranging from 2% to 8.4% of the quarterly operating profit.  
(b) Modification of the mining royalty calculation, which consists of applying a progressive scale of rates ranging from 1% to 12%, of the quarterly 
operating profit. The former royalty was calculated on the basis of monthly sales value of mineral concentrates.  
The SMT and modified mining royalty are accounted for as an income tax in accordance with IAS 12 “Income Taxes”. 
(c) For companies that have mining projects benefiting from tax stability regimes, mining royalties are calculated and recorded as they were 
previously, applying an additional new special charge on mining that is calculated using progressive scale rates, ranging from 4% to 13.12%  
of quarterly operating profit.  
(d) In the case of the Arcata mine unit, the company left the tax stability agreement, but has maintained the agreement for the mining royalties,  
such that the Arcata unit, is liable for the new SMT but the mining royalties remain payable at the same rate as they were, bef ore the 
modification in 2011. 
As at 31 December 2016, the amount payable as under the former mining royalty (for the Arcata mining unit), the new mining roya lty (for the  
Ares, Pallancata and Inmaculada mining units), and the SMT amounted to US$170,000 (2015: US$272,000), US$769,000 (2015: US$1,08 0,000),  
and US$737,000 (2015: US$745,000) respectively. The former mining royalty is recorded as ‘Trade and other payables’, and the ne w mining  
royalty and SMT as ‘Income tax payable’ in the Statement of Financial Position. The amount recorded in the income statement was US$1,759,000 
(2015: US$1,205,000) representing the former mining royalty, cl assified as cost of sales, US$3,882,000 (2015: US$1,778,000) of new mining royalty 
and US$3,869,000 (2015: US$755,000) of SMT, both classified as income tax. 
Argentina  
In accordance with Argentinian legislation, Provinces (being the legal owners of the mineral resources) are entitled to collect royalties from mine 
operators. For San Jose, the mining royalty was originally fixed at 1.85% of the pit-head value of the production where the fin al product is doré and 
2.55% where the final product is mineral concentrate or precipitates. In October 2012 a new provincial law was passed, which in creased the mining 
royalty applicable to doré and concentrate to 3% of the pit-head value. Since November 2012 Minera Santa Cruz S.A. has been pay ing and expensing 
the increased 3% royalty. As at 31 December 2016, the amount payable as mining royalties amounted to US$509,000 (2015: US$524,0 00). The 
amount recorded in the income statement as cost of sales was US$5,747,000 (2015: US$4,763,000). 
On 13 June 2013, the congress of the Province of Santa Cruz passed Law No. 3318, which created a tax on mining reserves. Accord ingly, the owners  
of mining concessions located in the Province of Santa Cruz were required to pay a tax on mining reserves at a rate of 1%, calc ulated at the end of 
each year and determined according to the international price of metals at that date. According to these applicable regulations , the tax applied only 
on “proved reserves” and certain deductions (related to the production cost) applied to Minera Santa Cruz S.A. (a subsidiary of Hochschild Mining plc). 
On 20 December 2013, Minera Santa Cruz S.A. filed before the Ar gentinian Supreme Court a legal claim against the tax on mining reserves. Such 
legal claim challenged the legality of the tax on mining reserves arguing its unconstitutionality on the grounds that it violat ed the Federal Mining 
Policy created by national law No. 24.196. Ad ditionally, on 2 November 2015, Minera Santa Cruz S.A. filed a precautionary measu re under which it 
requested the Argentinian Supreme Court to order the Province of Santa Cruz not to claim from Minera Santa Cruz S.A. the paymen t of any amount 
related to the tax on mining reserves until a final decision on the constitutionality of the tax is rendered. The precautionary measure was granted on 
9 December 2015, with no tax was paid during 2015. The tax on mining reserves was eliminated on 30 December 2015. On 1 March 20 16 Minera 
Santa Cruz S.A. and the Province of Santa Cruz entered into an agreement under which each party agreed not to make to the other party any claim 
related to the tax on mining reserves. Consequently, the amount pa yable as at 31 December 2015 as tax on mining reserves of US$ 4,054,000, which 
was presented as ‘Trade and other payables’, have been written back and credited to the income statement within other income (U S$2,667,000) and 
financial income (US$974,000) (see footnote 2 of note 11). The expense recognised as other expenses in  
the year ended 31 December 2015 with respect to this tax amounted to US$441,000 (note 12).

36 Financial risk management 
The Group is exposed to a variety of risks and uncertainties which may have a financial impact on the Group and which also impa ct the achievement 
of social, economic and environmental objectives. These risks include strategic, commercial, operational and financial risks an d are further 
categorised into risk areas to facilitate consolidated risk reporting across the Group.  
The Group has made significant developments in the management of the Group’s risk environment which seeks to identify and, wher e appropriate, 
implement the controls to mitigate the impact of the Group’s significant risks. This effort is supported by a Risk Committee wi th the participation of 
the CEO, the Vice Presidents, and the head of the internal audit function. The Risk Committee is responsible for implementing t he Group’s policy on 
risk management and internal control in support of the Company’ s business objectives, and monitori ng the effectiveness of risk management within 
the organisation. 
(a) Commodity price risk  
Silver and gold prices have a material impact on the Group’s results of operations. Prices are significantly affected by change s in global economic 
conditions and related industry cycles. Generally, producers of silver and gold are unable to influence prices directly; theref ore, the Group’s 
profitability is ensured through the control of its cost base and the efficiency of its operations.  
The Group´s policy is generally to remain hedge free. However, management continuously monitors silver and gold prices and rese rves the right  
to take the necessary action, where appropriate and within Board approved parameters, to mitigate the impact of this risk. 
For the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015 the (loss)/gain recognised in the income statement for the commodity swaps contracts signed 
during the year is as follows:

At 31 December 2016 the Group is not exposed to commodity price risk on commodity forward contracts. At 31 December 2015, a 10% favourable  
or adverse change in the price of gold and silver would have an impact on amounts recognised in the comprehensive income of app roximately +/- 
US$10,561,000 and +/-US$8,265,000 respectively. 
The Group has embedded derivatives arising from the sale of concentrate and doré which were provisionally priced at the time th e sale was recorded 
(refer to notes 5 and 36(e)). For these derivatives, the sensitivity of the fair value to an immediate 10% favourable or advers e change in the price of 
gold and silver (assuming all other variables remain constant), is as follows:

(b) Foreign currency risk  
The Group produces silver and gold which are typically priced in US dollars. A proportion of the Group’s costs are incurred in pounds sterling, Peruvian 
nuevos soles, Canadian dollars, Argentinian pesos and Mexican pesos. Accordingly, the Group’s financial results may be affected by exchange rate 
fluctuations between the US dollar and the local currency. The long-term relationship between commodity prices and currencies i n the countries  
in which the Group operates provides a certain degree of natural protection. The Group does not use derivative instruments to m anage its foreign 
currency risks. 
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial assets and liabilities, at the reporting date, denominated in the ir respective currencies,  
to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar exchange rate, with all other variables held constant, of the Group’s profit b efore tax and the  
Group’s equity.

(c) Credit risk  
Credit risk arises from debtors’ inability to make payment of their obligations to the Group as they become due (without taking into account  
the fair value of any guarantee or pledged assets). The Group is primarily exposed to credit risk as a result of commercial act ivities and 
non-compliance, by counterparties, in transactions in cash which are primarily limited to cash balances deposited in banks and accounts receivable 
at the statement of financial position date.

36 Financial risk management continued 
To manage the credit risk associated with commercial activities, the Group took the following steps: 
• Active use of prepayment/advance clauses in sales contracts; 
• Delaying delivery of title and/or requiring advance payments to reduce exposure timeframe (potential delay in sales recognition ); 
• Obtaining parent guarantees or contracting directly with the parent company to shore up the credit profile of the customer (whe re possible); and 
• Maintaining as diversified a portfolio of clients as possible. 
To manage credit risk associated wi th cash balances deposited in banks, the Group took the following steps: 
• Increasing banking relationships with large, established and well- capitalised institutions in order to secure access to credit and to diversify credit risk. 
• Limiting exposure to financial counterparties according to Board approved limits; and 
• Investing cash in short-term, highly liquid and low risk instruments (money market accounts, term deposits, US Treasuries). 
Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant . The maximum 
exposure is the carrying amount as disclosed in notes 20, 22 and 36(e).  
(d) Equity risk on financial instruments  
The Group acquires financial instruments in connection with strategic alliances with third parties. The Group constantly monito rs the fair  
value of these instruments in order to decide whether or not it is convenient to dispose of these investments. The disposal dec ision is also  
based on management’s intention to continue with the strategic alliance, the tax implications and changes in the share price of the investee.  
The amount held of investments at year end (note 19) is not significant and the sensitivity to reasonable movements in the shar e price of available-
for-sale financial assets is immaterial. 
(e) Fair value hierarchy  
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation tech nique: 
Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, eithe r directly or indirectly.  
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observabl e market data. 
As at 31 December 2016 and 2015, the Group held the following financial instruments measured at fair value:

1 Sales of concentrate and certain gold and silver volumes are provisionally priced at the time the sale is recorded. The price is then adjusted after an agreed period of  
time (usually linked to the length of time it takes for the smelter to refine and sell the concentrate or for the refiner to pr ocess the doré into gold and silver), with the Group either 
paying or receiving the difference between the provisional price and the final price. This price exposure is considered to be a n embedded derivative in accordance with IAS 39 ‘Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’. The gain or loss that arises on the fair value of the embedded derivative is recorde d  
in ‘Revenue’ (note 5).

Gain from the period recognised in revenue  (585)
Balance at 31 December 2016 (1,726)
(f) Liquidity risk  
Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s inability to obtain the funds it requires to comply with its commitments, including the inability to sell a financial 
asset quickly enough and at a price close to its fair value. Management constantly monitors the Group’s level of short- and med ium-term liquidity, 
and their access to credit lines, in order to ensure appropriate financing is available for its operations. 
The table below categorises the undiscounted cash flows of Group’ s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period 
as at the statement of financial position to the contractual maturity date. Interest cash flows have been calculated using the spot rate at year end.

(g) Interest rate risk  
The Group has financial assets and liabilities which are exposed to interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates primarily impact loans and borrowings 
by changing either their fair value (fixed rate debt) or their future cash flows (variable rate debt). The Group does not have a formal policy of 
determining how much of its exposure should be at fixed or at variable rates. However, at the time of taking new loans or borro wings, management 
applies its judgement to decide whether it believes that a fixed or variable rate borrowing would be more favourable to the Gro up over the expected 
period until maturity.

Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is re-priced at intervals of less than one year. Interest on fina ncial instruments classified  
as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument. The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above tables are 
non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.  
The sensitivity to a reasonable movement in the interest rate, with all other variables held constant, of the financial instrum ents with a floating rate, 
determined as a +/-50bps change in interest rates has a +/-6, 000 effect on profit before tax (2015: +/-477,000). The Group is e xposed to fluctuations 
in market interest rates.  
This assumes that the amount remains unchanged from that in place at 31 December 2016 and 2015 and that the change in interest rates is 
effective from the beginning of the year. In reality, the floating rate will fluctuate over the year and interest rates will ch ange accordingly.  
(h) Capital risk management  
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to pr ovide returns for 
shareholders, benefits for other stakeholders, and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. Mana gement considers  
as part of its capital, the financial sources of funding from shareholders and third parties (notes 25 and 27). 
In 2015 the Group collected capital of US$95,216,000 following a ri ghts issue and US$175,948,000 due to proceeds of borrowings while 
$209,173,000 of debt was repaid. 
In 2016 the Group collected US$70,000,000 due to proceeds of borrowings while US$177,431,000 of debt was repaid. 
Management also retains the right to fund operations (fully owned and with joint venture partners) with a mix of equity and joint venture  
partners’ debt. 
37 Subsequent events 
(a) On 7 February 2017, US$25,000,000 of short-term debt was repaid. 
(b) The Group received a letter of intent dated 26 January 2017 outlining a proposed transaction between Americas Silver Corporation and 
Santacruz Mining Ltd (IMSC). Following this letter, the Group si gned the following agreements which supersede all previous cont racts: 
On 20 February 2017, the Group and IMSC signed a new agreement pursuant to which IMSC will acquire properties comprising the El Gachi 
project (part of San Felipe) for a total consideration of US$500,000 which is due on 31 March 2017. 
On 28 February 2017, the Group signed a new option agreement with IMSC for the remaining San Felipe properties amounting to 
US$10,000,000. An initial payment of US$2,000,000 was due to the Group on 7 March 2017. The IMSC option expires on 1 December 2 017. 
On 2 March 2017 it was announced that IMSC had entered into an agreement with Americas Silver Corporation to assign 100% of its interest in 
the San Felipe Project.

Notes to the pare nt company financi al statements 
For the year ended 31 December 2016 
1 Corporate information  
Hochschild Mining plc (hereinafter ‘the Company’) is a public limited company incorporated on 11 April 2006 under the Companies Act 1985 as  
a Limited Company and registered in England and Wales with registered number 05777693. 
The Company’s registered office is located at 17 Cavendish Square, London W1G 0PH, United Kingdom. The Company was incorporated to serve  
as a holding company to be listed on the London Stock Exchange. The Company acquired its interest in a group of companies to co nstitute the 
Hochschild Mining Group (‘the Group’) pursuant to a share exchange agreement (‘Share Exchange Agreement’) dated 2 November 2006 .  
The ultimate controlling party of the Company is Mr Eduardo Hochschild whose beneficial interest in the Company and its subsidi aries  
(together ‘the Group’ or ‘Hochschild Mining Group’) is held th rough Pelham Investment Corporation, a Cayman Islands company. 
On 8 November 2006, the Company’s shares were admitted to the Of ficial List of the UKLA (United Kingdom Listing Authority) and to trading  
on the London Stock Exchange.  
2 Significant accounting policies  
(a) Basis of preparation  
The Company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the 
European Union and are also consistent with IFRS issued by th e IASB, as applied in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.  
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared on a historical cost basis. The financial statements are presented i n US dollars (US$) 
and all monetary amounts are rounded to the nearest thousand ($000) except when otherwise indicated.  
The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on Hochschild Mining Holdings Limited providing addition al funding to  
the extent that the operating inflows of the Company are insufficient to meet future cash requirements. As Hochschild Mining Ho ldings Limited  
has committed to provide this support, is itself a going concern and can provide financial support if necessary, the Directors have prepared the 
financial statements for the Company on the going concern basis. 
(b) Exemptions  
The Company’s financial statements are included in the Hochschild Mining Group consolidated financial statements for the years ended  
31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015. As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its  
own profit and loss account.  
(c) Judgements in applying ac counting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty  
Certain amounts included in the financial statements such as the impairment in subsidiaries involve the use of judgement and/or estimation. These 
judgements and estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, having regard to pri or experience, 
but actual results may differ from the amounts included in the financial statements. Information about such judgements and esti mation is 
contained in the accounting policies and/or the notes to the financial statements.  
(d) Changes in accounting policy and disclosures  
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financia l statements are consistent with those applied in the prepara tion of the 
consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015. Amendments to standards and interpretations which came i nto force 
during the year did not have a significant impact on the financial statements. The accounting policies adopted are consistent w ith those of the 
previous financial year. 
(e) Currency translation  
The functional currency of the Company is the US dollar and is determined by the currency of the primary economic environment i n which it operates.  
Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company are initially recorded in the function al currency using the 
exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are reme asured at the rate of 
exchange ruling at the statement of financial position date. Exchange gains and losses on settlement of foreign currency transa ctions which are 
translated at the rate prevailing at the date of the transactions, or on the translation of monetary assets and liabilities whi ch are translated at period-
end exchange rates, are taken to the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies th at are stated at 
historical cost are translated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transactio n.

(f) Investments in subsidiaries  
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Company controls operating and financial policies, generally by owning more than 50% o f voting  
rights. Investments in subsidiaries are recognised at acquisition cost less any provision for impairment. The Company assesses investments  
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recover able. If any such 
indication of impairment exists, the Company makes an estimate of its recoverable amount. Where the carrying amount of an inves tment exceeds 
its recoverable amount, the investment is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. If, in subsequent periods, the amount 
of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was rec ognised, the 
previously recognised impairment loss is reversed. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the profit an d loss account, to the 
extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date. 
(g) Dividends receivable  
Dividends are recognised when the Company’s right to receive paym ents is established. Dividends received are recorded in the in come statement.  
(h) Other receivables  
Current receivables are carried at the original amount less provision made for impairment of these receivables. A provision for impairment of 
receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due accord ing to the original 
terms of the receivable. The amount of the provision is the difference between the original carrying amount and the recoverable amount and this 
difference is recognised in the income statement.  
(i) Cash and cash equivalents  
Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the statement of financial position at cost. For the purposes of the statement of fina ncial position,  
cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and deposits held with banks that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash within three 
months or less and which are subject to insignificant risk of chan ges in value. For the purposes of the cash flow statement, ca sh and cash equivalents 
as defined above are shown net of outstanding bank overdrafts.  
(j) Share capital  
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Any excess above the par value of shares received upon issuance of those shares is cl assified as share premium. 
In the case the excess above par value is available for distribution, it is classified as merger reserve and then transferred t o retained earnings. 
(k) Provisions  
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow 
of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect of the time 
value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that refl ects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the 
provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.

(l) Share-based payments  
Cash-settled transactions 
The fair value of cash-settled share plans is recognised as a liability over the vesting period of the awards. Movements in tha t liability between 
reporting dates are recognised as an expense. The fair value of the awards is taken to be the market value of the shares at the date of award adjusted 
by a factor for anticipated relative Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) performance. Fair values are subsequently remeasured at e ach reporting date to 
reflect the number of awards expected to vest based on the current and anticipated TSR performance.  
Uncertainties in estimating the award include potential changes in the TSR, the number of participants in the plan, and levels of interest rates.  
Where the Company is remunerating employees of its subsidiaries through a share-based payment, the costs of the transactions ar e recorded  
as capital contribution to the subsidiaries. 
Equity-settled transactions 
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in other reserves in equity, over the period in which  
the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled. The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at e ach reporting  
date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity 
instruments that vest.  
The income statement expense for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of  
that period and is recognised in personnel expenses. During 2011 and 2014, the Company approved an equity-settled scheme for it s CEO. 
At the beginning of 2015, the Company granted a new benefit for some key employees of the Group, the Restricted Share Plan. 
(m) Finance income and costs  
Finance income and costs mainly comprise interest income on funds invested, interest expense on borrowings, foreign exchange ga ins and losses, 
gains and losses from the change in fair value of derivative in struments and gains and losses on the disposal of available-for- sale investments.  
Interest income and costs are recognised as they accrue, takin g into account the effective yield on the asset and liability, re spectively.  
(n) Income tax  
Income tax for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the exte nt that it  
relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.  
Current tax expense is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted at the statement of financial position 
date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.  
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amo unts of assets  
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes with the following exemptions:  
• where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction tha t is not a business 
combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;  
• in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where t he timing  
of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not rever se in the 
foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is re alised or the liability  
is settled based on the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date.  
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset  
can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.

(o) Financial instruments  
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes party to the contracts that give rise to them and are classified as loans  
or borrowings, receivables, payables, financial instruments at fair value through profit and loss or as available-for sale fina ncial assets, as appropriate. 
The Company determines the classification of its financial assets and liabilities at initial recognition and, where allowed and appropriate,  
re-evaluates this designation at each financial year end. When financial assets and liabilities are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, 
being the transaction price plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss and borrowings, dire ctly attributable transaction 
costs. The Company considers whether a contract contains an embedded derivative when the entity first becomes a party to it. Th e embedded 
derivatives are separated from the host contract if it is not measured at fair value through profit or loss and when the econom ic characteristics and 
risks are not closely related to those of the host contract. Reassessment only occurs if there is a change in the terms of the contract that significantly 
modifies the cash flows that would otherwise be required.  
All regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date, being the date that the Company commi ts to purchase or 
sell the asset. Regular way transactions require delivery and receipt of assets within the timeframe generally established by r egulation or convention 
in the marketplace.  
Financial guarantees 
Financial guarantees are guarantees provided by the Company on behalf of one of the Group’s subsidiaries. At inception the fair value of a financial 
guarantee is determined and recognised as a liability in the Company’s accounts, while the debit is recognised as a capital contribution to its 
subsidiary. The liability is subsequently amortised on a straight -line basis over the life of the guarantee, unless it is consi dered probable that the 
guarantee will be called, in which case it is measured at the value of the guaranteed amount payable, if higher. 
The liability is presented within creditors as ‘Financial liability – financial guarantee’.  
Loans and borrowings  
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value. After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequ ently measured  
at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.  
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the amortisati on process.  
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liabili ty for at least twelve 
months after the statement of financial position date. 
A detailed description of the Company’s policies in respect of financial instruments is included in the Group’s financial state ments (note 2(t)).  
(p) Dividends distribution  
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Company’s financial statements in the p eriod in which  
the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. 
3 Profit and loss account 
The Company made a profit attributable to equity sh areholders of US$1,199,842,000 (2015: loss of US$269,954,000). 
4 Property, plant and equipment 
The ending balance at 31 December 2016 is US$nil (31 December 2015: US$nil), related to cost of equipment of US$265,000 net to accumulated 
depreciation of US$265,000. 
There were no additions during 2015 and 2016.

The Company tested its investment in subsidiary for impairment in light of increases in the prices of gold and silver, as well as increases in the 
Company’s publically listed share price. As a result of this test, the Company recognised an impairment reversal of the investm ent in Hochschild 
Mining Holdings Ltd. of US$1,202,60 4,000 (2015: Impairment of US$268,895,000). 
The recoverable value of the investment in Hochschild Mining Holdings Limited was determined using a fair value less costs of d isposal. The fair 
value less costs of disposal was determined with reference to the market capitalisation of the Group at 31 December 2016 and 20 15 translated from 
Pounds Sterling into U.S. Dollars using the year-end exchange rate (both Level 1 inputs), to which a control premium was added based on recent 
market transactions (a Level 2 input), and subsequently adjusted for the net debt held directly by the Company. A Level 1 input refers to quoted prices 
in active markets, while a Level 2 input corresponds to other information that can be observed directly or indirectly. Any vari ation in the key 
assumptions would either result in further impairment or a reduction of the impairment.

subsequently amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of the guarantee.  
Trade payables mainly relate to the purchase of third-party services. These payables do not accrue interest and no guarantees h ave been granted in 
relation to these payables. The fair value of trade and other payables approximate their book values.

13 Financial risk management  
The Company is exposed to a variety of risks and uncertainties which may have an impact on the achievement of financial and eco nomic objectives. 
These risks include strategic, operational and financial risk and are further categorised into risk areas to facilitate risk as sessment. The Company is 
not exposed to significant sources of commodity price, equity or interest rate risk.  
(a) Foreign currency risk  
Due to the operations of the Company, it has cash and cash equivalents and trade payables denominated in pounds sterling and Ca nadian dollars. 
Accordingly, the financial results of the Company may be affected by exchange rate fluctuations. The Company does not use deriv ative instruments 
to manage its foreign currency risks. The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial assets and liabilities, at the reporting date 
denominated in their respective currencies, to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar exchange rate, with all other vari ables held constant,  
of the Company’s profit before tax and the Company’s equity.

(b) Credit risk  
The Company is primarily exposed to credit risk in transactions in cash which are primarily limited to cash balances deposited in banks and accounts 
receivable at the statement of financial position date. The Company has evaluated and introduced efforts to try to mitigate cre dit risk exposure.  
To manage credit risk associated with cash balances deposited in banks, the Company is:  
• increasing banking relationships with large, established and well- capitalised institutions in order to secure access to credit and to diversify credit risk; 
• investing cash in short-term, highly liquid and low risk instruments (term deposits); 
• maintaining excess cash abroad in hard currency. 
Credit risk concentrations exist when changes in economic, industrial or geographic factors take place, affecting in the same m anner the  
Company’s counterparties whose added risk expo sure is significant to the Company’s total credit exposure. Receivable balances a re monitored  
on an ongoing basis with the result that the Company’s exposure to bad debts is not significant. The maximum exposure is the ca rrying amount  
as disclosed in note 6.

www.hochschildmining.com 137 
(c) Liquidity risk  
Liquidity risk arises from the Company’s inability to obtain the funds it requires to comply with its commitments, including th e inability to  
sell a financial asset quickly enough and at a price close to its fair value. Management constantly monitors the Company’s leve l of short- and  
medium-term liquidity and their access to credit lines on reasonable terms in order to ensure appropriate financing is availabl e for its operations. 
The Company is funded by Hochschild Mining Holdings Ltd through loans in order to meet its obligations. Liquidity is supported by the balance of 
cash and cash equivalent held by the Company and Hochschild Mining Holdings Ltd at 31 December 2016 of US$10,402,000 (2015: US$ 21,885,000) 
and US$17,218,000 (2015: US$335,000) respectively. The Company also serves as principal funding conduit for the Group’s capital raising activities 
such as equity issuances.

(d) Capital risk management  
The Company’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern in order t o provide returns 
for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital . Management 
considers as part of its capital the financial sources of funding from shareholders and third-parties (notes 8 and 9). In order to ensure an appropriate 
return for shareholders’ capital invested in the Company, management monitors capital thoroughly and evaluates all material pro jects and potential 
acquisitions before submission to the Board for ultimate approval, where applicable.  138 Hochschild Mining plc Annual Report 2016

  Ore reserves and mineral resources estimates 
Hochschild Mining plc reports its mineral resources and reserves estimates in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration 
Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves 2004 edition (“the JORC Code”). This establishes minimum standards, recommendations and 
guidelines for the public reporting of exploration results and mineral resources and reserves estimates. In doing so it emphasises the importance 
of principles of transparency, materiality and confidence. The information on ore reserves and mineral resources on pages 139 to 141 were 
prepared by or under the supervision of Competent Persons (as defined in the JORC Code). Competent Persons are required to have sufficient 
relevant experience and understanding of the style of mineralisation, types of deposits and mining methods in the area of activity for which they 
are qualified as a Competent Person under the JORC Code. The Competent Person must sign off their respective estimates of the original mineral 
resource and ore reserve statements for the various operations and consent to the inclusion of that information in this report, as well as the form 
and context in which it appears. 
Hochschild Mining plc employs its own Competent Person who has audited all the estimates set out in this report. Hochschild Mining Group 
companies are subject to a comprehensive programme of audits which aim to provide assurance in respect of ore reserve and mineral resource 
estimates. These audits are conducted by Competent Persons provided by independent consultants. The frequency and depth of an audit depends 
on the risks and/or uncertainties associated with that particular ore reserve and mineral resource, the overall value thereof and the time that has 
elapsed since the previous independent third-party audit. 
The JORC Code requires the use of reasonable economic assumptions. These include long-term commodity price forecasts (which, in the Group’s 
case, are prepared by ex-house specialists largely using estimates of future supply and demand and long-term economic outlooks). 
Ore reserve estimates are dynamic and are influenced by changing economic conditions, technical issues, environmental regulations and any 
other relevant new information and therefore these can vary from year-to-year. Mineral resource estimates can also change and tend to be 
influenced mostly by new information pertaining to the understanding of the deposit and secondly the conversion to ore reserves. 
The estimates of ore reserves and mineral resources are shown as at 31 December 2016, unless otherwise stated. Mineral resources that are 
reported include those mineral resources that have been modified to produce ore reserves. All tonnage and grade information has been rounded 
to reflect the relative uncertainty in the estimates; there may therefore be small differences. The prices used for the reserves calculation were:  
Au Price: US$1,200 per ounce and Ag Price: US$16.5 per ounce.

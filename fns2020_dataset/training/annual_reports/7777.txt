Chairman’s Statement
Idox has delivered an outstanding performance in 
this financial year. We have not only consolidated our 
position as the market leading Land and Property 
software specialist in the UK Public Sector software local 
government market, but we have also now established 
a strong foothold in the global Engineering Information 
Management market. 
We have enjoyed further transformation in 2012 and a 
greater leap in profitability, driven not only by our continuing 
acquisition programme, but also by a very encouraging 
uplift in organic growth in both our major software divisions. 
Five acquisitions were made in the financial year; CT Space 
Group, Interactive Dialogues, Opt2Vote, Currency Connect 
and FMx. All are performing well and as a result we have 
many new Idox employees in the UK and around the world 
to welcome to our growing organisation. This acquisition 
programme has been met from the high cash conversion 
generated from operating activities, together with a flexible 
debt facility, which is maintained well within a prudent 
multiple of earnings.
As always, it is our senior management and all our 
employees who drive this business forward in terms 
of capability and profitability. We are also privileged to 
have the support and engagement of many of our key 
shareholders on our journey as a growing AIM listed 
company, as well as able professional advisers. All have 
played a part in helping Idox progress well against the 
continuing headwinds of great uncertainty in the wider 
economic world. 
Looking to the future, we have sought to diversify our 
core software businesses, which are largely driven off a 
common technology base, as well as achieving a greater 
geographical spread. We have also sought to achieve a 
degree of parity in revenues between our Public Sector 
business and our private sector Engineering Information 
Management (EIM) business and between the UK and the 
rest of the world. 
Therefore it is pleasing to report that in this financial year 
we show 31% of Group revenues coming from the EIM 
division (2011:12%) and 31% coming from outside the 
UK (2011: 12%) with a particular focus on non-European 
markets such as the USA, our largest market outside the 
UK, Australia and the BRIC countries which, together, 
provided 69% of this international total. 
As our Company grows, the board has developed its 
thinking on governance and risk management. We 
are determined to protect our small company heritage 
of rigorous attention to detail, cash and cost control, 
combined with speedy execution, while recognising that 
new scale and opportunities around the world bring new 
challenges. Such potential issues include anticipating 
technology shifts, ensuring revenue recognition policies 
remain appropriate as business expands, multiple overseas 
jurisdictions and currencies, different national cultures, as 
well as more complex product lines and management skills. 
These all require more planning and oversight by the board 
acting independently, as well as by senior management. 
In turn this also requires the composition and skill base 
of the board to be progressively refreshed and as part of 
this process, we were particularly pleased to welcome 
Professor Dame Wendy Hall FRS as an additional Non-
Executive Director in October.
In line with our progressive dividend policy, the Board 
proposes a final dividend of 0.40p, subject to shareholder 
approval, making a total for the year of 0.675p, a 13% 
increase over 2011.
The new financial year has started well, building on our high 
recurring revenues and strong qualified sales pipeline and 
we look forward to another year of further development and 
growth at Idox.

This year we have built on the improvements we have made 
in previous years and laid the foundations for further growth 
and prosperity of the business.
To achieve this we continue to evolve our internal 
processes, develop further our product strategies, invest 
in new graduates, encourage innovation in all parts of the 
organisation from product to back office operations and 
importantly, focus on delivering improved customer care. 
These continued efforts have delivered this year’s growth 
and we are committed to continuing this growth across 
the Group.
The Public Sector Software Division has benefited from 
local government responding to the current difficult 
economic environment and we have actively engaged 
with them to look for ways to improve services at a 
reduced cost through improvements in productivity, 
vendor consolidation, automation and business change. 
The division has won seventy-five individual new 
systems in the past twelve months delivering significant 
improvements in productivity and thereby cost savings. 
Although we are not always the cheapest vendor we 
strive to demonstrate the benefits of our solutions and 
our commitment to deliver improved services and 
support over the long-term.
Building on our successes in 2011 we have this year 
implemented more shared, managed and hosted solutions 
and look forward to growing this part of our business 
further in 2013.
The Engineering Information Management Division (EIM), 
which previously just included McLaren Software, was 
expanded at the start of the year through the acquisition 
of CTSpace and at the end of the year with the extension 
of our capabilities into facilities management software with 
the acquisition of FMx. This, together with another year of 
double digit organic growth, has helped raise EIM revenue 
from 12% in 2011 to 31% in 2012. 
McLaren Software launched its new hosted “On-Air” 
offering in Q4. This resulted in making Idox the only 
global supplier within the Engineering Information 
Management market able to provide enterprise-wide 
document management and collaboration solutions for 
the construction and operation of large assets, offering a 
flexible open standards cross platform package whether 
in the Cloud, off-premise hosted or on-premise solution.
Our Information Solutions Division extended its content 
and web capabilities through added-value consultancy 
and training services outside the public sector with 
the acquisition of Currency Connect and Interactive 
Dialogues. It is now able to offer a range of content, 
hosting, e-learning and compliance solutions in the public 
sector and in the private sector across Europe. The 
division has improved its renewal rates, grown its training 
revenues in double digits and successfully completed its 
first content and managed services outsourcing contract 
for the Greater London Authority (GLA), where it not 
only reduced the costs but also managed to deliver an 
improved outcome through a combination of content, 
domain expertise and technical capability.
Recruitment continued to make a contribution to the 
business and has reorganised its approach to take account 
of the continued difficult market and the internationalisation 
of its business.
Outlook 
The Group will continue to build upon its previous financial 
success and has again started this year well with a stronger 
pipeline than the year before across all of the divisions. 
We expect the shift in revenue mix to a higher percentage 
of private sector revenues to work in our favour with higher 
top line growth expected, whilst margins are expected to 
move closer to those of the public sector business.
In 2013 we intend to accelerate the level of innovation in 
all aspects of the business, not just development, and will 
continue to look for areas of productivity improvement, 
improved processes and, above all, improved quality in 
customer care.
We expect the geographic diversification of the revenue 
base to help insulate the Group from challenging economic 
issues closer to home and assist it in the ambition to grow 
in double digits organically. 
Management will continue its strategy of becoming domain 
experts and partner of choice in the Public Sector and EIM 
markets through suitable acquisitions which will extend its 
global and technical reach.

Financial review 
Group revenues grew by 50% to £58m (2011: £39m) 
reflecting not only the impact of the five acquisitions made 
in 2012 but also accelerating organic growth across the 
business. The Group enjoyed a significant diversification 
of its revenues geographically with 31% now generated 
outside of the UK (2011: 12%). Gross profit earned was 54% 
higher at £51.4m (2011: £33.4m) and the Group saw an 
increase in gross margin from 87% to 89% as a result of an 
increased mix of higher margin software business. Earnings 
before goodwill, impairment, amortisation, depreciation, 
restructuring, corporate finance and share option costs 
(“EBITDA”) increased by 44% to £16.7m (2011: £11.6m) with 
EBITDA margins of 29% (2011: 30%).
Performance by segment
The Public Sector software business, which accounted for 
52% of Group revenues (2011: 68%), delivered revenues 
of £30.2m (2011: £26.1m), a growth rate of 15%. Excluding 
Opt2Vote, the election managed services business 
acquired in March 2012 which contributed £2.4m,  
revenues grew by 6% organically on the previous year. 
Recurring revenues within the Public Sector software 
business were 57%, down from 66% in FY11 as a result of 
the strong growth of new software and services revenue in 
the year and the classification of Opt2Vote revenue as non-
recurring resulting in a change in product mix. Divisional 
EBITDA grew by 8% to £10.3m (2011: £9.5m), delivering a 
34% margin, a 2% drop on 2011 due to the inclusion of the 
lower gross margin Opt2Vote business. 
The Engineering Information Management (“EIM”) business 
accounted for 31% of Group revenues (2011: 12%) and 
more than tripled revenues from £4.7m in 2011 to £17.8m in 
2012. This was achieved by organic growth of 46% in the 
McLaren business in addition to the first year’s contribution 
of CT Space which was acquired in November 2011. Visibility 
of revenue in the EIM business has also increased during 
the year with 48% (2011: 36%) of revenues coming from 
recurring maintenance and Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) 
contracts. The business is also becoming increasingly 
international with 60% of divisional revenues coming from the 
USA, 9% from Australia and 9% from Europe and Asia.
EBITDA for the EIM business increased five-fold to £5.3m 
(2011: £1.1m), 32% of the Group total. Margins increased to 
30% (2011: 23%) which reflects both the increased scale of 
the business and progress made during the year in rapidly 
integrating CTSpace to achieve planned cost synergies. 
The Information Solutions business increased revenues by 
59% to £7.5m (2011: £4.7m) as a result of the acquisitions 
of e-learning provider, Interactive Dialogues and grants 
consultancy business, Currency Connect during the year 
which contributed £2.1m and £1.2m respectively. In 2011 
the grants subscription business faced headwinds during 
the first year of the public sector spending cuts which 
impacted renewal rates and therefore revenue recognition 
coming into 2012. However in the second half renewal rates 
improved providing a solid platform for growth in 2013. 
EBITDA for the Information Solutions business increased 
70% to £1m (2011: £0.6m).
The Recruitment business revenues declined by 19% 
to £2.5m (2011: £3.1m) as a result of a decline in the low 
margin contract recruitment business. However, gross 
margins were relatively stable at £1.3m due to the shift 
in mix toward the higher margin permanent recruitment 
business. EBITDA declined to £0.1m (2011: £0.4m).
Profit before tax
Within the income statement, we present both profit before 
tax and adjusted profit before tax which is a performance 
measure that is not defined by GAAP but which the 
Directors believe provides a reliable and consistent 
measure of the Group’s underlying financial performance. 
Adjusted profit before tax and adjusted EPS excludes 
amortisation, impairment, restructuring, corporate finance 
and share option costs. 
Adjusted profit before tax increased 36% to £14.9m (2011: 
£10.9m). Financing costs increased from £0.4m to £1.3m as 
a result of the loan facilities which were taken out to fund the 
acquisitions made during the year. Interest payable (including 
swap costs) was £0.9m (2011: £0.1m), amortisation of the 
loan facility fees £0.2m (2011: £0.2m) and foreign exchange 
translation differences £0.1m (2011: £0.02m). 
Reported profit before tax increased 23% to £6.9m (2011: 
£5.6m). Amortisation of intangibles increased from £3.7m 
to £4.6m as a result of acquisitions made during the year. 
An impairment charge of £1m has been made against the 
carrying value of goodwill in relation to the TFPL Recruitment 
business based on management’s review of the future 
projections for the business. Restructuring charges of £0.5m 
(2011: £0.2m) relate to the integration of acquisitions made 
during the year and corporate finance costs of £1.1m (2011: 
£0.3m) are all acquisition related and include legal and due 
diligence fees in respect of the five acquisitions completed 
during the course of the year and fees incurred in respect of 
one large acquisition which was aborted. 
Taxation
The Group’s effective tax rate for the year was 3% compared 
to 19% in 2011. The reduction in the effective rate of tax 
is largely related to both the recognition and utilisation of 
brought forward tax losses acquired with the McLaren 
business. During the year, £2.9m of unrecognised brought 
forward tax losses were utilised against current year profits 
within the EIM business. After utilising these losses, a further 
£4.1m of tax losses remain available to utilise against future 
year profits. Based on EIM trading performance during FY12 
the board now consider it highly probable that the Group 
will benefit from these tax losses, amounting to £4.1m, in 
the future and as a result a deferred tax asset has been 
For the year ended 31 October 2012
Chief Financial Officer’s Review 09 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 October 2012
recognised on the balance sheet which has resulted in a 
£0.9m reduction in the current year tax charge. The Group 
will continue to derive a cash benefit from these tax losses in 
future years. Excluding the effect of recognising this deferred 
tax asset the effective tax rate was 17%. 
Earnings per share and dividends
Adjusted earnings per share were up 55% to 3.83p 
(2011: 2.47p). Diluted adjusted earnings per share  
increased by 51% to 3.63p (2011: 2.41p). 
Basic earnings per share were up 48% to 1.94p 
(2011: 1.31p). Diluted earnings per share increased by  
44% to 1.84p (2011: 1.28p). 
The Board proposes a final dividend of 0.40p, to give a full 
year dividend of 0.675p (2011: 0.60p). This 13% increase 
in dividend reflects the Group’s strong profitability growth 
whilst also being mindful of maintaining balance sheet 
capability to capitalise on future acquisition opportunities. 
Subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting, the final 
dividend will be paid on 26 April 2013 to shareholders on 
the register at 19 April 2013. 
Balance sheet and cashflows
Idox’s balance sheet continued to strengthen during the 
year and at 31 October 2012 net assets were £38.9m 
compared to £34.4m at 31 October 2011. 
Cash generated from operating activities before tax as 
a percentage of EBITDA was 75%, up from 56% in the 
previous year. Trade receivables increased to £11.2m  
(2011: £6.0m) as a result of acquisitions during the year  
and a strong finish to trading in the year. 
The Group ended the year with net debt of £21.5m 
(2011: £2.4m) after making acquisition related payments 
(net of cash acquired) of £23.6m and after total dividends 
and share buy backs of £2.8m. The Group’s total signed 
debt facilities at 31 October 2012 stood at £27.7m, a 
combination of a term loan and flexible working capital and 
acquisition revolving credit facilities. The acquisition facility 
was extended by a further £5m post year-end however 
remains undrawn. The Group has enjoyed very significant 
headroom against its banking covenants during the year. 
Deferred income, representing invoiced maintenance and 
SaaS contracts yet to be recognised in revenue stood at 
£13.5m at 31 October 2012 (2011: £10.9m), increasing 
visibility of revenue in the new financial year.

Health, Safety and Environmental Policies

team which provides advice and support in this area. The team members regularly attend external H,S&E courses and 
internal reviews are performed on a regular basis to ensure compliance with best practice and all relevant legislation.
Disabled Employees
Applications for employment by disabled persons are always fully considered, bearing in mind the aptitudes and abilities of 
the applicant concerned. 
In the event of members of staff becoming disabled, every effort is made to ensure that their employment with the Group 
continues and that appropriate training is arranged. It is the policy of the Group that the training, career development and 
promotion of disabled employees should, as far as possible be identical with that of other employees. 
Employee Consultation
The Group consults employees through the National Company Council (NCC). The NCC sits regularly during the year 
and is made up of representatives voted on the Council by employees. An employee consultation policy is also in place. 
Employees are encouraged to present their views and suggestions in respect of the Group’s performance and policies. In 
addition, the Group has an intranet which facilitates faster and more effective communication.
An Employee Share Investment Trust is in place to allow employees a tax efficient way of investing in the Company. The 
Company purchases matching shares which become the property of the employee after a three year vesting period.
Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies
The Group uses various financial instruments which include cash, equity investments, bank loans and items such as trade 
debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to 
raise finance for the Group’s operations. 
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk, exchange rate risk and interest 
rate risk. The Directors review these risks on an ongoing basis. This policy has remained unchanged from previous years.
Credit Risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and trade debtors. The credit risk associated with cash is limited as the 
counterparties have high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies. The principal credit risk arises 
therefore from its trade debtors. 
In order to manage credit risk, the management review the debt ageing on an ongoing basis, together with the collection 
history and third party credit references where appropriate. 
Liquidity Risk
The Group seeks to manage financial risk by ensuring sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to 
invest cash assets safely and profitably. 14 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 October 2012
For the year ended 31 October 2012
Exchange Rate Risk
The Group monitors its exposure to exchange rate risk on an ongoing basis. The Group has minimal exposure to foreign 
exchange risk as a result of natural hedges arising between sales and cost transactions.
Interest Rate Risk
The Group’s bank borrowings bear interest at rates linked to the LIBOR. To protect cash flows against movements in 
LIBOR the Group entered into an interest LIBOR swap agreement.
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
The principal risks and uncertainties affecting the Group include the following:
 > Political – the Group has a large customer base in local government. A change in spending priorities by the current or 
a future Government could materially impact the Group. However this risk is mitigated due to the contractual nature of 
the recurring revenue in the Group. The Group has increased diversification of its customer base through acquisitions to 
mitigate against political risks.
 > Economic – the software area of the business could be adversely affected if the government reduces the grants to local 
authorities in an economic downturn. However, all indications are that the government will maintain and may increase 
the grants during such a period. The Group has increased diversification through acquisitions to mitigate against 
economic risks.
 > Competitors – the Group has certain competitors for its software products. To mitigate this risk, the Group continues 
to invest in and develop its software. Competitor risk is also mitigated through the long-term nature of customer 
relationships and recurring software maintenance revenue.
 > Acquisitions – the Group could be materially impacted if an acquisition does not perform in line with expectations. To mitigate 
this risk, for each acquisition due diligence and integration planning is undertaken and all potential synergies identified.

Directors’ Report continued 15 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 October 2012
Going Concern
The Directors have reviewed the Group’s budget and cash flows for 2013 and 2014 in the context of the Group’s banking 
facilities and covenants, the level of recurring revenue within the business, the outlook for our chosen markets, and our current 
working capital resources, and are satisfied that it is appropriate to prepare accounts on a going concern basis. There are no 
events or conditions that may cast significant doubt about the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern. 
Post balance sheet events
On 1 November 2012 the Group increased the acquisition Revolving Credit Facility from £10m to £15m. 
Disclosure of Information to Auditors
In so far as each of the Directors is aware:
 > there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and
 > the Directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the auditors are aware of that information.
Auditors
A resolution to reappoint Grant Thornton UK LLP as auditors and to authorise the Directors to agree their remuneration  
will be placed before the forthcoming Annual General Meeting of the Company.

Report on Remuneration
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee operates within defined terms of reference. The Remuneration Committee comprises the 
Chairman and two Non-Executive Directors. It is chaired by Christopher Wright.
Remuneration Policy
The policy of the Group is to set levels of remuneration to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and key staff. The 
packages are designed to be competitive in value to those offered to the Directors of similar sized public companies in related 
sectors. It is the Board’s policy to align the interests of managers with those of our shareholders in the grant of option and 
other equity rewards which underlying securities grantees are very much encouraged to retain over the longer term.
The components of the Executive Directors’ remuneration packages are currently a basic salary, bonus, money purchase 
pension contributions and benefits in kind. The benefits include car allowance, private medical cover, life cover and critical 
illness cover. The bonus elements are dependent on the Executive Directors achieving performance criteria set out by the 
Remuneration Committee. The criteria include targets for revenue and profits as well as for cash balances. In addition, the 
Group operates share option schemes for the Executive Directors.

The Directors’ shareholdings in the Company are listed in the Directors’ Report on page 12. 18 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 October 2012
For the year ended 31 October 2012
Corporate Governance
The Group is committed to applying the highest principles 
of corporate governance commensurate with its size. The 
Group has adopted the Quoted Company Alliance (QCA) 
Corporate Governance Guidelines for AIM Companies as 
published in September 2010. The Group complies with the 
QCA Corporate Governance Guidelines except whereby:
 > the Board does not currently undertake performance 
evaluation of the Board, its committees, and its 
individual Directors
 > the Board held eight Board meetings, three Audit 
Committee and two Remuneration Committee 
meetings during the year. All Directors attended 
each Board meeting. Two Directors attended each 
Committee meeting.
Internal Control
The Board takes responsibility for establishing and 
maintaining reliable systems of control in all areas of 
operation. These systems of control, especially of financial 
control, can only provide reasonable, but not absolute, 
assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
The key matters relating to the system of internal control  
are set out below:
 > Idox plc has established an operational management 
structure with clearly defined responsibilities and regular 
performance reviews
 > the Group operates a comprehensive system for 
reporting financial and non-financial information to the 
Board including preparation and review of strategy plans 
and the preparation and review of annual budgets
 > financial results are monitored against budgets, 
forecasts and other performance indicators with action 
dictated accordingly at each meeting
 > a structured approval process based on assessment of 
risk and value delivered
 > sufficient resource is focused to maintain and develop 
internal control procedures and information systems, 
especially in financial management.
The Board considers that there have been no substantial 
weaknesses in internal financial controls that have resulted 
in any material losses, contingencies or uncertainties which 
need to be disclosed in the accounts.
The Group supports an internal audit function that performs 
annual audits on its management systems. This function is 
supported by a management review of the audit findings. 
The Board confirms that there is an ongoing process 
for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant 
risks faced by the Group, and that this process has been 
in place for the year under review and up to the date of 
approval of the Annual Report and Accounts. This process 
is regularly reviewed by the Board. 
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the 
Directors have to prepare the consolidated financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European 
Union (IFRSs). The Directors have elected to prepare 
the Company financial statements under UK Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (“UK GAAP”). 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
parent Company and of the profit or loss of the Group and 
parent Company for that period. In preparing these financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
 > select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently
 > make judgments and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent
 > state whether applicable IFRSs and UK accounting 
standards have been followed, subject to any  
material departures disclosed and explained in 
the financial statements
 > prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Group’s transactions, disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection  
of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for ensuring that the 
Directors’ Report and other information included in the 
Annual Report is prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom company law. They are also responsible for 
ensuring that the Annual Report includes information 
required by the AIM Market Rules. 
Corporate Governance Report 19 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 October 2012
The maintenance and integrity of the Group’s website is the 
responsibility of the Directors; the work carried out by the 
auditors does not involve consideration of these matters 
and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for 
any changes that may have occurred to the information 
contained in the accounts since they were initially 
presented on the website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and the dissemination of the accounts and 
other information included in annual reports may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Accounting Policies
The Board considers the appropriateness of its accounting 
policies on an annual basis. The Board believes that its 
accounting policies are appropriate in particular in relation 
to income recognition and research and development.
Board of Directors
The Board, comprising the Chairman, the Chief Executive 
Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and three Non-Executive 
Directors, is responsible for the overall strategy and 
direction of Idox plc as well as for approving potential 
acquisitions, major capital expenditure items and financing 
matters. The Board has a formal schedule of business 
reserved to it and meets regularly during the year. The 
Board is supplied in a timely manner with information in a 
form and of a suitable quality appropriate to enable it to 
discharge its duties. Advice from independent sources is 
available if required. The Board monitors exposure to key 
business risks and reviews the strategic direction of the 
Group, the annual budgets as well as their progress against 
those budgets.
The Board members and their roles are described on page 
10 to 11. In accordance with the Company’s Articles of 
Association, one third of the Directors are required to retire 
by rotation at the Annual General Meeting.
Shareholder Relations
Idox plc is committed to open communication with all its 
shareholders. The Directors hold regular meetings with 
institutional shareholders to discuss and review the Group’s 
activities and objectives. Communication with private 
shareholders is principally through the Annual General 
Meeting, where participation is encouraged and where the 
Board is available to answer questions. Idox plc maintains 
up-to-date information on the Investor Relations section of 
its website www.Idoxplc.com.
Every shareholder has access to a full annual report each 
year end and an interim report at the half year end. Care 
is taken to ensure that any price sensitive information 
is released to all shareholders, institutional and private, 
at the same time in accordance with London Stock 
Exchange requirements. 
Idox plc strives to give a full, timely and realistic assessment 
of its business in a balanced way, in all price-sensitive 
reports and presentations. 
The Group has adopted the Quoted Company Alliance 
(QCA) suggested terms of reference for the various Board 
committees as set out by the QCA.
The Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is chaired by Peter Lilley and includes 
Christopher Wright and Wendy Hall. The Report of the 
Audit Committee can be found on page 20.
The Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee is chaired by Peter Lilley and 
includes Christopher Wright and Wendy Hall. 
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Christopher 
Wright and includes Peter Lilley and Wendy Hall. This 
Committee determines the remuneration and benefits 
packages for the Executive Directors and any changes to 
the service contracts. The Committee also approves any 
share related incentive schemes within the Group. 
Re-election
Under the Code, Directors should offer themselves for 
re-election at regular intervals and, under the Company’s 
Articles of Association, at every Annual General Meeting 
at least one third of the Directors who are subject to 
retirement by rotation are required to retire and may 
be proposed for re-election. New Directors, who were 
not appointed at the previous Annual General Meeting, 
automatically retire at their first Annual General Meeting  
and if eligible, can seek re-appointment.
Three Directors will retire from office at the  
Company’s forthcoming Annual General Meeting  
and stand for re-appointment. 20 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 October 2012
For the year ended 31 October 2012
Membership and Meetings
The Audit Committee is a committee of the Board and is 
comprised of three Non-Executive Directors: Peter Lilley, 
Christopher Wright and Wendy Hall.
The Audit Committee invites the Executive Directors, the 
external auditors and other senior managers to attend its 
meetings as appropriate. The Company Secretary is also 
the Secretary of the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee is considered to have sufficient, recent 
and relevant financial experience to discharge its functions.
During the period under review, the Audit Committee  
met three times.
Role, Responsibilities and Terms of Reference
The Audit Committee’s role is to assist the Board in the 
effective discharge of its responsibilities for financial 
reporting and internal control.
The Audit Committee’s responsibilities include:
 > to review the integrity of the annual and interim financial 
statements of the Group ensuring they comply with legal 
requirements, accounting standards and AIM rules, and 
any other formal announcements relating to the Group’s 
financial performance 
 > to review the Group’s internal financial control and  
risk management systems
 > monitor and review the requirement for an internal  
audit function
 > to review the arrangements for staff to whistle-blow  
on financial reporting and other matters
 > safeguard the auditor’s objectivity and independence 
when non-audit services are provided
 > oversee the relationship with the external auditor, 
including approval of their remuneration, agreeing 
the scope of the audit engagement, assessing their 
independence, monitoring the provision of non-audit 
services, and considering their reports on the Group’s 
financial statements.
The Audit Committee operates within agreed terms of 
reference, which can be found on the Company’s website.
Independence of External Auditors
The Committee keeps under review the relationship with 
the external auditors including:
 > the independence and objectivity of the external 
auditors, taking into account the relevant UK 
professional and regulatory requirements and the 
relationship with the auditor as a whole, including the 
provision of the non-audit services
 > the consideration of audit fees and any fees for non-
audit services.
The Audit Committee develops and recommends to the 
Board the Group’s policy in relation to the provision of 
non-audit services by the auditors, and ensures that the 
provision of such services does not impair the external 
auditor independence.

1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
General Information
Idox plc is a leading supplier of software and services 
for the management of local government and other 
organisations. The Company is a public limited company 
which is listed on the London Alternative Investment Market 
and is incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The address 
of its registered office is 2nd Floor, Chancery Exchange, 10 
Furnival Street, London, EC4A 1AB. The registered number 
of the Company is 03984070.
The financial statements are prepared in pound sterling.
Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU) 
and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS. 
The financial statements have been prepared under the 
historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation  
of certain financial assets and liabilities, being derivatives  
at fair value through profit or loss.
As set out on page 15 of the Directors’ Report, the financial 
statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
International Financial Reporting Standards  
and Interpretations issued but not yet effective
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, 
the following new standards, amendments and 
interpretations to existing standards have been published 
that are mandatory for forthcoming financial periods, 
but which the Group has not adopted early. These are 
not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s 
consolidated financial statements:
 > IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective 1 January 2015)
 > IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements (effective  
1 January 2013)
 > IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities (effective 
1 January 2013)
 > IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement (effective 1 January 2013)
 > IAS 19 (revised June 2011) Employee Benefits (effective  
1 January 2013)
 > IAS 27 (revised) Separate Financial Statements (effective 
1 January 2013)
 > Amendments to IFRS 7: Disclosures – Offsetting 
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (effective  
1 January 2013)
 > Amendments to IAS 32 – Offsetting Financial Assets 
and Financial Liabilities (effective 1 January 2014)
 > Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 – Mandatory 
Effective Date and Transition Disclosures (effective  
1 January 2015)
 > Annual Improvements 2009-2011 Cycle (effective  
1 January 2013).
Adoption of new and revised standards
The following amendments to standards have been 
adopted by the Group during the year:
Amendments to IAS 1 (effective 1 July 2012) – 
Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income. 
This amendment requires separate presentation of items 
of other comprehensive income that are reclassified 
subsequently to profit or loss and those that are not 
reclassified to profit or loss. 
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and 
are based on historical experience and other factors, 
including expectations of future events that are believed to 
be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning 
the future. The resulting accounting estimates and 
assumptions will, by definition, seldom equal the related 
actual results. The Group has evaluated the estimates 
and assumptions that have been made in relation to the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in these financial 
statements. The estimates and assumptions which have the 
most significant impact on the financial statements which are 
recognised in the financial statements are as follows:
(i) Intangible assets
The Group recognises intangible assets acquired as 
part of business combinations at fair value at the date of 
acquisition. The determination of these fair values is based 
upon management’s judgement and includes assumptions 
on the timing and amount of future incremental cash flows 
generated by the assets and selection of an appropriate 
cost of capital. Furthermore, management must estimate 
the expected useful lives of intangible assets and charge 
amortisation on those assets accordingly. In determining 
the useful economic life of the intangible software assets, 
management has given consideration to the length of time 
that its own software is typically used within its market. In 
addition, management reviewed competitor products and 
the length of time they had also been in use.
Consideration was also given as to the likelihood that a 
new competitor could enter the market with a new product. 
This was considered unlikely due to the up-front capital 
investment which would be required to develop a new 
product, the requirement for reference sites to demonstrate 
the product, and the long life cycles which products have in 
the market. For details on the estimates made in relation to 
intangible assets, see note 11.

1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUEd
Critical accounting estimates and judgements 
continued
(ii) Development costs
The Group reviews half yearly whether the recognition 
requirements for development costs have been met. This 
is necessary as the economic success of any product 
development is uncertain and may be subject to future 
technical problems at the time of recognition. Judgements 
are based on the information available at each balance sheet 
date. In addition, all internal activities related to the research 
and development of new software products are continuously 
monitored by the Directors. See note 11 for further information.
(iii) Impairment of goodwill
The Group is required to test, as least annually, whether 
goodwill has suffered any impairment. The recoverable 
amount is determined based upon value-in-use and net 
realisable value calculations. The value-in-use method 
requires the estimation of future cash flows and the choice 
of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present 
value of these cash flows. Pre-tax discount rates have been 
applied and are based on WACC calculations. See note 11 
for further commentary.
(iv) Revenue recognition
The Group recognises revenue on certain contracts  
such as work in progress, prior to an invoice being raised, 
where work has been completed and there is a high  
degree of certainty of the contract being completed  
and the invoice raised and cash received. See paragraph 
headed ‘Revenue’ below for more detail on how the  
Group accounts for revenue. 
(v) Dilapidations
Dilapidation provisions are management’s best estimates 
based on actual costs incurred in existing or similar 
properties. See note 17 for details of the amounts included 
in the balance sheet at the year end.
(vi) Contingent consideration
The contingent consideration provision is the maximum 
undiscounted amount which will be paid, which represents 
fair value. 
(vii) Deferred tax
The Group has tax losses available to offset future taxable 
profits. In estimating the amount of deferred tax to be 
recognised as an asset the Group estimates the future 
profitability of the relevant business unit.
Basis of consolidation
The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of the 
Company and its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to  
31 October each year. Subsidiaries are those entities over 
which the Group has the power to control the financial and 
operating policies. Over all its subsidiaries, Idox plc obtains 
and exercises control through 100% of the voting rights.
All inter-company transactions are eliminated  
on consolidation. 
For business combinations occurring since 1 November 
2009, the requirements of IFRS 3R have been applied. 
The consideration transferred by the Group to obtain 
control of a subsidiary is calculated as the sum of the 
acquisition date fair values of assets transferred, liabilities 
incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group, 
which includes the fair value of any asset or liability arising 
from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition 
costs are expensed as incurred.
Revenue
Revenue represents the amounts receivable in respect of 
goods and services provided during the year, stated net of 
value added tax. Where work has been done, but a billing 
milestone has not been reached, the income has been 
accrued and included in amounts recoverable within trade 
and other receivables. 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the right to 
consideration. The Group derives its revenue streams  
from software solutions, information solutions and 
recruitment services. 
Software licence revenue is recognised when the licence 
is delivered. Where the licence is bespoke, revenue is 
recognised when the licence is delivered and the customer 
has accepted the licence as fully functional. 
Software consultancy revenue is recognised on a stage 
of completion basis. Stage of completion is determined 
by time spent by service delivery consultants compared 
to estimated total time to complete the project. For small 
value orders, the whole invoice amount is recognised at 
the billing point. 
Revenue relating to goods delivered as part of software 
solutions provided is only recognised once the goods have 
been received by the customer.
The revenues for maintenance and managed service 
contracts are spread evenly over the life of the agreement, 
which is typically one year. 
Revenue derived from information solutions content is 
recognised over the life of the subscription, which is 
typically one year. Revenue from projects is recognised 
over the life of the project in accordance with the stage of 
completion on a time spent basis which is determined by 
reference to the project delivery plan.
Recruitment revenue from permanent placements is 
recognised in the month when the placement starts. 
Revenue from contract recruitment is recognised as the 
service is performed. 29 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Contract revenue
The amount of profit attributable to the stage of completion 
of a long-term contract is recognised only when the 
outcome of the contract can be foreseen with reasonable 
certainty. Management make a judgement on the fair value 
of the work completed to enable revenue on long-term 
contracts to be recognised in the correct periods. Stage 
of completion is determined based on management’s best 
estimate of effort expended and progress against project 
plans at the year end on a time spent basis. Provision is 
made for any losses as they are foreseen. 
The contracts for software solutions often contain multiple 
elements such as software, consultancy and maintenance. 
Management make appropriate judgements and estimates 
in relation to the fair value of each of these elements in 
accordance with IAS 18.
Amounts recoverable on contracts are included in trade 
and other receivables and represent revenue recognised in 
excess of payments on account.
Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent 
with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating 
decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker has 
been identified as the steering committee, which comprises 
the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer.
Goodwill
Goodwill is stated after separate recognition of identifiable 
intangible assets. It is calculated as the excess of the 
sum of a) fair value of consideration transferred, b) the 
recognised amount of any non-controlling interest in the 
acquiree and c) acquisition-date fair value of any existing 
equity interest in the acquiree, over the acquisition-date 
fair values of identifiable net assets. If the fair values of the 
identifiable net assets exceed the sum calculated above, 
the excess amount (i.e. gain on a bargain purchase) is 
recognised in profit or loss immediately.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated 
are tested for impairment at least annually. All other 
individual assets or cash-generating units are tested for 
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment 
losses. Negative goodwill is recognised immediately after 
acquisition in the statement of comprehensive income. 
Unallocated goodwill on acquisitions relates mainly to 
workforce valuation, synergies and economies of scale 
obtained on combining acquisitions with existing operations.
Goodwill written off to reserves prior to the date of transition 
to IFRS remains in reserves. There is no re-instatement 
of goodwill that was amortised prior to transition to IFRS. 
Goodwill previously written off to reserves is not written back 
to profit or loss on subsequent disposal.
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortised to 
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on 
a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which 
are reviewed on an annual basis. Amortisation commences 
when the asset is available for use. The residual values of 
intangible assets are assumed to be zero.
(i) Research and development
Expenditure on research (or the research phase of an 
internal project) is recognised in profit or loss in the period 
in which it is incurred. Development costs incurred are 
capitalised when all the following conditions are satisfied:
 > completion of the intangible asset is technically feasible 
so that it will be available for use or sale
 > the Group intends to complete the intangible asset and 
use or sell it
 > the Group has the ability to use or sell the intangible asset
 > the intangible asset will generate probable future 
economic benefits. Among other things, this requires 
that there is a market for the output from the intangible 
asset or for the intangible asset itself, or, if it is to be 
used internally, the asset will be used in generating 
such benefits
 > there are adequate technical, financial and other 
resources to complete the development and to use  
or sell the intangible asset, and
 > the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset 
during its development can be measured reliably.
Development costs not meeting the criteria for 
capitalisation are expensed in profit or loss as incurred. The 
cost of an internally generated intangible asset comprises 
all directly attributable costs necessary to create, produce, 
and prepare the asset to be capable of operating in 
the manner intended by management. Amortisation 
commences upon completion of the asset, and is shown 
separately on the statement of comprehensive income.
Careful judgement by the Directors is applied when 
deciding whether the recognition requirements for 
development costs have been met. This is necessary as 
the economic success of any product development is 
uncertain and may be subject to future technical problems 
at the time of recognition. Judgements are based on 
the information available at each balance sheet date. In 
addition, all internal activities related to the research and 
development of new software products are continuously 
monitored by the Directors.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight line method 
over a period of 5 years. 30 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

Subscription deferred revenue is calculated using the 
straight line method over a period of 5 years.
Impairment
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are 
grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately 
identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). As a result, 
some assets are tested individually for impairment and 
some are tested at cash-generating unit level. Goodwill is 
allocated to those cash-generating units that are expected to 
benefit from synergies of the related business combination 
and represent the lowest level within the Group at which 
management monitors the related cash flows.
Goodwill, other individual assets or cash-generating 
units that include goodwill, other intangible assets with 
an indefinite useful life, and those intangible assets not 
yet available for use are tested for impairment at least 
annually. All other individual assets or cash-generating 
units are tested for impairment whenever events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by 
which the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s carrying 
amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The 
recoverable amount is the higher of fair value, reflecting 
market conditions less costs to sell, and value in use 
based on an internal discounted cash flow evaluation. 
Impairment losses recognised for cash-generating 
units, to which goodwill has been allocated, are credited 
initially to the carrying amount of goodwill. Any remaining 
impairment loss is charged pro rata to the other assets in 
the cash generating unit. With the exception of goodwill, 
all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications 
that an impairment loss previously recognised may no 
longer exist.
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost 
less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement using 
the following rates and bases so as to write off the cost or 
valuation of items of property, plant and equipment over 
their expected useful lives. The rates that are generally 
applicable are:
Computer hardware 50% and 100% straight line
Fixtures, fittings and equipment 25% straight line
Library books and journals 33 1/3% straight line
Motor vehicles 25% straight line
Useful economic lives and residual values are  
reviewed annually. 31 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Employee benefits
Defined contribution pension plans
Contributions paid to private pension plans of certain 
employees are charged to the income statement in the 
period in which they become payable. Contributions paid 
to the Group personal pension plans of employees are 
charged to the income statement in the period in which 
they become payable.
Share-based payment transactions
All share-based payment arrangements granted  
after 7 November 2002 that had not vested prior  
to 1 November 2006 are recognised in the  
financial statements.
All goods and services received in exchange for the grant of 
any share-based payment are measured at their fair values. 
Where employees are rewarded using share-based payments, 
the fair values of employees’ services are determined indirectly 
by reference to the fair value of the instrument granted to the 
employee. This fair value is appraised at the grant date and 
excludes the impact of non-market vesting conditions (for 
example, profitability and sales growth targets).
All equity-settled share-based payments are ultimately 
recognised as an expense in the income statement with a 
corresponding credit to the share option reserve.
If vesting periods or other non-market vesting conditions 
apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting period, 
based on the best available estimate of the number of 
share options expected to vest. Estimates are revised 
subsequently if there is any indication that the number 
of share options expected to vest differs from previous 
estimates. Any cumulative adjustment prior to vesting is 
recognised in the current period. No adjustment is made 
to any expense recognised in prior periods if share options 
that have vested are not exercised.
Upon exercise of share options, the proceeds received net 
of attributable transaction costs are credited to reserves.
Reserves
Equity comprises the following:
 > “Share premium” represents the excess over nominal 
value of the fair value of consideration received for equity 
shares, net of expenses of the share issue.
 > “Capital redemption reserve” represents when the entire 
deferred ordinary share capital was bought in exchange 
for one ordinary 1p share. 
 > “Merger reserve” which arose as a result of a Group 
reconstruction that occurred on 17 November 2000. 
This represents the issued share capital and share 
premium account in the Company’s subsidiary 
undertaking, Idox Software Limited.
 > “Share options reserve” represents shares to be issued on 
potential exercise of those share options that have been 
accounted for under “IFRS 2 Share Based Payments”.
 > “ESOP trust” represents share capital purchased to 
satisfy the liability of the employee share scheme. 
Purchased shares are classified within the ESOP trust 
reserve and presented as a deduction from total equity.
 > “Retained earnings” represents retained profits.
 > “Treasury reserve” represents shares repurchased by the 
Company to be held for redistribution as share options.
 > “Foreign currency translation reserve” represents exchange 
gains and losses on retranslation of foreign operations. 
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current 
and deferred tax. Current tax is charged to profit or loss 
except where it relates to tax on items recognised directly 
in equity, in which case it is charged to equity or other 
comprehensive income.
Current tax is the tax currently payable based on taxable 
profit for the year. 
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability 
method on temporary differences. Deferred tax is generally 
provided on the difference between the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. However, 
deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition of 
goodwill, nor on the initial recognition of an asset or liability 
unless the related transaction is a business combination or 
affects tax or accounting profit. Deferred tax on temporary 
differences associated with shares in subsidiaries is not 
provided if reversal of these temporary differences can be 
controlled by the Group and it is probable that reversal will 
not occur in the foreseeable future. In addition, tax losses 
available to be carried forward as well as other income 
credits to the Group are assessed for recognition as 
deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full, with no 
discounting. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that the underlying deductible temporary 
differences will be able to be offset against future taxable 
income. Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
calculated at tax rates that are expected to apply to their 
respective period of realisation, provided they are enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised 
as a component of tax expense in profit or loss, except 
where they relate to items that are charged or credited 
directly to other comprehensive income or equity in which 
case the related deferred tax is also charged or credited 
directly to other comprehensive income or equity. 32 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUEd
Operating leases
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks 
and rewards of ownership are classified as operating 
leases. All leases held by the Group are operating in nature. 
Amounts paid under operating leases are charged to the 
statement of comprehensive income on a straight line basis 
over the lease term.
d ividend distributions
Interim dividends in respect of equity shares are 
recognised in the financial statements in the period in 
which they are paid.
Final dividends in respect of equity shares are recognised 
in the financial statements in the period that the dividends 
are formally approved.
Foreign currency translation
The functional and presentation currency of Idox plc and 
its United Kingdom subsidiaries is the pound sterling (£). 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded 
at the functional currency rate ruling at the date of the 
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional 
currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 
All differences are taken to profit or loss.
In the consolidated financial statements, the assets and 
liabilities of non-sterling functional currency subsidiaries, 
are translated into pound sterling at the rate of exchange 
ruling at the balance sheet date. The results of non-sterling 
functional currency subsidiaries are translated into pound 
sterling using average rates of exchange. Exchange 
adjustments arising are taken to a separate component of 
equity and reported in other comprehensive income.
Capital policy
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to 
safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and 
benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain a capital 
structure that optimises the cost of capital. In order to 
maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may 
adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return 
capital to shareholders or issue new shares. 
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on 
the Group’s balance sheet when the Group has become a 
party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets
Financial assets are classified according to the substance 
of the contractual arrangements entered into. 
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are initially 
stated at their fair value, as reduced by appropriate 
allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. All 
receivables are considered for impairment. Provision 
against trade receivables is made when there is objective 
evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all 
amounts due in accordance with the original terms of those 
receivables. The amount of the write-down is determined 
as the difference between the assets carrying value and the 
present value of estimated future cash flows.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and 
on deposit and are subject to an insignificant risk of 
changes in value. 
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified 
according to the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that 
evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after 
deducting all of its financial liabilities.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded 
initially at fair value, net of direct transaction costs. Such 
instruments are subsequently carried at their amortised 
cost and finance charges, including premiums payable 
on settlement or redemption, are recognised in profit or 
loss over the term of the instrument using an effective 
rate of interest.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are not interest-bearing, are 
initially stated at their fair value and subsequently at 
amortised cost.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at 
the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
d erivative financial instruments
The Group’s activities expose the entity primarily to interest 
rate risk. The Group uses interest rate swap contracts 
to manage these exposures. The Group does not use 
derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. 
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s 
policies approved by the Board of Directors, which 
provide written principles in the use of financial derivatives. 
Derivative financial instruments are accounted for at fair 
value through profit or loss. The Group does not apply 
hedge accounting.  33 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
2 SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS
In previous periods, the Group was organised into three main operating segments. Following the acquisition and integration 
of McLaren Software Group and CT Space Group, the Group now includes an Engineering Information Management (EIM) 
segment. As at 31 October 2012, the Group is primarily organised into four main operating segments, which are detailed 
below. Segmental analysis for the comparative period to 31 October 2011 has been restated to show results for all four 
business segments. 
Financial information is reported to the chief operating decision maker, which comprises the Chief Executive Officer  
and the Chief Financial Officer, monthly on a business unit basis with revenue and operating profits split by business 
unit. Each business unit is deemed an operating segment as each offers different products and services.
 > Public Sector Software – delivering software service solutions to mainly local government customers across a broad 
range of departments
 > Engineering Information Management – delivering engineering document management and control solutions to asset 
intensive industry sectors
 > Information Solutions – delivering both an information service and consultancy services to a diverse range of customers 
across both private and public sectors
 > Recruitment – providing personnel with information, knowledge, records and content management expertise to a 
diverse range of customers
Segment revenue comprises of sales to external customers and excludes gains arising on the disposal of assets and 
finance income. Segment profit reported to the Board represents the profit earned by each segment before the allocation 
of taxation and Group related interest payments and Group corporate finance costs. The assets and liabilities of the Group 
are not reviewed by the chief operating decision maker on a segment basis.
The Group does not place reliance on any specific customer and has no individual customer that generates 10% or more 
of its total Group revenue.
The segment revenues by geographic location for the year ended 31 October 2012 are as follows:
2012

– 21 21 3
The foreign losses arise in the US and are subject to IRC s382 limitation.  
The effective tax rate was 3% (2011: 19%). The decrease is due to the recognition of a deferred tax asset in relation to 
brought forward losses of £6,960,000 and the utilisation of £2,871,000 of those losses in the current year. The tax effect of 
the utilisation of losses was a credit of £689,000 in the tax charge.
The unrelieved trading losses of £4,089,000 arising in the UK remain available to offset against future taxable trading profits. 
A deferred tax asset of £941,000 was recognised during the year in relation to these losses (see note 20). The losses were 
acquired during the prior year and were not previously recognised as a deferred tax asset. Given the high probability that the 
Group will benefit from these tax losses in the future, the deferred tax asset was recognised during the year. 40 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

Impairment test for goodwill
For this review goodwill was allocated to individual Cash Generating Units (CGU) on the basis of the Group’s operations  
as disclosed in the segmental analysis. The carrying value of goodwill by each CGU is as follows:

The recoverable amount of all CGU’s has been determined using value-in-use calculations. These calculations use pre-
tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering the next five financial years. 
The key assumptions used in the financial budgets relate to revenue and EBITDA growth targets relating to increasing 
market share and acquiring new customers. Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using the estimated growth 
rates stated below. Growth rates are reviewed in line with historic actuals to ensure reasonableness.
For value in use calculations, the growth rates and margins used to estimate future performance are based on management’s 
best estimate of short-term performance based on an assessment of market opportunities and macro-economic conditions. In 
the year to 31 October 2012 and the year to 31 October 2011, the Weighted Average Cost of Capital for the Group has been used 
as an appropriate discount rate to apply to cash flows. This represents the overall required return on the Group as a whole and is 
also considered appropriate to each CGU, except for TFPL Recruitment.
The assumptions used for the value in use calculations are as follows and are considered appropriate for each of the risk 
profiles of the respective CGU:
Cash generating unit (CGU)
Discount rate 
2012
Growth rate
 2012

TFPL Recruitment 13.0% 0% 12.5% 2%
Engineering 12.5% 2% 12.5% 2%
Individual Weighted Average Cost of Capital were calculated for each CGU and adjusted for the market’s assessment of 
the risks attaching to each CGU’s cash flows. The resultant Weighted Average Cost of Capital rates were not significantly 
different from the Group WACC and so the Group WACC was deemed reasonable to apply to all CGUs except for TFPL 
Recruitment as the actual discount rate specific to that CGU was utilised in the impairment calculation. The Weighted 
Average Cost of Capital is recalculated at each period end. 
Management considered historic performance against budget and have adjusted revenue and EBITDA growth rates. As 
a result, for the CGU TFPL Recruitment, an impairment charge of £1,000,000 has been recorded against goodwill with a 
further impairment of £18,000 against software intangibles which no longer hold any value to the Group.
Sensitivities have been run on cash flow forecasts for all CGU’s. Management are satisfied that the key assumptions of 
revenue and EBITDA growth rates are achievable and that reasonable possible changes to those key assumptions would 
not lead to the carrying amount of the relevant CGU following the impairment charge processed exceeding the recoverable 
amount. A 0% growth rate would result in the following headroom:

Growth rate 0%  
Headroom

Sensitivities have also been run on the discount rate applied and management are satisfied that, except for the CGU 
TFPL Recruitment, a reasonable increase in the discount rate would not lead to the carrying amount of the relevant CGU 
exceeding the recoverable amount. A 0.5% increase in discount rate used for CGU TFPL Recruitment would result in a 
further impairment of £19,989, however management do not consider any further impairment is required. Management  
are satisfied that except for TFPL Recruitment there is significant headroom between the value in use of each CGU and  
the carrying value of goodwill. 46 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

that no recovery of the amount owing is possible. At that point the amounts are considered irrecoverable and are written 
off against the trade receivable directly. Where trade receivables are past due an assessment is made of individual 
customers and the outstanding balance. No provision is required in respect of amounts owed by Group undertakings.

balance sheet date, the amortised cost of the term loan was £9,568,000 and during the period the loan was held the 
average interest rate paid was 4.07%.
The Group has a revolving credit facility to fund working capital requirements. At the balance sheet date, the amortised 
cost of this facility was £5,732,000 and during the period the facility was held the average interest rate paid was 3.25%.
The Group has a revolving credit facility of £10m which was made available in order to finance business acquisitions. In 
March 2012, £2.7m of this facility was drawn down in order to fund the acquisition of Opt2Vote Limited. In May 2012, £3.6m 
of this facility was drawn down in order to fund the acquisition of Currency Connect Holdings BV. In October 2012, £3.7m 
of this facility was drawn down in order to fund the acquisition of FMx Limited. The total amortised cost of the acquisition 
revolving credit facility at the year end was £9,880,000 and the average interest rate paid during the period the facility was 
held was 4.03%. 
As security for the above loans, the Bank of Scotland Plc holds a bond and floating charge over the assets of the Group, a 
composite guarantee supported by each Group company and a share pledge in respect of the entire issued share capital 
of each subsidiary company.
The Directors’ estimate that the fair value of the Group’s borrowing is not significantly different to the carrying value. 50 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

21 RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES ANd POLICIES
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise cash and cash equivalents, short-term deposits, bank borrowings 
and interest rate swaps. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to finance the Group’s operations. The 
Group has other financial instruments which mainly comprise trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly 
from its operations.
Risk management is carried out by the finance department under policies approved by the Board of Directors. The  
Group finance department identifies, evaluates and manages financial risks. The Board provides guidance on overall  
risk management including foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, and investment of excess liquidity.
The impact of the risks required to be discussed under IFRS 7 are detailed below:
Market risk
(i) Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a 
currency that is not the Group’s functional currency. The Group has minimal exposure to foreign exchange risk as a result 
of natural hedges arising between sales and cost transactions.
(ii) Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk in respect of cash balances held with banks and other highly rated counterparties.
The Group’s main interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the 
Group to cash flow interest rate risk. Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. 
During 2012 and 2011, all the Group’s borrowings at variable rate were denominated in UK Sterling. To protect cash  
flows against movements in interest rates the Group entered into an interest LIBOR swap agreement.
Credit risk
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the 
reporting date, as summarised below:
2012

Credit risk is managed on a Group basis. Credit risks arise from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and 
financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions. 
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. It is the policy of the Group to present the amounts 
in the balance sheet net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based on prior 
experience and the current economic environment. The Group reviews the reliability of its customers on a regular basis, 
such a review takes into account the nature of the Group’s trading history with the customer.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the majority of funds are held with two UK banks with high 
credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies. Management does not expect any losses from non-
performance of these counterparties.
None of the Group’s financial assets are secured by collateral or other credit enhancements. 52 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

21 RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES ANd POLICIES CONTINUE d
Liquidity risk
The Group closely monitors its access to bank and other credit facilities in comparison to its outstanding commitments on 
a regular basis to ensure that it has sufficient funds to meet obligations of the Group as they fall due.
The Board receives regular debt management forecasts which estimate the cash inflows and outflows over the next twelve 
months, so that management can ensure that sufficient financing is in place as it is required. Surplus cash within the Group 
is put on deposit in accordance with limits and counterparties agreed by the Board, the objective being to maximise return 
on funds whilst ensuring that the short-term cashflow requirements of the Group are met.
Detailed analysis of the debt facilities taken out and available to the Group are disclosed in note 18. 
As at 31 October 2012, the Group’s financial liabilities have contractual maturities (including interest payments where 
applicable) as summarised below:

Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in 
order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure 
to reduce the cost of capital. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of 
dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debts.

transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised total expenses of £731,000 (2011: £1,064,000) related to equity-settled share-based payment 
transactions during the year. Expenses of £568,000 (2011: £994,000) related to share options granted and £163,000  
(2011: £70,000) related to share options exercised.

An initial payment of €2m has been made on completion and a further €0.2m is payable one year after completion subject  
to the fulfilment of certain conditions. ID had revenues of €2.4m for the year ended 31 May 2011.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of ID has been capitalised and consists largely of the workforce value, synergies

expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The purchase of ID has been accounted for using the acquisition 
method of accounting.

1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
The accounts have been prepared in accordance with 
applicable United Kingdom accounting standards and 
under the historical cost convention.
No profit and loss account is presented for the Company 
as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act, 2006. 
A cash flow statement has not been provided as permitted 
by FRS1 (Revised) Cash Flow Statements.
FRS 20 Share-based Payment
All share-based payment arrangements granted after 
7 November 2002 that had not vested prior to 1 November 
2006 are recognised in the financial statements.
All goods and services received in exchange for the grant 
of any share-based payment are measured at their fair 
values. Where employees are rewarded using share-
based payments, the fair values of employees’ services 
are determined indirectly by reference to the fair value of 
the instrument granted to the employee. This fair value is 
appraised at the grant date and excludes the impact of 
non-market vesting conditions (for example, profitability and 
sales growth targets).
Employees to whom share options have been granted 
provide their services in subsidiary companies of Idox plc. 
All equity settled share-based payments are recognised as 
an expense in the profit and loss account of the relevant 
subsidiary company. In Idox plc, the cost is allocated to 
investments in subsidiaries.
If vesting periods or other non-market vesting conditions 
apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting period, 
based on the best available estimate of the number of 
share options expected to vest. Estimates are revised 
subsequently if there is any indication that the number 
of share options expected to vest differs from previous 
estimates. Any cumulative adjustment prior to vesting is 
recognised in the current period. No adjustment is made 
to any expense recognised in prior periods if share options 
that have vested are not exercised.
Upon exercise of share options, the proceeds received net 
of attributable transaction costs are credited to reserves.
deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised on all timing differences where 
the transactions or events that give the Company an 
obligation to pay more tax in the future, or a right to pay 
less tax in the future, have occurred by the balance sheet 
date. Deferred tax assets are recognised when it is more 
likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax is 
measured using rates of tax that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiary undertakings are 
stated at cost less provision for impairment.
Financial instruments
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified 
according to the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that 
evidences a residual interest in the assets of the entity  
after deducting all of its financial liabilities.
Where the contractual obligations of financial instruments 
(including share capital) are equivalent to a similar debt 
instrument, those financial instruments are classed as 
financial liabilities. Financial liabilities are presented as such 
in the balance sheet. Finance costs and gains or losses 
relating to financial liabilities are included in the profit and loss 
account. Finance costs are calculated so as to produce a 
constant rate of return on the outstanding liability.
Where the contractual terms of share capital do not have 
any terms meeting the definition of a financial liability then 
this is classed as an equity instrument. Dividends and 
distributions relating to equity instruments are debited 
direct to equity.
Interest and expenditure arising on financial instruments is 
recognised on the accruals basis and credited or charged 
to the profit and loss account in the financial period to 
which it relates. The Company does not apply FRS 26.
2 dIRECTOR S ANd EMPLOYEES

During the year the Company entered into one term loan and two revolving credit facilities with Bank of Scotland. At the 
balance sheet date, the amount outstanding on the term loan was £9,700,000 and during the period the loan was held the 
average interest rate paid was 4.07%.
The Company has a revolving credit facility to fund working capital requirements. At the balance sheet date, the amount 
drawn down under this facility was £5,800,000 and during the period the facility was held the average interest rate paid 
was 3.25%.
The Group has a revolving credit facility of £10m which was made available in order to finance business acquisitions. In 
March 2012, £2.7m of this facility was drawn down in order to fund the acquisition of Opt2Vote Limited. In May 2012, £3.6m 
of this facility was drawn down in order to fund the acquisition of Currency Connect Holdings BV. In October 2012, £3.7m 
of this facility was drawn down in order to fund the acquisition of FMx Limited. The total amount drawn down under this 
facility at the year end was £10m and the average interest rate paid during the period the facility was held was 4.03%. 
As security for the above loans, the Bank of Scotland Plc holds a bond and floating charge over the assets of the Group, a 
composite guarantee supported by each Group company and a share pledge in respect of the entire issued share capital 
of each subsidiary company.
The Directors’ estimate that the fair value of the Group’s borrowing is not significantly different to the carrying value.
In the current year the Group has used interest rates swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its bank 
borrowings. Contracts with notional values of £12m fix interest payments at an average rate of 1.33% for periods up until 2015.
The fair value of the interest rate swap liability at 31 October 2012 is estimated at £136,000 (2011: £Nil).

transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised total expenses of £731,000 (2011: £1,064,000) related to equity-settled share-based payment 
transactions during the year. Expenses of £568,000 (2011: £994,000) related to share options granted and £163,000  
(2011: £70,000) related to share options exercised.

The capital redemption reserve for the Group and the Company was created during 2003 when the entire deferred 
ordinary share capital was bought in exchange for one ordinary 1p share. Other reserves relate to the issued share capital 
and share premium account in the Company’s subsidiary undertaking, Idox Software Limited, and has been treated in 
accordance with FRS 6 under merger accounting. The share options reserve represents shares to be issued on potential 
exercise of those share options that have been accounted for under FRS20 (IFRS2) Share Based Payments.
The purpose of the Treasury Reserve is to enable the Board to issue share options to employees. 72 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

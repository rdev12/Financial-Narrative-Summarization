OVERVIEW OF BUSINESS
The Group’s heritage is in news 
and the printed word – through 
the Daily Mail, The Mail on 
Sunday, local and regional 
newspapers. But there’s much 
more to our story. 
It’s more than 20 years since we 
took the decision to diversify 
the business and reduce our 
reliance on UK advertising 
markets. It was a pivotal 
moment. 
DMGT in 2011 has over 12,000 
employees. It controls a 
growing portfolio of profitable 
digital businesses. B2B 
operations account for nearly 
50% of total revenue. Profitability 
has increased five-fold, with 
more than 50% of profits now 
earned in North America.
We are expanding our 
capabilities, extending our 
geographic footprint and 
strengthening our balance 
sheet. 
A CONTENT-LED GROUP
We’ve built and acquired many 
different kinds of companies to 
develop the Group, but there  
is always one common thread. 
Each depends for its prosperity 
on connecting people with 
valuable, content-rich 
information. 
With our roots in news, we 
understand what makes  
great content. We invest in 
companies that generate 
high-quality, hard-to replicate 
content and distribute it to 
people and businesses when 
they need it, in the way that 
they want it. 
Customers want real-time, 
relevant information wherever 
they happen to be. We’re 
developing apps, building 
platforms and improving the 
mobile user experience. 
Our customers are also 
co-creators. They contribute 
reviews and feedback. They 
form online communities. In the 
professional sphere, they want 
to debate industry issues and 
analyse real-time data. 
We’re engaging with 
communities in various ways. 
We are building audiences  
on multiple platforms by  
acting as a trusted partner. We 
stage global conferences and 
exhibitions. We manage social 
and professional online 
networks. And we deliver 
compelling content. 
DISTRIBUTED DECISION-
MAKING
We don’t micro-manage. We 
devolve operating decisions  
as much as possible. Strong 
financial management  
skills and systems at Group  
level allow us to monitor 
performance and underlying 
risk. This, allied to a transparent 
reporting culture, provides 
effective control and gives  
us the confidence to let our 
businesses follow their own 
paths to growth. 
Our hands-off management 
style appeals to talented 
entrepreneurs. We focus on 
giving them the right kind  
of backing, motivating them 
and rewarding initiative. 
OUR STRUCTURE 
DMGT is publicly listed on  
the London Stock Exchange. 
The founding family retains a 
significant interest and, in the 
person of our Chairman, 
executive control.
Our overriding aim is to 
maximise performance for all 
shareholders. Our family control 
status makes that easier to 
achieve. Public listing adds 
rigour – it imposes market 
disciplines and promotes best 
practice. Committed, family 
ownership adds flexibility and 
greater scope to generate 
long-term value.
ACTING RESPONSIBLY
As a Group we’ve always been 
committed to sustainable, 
long-term performance. 
Managing our businesses and 
brands responsibly, valuing our 
own people and respecting 
the communities we serve are 
essential for our own continued 
success. From this common 
starting point each of our 
business units develops 
corporate responsibility policies 
to suit its distinctive conditions.
BUILDING ON SUCCESS 
We take a portfolio approach 
to management. We invest  
for the long term in businesses 
that meet our financial and 
strategic criteria. Equally, 
where existing holdings no 
longer meet our strategic  
and financial requirements,  
we will divest. 
Ours is a growth agenda. We 
are consistently looking to build 
on and extend our market-
leading positions. We are 
generating shareholder value 
and strengthening our balance 
sheet by progressively 
enhancing the quality  
of our assets. 
DMGT continues to evolve.  
It is developing into a global 
growth company with 
sustainable earnings, a 
consistently growing dividend 
and an increasing exposure  
to high-growth markets.
DMGT is an international Group quoted 
on the London Stock Exchange. It brings 
together a portfolio of businesses operating 
in traditional media, information and 
digital markets. DMGT companies 
provide essential news and knowledge 
resources to professional and consumer 
audiences around the globe.

REPORT SUMMARY
DMGT’s core objective is 
continually to improve the 
quality of its portfolio of assets, 
thus enhancing its overall share 
rating. We are progressively 
transforming DMGT into a 
global growth company.
We have identified three 
strategic priorities in pursuit of 
this objective. Firstly, we are 
growing our B2B businesses. 
Secondly, in consumer sectors 
we support our newspapers 
and invest in digital media. 
Thirdly, we are diversifying 
internationally into high-growth 
markets. 
Four strategic pillars inform our 
approach: growth, innovation, 
efficiency and talent. 
Our businesses are managed  
to achieve sustainable growth. 
We invest in growth potential 
and focus on high-growth 
sectors. 
Innovation is a key discipline. 
We invest in product 
development and new 
technology. We promote agility 
and resilience by encouraging 
a problem-solving, can-do 
culture across the Group.
The Group allocates capital 
efficiently according to clear 
investment criteria. We subject 
all of our assets and potential 
investments to regular, rigorous 
analysis. We maintain strong 
financial discipline.
We back talent. Our 
decentralised management 
style encourages initiative. We 
reward success with 
performance-related incentives. 
DMGT is a long-term owner of a diverse 
range of high-quality media and 
information assets in both the business-
to-business (B2B) and consumer sectors. 
We build sustainable and growing 
revenue streams by providing useful 
content, information, analytics and  
events 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
OUR VISION & VALUES
We are building a global 
growth company to deliver 
sustainable earnings and 
dividend growth over the long 
term. Our distinctive values 
help us to pursue growth, while 
remaining agile and keeping a 
firm grip on performance.
Long-term view
DMGT is a permanent capital 
company. We invest in 
companies and business 
models that will generate 
value through sustained 
growth over the long term. 
Empowering people
We’re here to help people get 
things done. Within the Group, 
we back talent. In our markets, 
we equip our customers with 
relevant, topical information.
Customer focused
We take our cue from our 
customers. Our decentralised 
structure ensures that the 
people making the big 
decisions are close to their 
markets.
Integrity and quality of content
High-quality content makes 
our companies distinctive. We 
aim to deliver relevant, reliable 
and topical information that’s 
hard to find elsewhere. 
Creative, adaptable and 
innovative
We’ve built a successful 
international Group by 
challenging the status quo.  
We rely on insight and agility 
and see change as an 
opportunity.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
BUSINESS
I am pleased to report a solid 
set of results, driven by a strong 
performance from our 
international B2B companies. 
These results were achieved 
despite the impact on our UK 
consumer businesses from 
sharply higher newsprint prices 
and a weaker advertising 
environment. 
We have continued to refine 
our portfolio to optimise our 
talent and financial resources. 
In September we sold George 
Little Management, as part  
of our continuing drive to 
improve returns and in July  
we made our first significant 
acquisition for several years, 
backing Euromoney in its 
purchase of an initial 85% 
interest of Ned Davis Research 
Group. DMGT is strong both 
operationally and financially. 
Our debt has fallen further 
through strong operating cash 
flow and disposals, leaving us 
well placed to weather the 
uncertainties of the current 
Eurozone climate. We continue 
to build value and to grow 
revenues and profits.
CONTINUED GROWTH IN B2B
I again hail my father’s 
decision to diversify the DMGT 
portfolio. This year it has 
proved a masterful move. The 
percentage of operating profit 
derived from B2B is now 74% of 
the total (up from 67% last 
year) and continues to 
strengthen. A couple of 
highlights: RMS continues to 
lead their sector and this year 
they launched their new North 
America Hurricane and 
Europe Windstorm models  
that supply seamless coverage 
across 15 countries. 
dmg::events has expanded its 
presence in Saudi Arabia. 
Euromoney remains the 
game-changer in their 
industry: in August Singapore 
Mercantile Exchange 
launched the world’s first 
globally tradable iron ore 
futures contract, based on 
Euromoney’s MBIO index.
Meanwhile, our newspaper 
division remains resilient. In a 
difficult twelve months, the 
Daily Mail produced the 
strongest circulation 
performance of all national 
daily newspapers despite 
having increased its cover 
price. The Mail on Sunday 
became the largest-selling 
national Sunday newspaper 
following the closure of  
The News of the World. A 
revamped Metro is distributing 
a record number of copies, 
producing record advertising 
revenue and record profits.
MailOnline is now a global 
name and is set, I believe,  
to become the world’s most 
popular English language 
newspaper website. In 
October 2011, it recorded 79 
million unique visits of which 
25.7 million were in America 
where, with the opening of  
a New York office, we have 
expanded our operations. 
Meanwhile, MailOnline’s 
iPhone app is showing very 
exciting growth in both visitors 
and revenue. 
At Northcliffe, the future of four 
of our smallest dailies has been 
safeguarded by launching 
them as weeklies. This has 
resulted in a 50% increase  
in circulation with earnings 
totalling almost as much as 
was produced by the daily 
papers they replaced. My 
colleagues across the 
consumer businesses share  
my determination to see more 
such progress and innovation 
across all our titles.
This year more  
than ever, my  
father’s decision to 
diversify DMGT has 
proved to have been  
a masterful move.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
PRESS FREEDOM
The criminality at The News of 
the World has cast a shadow 
over the whole of the 
newspaper industry and, I 
believe, poses a greater threat 
to press freedom than has 
existed at any time in my life. 
Press freedom, of course,  
also demands ethical and 
responsible journalism – 
something, I know, the 
Editor-in-Chief of Associated 
Newspapers is committed  
to. In the ensuing battle over 
press regulation (which I firmly 
believe should result in a 
strengthened version of 
self-regulation) it is important 
not to forget that, but for a free 
press, many scandals in recent 
years, including MPs’ expenses 
and phone hacking, would not 
have been exposed. For my 
part, I continue to highlight  
the Company’s commitment 
to the importance of that 
freedom and the public’s right 
to know – something that my 
family has been dedicated to 
for over a hundred years and 
which I passionately believe is 
a cornerstone of democracy.
DIGITAL
Digital evolution continues  
in our B2B as well as B2C 
companies. In A&N Media 
there have been more than  
2.9 million downloads of their 
mobile apps and more than 
11% of Jobsite traffic comes via 
mobile. Our digital innovations 
go from strength to strength at 
Hobsons where this year they 
launched the College 
Confidential mobile app. Over 
50,000 downloads in the first 
eight months impressively 
reinforces Hobsons’ status  
as the most popular online 
college discussion forum. In 
our B2B portfolio, Quest, part  
of the Landmark Information 
Group, is revolutionising the 
speed and efficiency of 
mortgage valuations with its 
new tablet technology. And 
RMS remains at the vanguard 
of digital progression, boasting 
some of the most sophisticated 
software in the sector. These 
are just a few of our exciting 
digital initiatives.
INNOVATION AND 
TECHNOLOGY
Innovation and the 
deployment of new 
technology are the key pillars 
of DMGT’s exciting future. 
Supporting this, A&N Media 
hosted its inaugural 
technology summer school  
at Cambridge University. 
Delegates finished the  
week proposing ways that  
we might invest in innovation. 
Management teams across 
the Group are considering all 
suggestions. This forms part of 
a wider initiative whereby we 
are investing in, supporting 
and promoting innovative 
ideas and innovative people. 
Innovation and technology  
will provide the focal point for 
discussion at the Chairman’s 
Conference 2012 and the 
resulting ideas will be spread 
across the Group. We have 
launched DMGT Chatter,  
a business networking and 
collaboration tool, which is 
transforming the way our 
talented employees can share 
ideas with colleagues across 
the Group. 
OUR PEOPLE, OUR CULTURE
Selecting and retaining the 
best talent is something we 
can ensure. At RMS we have 
revolutionised the recruitment 
process, using video content 
and engaging explanations 
about prospective positions 
with a live chat function 
answering candidates’ 
questions on a real-time  
basis. Using this outstanding 
technology will help us to 
attract outstanding talent. 
The Nominations Committee 
already considers the benefits 
of diversity, including gender, 
when suggesting Board 
appointments. The 
appointment of women is one 
issue. Of equal importance is

technology are key to

in positions elsewhere within 
our businesses. As a major 
international employer, we  
are pleased that below Board 
level women account for a 
significant portion of our 
workforce – in some businesses, 
for more than half of our staff, 
including senior leadership 
positions.
The year has seen changes on 
the Board. In January, we 
welcomed Stephen Daintith, 
our new Finance Director to 
the Company and in February, 
we were fortunate to be joined 
on the Board by Dominique 
Trempont, whose appointment 
has brought considerable 
technology and international 
experience to it. In March we 
said goodbye to Peter Williams, 
our Finance Director since 
1991. Charles Dunstone has 
indicated that he will not stand 
for re-election to the Board at 
the AGM in February. He has 
provided us with sound advice 
over his ten years as an 
independent non-executive 
Director. I shall miss him.
At DMGT, we believe that  
our people are our future. We 
have the right people to make 
that future a success.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
DMGT’s Philosophy
DMGT is a multi-media  
and information company 
providing essential news, 
entertainment and information 
services in both the business to 
business (B2B) and consumer 
sectors. We operate in many 
different markets, in many 
countries, each with its own 
competitive and regulatory 
requirements. 
It has been DMGT’s philosophy 
for many years to take 
advantage of its shareholding 
structure and to invest with  
a long-term perspective to 
generate value. Our particular 
ownership structure, with 
control maintained by the 
founding family, has proved 
itself throughout our long 
history to be a successful 
business model in the media 
and information industry. It is 
this ownership structure that 
affords us a longer-term 
perspective and that is at  
the heart of our philosophy.
We are committed to 
remaining diversified across 
both the B2B and consumer 
media sectors in order to give 
us a breadth of opportunities 
and to spread risk. Our B2B  
arm is made up of Risk 
Management Solutions (RMS), 
dmg::information, dmg::events 
and Euromoney Institutional 
Investor. Our consumer media 
activities comprise within A&N 
Media Mail Newspapers, our 
digital-only businesses, our free 
newspaper division, principally 
Metro, and Northcliffe Media. 
We also own 50% of dmg Radio 
Australia, a joint venture. 
Strategy
The overarching strategy for 
the Group is to remain the 
owner of high quality, 
sustainable, market-leading 
media and information assets 
across both the B2B and 
consumer sectors and to 
improve DMGT’s overall share 
rating. Our intention is for DMGT 
to become a truly global 
growth company with 
sustainable earnings and

dividend growth, with an 
increasing exposure to growth 
economies and international 
opportunities. 
Last year I stated that our 
strategy is underpinned by five 
guiding tasks, which are still all 
relevant today, but this year I 
have added a sixth, and that  
is technology innovation.
The first is to enhance focus  
by concentrating our 
management and investment 
on a subset of businesses 
where we see the closest 
alignment between 
opportunities and growth, and 
which fit with our investment 
criteria. 
Secondly, we have been 
strengthening our balance 
sheet in order to maintain 
financial flexibility so that we 
are able to take advantage  
of opportunities as they arise. 
The third key priority has been 
to reduce pension liabilities. 
The fourth is applying 
consistent investment criteria. 
This requires being highly 
disciplined both in regularly 
assessing our current 
businesses and in the way we 
assess all future investments, 
resulting in a clear capital 
allocation process. There is  
a preparedness to sell as well 
as to buy on a timely basis. 
The fifth is building on  
DMGT’s distinct values and 
management philosophy.  
We remain committed to  
a decentralised operating 
structure with a small  
central team in order to 
nurture innovation and an 
entrepreneurial mind set.  
We have been raising the bar 
on talent by being committed 
to attracting and retaining  
the best people in order to 
optimise our management 
philosophy and to meet  
our global growth ambitions. 
Our work on talent remains 
critical in order to have the 
entrepreneurially minded 
people who can drive the 
revenue line and our strategic 
ambitions.
The sixth task, to which we are 
dedicating increased 
attention, is ensuring that we 
are making the necessary 
changes to embrace new 
technologies to meet 
changing customer needs and 
to improve efficiency and to 
lower costs.
Progress in year
We have made good progress 
in pursuit of our strategy over 
the last twelve months. We 
have narrowed further the 
range of companies DMGT 
operates to concentrate 
financial and talent resources 
where growth opportunities 
are greatest. We have 
repaired our balance sheet by 
achieving a high profit to cash 
conversion, through active 
portfolio management and by 
extending our bank facilities 
out to 2016. We have focused 
strongly on operational 
efficiency throughout the 
Group. We have negotiated  
a medium-term funding 
arrangement with the pension 
fund trustees and have made 
inroads towards curtailing our 
pension liabilities. We are 
looking at ways of reducing 
the schemes’ volatility. We 
have applied our clearly 
articulated set of criteria  
for making investments. We 
have elevated the priority 
given to talent and launched 
a new leadership programme.  
We have improved 
communication both internally 
and externally. We are 
developing a long-term plan 
for international growth as part 
of our ambition to create a 
truly global company and we 
invested additional resources 
to execute against this plan. 
Finally, we are pursuing a 
number of DMGT Group-wide 
initiatives in the technology 
area.
My summary of this year’s 
progress should be seen as a 
testament to our unwavering 
commitment to the strategy 
we set out last year.
DMGT Operational Model
DMGT’s approach to 
managing the Group’s 
companies has not changed: 
we continue to adopt a 
decentralised structure. We 
take a considerable amount of 
comfort in the fact that we 
know all our companies are 
run by chief executives with 
expert knowledge of the 
markets in which they operate. 
We have continued to nurture 
operational autonomy with 
strong incentives based on 
performance, whilst retaining 
central control over surplus 
capital and its reinvestment. 
Maintaining this approach  
is of the upmost importance  
to me and my colleagues. The 
benefits are numerous and 
enabled us to respond rapidly 
to the economic downturn. At 
DMGT we realise that if you 
want to survive in this sector, 
you must be able to react 
quickly and efficiently to the 
rapidly changing media world. 
Autonomous management 
keeps decision-making  
close to the customer. Real 
innovation comes from having 
a customer focus. Our 
decentralised model provides 
a fertile environment for 
innovative people and, in turn, 
a positive breeding ground for 
innovative ideas.
At Group level, the Investment 
and Finance Committee  
works alongside the DMGT 
Leadership Team, making 
decisions on investment and 
capital allocation, acting 
independently from the 
divisions, and overseeing 
Group strategy development. 
The Leadership Team 
comprises all the divisional 
company leaders, together 
with the DMGT executive. Its 
remit is to focus on developing 
DMGT Group-wide longer-term 
strategy, on furthering 
cross-Group co-operation 
when and where this makes 
sense, and to guide policy on 
cross-divisional matters, for 
example Group leadership 
courses, communications, 
international expansion  
and aspects of technical 
capability. It does not replace 
the decision making and 
accountability structures  
in place through our 
decentralised operating 
structure.
We are developing 
DMGT into a truly 
global growth company, 
with sustainable 
earnings, consistent 
dividend growth and 
increasing exposure  
to high growth 
economies.
Our decentralised 
model provides a fertile 
environment for 
innovative people and 
a positive breeding 
ground for innovative 
ideas.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW continued
On compensation, we do not 
apply a ‘one size fits all’ policy. 
This is a big strength, reflecting 
the value of the decentralised 
model. A series of templates 
has been created. Local 
incentive plans are in place 
and the Remuneration 
Committee takes care to 
ensure that compensation is 
aligned with the particular 
circumstances of each 
business. 
Information sharing and 
technology
We recognise that our future  
is largely digital, whether it be 
in the consumer or in B2B 
markets, and we are uniquely 
placed to take key learnings 
and experience from one to 
inform the other. Accordingly, 
we have encouraged the 
sharing of more information 
regarding technological 
developments across the 
Group, particularly regarding 
new product development 
and entering new markets.  
We launched DMGT Chatter, 
which already serves as an 
excellent pan-Group idea 
sharing tool. We have made 
more use of the services of Bill 
Raduchel, our technology 
expert, to advise us at Group 
level during the year. Last  
year I reported that since 
technology defines our 
businesses, driving the 
presentation of content, we 
had carried out a study of 
technology systems and what 
our future requirements would 
be. During the year we started 
taking actions based on this 
analysis. A further example of 
information sharing is in the 
establishment this year of an 
energy forum, under the 
guidance of David Dutton, 
which has gained excellent 
traction by putting executives 
from dmg::information, 
dmg::events and Euromoney 
together to exchange ideas.
Active portfolio 
management
When I became Chief 
Executive in 2008, I recognised 
the need to focus on a 
narrower range of activities in 
order to concentrate human 
resources and financial capital 
where the most potential for 
long-term growth and value 
creation existed. I stated that 
we would remain active 
managers of our portfolio  
of businesses and apply our 
investment criteria vigorously 
in determining where to 
allocate capital. At the same 
time we would maintain our 
long-term perspective and 
rate of internal investment to 
drive organic growth. 
The investment criteria that  
I identified were to focus  
on having businesses which 
operate in attractive growth 
markets. Such businesses should 
have products or services  
that are highly innovative  
and highly valued, ones which 
customers repeat buy. We 
have a strong bias towards 
market leaders. Businesses with 
these characteristics will not 
only grow but be high margin, 
cash generative and produce 
a high return on capital. We 
are also focused on capturing 
and retaining entrepreneurial 
management and we give 
preference to businesses  
which can benefit from DMGT’s 
long-term perspective. 
We have fully adopted these 
investment criteria both in  
new investments and in the 
management of currently 
owned businesses. In keeping 
with this approach, we have 
further refocused the portfolio 
with a range of disposals and 
reorganisations.
As well as maintaining our 
focus on organic growth  
and on nurturing our existing 
businesses, we have also 
made a significant acquisition 
in July, backing Euromoney  
in its acquisition of an 85% 
interest in Ned Davis Research 
Group, the US-based provider 
of independent financial 
research to institutional 
investors. We are keen on 
bolt-on acquisitions to 
strengthen the competitive 
position of our businesses: and 
dmg information have made a 
further attractive acquisition, 
that of On-Geo for Landmark 
which has now been 
combined with its Inframation 
business to give Landmark a 
market leading position in the 
German market. 
We have also made a number 
of disposals of businesses 
which had become non-core. 
These were RMSI, the Indian-
based geographic information 
services division of Risk 
Management Solutions, 
Sanborn, dmg::information’s 
business serving the geospatial 
market in the USA, and 
dmg::events’ US retail-focused 
events managed by George 
Little Management (GLM). We 
also disposed of 
dmg::information’s stake in 
CoStar Group, Inc, acquired in 
exchange for Property & 
Portfolio Research in July 2009. 
Combined with our strong 
operating cash flow 
generation, this has reduced 
our debt significantly. We are 
now in a good position to 
make further acquisitions,  
but will continue our policy  
to prioritise a programme of 
selective smaller scale deals 
which we can develop and 
which can benefit from our 
longer-term perspective.  
We will continue to divest on  
a periodic basis where our 
track record over recent years 
is good.
Review of the year
DMGT has delivered a solid  
set of results. Our international 
B2B companies have again 
increased their revenues  
and adjusted profits,  
reflecting the strength of  
their market positions. Our  
UK consumer businesses have 
proved resilient in the face of 
weak consumer advertising, 
particularly in the third quarter, 
and taken together with higher 
newsprint prices, resulted in 
profits being down sharply for 
the year. There has been a 
strong focus on operational 
efficiency throughout the 
Group and we have sought 
further cost savings, 
particularly through the 
decision to relocate our  
Surrey Quays printing 
operation to a green-field  
site in Thurrock, Essex. 
Notwithstanding the fact that 
operating profit fell by 5% and 
operating margin from 15% to 
We are embracing new 
technologies to meet 
changing customer 
needs and improve 
efficiency. 
Our energy forum  
has gained excellent 
traction. It’s bringing 
together executives  
to exchange ideas.  15

14%, our debt has fallen 
significantly. We have beaten 
our debt: ebitda target range 
of 2 to 2.5 times and have 
eliminated bank debt. We now 
have cash on deposit. We 
have maintained our rate of 
investment in new products 
and services during the year. 
DMGT has always been a  
first mover in the media and 
information industry. Our results 
demonstrate once again the 
success of the decision to 
diversify and move away from 
a dependence on UK 
newspapers. But at the same 
time our national newspapers 
have strengthened further 
their market-leading positions. 
We are experiencing growth in 
our newer consumer digital 
business and in our strong 
grouping of B2B sector 
companies. 
Business to Business 
Summary
I am pleased to report that our 
B2B operations achieved good 
growth in the year. They 
reported combined revenues 
of £892 million, 8% higher than 
last year, with an underlying 
increase of 10%. Operating 
profit was up by 4%. The 
underlying increase, including 
adjusting for an additional 
charge for Euromoney’s 
management incentive 
scheme, was 14%. The overall 
B2B margin was 25%.
Risk Management Solutions
RMS had a solid year of 
revenue and profit growth. 
Revenues increased by 4%  
on a reported basis, with an 
underlying increase of 11%. 
Operating profit rose by 6% in 
spite of the inclusion of RMSI’s 
£4 million loss up until its 
disposal in August; underlying 
profit grew by 21%. 
Subscriptions continued to 
grow well, with a renewal rate 
of approximately 95%.
RMS has multiple growth 
drivers. Whilst continuing to 
focus primarily on in its core 
commercial catastrophe 
modelling business, it is aiming 
to establish itself as a platform 
solution provider, beginning a 
significant development 
programme on a new software 
platform, which is expected to 
generate future, multi-year 
revenue growth, as explained 
on page 24. The company  
also made good progress  
in addressing opportunities  
to model additional risk 
categories, mostly in the  
area of life and health.
dmg::information
dmg::information had a good 
year, with reported revenue up 
3%. Underlying revenues grew  
by 7%, which is a good 
performance given the 
economic backdrop. 
Operating profits were 
unchanged, but with an 
underlying increase of 9%  
year-on-year.
dmg::information’s strategy 
remains focused on investing in 
those companies within the 
existing portfolio which 
operate in an attractive sector 
and have the combination of 
attractive business models, 
strong market positions, growth 
potential and good 
management. Its ambition to 
invest in must-have, high-
growth, innovative business 
information companies 
remains unchanged, as does 
its remit to diversify DMGT by 
sector, by business model and 
by geography. 
dmg::events 
dmg::events had a very good 
year with both underlying 
revenues and underlying 
profits increasing by 14%. The 
strong momentum that started 
in the latter half of 2010 has 
continued through the past 
year due to exhibitions and 
events being late-cycle 
media. The reported revenues 
and profits benefited from two 
of our large biennial shows 
taking place in the year. The 
sale of GLM was completed  
in September. 
The remediation phase has 
been completed by ‘right-
sizing’ the portfolio and 
reinvesting in the ongoing 
events. The business is now 
moving into its third phase of 
sustainable, profitable growth. 
This will involve continued 
portfolio management, the 
driving of new launches by 
building off the big shows in 
Energy and the Middle East. 
With respect to the latter,  
there have been several new 
launches including new shows 
in Saudi Arabia and organic 
investment. The Ad:Tech 
business in digital marketing is 
growing strongly as is Evanta in 
executive conferences. dmg 
events will also look to make 
selected targeted small 
acquisitions.
Euromoney Institutional 
Investor
Euromoney’s operating profit 
was up 9%, before its capital 
appreciation plan (CAP) 
expenses, maintaining its 
impressive recent history of 
profits growth, illustrated on 
page 30. 
These results confirm the value 
of Euromoney’s strategy to 
build a more resilient and 
better focused business by 
increasing the proportion  
of revenues derived from 
subscription products. With 
subscriptions now accounting 
for nearly a half of total 
revenues. A predominantly 
publishing driven business has 
been transformed to one with 
significant activities in 
electronic information and 
database services. 
Euromoney has outperformed 
expectations, allowing 
management to shift its focus 
to positioning the business  
for growth, both from existing 
products as markets recover, 
and from investment in 
technology and new products. 
Euromoney’s performance 
and its shift into more 
subscription and digital activity 
and its global reach mean that 
the Board regards it as core to 
DMGT’s own strategic global 
growth ambitions. 
Euromoney’s separate listing 
on the London Stock Exchange 
has enabled it to introduce 
incentive plans which have 
motivated management  
to grow the company 
significantly over recent years. 
We remain a supportive 
shareholder, fully backing its 
management’s expansion 
DMGT has always 
been a first mover  
in the media and 
information industry.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW continued
strategy. We have maintained 
our equity interest at around 
67% and are taking opportunities 
to increase it, as they arise. 
Consumer media
At A&N Media, the testing 
economic conditions adversely 
affected both Northcliffe’s 
classified revenues and the 
Mail titles’ display advertising 
revenues. Combined revenues 
were £1,098 million, an 
underlying decrease of 2%  
and a fall of 4% on a reported 
basis. Together with discounted 
cover price-related marketing 
activity for The Mail on Sunday, 
and a further increase in the 
price of newsprint, this meant 
that operating profits 
decreased by 20%. The pursuit 
of cost efficiencies in shared 
back office functions and 
service centres continued 
during the year. A&N Media’s 
underlying margin fell from 11% 
to 8%. Headcount reduced by 
740 (10%).
A drive for efficiency has 
delivered a leaner and more 
robust base on which to grow. 
Alongside this, investment 
continues in new and emerging 
business models, particularly 
MailOnline which is key to 
future growth, and A&N Media 
Enterprises, which sells 
products and services directly 
to customers.
Consumers are increasingly 
adopting new mobile devices 
to access digitally delivered 
news, entertainment and 
information. Advertising is 
following this trend, moving 
away from printed press. But 
the growth in the number of 
55+ aged newspaper readers 
has softened the readership 
decline for the Daily Mail which 
continues to outperform the 
market. MailOnline grew 
rapidly and increased its global 
reach, positioning us well to 
capture share of digital 
advertising. 
Associated Newspapers 
The Mail titles, despite 
operating in a sector in 
long-term decline, is and will 
be a core business for many 
years to come and will 
continue to offer real growth 
opportunities, by building off 
the strength of the brand, for 
example, through MailOnline 
which has significant growth 
opportunities ahead of it. 
Content has been at the heart 
of our success at Associated 
and we continue to invest in 
editorial quality. The graph on 
page 35 shows that our actions 
are delivering success with 
circulation relatively stable 
and market share rising. This 
was due in part to the success 
of the Mail Rewards Club 
initiative.
Our national free morning 
newspaper, Metro, increased 
its distribution and advertising 
volumes. It extended into new 
advertising categories and 
reported record profits. It also 
grew its digital offering. 
Mail Digital made further 
progress this year, recording a 
63% improvement in revenue. 
Traffic to its primary website, 
MailOnline, increased 
significantly, largely through its 
targeting of the US market. We 
opened an office in New York, 
alongside that in Los Angeles, 
aimed at increasing US 
content, audience and 
thereby driving US advertising 
sales. This has contributed 
towards a 62% year-on-year 
increase in US daily unique 
visitors in October 2011. 
On a global basis, MailOnline 
became the world’s second 
most visited English language 
newspaper website. It is 
differentiated in the UK from 
the Mail newspapers by its 
particular treatment of news 
and entertainment, which 
appeals to a younger 
demographic, the majority  
of whom do not buy a Mail 
newspaper. An iPad version 
was launched in April, 
alongside our iPhone and  
iPod Touch versions. We see 
digital publishing as a growth 
opportunity, and a means of 
extending the Mail brand. 
Whilst MailOnline is growing 
audience we expect to retain 
our policy of free access. Our 
approach to distribution 
channels and pricing remains 
flexible. 
Digital-only businesses 
Our digital-only verticals in the 
jobs, property, motors and 
travel markets increased 
underlying revenues by 5%.  
The recruitment and property 
sectors both grew strongly, 
offset by challenging markets 
in motors and travel. In 
October 2011, A&N Media 
agreed to merge the online 
property business of its Digital 
Property Group with Zoopla 
Limited. This merger will create 
a genuine opportunity to 
challenge the dominant 
market leader in the online 
property sector. We believe 
that the combination of our 
respective digital property 
assets will benefit both 
consumers and clients. Under 
the proposed merger, A&N 
Media will retain a 55% interest 
in the newly merged entity. The 
completion of the merger is 
subject to competition 
authority clearance.
Northcliffe Media
Northcliffe’s titles continued  
to be affected by weak 
advertising markets, with total 
revenues down by 10%. In 
March, we appointed Steve 
Auckland, formerly Managing 
Director of Metro to be 
responsible for Northcliffe’s 
print publishing, with Roland 
Bryan running the local digital 
operations including the Local 
People business. A programme 
to extract further efficiencies 
and reduce costs was initiated 
including a re-organisation 
and simplification of the 
management structure. A 
review of the portfolio was 
carried out resulting in a 
rationalisation of the number 
of free newspapers published 
and the creation of one 
recruitment call centre for  
the whole business. Where 
profitable we are switching 
some daily titles to weekly 
publications and four such 
changes were made 
successfully. In Hull, 
Nottingham and Bristol  
new publishers have been 
appointed to enable these 
centres better to adapt  
to their individual market 
circumstances. 
Investment continues 
in new and emerging 
business models, 
particularly 
MailOnline. 17

DMGT ‘A’
FTSE All-Share Index
We have again demonstrated 
the benefits of our diversified 
international portfolio of 
market-leading businesses. 
Our priorities
The environment in which we 
operate remains unsettled,  
just as it was this time last year. 
In light of our performance,  
we continue to apply the  
same priorities. We remain 
disciplined about our 
approach to costs and 
acquisitions, whilst continuing 
to work on building a pipeline 
of new innovative products, 
and in growing a target list of 
attractive bolt-on acquisitions. 
Given the significant prevailing 
economic uncertainties, we 
will run the Group with the 
utmost prudence.
At our first Investor Day in 
March 2009, I stated that our 
aim for DMGT was to be a 
modern company of 
tomorrow, not a legacy 
company of the past. We  
have a much sounder platform 
today than we did then  
on which to execute this 
objective, due to the 
management actions taken 
right across the Group, and 
from the recovery in a number 
of key markets. Therefore our 
strategy remains unchanged.
Whilst we believe print is far 
from dead, our growth lies in 
digital media in both consumer 
and in B2B, and we are 
increasingly focused on doing 
what is needed to excel in the 
digital world.
We envisage DMGT becoming 
a more global and faster 
growing company. We plan to 
be nimble, bold and decisive 
in order to realise this vision. 
Our objective is to ensure 
profitable sustainable growth 
over the long term.
Share price performance
Our share performance 
remains important to us as an 
indicator as to whether our 
strategy is understood and 
appreciated by institutional 
investors.
The price of our widely traded 
‘A’ Ordinary Non-Voting Shares 
has again been volatile, 
despite stock lending of the 
shares reducing significantly 
below 5% of the free float. The 
share price started the 
financial year at £5.26, rising to 
a high of £5.95 at the start of 
February. The shares fell as low 
as £3.43 in September, due 
largely to external factors 
outside our control, before 
closing the year at £3.63. 
As explained in last year’s 
Business Review, as a 
consequence of a decision  
by FTSE, in response to the 
Financial Services Authority’s 
Policy Notice in February 2010, 
to adopt listing classifications 
for determining the weighting 
of share classes in their indices, 
DMGT’s weighting in the UK 
Index Series will fall from 75%  
to 0% when our ‘A’ shares are 
redesignated by the FSA as 
having a standard listing on 
31st May, 2012. DMGT will 
remain a premium listed 
company, following this 
change, by virtue of its 
Ordinary shares. Pure index 
funds tend to hold only around 
5% of our ‘A’ shares.
New advertising packages 
and sales campaigns have 
been introduced to improve 
revenue growth. 
The much-mooted talk of 
potential consolidation within 
the regional newspaper 
industry has not yet come 
about. Whilst we can see 
benefits from consolidation, 
the Board has decided not to 
put further capital into the 
regional newspaper industry 
because of the more certain 
potential of other opportunities 
for investment. We remain 
committed to the continuing 
transformation of Northcliffe 
because we believe there will 
always be a demand for local 
news and information. Our 
attempt to safeguard the 
future of some of Northcliffe’s 
titles in Kent by selling them to 
the Kent Messenger Group was 
thwarted by the Office of Fair 
Trading which referred the 
sales to the Competition 
Commission for further 
investigation causing the 
acquirer to withdraw. We 
believe it is now imperative 
that changes are made to 
allow the industry to 
consolidate in a way that can 
safeguard its future.
A&N International Media
Whilst print advertising 
declined, circulation and 
digital revenues both grew, as 
did the audience visiting our 
digital businesses. Headcount 
has been reduced and 
significant savings made. 
Summary
The Group’s B2B companies 
increased their overall profit by 
4%, which was offset by the 
profits of A&N Media being 
down 20%. As a consequence, 
74% of this year’s operating 
profit was generated from the 
Group’s B2B operations and 
26% from consumer, compared 
to 67% and 33% last year. A 
significant part of our 
operations and more than half 
of the Group’s operating profits 
again derived from outside the 
UK, which also has the effect 
of reducing the Group’s 
exposure to media regulation.

Capital structure
The Company has not made a 
capital call on its shareholders 
since 1933. Capital growth is 
funded by long-term debt and 
by retained earnings. Since the 
late 1980s, our strategy has 
been to seek to raise the 
dividend in real terms and 
since 2002, the Board’s policy 
has been to target a real rate 
of growth in the dividend in  
the region of 5% to 7% on  
the basis of the Directors’ 
confidence in the Group’s 
long-term financial health. 
Whilst maintaining its policy of 
seeking to increase the 
dividend in real terms over the 
economic cycle, the Board 
has declared a final dividend 
up 6%, making an increase of 
6% for the year. As shown 
above, the compound 
dividend growth over the last 
23 years is 10% in nominal 
terms, which is an increase of 
7% in real terms. 
As we now have surplus cash, 
we will look to buy back any 
available bonds, especially 
those due for repayment in 
March 2013, at the right price. 
On 30th September, we 
repurchased £25 million of our 
Bonds due 2018. Share buy 
backs are not currently 
attractive, given our strategy 
to grow the business, the 
scarcity of available capital 
and our desire to regain 
investment grade status. They 
will be considered, however, at 
the time any major acquisition 
is contemplated. We envisage 
repaying our 2013 Bonds from 
our cash resources. Containing 
and eventually eliminating 
significant liability risk and 
volatility from our pension 
schemes remains a high 
priority. 
By the year end, we had 
eliminated bank debt and 
have £328 million of unused 
bank facilities. Having 
comfortably stayed within our 
debt: ebitda limit of 2.4 times 
by achieving a ratio of 1.99 
times, we will continue to 
manage the ratio down 
through strong cash flow 
generation, in order to create 
more capacity to satisfy 
attractive acquisition and 
investment opportunities. 
Whilst we can run the Group 
without having to raise new 
finance, we will want to do so 
in order to sustain the Group’s 
long-term growth ambitions. 
Therefore regaining investment 
grade status remains an 
important objective.
Resources 
The Group’s main resources 
are its brands, reputation, the 
market-leading position of its 
major businesses and above 
all its people. I realise that the 
skills required of leaders in our 
industry ten years ago are not 
the same today. Superior 
business performance starts 
with superior people. We 
cannot capitalise on the future 
unless we invest in the talent  
of today, in the leaders of 
tomorrow. It is my overriding 
priority to ensure that we 
continue to attract and 
promote the very best talent 
and reward talent suitably  
in line with shareholders’ 
interests. 
Our commitment to raising the 
bar on talent is continuing and 
increasingly effective, 
applying human capital where 
growth prospects are best. Two 
DMGT-wide executive training 
courses were held and talent 
reviews are taking root in every 
business.
We made several further key 
appointments in order to 
populate the Group with new 
superior talent, from both 
within and outside the Group. 
At Group level, Stephen 
Daintith joined us in January, 
succeeding Peter Williams as 
Finance Director at the end of 
March. We hired Galen Poss in 
December 2010 to the newly 
created role of Chief 
Operating Officer of 
dmg::events. 
Communications
We continue our commitment 
to raise the profile of DMGT 
and communicate the quality, 
performance and prospects of 
the Group, both internally and 
externally. We have increased 
the regularity and consistency 
of our communications. Our 
Investor Day in March was 
positively received. We are 
planning a further Investor Day 
to be held in London on 18th 
April, 2012.
A variety of approaches to 
staff communications exist 
within the Group, as explained 
in our CR report. In September, 
we launched a business 
collaboration tool called 
Chatter, which encourages 
staff to share ideas and 
enables communication  
on a Group-wide basis. 
Stakeholder relationships 
and Corporate Responsibility 
Across the Group we take 
corporate responsibility (CR) 
seriously and it permeates our 
outlook on the environment, 
the way we treat our 
employees, our customers and 
suppliers, as well as on local 
community issues.  19

DMGT companies are 
combining innovation and 
business knowledge to further 
corporate responsibility issues. 
Metro’s inaugural four-day 
EcoVelocity event at Battersea 
Power station in London is a 
case in point. The event 
focused on low-carbon 
motoring and showcased the 
latest low emission vehicles 
from leading manufacturers. 
We recognise that our 
businesses have an impact  
on the environment, be  
that through our printing 
operations, offices, transport  
or other activities. We are truly 
committed to ensuring that, 
where possible, our impact on 
the environment is minimised. 
The greatest impact we  
make arises from our printing 
operations. Here, I am pleased 
to say that we have been 
diligent in measuring and 
reducing waste in our usage  
of materials, and through  
our analysis of our carbon 
footprint, monitoring and 
improving our efficiency in the 
use of energy. 
We started to measure our 
footprint in 2006 and the graph 
shown below illustrates that the 
Group’s emissions have fallen 
steadily since then. 
At Harmsworth Quays, our 
largest printing plant, and 
Northcliffe House, the 
Company’s headquarters and 
the London base of Associated 
Newspapers, Northcliffe  
Media and dmg::events, we 
maintained the key 
international environmental 
standard ISO 14001. 
Community involvement is 
integral to the way we run our 
company, as is its importance 
to the personal motivation of 
our employees. We donate 
money, time and in-kind 
donations such as advertising 
space, and staff participate in 
a huge range of activities, 
including fundraising, 
organising events and acting 
as trustees to charitable 
initiatives. 
Over the last six months there 
has been a considerable 
amount of public discussion 
about the conduct and 
regulation of the press and the 
launch of the Leveson Inquiry. 
At DMGT, our journalists have 
for a number of years received 
regular training and 
communications on the PCC 
Code of Practice (which 
forbids telephone hacking), 
the Data Protection Act and, 
most recently, on the UK 
Bribery Act. Furthermore, it is a 
condition of employment (and 
is written into employment 
contracts) that our journalists 
comply with the PCC Code 
and the Data Protection Act 
and now includes compliance 
with the Bribery Act, following 
its introduction on 1st July. Any 
breach of the Code or the law 
is a serious disciplinary matter 
that results in immediate 
dismissal. Thus the tone from 
the top and culture at 
Associated Newspapers has 
always made it clear that 
compliance in these areas is 
non-negotiable.
There have been comments  
in the media on the Mail titles’ 
use of ‘inquiry agents’. In  
the 2006 ‘What Price Privacy’ 
report, the Information 
Commissioner expressed 
concerns about the 
widespread use of ‘inquiry 
agents’ by many organisations. 
It would seem that, for  
the most part, it related  
to the tracing of individuals. 
Following this report, the 
Associated Newspapers 
Editor-in-Chief, banned  
the use of ‘inquiry agents’. 
In the context of these 
measures, the Editor-in-Chief, 
Paul Dacre, was able to inform 
a Parliamentary Committee  
in July that he had never 
countenanced hacking or 
blagging and the Daily Mail 
has never published a story 
that he knew, either at the 
time or subsequently, was 
based on a hacked message 
or any other source of material 
that had been obtained 
unlawfully. 
In August, the Risk Committee 
and Paul Dacre initiated an 
internal review of editorial 
policy and process. This  
review was conducted by  
the Head of Editorial Legal 
Services. It considered editorial 
policies, ethics, training, 
communications and 
payments. This was a routine 
assessment which was seen as 
a sensible step to reconfirm 
and give comfort that 
appropriate policies and 
procedures exist over our 
editorial practices. The review 
was discussed by the Risk 
Committee of the Board, as 
explained in the Risk 
Committee section of the 
Corporate Governance Report 
on pages 59 and 60. 
A further important part of  
our overall culture and control 
environment is the DMGT  
Code of Conduct, which we 
require all our staff to follow. 
This was updated, particularly 
in light of the Bribery Act, and 
re-communicated to all staff  
in July.

on our CR activities, please

44 to 47.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW continued
DMGT and our Employees 
The number of employees fell 
by 2,590 from 14,592 at the 
beginning of the year to 12,002 
at the year end, a decrease of 
18%. Of this reduction, 2,253 
was due to disposals, 
principally within RMS’s India 
operations. Excluding 
acquisitions and disposals and 
with a continued focus on cost 
reduction, the number of 
employees fell by 472 in the 
year. Within this number there 
was a fall within A&N Media of 
740 (10%), mainly due to further 
job losses at Northcliffe Media 
of 601 people (19%), while the 
principal increases were from 
the acquisitions of Ned Davis 
Research and On-Geo . 
The Company attaches  
great importance to a clear 
understanding of personal 
financial issues by its 
employees, a view which led 
to the development by DMGT 
Pensions of an online 
workplace financial 
information website (www.
timeformoney.co.uk) in the 
prior year. It is early days for 
this innovative facility but there 
are interesting possibilities for 
this application in supporting 
broader financial 
communications to employees 
by the Group.
In the first quarter of 2012, we 
plan to relaunch our share 
incentive plan, DMGT 
SharePurchase+, which is 
available to all eligible UK staff 
to give them the opportunity 
to own the Company’s shares, 
so that they can benefit if we 
are successful in meeting our 
financial objectives.
DMGT has been operating 
defined benefit pension 
schemes, primarily in its 
newspaper businesses, for a 
long time and has a reputation 
for the quality of pension 
provision. However, the cost of 
providing this benefit continues 
to rise as people are expected 
to live longer and, more 
recently, as turmoil in financial 
markets has reduced 
expected investment returns. 
In addition, regulatory 
changes introduced to  
protect pensioners make it  
less attractive to use defined 
benefit pension provision  
as a form of remuneration.
Given the value of the 
Company’s defined benefit 
pension commitments 
compared to the current 
market valuation of the Group, 
this cost needs to be controlled 
to ensure the financial health 
of the Company and these 
pension schemes. So, having 
previously closed its defined 
benefit schemes to new 
employees, the Board 
introduced a series of 
measures during the year  
to help secure the financial 
health of these plans into  
the future. These were 
communicated to relevant 
staff in December 2010  
and introduced, following 
consultation, on 1st April.  
All members of the schemes 
retain benefits accrued to  
that date which are increased 
in line with the Retail Price 
Index up to 5%. From 1st April 
onwards, the link to final salary 
has been broken and they 
earn a cash credit on the basis 
of their current year’s salary 
which increases in line with  
the Consumer Price index.
All new employees of A&N 
Media are now being offered 
a defined contribution pension 
plan, which has brought this 
division into line with our other 
newer and more 
internationally focused 
divisions where we have long 
believed this type of pension 
plan to be more appropriate.
Outlook
We have entered our new 
financial year with our 
businesses performing well and 
in line with our expectations. 
We expect underlying growth 
in revenue and profit to be 
delivered by all our B2B 
companies, A&N Media’s 
progress will be primarily 
dependent on the advertising 
environment which remains 
volatile and difficult, and on 
cost reduction. As referred  
to earlier the degree of 
economic uncertainty, 
especially in Europe, makes 
forecasting especially difficult 
and may well negatively 
impact our current 
expectations.
RMS has started the year 
strongly with a solid sales 
pipeline and a range of 
significant development 
programmes, including its new 
software platform. RMS 
expects to achieve revenue 
growth in the mid-to-high 
single digits and maintain 
margins of around 30%. 
dmg::information expects to 
drive continued solid organic 
growth, due to the strength of 
market positions and through 
new product initiatives. Growth 
would be enhanced by any 
sustained improvements in the 
economic environment, 
particularly for our property 
and financial businesses. 
Overall, dmg::information 
expects to achieve high single 
digit revenue growth and to 
maintain operating margins  
at around 20%.
At dmg::events, the positive 
momentum experienced 
through 2011 has continued 
into the autumn, with bookings 
for key events showing positive 
trends. The reported results for 
2011/12 will be affected by the 
disposal of GLM and by only 
one of our three major biennial 
shows taking place. On an 
underlying basis, and fuelled 
by our launch plans, revenue 
growth is expected to continue 
in the high single digits, with 
margins of around 20%. 
Our growth lies in 
digital media in both 
in B2B and consumer.  
We are increasingly 
focused on doing what 
is needed to excel in 
the digital world. 21

DAILY MAIL AND GENERAL TRUST PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2011
For Euromoney, despite the 
continuing volatility and 
uncertainty in financial 
markets, the broad outlook for 
the first quarter of the new 
financial year is reasonably 
positive. Euromoney expects 
the trading environment after 
that to be more challenging 
and, as usual at this time, 
forward revenue visibility 
beyond the first quarter is 
limited other than for 
subscriptions. For 2011/12, it 
expects to achieve mid-single 
digit revenue growth and to 
maintain operating margin 
(before its CAP charges).
Within A&N Media, national 
advertising revenue at 
Associated in the first eight 
weeks of the new year was 
down 2% on last year, with 
continued limited visibility  
on future trends. Circulation 
revenues will be boosted by 
the full year impact of the 
Monday to Friday cover price 
rise for the Daily Mail in July 
2011 and that for the Saturday 
edition in October 2011. 
Overall, Associated expects  
to achieve low single digit 
revenue growth due in part to 
the Olympics and margins in 
the region of 10%, with cost 
efficiency helping to protect 
profitability. We expect 
revenues from our digital 
products, especially 
MailOnline, to grow rapidly.
Northcliffe is going through  
a substantial change 
programme and will benefit 
from the full-year flow through 
of cost saving initiatives 
actioned in the previous six 
months. Advertising revenues 
have continued to track  
the year-on-year trends 
experienced in 2010/11 with a 
decline of 7% on a like-for-like 
basis last year in the first eight 
weeks of the new financial 
year (10% on a reported basis). 
The first quarter and outlook for 
the year as a whole are not 
expected to improve on this 
trend. Cost reduction initiatives 
will continue and margins are 
expected to be stable. 
Northcliffe is now focused on 
building new revenue 
opportunities from its print and 
digital products. 
It is not a coincidence that 
much of this year’s Business 
Review echoes that of last 
year. It is entirely intentional 
and demonstrates our 
unwavering commitment to 
the long-term strategic 
objectives I laid out on 
becoming Chief Executive.  
For the Group as a whole, that 
strategy remains focused on 
our key pillars: investing in 
innovation, achieving greater 
efficiency, nurturing talent  
and driving growth. With these 
factors in mind, all of our 
businesses will continue to 
invest in order to secure future 
growth and ensure that their 
financial and talent resources 
are appropriately managed. 
My colleagues and I remain 
confident that DMGT is well 
placed for 2012 and beyond.
Martin Morgan 
Chief Executive
These adjusted results are stated 
before exceptional items, 
impairment of goodwill and 
intangible assets, and amortisation of 
intangible assets arising on business 
combinations. Other than revenue 
and operating profit, these adjusted 
results are for total operations, 
including those treated as 
discontinued.
Underlying revenue or profit is 
revenue or profit on a like-for-like 
basis, adjusted for acquisitions, 
disposals, closures and non-annual 
events made in the current and prior 
year and at constant exchange 
rates. For RMS, underlying 
percentage movements exclude 
RMSI, for dmg::information Sanborn 
and for Euromoney Ned Davis 
Research. For dmg::events, the 
comparison is between events held 
in the year and the same events held 
the previous time. For A&N Media, 
the underlying percentage 
movements exclude London Lite,  
the discontinued television activities 
of Teletext, the digital dating and 
data businesses, the Slovakian  
print production companies and  
the disposal and closure of titles 
within Northcliffe.
Adjusted operating profit, the 
adjusted tax charge and adjusted 
earnings per share for the prior year 
have been restated for the change 
of presentation of amortisation of 
internally generated and acquired 
computer software as a charge 
against adjusted operating profit.  
For the prior year, £17 million has 
been reclassified as a charge 
against adjusted operating profit.
Percentages are calculated  
on actual numbers to one  
decimal place.
All references to profit or margin in 
this Business Review are to adjusted 
profit or margin, except where 
reference is made to statutory profit.

GROUP REVENUE
DMGT’s strategy emphasises 
growth for each of its businesses. 
Management targets sustained 
growth in Group revenue.
GROUP ADJUSTED PROFIT  
BEFORE TAX
As a portfolio-based Group, 
DMGT periodically buys and sells 
businesses. This KPI monitors the 
Group’s adjusted operating 
profitability.
OPERATING MARGIN %
DMGT’s investment criteria 
emphasise profitable, high 
growth sectors. In the long term, 
increasing adjusted operating 
margin indicates an 
improvement in the quality  
of its business assets.
NET DEBT
Management aims to regain 
DMGT’s investment grade status 
by reducing debt. Keeping net 
debt:EBITDA between 1.5 and 2 
times improves M&A flexibility. 
DIVIDEND PER SHARE
The Board’s policy is to maintain 
dividend growth in real terms 
every year.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Management seeks above 
average growth in adjusted 
earnings per share to maximise 
overall returns for its owners. 23

B2B SHARE OF OPERATING PROFIT
The growth and profitability of its 
business divisions are key 
components of DMGT’s strategy. 
This KPI tracks the proportion of 
operating profit attributable to 
B2B activities.
NORTH AMERICA SHARE OF 
OPERATING PROFIT
DMGT is committed to 
maintaining a significant, 
sustainable presence in North 
America markets. This KPI allows 
management to monitor the 
relative profitability of its North 
American units. 
DIGITAL SHARE OF REVENUES
We expect digital activities  
to account for the majority of 
DMGT’s future growth. This KPI 
tracks the rate at which the 
Group is monetising its digital 
content.
INTERNATIONAL SHARE  
OF REVENUES
This measures the proportion of 
revenue generated outside the 
UK. DMGT’s long-term strategic 
objective is to develop into a 
global growth company. The  
KPI measures DMGT’s success in 
internationalising the business.
SUBSCRIPTION SHARE OF B2B 
REVENUES
Subscription-based B2B revenue  
is a more stable and less cyclical 
revenue source than advertising. It 
is also a good proxy for monitoring 
growth in B2B digital revenues.  
This KPI tracks the Group’s ability to 
generate high-quality, digital B2B 
earnings.
SHARE PRICE VS FTSE ALL SHARE 
INDEX 
Management monitors the DMGT 
share price against the FTSE All 
Share Index to assess the Group’s 
relative performance against 
other UK companies.
The Group uses adjusted measures  
of profit for its KPIs, as defined on 
page 21.

SUMMARY
RMS had a solid year of 
revenue and profit growth, 
while increasing its investment 
programme that is expected 
to generate future, multi-year 
revenue growth. Excluding 
RMSI, revenues increased 11% 
and operating profits by 21%, 
somewhat assisted by an 
increase in capitalisation of 
software development 
expense, which is expected to 
continue into the new financial 
year and beyond. RMS’s 
margins were maintained 
despite the inclusion of RMSI 
until the sale of its non-core 
elements in August. RMSI 
moved from being marginally 
profitable to making a loss of 
£4 million in the period and 
had become non-core, given 
the significant growth 
opportunities for RMS in its core 
insurance markets. 
MARKET ENVIRONMENT
2011 was a very active year  
for catastrophes worldwide, 
including, among other events, 
the Japan earthquake and 
subsequent tsunami. Industry-
wide catastrophe losses were 
considerable, with impacts on 
capital positions, ratings, and 
pricing for RMS’s clients and  
for the industry as a whole. 
Insurers and reinsurers 
continued to make progress 
adapting to Solvency II 
requirements in Europe,  
and RMS clients began the 
adoption of its version 11 
model releases for North 
American Hurricane and 
European Windstorm. While 
capital markets activity  
was somewhat muted as 
compared to prior years, there 
was increased interest in the 
life and pensions space, which 
RMS participated in actively, 
as a complement to traditional 
property/casualty capital 
markets business.
STRATEGIC FOCUS
RMS’s primary strategic focus 
continues to be its new 
platform, which is designed  
to provide complete solutions 
for its clients across the  
re/insurance value chain, 
including access to 
sophisticated models, an 
ability to integrate those 
models into enterprise-wide 
business processes, and 
analytics to help clients  
make better decisions. Clients 
seek upstream capability to 
acquire and manage high-
quality exposure data, and 
downstream capability to 
open and interpret the models, 
and then apply these insights 
to deliver targeted decision 
support for underwriting, 
pricing and managing their 
business.
RMS underwent a significant 
development effort on its new 
software platform, begun in 
2010, and is working towards a 
version 1 release in early 2014 
to deliver the full range of new 
capabilities and solutions to its 
global client base. 
In the meantime, RMS 
continues to pursue selected 
growth areas in its Core 
modelling business, as well  
as in its Data, Life and Capital 
Markets initiatives. 25

PERFORMANCE  
CORE BUSINESS
RMS continues to focus 
primarily on the commercial 
catastrophe modelling 
business, which includes 
modelling of natural hazards 
risks such as earthquake, 
hurricane and flood, as well  
as terrorism risk and risk from 
pandemic diseases. Its primary 
market is the global property 
and casualty re/insurance 
industry, where it currently 
serves over 350 customers in  
30 countries around the world. 
Products and services are 
developed and delivered 
through the activity of 
approximately 930 RMS 
employees in North America, 
Europe, India, Japan and 
China.
RMS models are deeply 
embedded in risk decision-
making processes throughout 
the re/insurance vertical, 
including insurance 
companies, insurance and 
reinsurance brokers, reinsurers 
and the capital markets. 
During 2011, RMS released 
substantial updates to two of 
its core peril models, Atlantic 
Hurricane and European 
Windstorm, which reflected 
the incorporation of significant 
new hazard and loss data, as 
well as advances in research 
and technology since the 
models were last updated. 
DATA SOLUTIONS
RMS continues to expand 
‘upstream’ from its models to 
provide its clients with data 
and data management 
solutions. In 2011, RMS 
completed additional sales  
of its Data Quality Toolkit,  
a product which integrates 
client business rules with RMS 
analytics to ensure that data is 
complete, consistent, accurate 
and fit for purpose. RMS is 
currently assessing the future 
Data product roadmap to 
align it with the planned rollout 
of additional capabilities on its 
new software platform.
CAPITAL MARKETS/LIFERISKS
The capital markets 
experienced a relatively  
less robust year in terms  
of issuance, and RMS 
participated in fewer 
transactions than in previous 
years, as the release 
timeframe for its version 11 
Hurricane and Windstorm 
models prevented RMS from 
engaging the market for 
certain periods of the year. 
RMS continues to see potential 
growth opportunities in the Life 
and Pensions space, and in the 
capital markets for that sector, 
and has dedicated additional 
resources to this potential 
opportunity.
OUTLOOK
RMS has started the new 
financial year strongly with  
a solid sales pipeline and  
a range of significant 
development programmes.

SUMMARY
dmg::information’s Profits were 
unchanged at £47 million in a 
year where we continued to 
see only slight, and at times 
fragile, recovery in the markets 
our businesses serve.
Reported revenue increased 
by 3% to £238 million. Underlying 
revenues grew by 7%, a  
good performance given  
the economic backdrop. 
Underlying operating profits 
grew by 9% year-on-year.

In the US our market-leading 
provider of environmental 
information, Environmental 
Data Resources (‘EDR‘), 
continues to operate in  
a fragile commercial real 
estate market. Despite the 
challenging conditions both 
revenues and profits increased 
as the company continued to 
deepen its market penetration 
and enhance product 
offerings to embed them more 
into customers workflows. 
Landmark Information Group 
also increased both revenues 
and operating profits. 
Landmark provides information 
and services to both the 
residential and commercial 
property markets in the UK.  
This robust performance was 
particularly pleasing as market 
activity levels in both remain 
significantly below the historic 
norm, with for example UK 
residential housing transaction 
volumes in 2011 being 
approximately half of the 
historic norm. Landmark has 
successfully expanded its 
product range, increasingly 
serving the lenders in addition 
to solicitors and consultants.  
In June we completed the 
acquisition of On-Geo in 
Germany and, through 
combining the On-Geo  
and Inframation businesses, 
Landmark now enjoys a market 
leading position in the German 
market.

KEY DEVELOPMENTS
Underlying operating 
profit increased by 9%. 
Margins remained 
stable.
In the financial information 
market, Trepp is the market 
leader of information to the 
Commercial Mortgage-
Backed Securities (‘CMBS’) 
market. The market place  
has been particularly  
volatile during the year; the 
fundamentals have improved 
and as a consequence 
spreads on bonds have 
narrowed leading to 
speculative investors, seeking 
a high yield, exiting the 
market. At the same time  
new issuance remains muted 
and longer-term investors are 
holding off on rebuilding their 
activity. Fortunately, the need 
for Trepp analysis and insight 
continues to grow. Trepp has 
also expanded its product 
offerings, largely offsetting  
the difficult near-term market 
environment. 
Lewtan, offering products to 
both investors and issuers in  
the Asset-Backed securities 
market, released a major 
upgrade of its core ABSNet 
product in the year and saw 
good growth following the 
launch of its ABSNet Loan 
product line. The market 
conditions remained 
challenging for its products 
and services focused at the 
issuer of securities and in 
particular revenues from one 
major client declining impacted 
overall performance. 
Hobsons, our education 
information business, 
increased underlying revenues 
by 17% and margins improved 
slightly as we benefit from  
the operating leverage. 
Hobsons provides products  
to education professionals  
to assist in the preparation, 
recruitment, management 
and advancement of students 
and continues to increase its 
market share. Approximately 
75% of Hobsons’ revenue  
is generated in the US with  
the balance in the UK and 
Australia. The US high school 
division, Naviance, again grew 
particularly strongly in the year.
The energy trading markets, 
served by Genscape, 
remained turbulent. Genscape 
grew modestly with an 
expanding product range, in 
particular from the new 
launches providing information 
on the oil market. 
OUTLOOK
dmg::information expects to 
drive continued solid organic 
growth, due to the strength  
of its market positions and 
through new launch initiatives.

DMG EVENTS
OUTLOOK
For 2011/12, dmg::events expects  
to achieve high single digit 
underlying revenue growth. The 
reported results will be affected 
by the disposal of GLM and by 
the absence of Gastech and 
ADIPEC. Only one of our three 
major biennial shows will be 
taking place, the Global 
Petroleum Show in June 2012.  
As a consequence, dmg::events 
expects a low single digit decline 
in reported revenues (excluding 
GLM) with operating margin of 
around 20%. 
KEY DEVELOPMENTS
Underlying revenue 
increased by 14%. 
Margins improved by 
2% to 29%. 
SUMMARY
dmg::events had a good year 
with both underlying revenues 
and underlying profits 
increasing by 14%. The strong 
momentum that started in the 
latter half of 2010 has continued 
through the past year due to 
exhibitions and events being a 
late-cycle media. 
The reported revenues and profits 
benefited from two of our large 
biennial shows taking place in 
the year and were up 20% to £132 
million and up 28% to £39 million 
respectively. Both Gastech and 
ADIPEC were held during 2010/1 1, 
while only one large biennial 
event, the Global Petroleum 
Show, occurred in 2009/10.
The sale of George Little 
Management (‘GLM’), our 
business serving the retail (Gift, 
Surf & Jewellery) markets, 
including the bi-annual New York 
International Gift Fair, was 
completed in September for total 
consideration of £108 million. 
GLM reported operating profits 
for the year of £16 million on 
revenues of £45 million.
dmg::events is now organised 
into four operating units, covering 
the sectors Energy, Leadership 
Conferences, Digital Marketing 
and a regional unit in the  
Middle East. 
In the Energy sector, the Gastech 
event, held in Amsterdam, 
generated revenues 31% higher 
than the previous show and was 
a huge success. The next event is 
scheduled to be held in London 
in October 2012 after the London 
Olympics and will fall into our 
2012/13 financial year. 
Although the economic 
uncertainties in the Middle East 
have presented challenges our 
Middle East operating unit was 
able to increase both revenues 
and profits. The Big 5 show in 
Dubai, which is our largest 
individual event, was similar in 
scale to prior years and ADIPEC,

KEY DEVELOPMENTS
Underlying revenue 
increased by 12%. 
Acquisition of Ned 
Davis Research.
SUMMARY 
Euromoney achieved an 
operating profit of £93 million 
on revenues up 10% to £363 
million. This operating 
performance is stated after 
deducting a charge for its 
management incentive 
scheme, the CAP, £12 million 
higher than last year including 
an additional accelerated 
CAP expense of £7 million due 
to the earlier than expected 
achievement of its profit 
target. Underlying revenue 
growth was 12% and 
underlying profits were up 11%. 
This revenue growth, 
combined with tight control of 
headcount, helped 
Euromoney maintain its margin 
before the CAP in spite of 
significant investment in new 
products and technology.
STRATEGY
Euromoney continued its 
ambitious programme of 
investing in new technology 
and content delivery 
platforms, particularly for the 
mobile user, and in new digital 
information products, as part 
of its migration to a global 
online information business.  
In addition, it undertook  
a substantial investment 
programme at two of its  
most important electronic 
information businesses, BCA 
Research and CEIC Data, with 
a view to building rapidly the 
quality and coverage of their 
products and expanding their 
global sales resources.
In August it completed the 
acquisition of Ned Davis 
Research (NDR). NDR produces 
data, financial models, charts 
and independent market 
commentary to help clients 
execute their asset allocation 
strategies. All of its content is 
published online and the 
acquisition is expected to 
increase the proportion of 
Euromoney’s revenues derived 
from subscriptions to more 
than 50% for the first time. 
Euromoney intends to apply  
a similar investment strategy  
to NDR as it has done so 
successfully with its other 
independent research 
business, BCA Research, and 
build a range of new 
international products and 
drive revenue growth through 
an expanded global sales 
team. The early signs of trading 
at NDR are encouraging.
TRADING REVIEW
Underlying subscription 
revenues, which account for 
nearly half Euromoney’s 
revenue, increased at a rate  
of 11%, an underlying increase 
of 14%. This double digit 
subscription growth continues  
to be generated by its premium 
online research and data 
services such as BCA Research 
and CEIC Data, contrasting  
with the lower growth rates of 
the traditional print publishing 
businesses. 
The quality of Euromoney’s 
event portfolio was 
demonstrated by a 20% growth 
in sponsorship revenues. The 
event businesses have been a 
key driver of Euromoney’s strong 
recovery over the two years 
since the global credit crisis. 
Revenues broadly comprise an 
equal mix of both sponsorship 
and paying delegates, and the 
growth in the year reflects the 
success of Euromoney’s strategy 
of building large, must-attend 
annual events in niche markets, 
and continually investing to 
grow these events while adding 
new, smaller events as markets 
improve. The recent market 
uncertainty has had limited 
impact on Euromoney’s event 
businesses, while delegate 
bookings for training courses 
have held up well.

FINANCIAL PUBLISHING
Revenues, approximately  
50% of which are advertising-
related, increased by 5% to £84 
million. Advertising revenues 
came under pressure towards 
the end of the year, but the 
increased investment in digital 
publishing has contributed to 
an increasing proportion of 
advertising revenues from 
online rather than print, and  
a strong performance from 
products less dependent on 
advertising such as Euro Week 
and Institutional Investor 
Research. 
BUSINESS PUBLISHING
Euromoney’s activities outside 
finance cover a number  
of sectors including metals, 
commodities, energy, 
telecoms and law, with only 
35% of revenues derived  
from advertising. Revenues 
increased by 7% to £60 million, 
but margin dropped by 2 
percentage points due to the 
impact of investment in digital 
publishing, particularly in 
businesses such as Metal 
Bulletin and legal publishing.
TRAINING
This division predominantly 
serves the global financial 
sector with a strong focus on 
emerging markets. After a slow 
start to the calendar year, due 
partly to the political unrest  
in the Middle East, delegate 
bookings improved from June 
and the division finished the 
year strongly. Training revenues 
for the year increased by 9%  
to £33 million and adjusted 
margin was maintained at 24%.
CONFERENCES  
AND SEMINARS
Revenues comprise both 
sponsorship and paying 
delegates and increased by 
12% to £86 million. Margin was 
unchanged at 31%. Growth 
has come across all sectors but 
in particular from those outside 
finance such as metals, coal 
and telecoms which have a 
higher emerging market 
exposure.
RESEARCH AND DATA
Revenues are predominantly 
derived from subscriptions and 
increased by 16% to £104 million. 
Margin fell by one percentage 
point to 41% reflecting the 
investment programme at BCA 
Research and CEIC Data.
OUTLOOK
2012 promises to be more 
challenging and, as usual, 
forward revenue visibility 
beyond the first quarter is 
limited other than for 
subscriptions. Euromoney plans 
to continue its programme of 
investing in the digital 
transformation of its publishing 
businesses, and in improving 
the quality of the product and 
expanding the sales resources 
of its research and data 
businesses including the 
recently acquired Ned Davis 
Research. 
It is well prepared for the 
challenging markets ahead 
and in a stronger position than 
it was at the start of the last 
financial crisis, and will 
continue to pursue its 
successful strategy of investing 
in new products, digital 
publishing and selective 
acquisitions to drive further 
long-term growth.
Commentary
Underlying revenue growth 
and tight control of headcount 
drove a strong profits 
performance despite an 
additional charge of £12 
million for Euromoney’s CAP.

A&N MEDIA 
The A&N Media business 
portfolio has evolved 
significantly over the last three 
years and is now very much 
focused on leading positions  
in the markets in which it

A drive for efficiency has 
delivered a leaner and more

Alongside this, investment 
continues in new and 
emerging business models

potential to be strong profit 
contributors. The removal of an

MARKET AND COMPETITIVE 
POSITIONING
Consumer media consumption 
has rapidly changed in recent 
years and will continue to  
do so as digital channels  
(fixed and mobile) continue  
to take share. 
The complex and rapidly 
changing competitive 
landscape across consumer 
media makes the competitor 
set for A&N Media increasingly 
complex. The boundaries 
where our businesses operate 
and compete has extended 
over the last three years as we 
enter new adjacent markets, 
begin to utilise new channels/
devices (mobile, TV, online, 
print) and operate with a 
mixture of different business 
models (e.g. subscription, 
advertiser funded, consumer 
pays). 
201 1 PERFORMANCE
Revenues for the year were 
£1,098 million, an underlying 
decrease of £22 million or 2%, 
though 4% lower on a reported 
basis, reflecting that some 
underperforming business 
activity was discontinued. The 
testing economic conditions 
adversely affected Northcliffe’s 
classified revenues and the 
Mail titles’ display advertising 
revenues and a further hike in 
the price of newsprint, led to  
its underlying operating profits 
decreasing by £32 million 
(-26%) to £93 million. A&N 
Media’s margins fell from 10% 
to 8%. Headcount reduced  
by 740 (10%) during the year.
All underlying year-on-year 
comparisons are on a like-for-
like basis, excluding 
discontinued operations. DAILY MAIL AND GENERAL TRUST PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2011 32

After a strong first quarter, 
challenging economic 
conditions affected the 
second and, in particular,  
the third quarter, with an 
improvement seen towards the 
end of the year. Total revenues 
were down £21 million or 2%, 
due mainly to the impact of 
closed or sold businesses and 
lower display revenues from 
the two Mail titles. Improved 
revenues were seen from 
Metro, MailOnline and the 
recruitment and property 
digital businesses, resulting in 
total underlying revenues of 
£858 million, marginally ahead  
of last year. Total underlying 
advertising revenues of  
£442 million were unchanged  
from last year. 
Due to the reported fall in 
revenues and the increased 
price of newsprint, operating 
profit for the year fell by 
£13 million to £76 million. 
Continued control of costs,  
in particular reduced 
promotional activity and staff 
cost savings in part helped 
mitigate these adverse 
variances, but operating 
margins were down 1% to 9%. 
An exceptional operating 
charge of £42 million 
(£19 million of which was 
non-cash) was made for 
restructuring and closure  
costs, the largest portion 
relating to print site 
restructuring and closures.

MAILONLINE
Mail Digital made further 
progress this year, recording a 
65% improvement in revenue. 
Traffic to its primary website, 
MailOnline, increased 
significantly, largely through its 
targeting of the US market. This 
has contributed towards a 62% 
year-on-year increase in US 
daily unique visitors in October 
2011. 
On a global basis, MailOnline 
became the world’s second 
largest English language 
online newspaper. We see 
digital publishing as a growth 
opportunity, and a means of 
extending the Mail brand. 
FREE NEWSPAPERS
The Free Newspaper business 
had another strong year. 
Revenue growth of over  
£10 million or 14% and good 
cost control resulted in record 
profits. In November 2010, 
Metro increased its daily 
distribution by 4% to 1,385,000 
copies. Total costs rose due to 
increased print runs, newsprint 
prices, larger paginations due 
to advertising volumes and 
higher distribution charges. 
Traffic to Metro.co.uk saw 
strong growth during the year, 
up 47% to an average of 4.4 
million UK unique visitors per 
month in September, with 
global visitors growing by 55% 
to a record 8.6 million in the 
same month. Digital revenue 
grew by 33% in the year.
MAIL NEWSPAPERS
The Daily Mail increased its 
share of the national daily 
newspaper market by 0.5% to 
21%, a new record, during a 
year which saw the weekday 
cover price increased by 5p  
to 55p in July. Daily circulation 
averaged 2,070,000 copies, 
which was only 2.4% down 
year-on-year compared to  
a contraction in the overall 
market, excluding the Daily 
Mail, of 5.5%. 
The Mail on Sunday’s average 
circulation for the year rose  
by 0.01% to 1,989,000 copies, 
compared to a fall in the 
national Sunday market of 
10.3%, excluding The Mail on 
Sunday, and partly reflected 
gains in sale following closure 
of The News of the World in 
July. The Mail on Sunday’s 
share of the total market 
increased by 1.7% to a new 
high of 20.7%, and it firmly 
established itself as the market 
leader during the last quarter 
of the year.
In May the national titles 
launched a new promotional 
initiative, the Mail Rewards 
Club, with the twin objectives 
of building sales more 
efficiently and the retention  
of existing readers. This has 
helped to attract new readers 
and to date, 600,000 members 
have registered. 
Despite the further significant 
rise in newsprint prices, the 
cost base of the two national 
titles was again reduced 
through savings in other areas, 
most notably promotional  
cost efficiencies and lower 
production charges.

MAIL TODAY, INDIA
Mail Today, the Delhi-based 
daily newspaper, in which 
Associated holds a 26% 
interest, though still loss-
making, has grown revenues 
by over 50% year-on-year in 
the last six months (advertising 
up 48%, circulation up 91%). 
The relationship with our 
partners will be the foundation 
to extend MailOnline’s 
presence in this market.
PRINTING
During the year, plans to 
relocate the Group’s print 
operations from Surrey Quays 
to a new site in Thurrock were 
announced. The process is  
on track and significant cost 
savings have already been 
made as print operations are 
streamlined in advance of the 
transition. 
DIGITAL OPERATIONS
Underlying revenue (excluding 
closures and disposals)  
from the portfolio of digital 
companies was up 5% 
year-on-year to £84 million. 
Recruitment and property 
sectors both grew strongly, 
offset by challenging markets 
in the motors and travel 
sectors. The digital only 
businesses profit of £6 million 
fell marginally on prior year 
levels. The benefit of the 
closure of loss making 
businesses last year helped to 
improve margin. This was 
despite continuing to invest in 
products and marketing across 
all the digital businesses, as 
well as supporting the 
international expansion of our 
recruitment business. 
RECRUITMENT
Revenues grew by 15% in the 
year. The flagship recruitment 
portal, Jobsite, maintained its 
commitment to invest in brand 
building with multiple TV 
campaigns, resulting in record 
traffic (up 19% year-on-year in 
September) and uploaded 
CVs. In addition, the number of 
customers in September was 
10% higher than a year ago. 
Vacancy volumes grew 
strongly throughout the year, 
with the number advertised  
in September being 18%  
higher than the previous  
year. Considerable strategic 
investment was maintained in 
rolling out the international 
expansion plans for some of 
the key specialist recruitment 
activities. Broadbean, a 
leading multi-poster of 
vacancies and tracking 
information for recruiters,  
has continued to expand its 
interests in both the US and 
Europe. Oilcareers, a leading 
job-board in the energy sector, 
has, following on from its 
expansion into the US, recently 
launched into the Canadian, 
Middle East and Australian 
markets.
PROPERTY
The Digital Property Group 
(‘DPG’) incorporating 
FindaProperty.com, 
Primelocation.com and 
Globrix.com, continues  
to provide a distinct and 
differentiated offering, 
delivering substantial value  
to our customers through 
increased buyer leads, seller 
instructions and up-sell 
services. Revenues grew by 
15% in a very depressed 
property market. Substantial 
increases in marketing spend 
resulted in a drop in operating 
margins to 13%, from 17%  
last year. This growth in 
promotional spend helped 
DPG increase the number  
of UK estate agent branches 
using its services by 20% to  
over 12,600. In September, 8.9 
million home searches used 
DPG’s websites, a 17% increase 
on last year. In October 2011 
A&N Media announced it had 
agreed to merge its digital 
property business with that  
of Zoopla to provide a real 
alternative to Rightmove, the 
dominant player in this market.
TRAVEL
The travel business operates  
as an aggregator in the travel 
sector, under two brands, 
Teletext Holidays, in the late 
booking ‘package’ market, 
and Villarenters, in the 
self-catering rental market. This 
business has suffered markedly 
due to the pressures on 
consumer spending, with the 
number of bookings over the 
key summer period (June–
August) 8% lower than last 
year. In December, Teletext 
Holidays ceased broadcasting 
on the analogue TV service 
and in January it outsourced 
its retail operation. 
Revenues were 41% lower  
than last year. Excluding the 
revenues from Analogue  
and the Retail operation  
that closed in January, the 
underlying decline was 10%. 
Substantial investment was 
made in marketing the Teletext 
Holidays brand during the 
year, to rebalance the 
customer demographic from 
an ageing consumer to one 
more representative of UK 
holiday buyers. Holiday 
searches on the site increased 
by 24% reflecting the desire to 
seek late available holidays, 
despite the economy.
MOTORS
The UK’s automotive sector 
had a very tough year, the 
effects of which have been felt 
in our Motors digital business. 
Revenues were down 10% 
year-on-year. However, the 
company’s underlying growth 
continued with dealer 
numbers up 4% and the 
number of vehicle listed 
increasing by 5% over the year. 
The business also extended its 
reach through partnerships 
with regional newspaper 
groups, adding Archant, NWN 
Media and Scottish Provincial 
Press to its existing five 
partnerships.

A&N International’s operating 
profits grew by £0.4 million to 
£3.7 million on revenues down 
10% to £30 million. Underlying 
profits were in line with the 
prior year, with print 
advertising revenues declining 
by 13%, but circulation and 
digital revenues growing by 1% 
and 10% respectively. Contract 
printing revenues have also 
grown strongly. Headcount has 
been reduced and significant 
cost savings were made.  
The year-on-year decline  
in print revenues slowed 
towards the end of the year. 
The performance of digital 
revenues has improved.
OUTLOOK
For 2011/12, Associated expects 
to achieve low single digit 
revenue growth, due in part  
to the positive impact of the 
Olympics.

Northcliffe’s titles continued to 
be affected by weak 
advertising markets. The 
recruitment and notices’ 
categories were affected by 
low private sector demand 
and Government budget cuts. 
The company continued its 
restructuring and process 
innovation and delivered 
year-on-year underlying cost 
savings of £15 million or 7%. 
Restructuring costs of £11 
million (all cash) are treated as 
exceptional items this year. 
Total headcount reduced by a 
further 19%, or 602 people.
NEWSPAPER SALES
Reported newspaper sales 
revenues fell by 8% or £4 million. 
On a like-for-like basis 
(excluding a change in 
accounting treatment for 
distribution costs), revenues 
were down 2%. Cover price 
increases were implemented 
across the majority of titles 
where prices had historically 
been below the Industry 
average.
Our weekly paid-for portfolio 
continues to perform ahead of 
the industry average. For the 
January to June 2011 ABC 
period, circulation was down 
4.7%, outperforming the 
average of the top four  
regional publishers which  
were down 6.3%. 
For the January to June 2011 
ABC period, circulation of  
the dailies was down 8.2% 
compared with an average 
decline of 7.2% experienced by 
the top four regional publishers. 
Three daily paid for titles, in 
Exeter, Torquay and Scunthorpe, 
have converted to weeklies with 
sales significantly ahead of the 
best performing day (when in 
daily format). In October 2011, 
the daily title In Lincoln also 
converted to a weekly.
During the financial year, 
Northcliffe sold seven titles (in 
Forest of Dean, Hereford, 
Shrewsbury, Leek and Uttoxeter) 
and closed a further 10 free 
titles.
ADVERTISING
After a more modest 6% 
year-on-year decline in the first 
quarter, reported advertising 
trends have remained 
consistent at -12% in quarter 2, 
-10% in quarters 3 and 4, 
resulting in a 10% full year 
decline year-on-year. Excluding 
the title disposals noted above, 
advertising revenues are down 
9% for the year.
The increase in unemployment 
levels is showing no signs of 
slowing. Budget cut 
announcements have, as 
expected, had a heavy impact 
on our private and public sector 
recruitment spend. Recruitment 
revenues fell by 29%. In response 
to the challenge in the 
recruitment category, 
Northcliffe has restructured its 
rate and advertising package 
structure to help improve its 
position in this very competitive 
market place.
In the property category, 
revenues fell by 5%, a reflection 
of the tough property market 
where the level of mortgage 
approvals fell by 5% on the 
previous year.
Motors advertising was down 8% 
in 2011 as the level of private 
new car registrations was well 
down on last year. 
Retail advertising, Northcliffe’s 
largest category in 2011, fell by 
3% in the full year. UK Retail sales 
statistics continue to show little 
or no year-on-year underlying 
sales growth.
All the other advertising 
categories combined fell 7%.
KEY DEVELOPMENTS
Underlying decline  
in UK revenues of  
£25m (7%).
Continuing weak 
economic climate  
and UK Government 
austerity measures 
affect key advertising 
categories.
Restructuring activities 
delivered underlying 
year-on-year cost 
savings of £15m.
Portfolio changes 
strengthen our market 
position – four paid for 
daily titles converted to 
weekly publication.
Sale of titles in Leek,

NORTHCLIFFE DIGITAL
The Northcliffe Digital strategy is 
to diversify from a proposition 
focused on local news to sites 
which have a wider range of 
local content and greater 
commercial opportunities for 
our small and medium-sized 
enterprise (SME) customers. To 
achieve this the Thisis network 
has been relaunched on a new 
platform which includes a far 
greater range of commercial 
opportunities for our advertisers 
and potential for user 
generated content creation.
The Northcliffe Digital audience 
has continued to grow. Unique 
users across the Thisis and 
Localpeople networks reached 
5.3m in September, a growth  
of 13% versus last year. Most 
importantly both user 
contributions and commercial 
response increased sharply. 
Over 100,000 pieces of content 
were created by users in 
September 2011, an increase of 
46% year-on-year. Page views of 
the business directory product, 
the core of the suite of products 
sold to SMEs by Northcliffe 
Digital, increased 80% year-on-
year with a growth of 92% in 
number of tracked calls to 
advertisers. For the full year 
revenues generated from 
business directory listings 
increased 54% year-on-year. 
The portfolio of LocalPeople 
sites (aimed at communities of 
up to 60,000 people) reached 
160 by September.
The strength of our digital 
offering and continued 
audience growth has enabled 
revenue increases in all of our 
key categories, apart from 
recruitment (down 17%) and 
notices (down 12%), where 
market pressures were 
universally felt – revenues from 
other categories were up 6%  
in total. Digital revenues not 
associated with a print sale 
grew to account for 36% of 
business in September, up 105% 
year-on-year.
COSTS
Northcliffe has continued  
to drive down operational  
costs. These have reduced by 
£15 million or 7% compared to 
the same period last year.
Staff costs fell by £8 million or 9% 
as headcount was reduced by 
602 or 19% since September 
2010. Greater efficiency has 
been delivered across all 
departments.
Production and distribution 
costs have reduced by £9 
million or 17%. Some savings 
were as a consequence of 
lower activity levels. However, 
more significant reductions 
have been made through 
further rationalisation of the 
product portfolio, product 
format and distribution 
changes.
During the year, Northcliffe 
dismantled its regional 
operating structure, divided the 
business between print and 
digital activities and changed 
the senior management team 
structure. Steve Auckland, 
formerly managing director of 
Metro, was appointed MD of 
Northcliffe’s print publishing 
business and three new MDs 
were appointed to businesses in 
Hull, Leicester and Bristol. There 
have also been a number of 
editorial changes. Roland Bryan 
leads the digital businesses.
OUTLOOK
For 2011/12, Northcliffe expects 
a continuation of its current 
underlying revenue trends 
which track those experienced 
for 2010/11.

This Financial and Treasury 
Review focuses principally  
on the adjusted results* to give 
a more comparable indication 
of the Group’s underlying 
business performance. All 
year-on-year comparisons are 
on a like-for-like basis after 
adjusting the prior year results 
for the change of presentation 
of amortisation of internally 
generated and acquired 
computer software as a 
charge against adjusted 
operating profit. 
A discussion of restructuring 
and impairment charges and 
other items included in the 
statutory results is set out after 
the divisional performance 
review and in the segmental 
note. In the prior year statutory 
results, the Group’s radio 
division is shown within 
discontinued operations for 
the period to 16th December, 
2009. The adjusted results are 
summarised on the right:

KEY HIGHLIGHTS
• Good B2B 
performance with 
revenues up 8% and 
profits up 4%.
• Challenging year for 
consumer businesses 
leading to reduced 
profits, down 20%. 
• Underlying Group 
operating profit and 
operating margin 
unchanged.
• Net debt to EBITDA 
ratio of 1.99 times, 
with net debt down 
£143m to £719m.
• Dividend increased 
by 6%.
The purpose of this review is to outline key 
aspects of the Group’s performance over  
the last year and of its financial position. 39

REVENUE
Group revenue for the year 
was £1,990 million compared 
with £1,968 million for the prior 
year, an increase of 1% on  
a reported basis and an 
underlying increase of 3%. 
Revenues from the B2B group 
totalled £892 million, 8% higher 
than last year, with an 
underlying increase of 10%. 
A&N Media’s revenues for the 
year were £1,098 million, an 
underlying decrease of 2%, 
though 4% lower on a reported 
basis, reflecting that some 
underperforming business 
activity was discontinued in 
the prior year. The testing 
economic conditions adversely 
affected Northcliffe’s classified 
revenues and the Mail titles’ 
display advertising revenues.
The analysis of revenue by 
activity, illustrated in graph 1, 
shows that the percentage of 
total revenue from consumer 
media has fallen slightly this 
year and is now 55%, down 
from 66% in 2007. Graph 2 
shows the geographic split of 
revenue. This shows that 65% of 
total revenue by source was 
generated by UK businesses, 
compared with 74% in 2007.

OPERATING PROFIT
Operating profit was down  
by £14 million or 5% on the 
equivalent figure for the prior 
year at £286 million, but flat  
on an underlying basis. Overall 
operating margin fell from  
14% to 15% due to a slight 
deterioration in our consumer 
businesses. Underlying margin 
was unchanged at 16%.
Operating profit is stated 
before charging £53 million  
as exceptional operating 
costs, principally within A&N 
Media. This charge includes 
reorganisation costs of  
£29 million, accelerated 
depreciation of property,  
plant and equipment of  
£15 million, principally relating 
to the proposed move to 
Thurrock and impairments  
of fixed assets of £9 million.
The charge for amortisation  
of intangible assets fell by 
£12 million to £43 million. The 
Group also made a charge for 
the impairment of intangible 
assets of £24 million, largely 
relating to A&N Media.
The analysis of operating profit 
by activity is shown in graph 3. 
This shows that 74% of this 
year’s operating profit was 
generated from the Group’s 
B2B operations and 26%  
from consumer, compared to 
50% and 50% in 2007. These 
percentages have been 
calculated after allocating 
Head Office costs of £33 million 
on the basis of revenues.  
More than half of the Group’s 
operating profits were again 
derived from outside the UK 
with 51% coming from the US. 
The Group’s B2B companies 
increased their overall profit* 
by £8 million or 4%, despite an 
additional charge of £12 
million for Euromoney’s CAP. 
The underlying increase was 
14%. The largest increase was 
by dmg::events (£9 million). 
There were increases also at 
RMS (£2 million).The average 
sterling: US dollar exchange 
rate for the year was £1: $1.61 
(against £1:$1.56 last year). 
Within consumer media,  
the profits of A&N Media 
declined by £23 million or  
20%. Underlying margins* fell 
from 10% to 8%. At Associated 
Newspapers, operating profit 
fell by £13 million or 15% to £76 
million due to the fall in 
revenues and to the increased 
price of newsprint. Continued 
control of costs, in particular 
reduced promotional activity 
and staff cost savings in part 
helped mitigate these adverse 
variances, but operating 
margins were down 1% to 9%. 
Northcliffe’s profits fell by 
£10 million or 37% to £17 million 
as its titles continued to be 
affected by weak advertising 
markets. The company 
continued its restructuring  
and process innovation  
and delivered year-on-year 
underlying cost savings  
of £18 million or 8%. 
As explained last year, we 
have restated our adjusted 
results for the change of 
presentation of amortisation  
of internally generated and 
acquired computer software 
as a charge against adjusted 
operating profit. For the prior 
year, £17 million has been 
reclassified as a charge against 
adjusted operating profit. 41

JOINT VENTURES  
AND ASSOCIATES
The Group’s share of the 
adjusted results of its joint 
ventures and associates rose 
by £2 million to £5 million. It 
includes income from dmg 
Radio Australia, offset by our 
share of the losses of Mail 
Today, the Delhi-based daily 
newspaper. 
NET FINANCING COSTS
As the table shows, net interest 
payable and similar charges 
(including deemed finance 
charges and interest 
receivable) fell by £5 million  
to £69 million due to  
lower average debt and 
management of the  
debt portfolio. 
There was a £14 million 
movement in the pension 
finance item due to the lower 
pension fund deficit arising 
from a growth in assets and 
higher discount rate used. 
Other investment revenue rose 
by £2 million due largely to 
dividends from an internet 
investment fund.
OTHER INCOME  
STATEMENT ITEMS
The Group recorded other net 
gains on disposal of businesses 
and investments of £15 million, 
compared to £0.1 million  
last year. This comprised 
exceptional gains on the sale 
of businesses and investments. 
These include RMSI, the 
Indian-based geographic 
information services division  
of RMS, Sanborn, GLM, and 
dmg::information’s stake in 
CoStar Group, Inc. Profit 
attributable to operations 
treated as discontinued 
amounted to £nil (2010  
£33 million).
RESULT BEFORE TAX
The statutory profit before tax 
for the year was £125 million, 
after charging £112 million of 
amortisation charges and 
impairment losses and £113 
million of net exceptional 
charges. 
TAXATION
The adjusted tax charge of 
£35 million (2010 £31 million  
as restated) is stated after 
adjusting for the effect of 
exceptional items. The 
adjusted tax rate for the year 
rose to 15.0% from 13.6% in  
the 2010 full year, largely  
due to a change in the mix  
of chargeable profits. The 
continued low rate reflects tax 
reductions from tax-efficient 
financing and tax deductible 
amortisation in the USA that 
are expected to be in place 
for the next few years.
There were net exceptional tax 
credits of £38 million, arising on 
operating exceptional costs, 
the accelerated depreciation 
of property and equipment 
and the recognition of tax 
losses.
PROFIT AFTER TAX
Adjusted Group Profit after tax 
and minority interests was up 
1% to £180 million. Statutory 
profit was £112 million, down 
from £178 million, due to higher 
exceptional charges and 
lower tax credits in the current 
year.
PENSIONS
The Group’s defined benefit 
pension schemes provide 
retirement benefits for UK staff, 
largely in A&N Media. These 
schemes are closed to new 
employees. The deficit in these 
schemes rose from £271 million 
at the beginning of the year to 
£336 million at 2nd October, 
2011 (calculated in 
accordance with IAS 19). This 
change is primarily due to 
lower return achieved on the 
schemes’ investments. 
In June, the Company formally 
reached agreement with the 
Trustees on funding 
arrangements as part of the 
process associated with the 
triennial actuarial valuation of 
the main schemes as at 31st 
March, 2010. The deficit 
recovery plan will lead to 
payments of £37 million in 
October 2011, £36 million in 
October 2012, £23 million in 
October 2013, £21 million in 
October 2014 and £17 million in 
October for each of the 
following nine years. The 
Company has also entered 
into an additional funding 
agreement with the trustees 
that will supplement these 
amounts by payments 
between £5 million and £10 
million calculated annually but 
payable shortly after the 2016, 
2019 and 2022 triennial 
valuations of the main 
schemes, subject to those 
schemes then being in deficit 
by an amount greater than the 
payment due. These funding 
agreements will be revisited 
after the next actuarial 
valuation as at 31st March, 
2013.
Having previously closed its 
defined benefit schemes to 
new employees, the Board 
introduced a series of 
measures during the year to 
help secure the financial 
health of these plans into the 
future. All new employees of 
A&N Media are now being 
offered a defined contribution  DAILY MAIL AND GENERAL TRUST PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2011 42

brought this division into line 
with our other newer and  
more internationally focused 
divisions where we have long 
believed in this type of  
pension plan. 
CASH FLOW AND NET DEBT
Net debt has fallen by £143 
million during the year from 
£862 million to £719 million as 
the Group has remained 
focused on reduction of debt.
Graph 4 illustrates the 
movement in net debt and 
shows the Group’s sources of 
free cash flows and use of 
those funds during the year. 
The Group generated 
operating cash flows of £325 
million and disposal proceeds 
of £125 million. These funded 
acquisitions of £96 million, 
taxation of £47 million, interest 
of £69 million, pension funding 
of £11 million and dividends 
totalling £70 million. Operating 
cash flows are stated after 
capital expenditure of  
£56 million.
In general, the Group’s profits 
are converted rapidly into 
cash and cash generation was 
strong across the Group, with 
114% of profits converted into 
cash, before allowing for 
exceptional operating costs.
Graph 5 shows the movement 
in the Group’s ratio of year end 
net debt to EBITDA since 2006. 
By the 2011 year end it was 1.99 
times, well within the Group’s 
internal limit of 2.4 times and 
comfortably within the 
requirements of the Group’s 
bank covenants. During the 
year, the Group continued to 
act to increase profitability 
and reduce cash outflows, in 
particular by reducing 
acquisition activity. The 
Group’s corporate credit 
ratings are BBB- from Fitch,  
and BB+ from Standard & 
Poor’s due largely to the 
latter’s view on the weakness 
of newspapers and concerns 
that the Group did not  
reduce dividends during  
the credit crunch. 
The Group’s principal debt 
remains in long-term bonds. At 
the year end, the Group had 
£832 million of Bonds due for 
repayment in 2013, 2018, 2021 
and 2027. The Group acquired 
£25 million 5.75% Bonds 2018 
prior to year end and will 
consider acquiring further 
bonds where financially 
sensible. In April, the Group 
raised approximately £300 
million of new bank facilities  
for a five-year period to April 
2016 with only minor changes 
to basic financial covenants. 
These were available at the 
year end, together with £90 
million of existing facilities 
maturing in September 2013. 
Consequently, the Group  
has sufficient committed  
debt facilities to meet its 
foreseeable requirements.  
It had unutilised committed 
facilities of £328 million at the 
year end and surplus cash of 
£172 million.
OTHER FINANCING
The Company acquired 2.3 
million ‘A’ Ordinary Shares in 
Treasury for £12 million, using 
2.2 million of them, valued at 
£11 million, to provide shares 
under various incentive plans. 
Following these transfers, 
DMGT has 382.9 million shares 
in issue, together with 9.7 
million ‘A’ Ordinary Shares held 
in Treasury to meet further 
obligations that may arise. 
DMGT took its share of 
dividends from Euromoney in 
the form of a scrip. It is the 
Board’s intention also to take 
Euromoney’s forthcoming final 
dividend in the scrip form. In 
November 2011, DMGT 
increased its interest in 
Euromoney to 67.4%. These 
actions were taken in order to 
enable it to offset the dilutive 
effect of the vesting of 
Euromoney’s CAP.
TREASURY POLICIES 
DMGT aims to have sufficient 
liquidity to meet both 
operational and capital cash 
flows and to impose the 
minimum cash constraints on 
the management and 
operation of the Group. 
Financial instruments, 
including derivatives, are  
used by the Group in order  
to manage the principal 
financial risks that arise in the 
course of business. These risks 
are liquidity or funding risk, 
foreign exchange risk, interest 
rate risk and counterparty risk. 
The instruments are used within 
the parameters set by the 
Investment & Finance 
Committee of the Board, and 
are not traded for a profit. The 
Group’s priority is to address 
the economic impact of 
financial risks using the most 
efficient or appropriate 
approach. This may result in 
IFRS accounting volatility. Full 
details of treasury policies are 
on pages 135 to 138.
OVERVIEW
The Group has adequate 
committed debt finance to 
meet current trading 
requirements. The Group aims 
to have 70% to 80% of its debt 
at fixed interest rates to reduce 
the impact of interest rate 
fluctuations. Foreign exchange 
risk on transactions is not a 
large issue for the Group as the 
majority of its businesses 
operate in the country in 
which they are located. In 
principle, the underlying 
currency of net debt after 
taking account of derivatives is 
managed in proportion to the 
EBITDA in each currency. More 
than half of the Group’s profits 
are expected to be earned 
from revenue billed in US 
dollars outside the UK. The 
Group’s foreign assets are  
only partially hedged by its 
foreign currency debt and 
economically its earnings are 
most exposed to movements  
in value of the US dollar.  43

OUR APPROACH
As a Group we’ve always been 
committed to sustainable, 
long-term performance. It’s an 
approach that has served us 
well. 
Managing our businesses and 
brands responsibly, valuing our 
own people and respecting 
the communities we serve are 
the essential pre-requisites for 
our own success.
The people that run our 
businesses have considerable 
autonomy, but we expect 
each of them to act 
responsibly and in the long-
term interests of the Group.
Multiple CR campaigns are 
more effective than a single 
unified programme
We manage a portfolio of very 
diverse businesses. As such, a 
one-size-fits-all CR policy 
would be counter-productive. 
Each of our businesses 
operates in particular 
conditions. They understand 
their own markets. They are 
best placed to define and 
promote their own CR 
objectives.
Smart, highly-skilled people run 
these companies. They are 
used to acting independently. 
At Group level we typically 
help them most by backing 
their judgement. 
We aim to equip our people 
with the knowledge, the 
resources, the training and, 
crucially, the permission to 
take effective action. We try 
not to be prescriptive in our 
approach.
Our various businesses have 
evolved CR strategies to fit 
their distinct cultures and 
underlying objectives. 
Euromoney Institutional 
Investor controls multiple 
companies and has people all 
over the world. Every year it 
selects a single charity to 
support. All of its employees 
get to vote on the most 
deserving cause. This 
democratic process promotes 
fund raising and is a valuable 
binding agent for the 
company. 
Volunteering and giving 
something back are important 
cultural building blocks at 
Hobsons. The company has 
worked locally and globally for 
many years to support schools. 
A&N Media has different 
priorities. Its newspapers want 
to forge connections with their 
respective readerships. At 
Associated Newspapers the 
emphasis is on national issues 
that resonate with readers. For 
the Northcliffe titles, it makes 
strategic sense to engage with 
local initiatives.
The issue for us is not whether to pursue corporate 
responsibility (CR), but how best to achieve it.
Corporate responsibility and sustainability are intimately 
interconnected. Businesses that take CR seriously are often 
better run, more efficient and more resilient. 45 DAILY MAIL AND GENERAL TRUST PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2011

improve our ability to swap 
stories and spread best 
practice.
We are reinforcing the link 
between sustainability and 
long-term performance
We are committed to 
sustainable practices across 
the Group. Our primary 
responsibility is to protect the 
long-term viability of our own 
businesses. Our attitude to 
sustainability helps us stay 
relevant in a changing world. 
CR activities support our 
strategic objectives in the 
following ways:
• They help attract and retain 
talent. For all our staff, 
especially younger recruits, 
taking on wider 
responsibilities adds to our 
appeal. Most people look 
for more from their 
workplace than mere 
bottom-line efficiency. They 
want to enjoy their work, 
spend time with friends and 
for their actions to have a 
positive influence. Our CR 
activities promote a 
Our approach to CR reflects 
our decentralised 
management philosophy 
Our Corporate Responsibility 
Committee reports directly to 
the Board. The Committee 
doesn’t formulate CR policy. 
We act in an advisory rather 
than an executive capacity. 
Our remit is to monitor 
environmental, waste, 
sustainability, employee, 
customer, supplier and 
community practices across 
DMGT. Committee members 
include interested parties with 
relevant Group-wide 
responsibilities and senior 
nominees from our five main 
business units. I have Board 
level responsibility.
We exchange experiences 
and record performance. We 
act as a sounding board and a 
forum for ideas. We discuss 
ways to improve and build on 
what’s already been 
achieved. 
We’ve invested heavily in

feel-good factor about the 
business that engages and 
motivates our people. 
• They encourage stronger 
links with key constituencies 
and communities. In a 
networked world, content 
providers succeed by 
staying at the heart of their 
communities. This is more 
likely when we’re not just 
responding to demand, but 
sharing customer concerns. 
CR initiatives, particularly 
those that engage supply 
chain partners, instil a sense 
of common purpose. 
Looking ahead, we will carry 
on promoting best practice 
and continue to build on the 
improvements we have 
already made across the 
Group.

ENVIRONMENT
For the fourth year in 
succession we have collected 
CO
2
 emissions data from  
each of our five operating 
companies. The data is 
collated and independently 
verified by the environmental 
audit consultancy, ICF 
International.
We are committed to 
comprehensive, transparent 
reporting of our environmental 
performance. DMGT has been 
a signatory to the international 
Carbon Disclosure Project 
(CDP) since 2008. This year we 
integrated our carbon data 
collection process with our 
financial reporting. This has 
streamlined administration 
and improved data reliability.
We have elected not to apply 
for re-certification with the 
Carbon Trust Standard in 2012. 
Previously the administrative 
costs of complying with the 
Standard were offset by 
certain tax advantages, but 
these have now been 
withdrawn. We are researching 
alternatives. We continue to 
focus on the CDP and on 
reducing our carbon footprint.
Despite an increase in 
economic activity our carbon 
footprint continued to shrink in 
2011. CO
2
 emissions stood at 
93,100 tCO
2
 (97,300 tCO
2
 2010), 
an 18% decrease against our 
2007 baseline (114,100 tCO
2
).
In 2007 we set ourselves the 
target of reducing overall 
emissions by at least 10% by 
2012. Having achieved our 
goal two years ahead of 
schedule we are building on 
those gains. We are consulting 
with our business units before 
setting new Group-wide 
emissions targets.

We are working hard to reduce 
environmental impacts across 
the Group. 
DMGT’s headquarters at 
Northcliffe House, also the 
London base of Associated 
Newspapers, Northcliffe Media 
and dmg::events, retains the 
prized ISO 14001 international 
environmental standard. 
This year we announced a 
three-year plan to transfer our 
London printing production 
from the ISO 14001-accredited 
Harmsworth Quays to a green 
field site in Thurrock. The 
Thurrock facility will set even 
higher standards for 
performance, environmental 
efficiency and waste 
minimisation. 
Euromoney Institutional 
Investor continued its 
programme of reducing 
operational hours for the main 
plant systems in its buildings. At 
RMS server virtualisation 
technology is improving 
performance, using physical 
servers and power 
consumption more efficiently, 
and reducing manufacturing 
waste.
Where commercial imperatives 
constrain the ability to reduce 
emissions, our businesses are 
adopting other carbon-saving 
measures. 
International travel is 
unavoidable for dmg::events 
executives. The London office 
has signed a five-year deal 
with the UK Forestry 
Commission-backed Heart of 
England Forest Project to plant 
and maintain a 20-acre 
broadleaf wood in the UK. 
During their lifetimes these 
additional trees will capture at 
least 3,100 tonnes of CO
2
, well 
over five times the London 
team’s annual air travel 
emissions.
As a content-led business, 
perhaps the biggest 
environmental contribution we 
can make is by promoting the 
green agenda. 
Metro’s inaugural four-day 
EcoVelocity event, at Battersea 
Power station in London during 
September, advanced the 
cause of low-carbon motoring. 
The event showcased the 
latest low emission vehicles 
from leading manufacturers. 
Landmark Information Group’s 
Green IT Awards event is now 
in its second year. The awards 
reward the technologies and 
organisations doing most to 
improve the IT industry’s 
environmental performance.
The Exeter Express and  
Echo underlined its green 
credentials by winning the 
Environmental Initiative of the 
Year for the second year 
running at the 2011 Newspaper 
Awards. Its Green Team Project 
is a simple and effective 
campaign run with the local 
council that engages schools 
by awarding points for 
completing green tasks.
WASTE
We have identified waste 
minimisation as a particular 
area of focus. Reducing waste 
is not only environmentally 
desirable it makes good 
business sense.
Newsprint production waste, 
the most significant element  
of waste arising from our 
activities, again reduced this 
year. We work closely with our 
paper suppliers to raise the 
proportion of recycled stock 
we use without compromising 
quality. 
We have identified three high 
impact areas – paper, water 
and ink. In each we continue 
to make progress across the 
supply chain.
Our office-based divisions 
have limited direct 
environmental impact. We 
recycle paper in all our global 
offices. Where the 
infrastructure supports it we 
embrace other recycling 
initiatives. Plastic, glass, metals, 
toner cartridges, mobile 
phones and IT equipment are 
all being recycled. 
Following a successful 
collaboration between A&N 
Media and the Waste to 
Wonder charity last year, we 
have extended our recycling 
programme for redundant 
office furniture to other 
businesses across the Group. 
EMPLOYEES
The Group has policies in 
place on equal opportunities, 
whistleblowing, health and 
safety and the environment. 
As an equal opportunities 
employer we believe it is 
important for our staff to feel  
a connection between their 
values and their work. 
We aim to promote an 
inspiring, healthy and inclusive 
work environment in all our 
businesses. In 2011 the Hobsons 
Cincinatti Headquarters was 
voted best workplace in its 
region.
Internally, we communicate 
using multiple channels, 
including DMGT Connect, our 
intranet site, and DMGT Chatter, 
our business collaborative 
working platform.
DMGT Chatter launched this 
year. Its use is helping to 
accelerate the exchange of 
ideas. The CR group, one of 
the first to make use of the 
service, now runs regular, 
scheduled online chats and 
conference calls. 
ENGAGING WITH 
COMMUNITIES
Employees
We encourage all our people 
to engage with stakeholder 
communities and get involved 
with charitable projects. Each 
business approaches this in its 
own way.
Euromoney Institutional 
Investor’s employees vote for  
a single project each year.  
In 2011 they are raising money 
to provide clean water and 
sanitation in Kechene, 
Ethiopia. Some £250,000–
£300,000 will be contributed 
through staff fundraising, from 
the business’s charity budget 
and by clients.

EDR identifies a range of 
causes, focusing primarily on 
cancer and child-centred 
charities. It has set up schemes 
that make it easy for 
employees to volunteer and 
give back to their community. 
Every single EDR employee got 
involved in the programme  
in 2011.
Three of dmg::events-Digital 
Marketing’s employees were 
diagnosed with cancer this 
year. This became the stimulus 
for a series of fund-raisers for 
cancer charities. In New York 
staff joined the Bowling for 
Breast Cancer event. In San 
Francisco they took on the 
Livestrong long-distance 
cycling challenge in aid of the 
Lance Armstrong foundation. 
Also in California, iMedia 
employees joined a Light The 
Night walk for the Leukemia 
and Lymphona Society. 
The devastating consequences 
of the tsunami in Japan moved 
RMS staff to action. A month-
long, employee initiated 
campaign raised over $44,000. 
When a tragic accident took 
the lives of four miners in 
Swansea Valley, close to  
where South West Wales Media 
employees live and work, the 
South Wales Evening Post was 
among the first to contribute  
to a fund for the families. It 
continued the campaign to 
achieve the £200,000 target.
A&N Media staff are 
encouraged to raise funds with 
match-funded support for the 
charity of their choice. Despite 
difficult economic conditions 
in 2011 total donations rose by 
over a third to £116,000 
(£77,000 2010).
Customers and suppliers
We often link up with supply 
chain partners to further a 
deserving cause. One of the 
more significant examples this 
year was at the Euromoney 
Awards for Excellence dinner 
in September. This event, now 
in its twentieth year, is the most 
prestigious in the financial 
markets calendar. Over 500 
bankers from all over the world 
attended. At a charity auction 
held that evening, some very 
generous customers raised 
£597,000 for the Little Rock 
School in the Kibera slum in 
Nairobi, enough to guarantee 
the school’s future and build 
an orphanage nearby.
But the scale of the donation  
is only part of the story. A&N 
Media has been joining forces 
with suppliers and customers 
to make a difference on a 
wide range of projects. Mail 
Classified for instance 
collaborated with Dubai 
Tourism to raise £1,700 in a 
charity raffle for the ‘Just a 
Drop’ clean water campaign. 
YOU Magazine works with 
Clarins on a major annual 
award scheme. The Clarins 
Most Dynamisante Woman of 
the Year award recognises an 
exceptional British woman 
working for underprivileged or 
sick children with a £30,000 
award for her charity.
Communities 
In a long-standing partnership 
with the charity Plan, Hobsons 
employees raise funds to help 
build schools in some of the 
world’s poorest countries. 
Previous projects have been in 
Namibia, Nicaragua, Malaysia, 
Guatemala, Laos, Kenya, 
Vietnam, Bolivia, and Ghana. 
This year employees visited 
Rwanda to witness 
construction of another  
new primary school.
Jobsite UK is helping children 
locally. Employees give time  
to assist in schools close to  
its Havant headquarters.  
It also runs a football 
mentoring scheme  
alongside Portsmouth FC. 
Youth is also a priority at DMGT 
HQ. It supports the Prince’s 
Trust, which last year helped 
44,000 young people get back 
in work or education.
Metro has built a 3.3 million 
readership by forging close 
links with the cities it serves. 
When riots erupted in England 
over the summer the paper 
wanted to reach out to 
affected companies. It offered 
them free advertising space 
and design services. The 
initiative soon extended to 
other titles. Associated 
Newspapers as a whole 
donated over £2 million worth 
of advertising space in the 
aftermath of the riots.
A&N Media is proud to have 
made a donation to the Team 
2012 Fundraising Appeal, 
supporting Britain’s athletes on 
their journey to success. The 
company is also encouraging 
homegrown talent with 
journalism scholarships, an MA 
in journalism at the University 
of Kent, the Catch-22 
internship scheme and with a 
Journalism Diversity Fund.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
The Directors present their 
Report and Accounts for the 
year ended 2nd October, 2011.
ACTIVITIES
The principal activities of the 
Group are set out on pages 6 
and 7 of this Annual Report.
The analysis of revenue and 
operating profit for the years 
ended 2nd October, 2011 and 
3rd October, 2010 are included 
as Note 3 to the Consolidated 
Income Statement.
BUSINESS REVIEW
The information that fulfils the 
Companies Act requirements 
of the business review is 
included in the Business Review 
on pages 12 to 43. This includes 
a review of the development 
of the business of the Group 
during the year, of its position 
at the end of the year and  
of likely future developments  
in its business. Details of  
the principal risks and 
uncertainties facing the  
Group are set out below.
1) FAILURE TO RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO CHANGES IN OUR KEY MARKETS
The way in which our businesses deliver information to customers and the types of information provided are subject to constant change. This can 
result in structural market changes that have the potential to redefine or eliminate current markets served by our businesses. Technological 
innovations such as tablet and other mobile devices, cloud computing and the proliferation of social media impact all of our businesses. Our 
products and services, and their means of delivery, are also affected by competitor activity and changing customer behaviour. 
POTENTIAL IMPACT MITIGATION
The impact is both positive and negative. Failure to identify and 
respond to changes in the key markets in which the Group operates 
increases the risk of being left behind by both competitors and our 
customers with a resultant direct impact on Group results. 
The transition from traditional publishing and print advertising to online 
and mobile products is an example of the challenges faced by the 
Group. This affects a number of businesses including Euromoney and 
Associated Newspapers, but can be seen most acutely in Northcliffe. 
Conversely, new technologies and cloud solutions present opportunities 
for the Group. A good example of this is RMS which through its new 
software solution project will offer clients improvements in data 
management, automation and operating efficiencies.
The Group’s strategy of diversification and its willingness to take a 
long-term view enables it to react to these challenges and opportunities 
when they arise. 
The autonomous culture of the Group encourages an entrepreneurial 
approach to the development of new opportunities in response to these 
threats. This is overseen by the DMGT senior management team. 
In particular, internet strategies, including mobile solutions, have been 
developed for each of the main segments of advertising revenue and  
as such, the print and online businesses are working closely together to 
maximise the synergies that exist between these two formats. 
As far as possible, each division manages its costs in line with changes to 
revenue. An example of this is the significant reductions to the cost base 
within Northcliffe.
2) EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN THE ECONOMY
A significant (although decreasing) proportion of the Group’s revenue (especially in the UK newspaper divisions) is derived from advertising which 
is impacted by fluctuations in the wider economy. A similar, although reduced, effect has been seen in group businesses that rely on non-
advertising revenues, especially in the financial and property markets.
POTENTIAL IMPACT MITIGATION
Advertising revenues have been heavily affected by the downturn in 
the global economy in the last three years. 
A continued recession, or a downturn in the economy or market 
sectors served by the Group, gives rise to a risk of not achieving 
forecast results.
Experience has demonstrated that the long-term strategy of diversifying 
the Group’s portfolio into business information and subscription revenue 
streams, along with investment in strong brands, makes the Group’s 
results both more strategically and commercially robust. 
As noted above, each division manages its cost base as far as possible in 
line with changes to revenue.
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The principal risks and uncertainties the Group faces vary across the different businesses and are the focus of the Risk 
Committee. These risks are identified in the DMGT Group Risk Register. The materiality of each risk is assessed against a 
framework to determine its significance and likelihood of occurrence. The Risk Register is used to determine the agenda 
and activity of the Risk Committee. The most material risks identified in the Risk Register, together with the steps taken to 
mitigate them, are described below. 
The geographic spread and diverse portfolio of businesses within the Group help to dilute the impact of some of the 
Group’s key risks. Certain of these risks are interdependent and should not be considered in isolation.  51

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
3) COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS
Group businesses are subject to legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which they operate. The key laws and regulations that impact  
the Group cover areas such as bribery and corruption, competition, data protection, privacy (including e-privacy), health and safety and 
employment law. Additionally, specific regulations from the Press Complaints Commission and the Audit Bureau of Circulation apply to the 
newspaper divisions.
The Group generates a significant amount of its revenue from publishing, be it newspapers, magazines, trade journals or information and data 
published online. As a result, there is an inherent risk of error which, in some instances, may give rise to claims for libel. 
The recent high profile events in the UK newspaper industry and the accusations of illegal news gathering practices have raised questions over 
press regulation, media ownership and relationships between the press, police and politicians. The Board has received assurances from the 
Editor-in-Chief that, so far as he is aware, such practices have not, and do not take place within Associated Newspapers. However, the Leveson 
Inquiry, which began on 14th November and will conclude by September 2012, is considering as part of its remit, the regulation of the industry. 
POTENTIAL IMPACT MITIGATION
A breach of legislation or regulations could have a significant impact 
on the Group both in terms additional costs, management time and 
reputational damage. Equally, the management time and cost of 
defending libel cases can be significant.
Increasing regulation of the newspaper industry could limit our 
editorial output and have a corresponding commercial impact  
on the business. 
Compliance with laws and regulations is taken seriously throughout the 
Group. The DMGT Code of Conduct (and supporting policies) sets out 
appropriate standards of business behaviour and highlights the key legal 
and regulatory issues affecting group businesses. Divisional and local 
management are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws 
and regulations, overseen by the Risk Committee.
All of our publications have controls in place, including legal review,  
to approve content that that may carry a libel risk. Journalists have 
received communications and training on the PCC Code, Data 
Protection and the Bribery Act.
Controls are also in place surrounding compliance with the Audit Bureau 
of Circulation’s regulations and other regulatory bodies to which we 
adhere.
4) PENSION SCHEME SHORTFALLS
Although closed to new employees in 2009, we continue to operate defined benefit (DB) pension schemes for our newspaper divisions and certain 
senior executives. The triennial valuation, agreed formally with the Trustees in June 2011, identified deficits in the schemes, a primary cause of 
which is the lower bond yields driven largely by Quantitative Easing measures. A new funding arrangement has since been agreed with the 
trustees of the schemes under which the company will provide a series of funding payments aimed at reducing the deficit in the main DB scheme 
over the next thirteen years.
POTENTIAL IMPACT MITIGATION
Reported earnings may be adversely affected by changes in our 
pension costs and funding requirements due to lower than expected 
investment returns or changes made to the risk profile of our 
investment portfolio.
Measures to mitigate the risks that impact the company’s balance sheet 
are under continuous review by the Group and there is an ongoing 
dialogue with the trustees of the pension schemes. A joint group, the  
Risk Management Committee, regularly reviews proposals that could 
achieve this aim.
Recent amendments to the scheme have reduced the longevity risk 
exposure by arranging for future accruals to be taken as cash or 
transferred at retirement to an insurance company to provide an annuity.
5) SUCCESSFULLY MANAGING CHANGE PROJECTS
At any given time there is a number of active capital and IT projects underway around the Group. The two most significant change projects 
currently are RMS’s new software solution project and A&N Media’s new print site at Thurrock. Further details on both these projects are given  
in the business review section. 
POTENTIAL IMPACT MITIGATION
If a project is successful, it delivers improvements in product offerings, 
efficiency gains and cost savings. There is, however, a risk of increased 
costs or lost revenues as a result of delays, unforeseen problems, loss of 
access to systems and data or production and delivery issues.
Every active capital project around the Group is subject to a rigorous 
planning process involving all key stakeholders. Significant capital 
projects are approved by the Investment and Finance Committee. 
Ongoing project management is in place to ensure that plans are 
delivered to timetable and specification. 
All key projects are monitored by the local board to ensure that risks  
and opportunities are managed throughout the process.  DAILY MAIL AND GENERAL TRUST PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2011 52

6) DATA INTEGRITY, AVAILABILITY AND SECURITY 
The quality and availability of the information products that DMGT businesses provide their clients is key to their success. This is true for many 
businesses in the Group, most notably within dmg::information and Euromoney. 
Information security has always been a key focus across DMGT. However, changing technology, mobile working, cloud based technologies, the 
consumerisation of IT and the growing use of social media create opportunities but is also a threat to information security and the protection of 
our data, and that of our customers.
POTENTIAL IMPACT MITIGATION
Any challenge to the integrity of information within a DMGT product 
could damage the reputation of that business resulting in lost revenue 
and potentially increased costs of remediation. A similar impact would 
be felt if a product was unavailable for a period of time.
An information security incident resulting in the loss, theft, corruption, 
inappropriate use or unavailability of sensitive information held by the 
Group could lead to operational and regulatory challenges, and 
could impact on financial results.
Inadequate disclosure of information security breaches could have a 
significant reputational impact on the Group.
Every DMGT business understands that quality and availability of data is 
key to the reputation and ongoing success of the Group. Quality controls 
including rigorous checks, review and restricted access to amend and 
publish exist in every business with information products. Availability is 
managed through detailed and tested business continuity plans.
Information security risks are managed locally by the individual 
businesses, with support from divisional management and DMGT Risk & 
Assurance. The Risk Committee monitors and oversees information 
security and data protection risks and controls around the Group. 
Businesses are expected to comply with the information security policy 
and minimum baseline standards.
 
7) IMPACT OF A MAJOR DISASTER OR OUTBREAK OF DISEASE
There is a risk of disruption of Group operations as a result of a major disaster, outbreak of disease or other external threat. The Group’s operations 
are geographically diversified which limits the impact of any given incident. The largest locations are Northcliffe House and Harmsworth Quays in 
London, Euromoney’s offices in London and New York, and RMS’s headquarters in California. Northcliffe House is the Group’s headquarters as well 
as housing Associated Newspapers and some businesses within dmg::events. Harmsworth Quays is A&N Media’s main printing centre and a 
contingency location for Northcliffe House.
The events and training businesses within dmg::events and Euromoney rely to some extent on the confidence in, and ability of, delegates and 
speakers to travel internationally.
POTENTIAL IMPACT MITIGATION
A major incident (particularly in a key location) could affect the 
operations of the business at that location and impact their ability to 
produce or deliver its products, which could reduce the demand for 
them or increase costs.
Any disaster which significantly affects the wider environment or the 
infrastructure in an area in which the Group operates could adversely 
impact Group results.
Significant disruptions to, or reductions in, international travel for an 
extended period of time could lead to multiple events and training 
courses being postponed or cancelled which could have an impact on 
the Group’s performance. 
Business continuity plans, which are tested regularly, are in place 
across all business. 
Contingency planning is in place in the events businesses and virtual 
event alternatives are being developed. Where appropriate, 
cancellation insurance is taken out. 
8) RELIANCE ON KEY MANAGEMENT AND STAFF RETENTION
DMGT is reliant on the talented and successful management and staff across all of its businesses. Many businesses and products are dependent 
upon specialist, technical expertise. 
POTENTIAL IMPACT MITIGATION
The inability to recruit and retain talented people could impact the 
Group’s ability to maintain its performance and deliver growth.
When key staff leave or retire, there is a risk that knowledge or 
competitive advantage is lost.
The DMGT Human Resources Director works with divisional and 
executive management across the Group on a formal approach to 
talent management and succession planning. This includes payment 
of competitive rewards, employee performance and turnover 
monitoring and a variety of approaches to staff communication.
Succession planning and long-term incentive plans are in place for 
senior management. 53

9) COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIPS, INCLUDING VOLATILITY OF NEWSPRINT PRICES
The Group is reliant on a number of commercial relationships with key customers, suppliers and third parties. The most significant of these 
relationships is with the newsprint suppliers. Other key examples include large advertising agencies and major retailers in A&N Media, key venues 
and agents in dmg::events and Euromoney, and data providers in dmg::information. 
Newsprint continues to represent a significant proportion of our costs and prices are subject to volatility arising from variations in supply and 
demand.
POTENTIAL IMPACT MITIGATION
The loss of, or damage to, any key commercial relationship could have  
a material impact on the Group’s ability to produce and deliver its 
products. 
An increase in newsprint prices would impact the cost base of A&N Media.
Significant time and resources are dedicated to managing and 
developing these relationships to ensure they continue to operate 
satisfactorily.
The Group’s newsprint requirements are managed by a dedicated 
newsprint buying team and monitored by the board of Harmsworth 
Printing. Where possible, long-term arrangements are agreed with 
suppliers to limit the potential for volatility. 
10) ACQUISITION AND DISPOSAL RISK
As well as launching and building new businesses, an integral part of the Group’s strategy has, and will continue to be, the acquisition (and 
successful integration) of businesses that expand expertise whilst supporting existing products. The strategy also results in the disposal of businesses 
that no longer fit the Group’s investment criteria.
POTENTIAL IMPACT MITIGATION
Failure to identify acquisition targets could result in an opportunity cost 
to the business.
Equally, an unsuccessful integration of acquired subsidiaries, or an 
acquired business that fails to generate the expected returns, could 
result in the underperformance of the Group or impairment losses. This 
could also divert management time from other operational matters.
Our ability to achieve optimal value from disposals as well as the failure 
to realise other anticipated benefits of a disposal could also impact 
financial results. 
The majority of acquisitions are in related markets and are smaller 
businesses with a high potential for growth. This reduces the risk from 
any one acquisition.
Acquisitions are approved by the Investment and Finance Committee 
and managed by divisional and local management with oversight 
from the centre. Detailed due diligence is performed by internal teams 
and external advisors on all potential acquisitions.
The retention of key employees in the acquired business is often 
required as part of the purchase. Board level monitoring is performed 
post-acquisition.
Disposals, including the decision to divest, are overseen by the Board 
and by the director of Strategy Development.
11) TREASURY OPERATIONS
The Group Treasury function is responsible for executing treasury policy which seeks to manage the Group’s funding, liquidity and treasury 
derivatives risks. More specifically, these include currency exchange rate fluctuations, interest rate risks, counterparty risk and liquidity and debt 
levels. These risks are described in more detail in Note 32 to the Financial Statements.
POTENTIAL IMPACT MITIGATION
If the treasury policy does not adequately mitigate the financial risks 
summarised above or is not correctly executed, it could result in 
unforeseen derivative losses or higher than expected finance costs.
The Treasury Function undertakes high value transactions hence there 
is an inherent high risk of payment fraud or error having an adverse 
impact on Group results.
The Investment and Finance Committee is responsible for reviewing and 
approving Group Treasury policies which are executed by the Group 
Treasury department, overseen by the Deputy Finance director. 
Segregation of duties and authorisation limits are in place for all 
payments made. The Treasury Function is subject to an annual internal 
audit.
12) UNFORESEEN TAX LIABILITIES
The Group’s operations are global and therefore earnings are subject to taxation at differing rates across a number of jurisdictions. Whilst 
endeavouring to manage the Group’s tax affairs in an efficient manner, there will always be a certain level of uncertainty when provisioning for 
tax liabilities due to an ever more complex international tax environment.
POTENTIAL IMPACT MITIGATION
Changing tax laws could increase tax liabilities and have an adverse 
impact on financial results.
Due to the diverse and global nature of the Group, internal or external 
factors could give rise to unplanned tax liabilities.
The team of in-house specialists, in conjunction with divisional 
management and external experts, review all tax arrangements within 
the Group and keep abreast of changing legislation. DAILY MAIL AND GENERAL TRUST PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2011 54

FORWARD-LOOKING 
STATEMENT
This Annual Report contains 
certain forward-looking 
statements with respect to  
the principal risks and 
uncertainties facing the 
Group. By their nature, these 
statements involve risk and 
uncertainty because they 
relate to events and depend 
on circumstances that may or 
may not occur in the future. 
There are a number of factors 
that could cause actual results 
or developments to differ 
materially from those 
expressed or implied by these 
forward-looking statements. 
No assurances can be given 
that the forward- looking 
statements are reasonable as 
they can be affected by a 
wide range of variables. The 
forward-looking statements 
reflect the knowledge and 
information available at the 
date of preparation of this 
Annual Report, and will not be 
updated during the year. 
Nothing in this Annual Report 
should be construed as a profit 
forecast.
RESULTS AND DIVIDENDS
The profit after taxation of the 
Group amounted to £128 
million. After charging minority 
interests of £16 million, the 
Group profit for the year 
amounted to £112 million.
An interim dividend of 5.3 
pence per share was paid on 
the Ordinary and ‘A’ Ordinary 
Non-Voting Shares and the 
Directors recommend that a 
final dividend of 11.7 pence 
per share be paid on 10th 
February, 2012 making 17.0 
pence per share for the year 
(2010 16.0 pence).

INVESTMENTS
The Company’s principal 
subsidiaries are set out on 
pages 168 and 169.
Changes in the Group’s 
tangible fixed assets and 
investments during the year 
are set out in Notes 21, 22 and 
23. There was no material 
difference between the book 
value and market value of the 
Group’s land and buildings.
POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS
On 14th October, 2011, A&N 
Media announced that it had 
agreed to merge the online 
property business of its Digital 
Property Group with those of 
Zoopla Limited. On 22nd 
November, 2011, the Group 
increased its equity interest in 
Euromoney by 1% through 
market purchases at a cost  
of £10 million.
SHARE CAPITAL
Details of allotments of share 
capital during the year, which 
arose solely from the exercise 
of options, are given in Note 36.
At the Annual General 
Meeting on 9th February 2011, 
the Company was granted the 
authority to purchase up to 
10% of its own shares.
During the year, the Company 
transferred 2,114,900 shares out 
of Treasury, representing 0.57% 
of called up ‘A’ Ordinary 
Non-Voting Shares, in order to 
satisfy incentive schemes.
The Company also purchased 
2,340,214 ‘A’ Ordinary Non-
Voting Shares for holding in 
Treasury, having a nominal 
value of £292,527 in order to 
match obligations under 
various incentive plans. The 
consideration paid for these 
shares was £11.7 million. Shares 
purchased during the year 
represented 0.63% of the 
called up ‘A’ Ordinary Non–
Voting Share capital  
at 2nd October, 2011.
The Company has two classes 
of share capital. Its total share 
capital comprises 5% of 
Ordinary shares and 95% of ‘A’ 
Ordinary Non-Voting Shares. 
Full details of the Company’s 
share capital are given in  
Note 36.
EMPLOYEES
Under the Group’s general 
policy of decentralised 
management, it is the 
responsibility of the 
management in each 
subsidiary to encourage the 
involvement and participation 
of employees in their 
company. The methods used 
vary company by company, 
but the linking to performance 
targets of a significant portion 
of remuneration is one widely 
used means.
The Group gives full and fair 
consideration to suitable 
applications from disabled 
persons for employment. If 
existing employees become 
disabled they will continue to 
be employed, wherever 
practicable, in the same job 
or, if this is not practicable, 
every effort will be made to 
find suitable alternative 
employment and to provide 
appropriate training.
INFORMATION ABOUT 
PERSONS WITH WHOM THE 
COMPANY HAS 
CONTRACTUAL OR OTHER 
ARRANGEMENTS ESSENTIAL 
TO THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS 
Group companies undertake 
business with a range of 
customers and suppliers. There 
is no dependence on any 
particular contractual 
arrangement, other than those 
disclosed in Note 39 to the 
Accounts as regards ink and 
printing, where arrangements 
are in place until 2015 and 
2022 respectively to obtain 
competitive prices and to 
secure supplies. 
As regards the Group’s 
principal commodity, 
newsprint, arrangements are 
made annually with a range of 
suppliers to ensure the security 
of supply at the best available 
prices, having regard to the 
need for the necessary quality. 
Particularly in the light of its 
strategy to create a diversified 
international portfolio of 
media businesses, the Group is 
not dependent on any 
suppliers of other commodities, 
nor for its revenue on any 
particular customer. 
Distribution arrangements are 
in place to ensure the delivery 
of newspapers to retail outlets.
POLICY ON PAYMENT OF 
SUPPLIERS
The Group’s policy on supplier 
payments varies across its 
subsidiaries. These companies 
have no formal code or 
standard which deals 
specifically with the payment 
of suppliers. However, their 
policy is to ensure that the 
terms of payment, as specified 
by, and agreed with the 
supplier at the outset, are not 
exceeded.
The Company had no trade 
creditors at the year end date.
The Group’s average payment 
period, calculated on the basis 
of year-end trade creditors,  
is 70 days (2010 66 days), 
although this is dependent on 
the year-end date and cannot 
therefore be regarded as 
meaningful.
DONATIONS
Charitable donations made by 
the Group in the year 
amounted to £1,392,000 (2010 
£860,000). This excludes the 
cost of publicity, often 
provided free of charge by the 
Group’s titles, and funds raised 
by them, further details on 
which are given in the 
Corporate Responsibility 
Report on pages 44 to 47 of 
this Annual Report. No political 
donations were made by the 
Group. 55

DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES 
STATEMENT
The Directors are responsible 
for preparing the Annual 
Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with 
applicable law and 
regulations.
Company law requires the 
Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial 
year. Under that law the 
Directors are required to 
prepare the Group financial 
statements in accordance with 
International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European 
Union and Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation and have elected 
to prepare the parent 
Company financial statements 
in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United 
Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and applicable 
law). Under Company law the 
Directors must not approve the 
accounts unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Company and of 
the profit or loss of the 
Company for that period.
In preparing the parent 
Company financial 
statements, the Directors are 
required to:
•  select suitable accounting 
policies and then apply 
them consistently;
•  make judgments and 
accounting estimates that 
are reasonable and 
prudent;
• state whether applicable UK 
Accounting Standards have 
been followed, subject to 
any material departures 
disclosed and explained in 
the financial statements; 
and
•  prepare the financial 
statements on the going 
concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume 
that the Company will 
continue in business.
In preparing the Group 
financial statements, 
International Accounting 
Standard 1 requires that 
Directors:
• properly select and apply 
accounting policies;
• present information, 
including accounting 
policies, in a manner that 
provides relevant, reliable, 
comparable and 
understandable 
information;
• provide additional 
disclosures when 
compliance with the 
specific requirements in 
IFRSs are insufficient to 
enable users to understand 
the impact of particular 
transactions, other events 
and conditions on the 
entity’s financial position 
and financial performance; 
and
• make an assessment of the 
Company’s ability to 
continue as a going 
concern.
The Directors are responsible 
for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain 
the Company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the 
Company and enable them to 
ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. They  
are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of  
the Company and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible 
for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and 
financial information included 
on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the United 
Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions.
RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT
We confirm that to the best of 
our knowledge:
•  the financial statements, 
prepared in accordance 
with International Financial 
Reporting Standards, give  
a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit or loss of 
the Company and the 
undertakings included in 
the consolidation taken as  
a whole; and
•  the Business Review, which  
is incorporated into the 
Directors’ Report, includes  
a fair review of the 
development and 
performance of the business 
and the position of the 
Company and the 
undertakings included in 
the consolidation taken as  
a whole, together with a 
description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that 
they face.
AUDITORS
Each of the persons who is a 
Director at the date of 
approval of this Annual Report 
confirms that:
•  so far as the Director is 
aware, there is no relevant

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
The Code, issued by the 
Financial Reporting Council in 
May 2010, is part of the Listing 
Rules and applied to the 
Company throughout the year.
The Company has substantially 
complied with the provisions of 
the Code throughout the year, 
except where the Board has 
determined that they are 
In addition, the Chairman was 
not independent on 
appointment (Code provision 
A3.1). Whilst a formal review  
of each Director’s training 
requirements was not 
undertaken, Directors are 
encouraged to keep up to 
date and are provided with 
regular communications to 
enable them to do so.
inappropriate to the particular 
circumstances of the 
Company. The areas in which 
the Company has not applied 
the Code during the year 
essentially arise from the 
composition of the Board and 
are summarised in the table 
below:
THE BOARD
The Company is headed by a 
Board which comprises a 
balance of seven executive 
Directors, including the 
Chairman and Chief Executive, 
and eight non-executive 
Directors. Biographical details 
of each of the Directors are set 
out on page 48 and 49. The 
Board was refreshed in the 
The Company is committed to high standards of corporate 
governance. The paragraphs below and in the Remuneration 
Report on pages 62 to 78 describe how the Board has applied 
the principles set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(‘the Code’).
Provision Area Details of non-compliance and mitigating circumstances
A4.1 Composition of the Board The Board has not identified a senior independent non-executive Director since it believes 
that to identify such an individual is potentially divisive to a unitary body, as this Board is, and 
disruptive to the role of the Chairman.
A4.2 Board Evaluation The non-executive Directors did not meet as a group without the Chairman since his 
performance was assessed by the Remuneration Committee (without the Chairman being 
present).
B1.1 Composition of the Board Less than half of the Board are independent non-executive Directors. The Board believes 
that its current composition is appropriate and that a good balance is achieved from its 
non-executive Directors in terms of skill and independence.
B2.1 Composition of the 
Nominations Committee
Independent non-executive Directors do not comprise a majority of the Committee’s 
members since Mr Balsemão is the only independent non-executive Director appointed. 
Nevertheless, the Board believes that the Committee operates well.
B6.2 Board Evaluation The Board has determined to continue to conduct evaluation internally by means of a 
questionnaire, rather than through contracting external consultants every three years. The 
process is refreshed regularly and has proved valuable in driving the Board’s agenda.
C3.1 Composition of the Audit 
Committee
The Committee included two independent non-executive Directors rather than three as set 
out in the Code. The Nominations Committee will take this into account at the time of the 
next Board appointment. The Board believes that the Committee operates independently 
and benefits from the skill and experience of its current composition.
D1.5 Service contracts and 
compensation
The service contracts of Messrs Morgan and Dacre exceeded the one year recommended 
in the Code during the year. However, both will reduce to one year over the next twelve 
months, as explained in the Remuneration Report on page 78.
D2.1 Composition of the 
Remuneration Committee
The Committee comprises one independent non-executive Director, rather than two as set 
out in the Code, as explained on page 63 of the Remuneration Report. 57 DAILY MAIL AND GENERAL TRUST PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2011

BOARD MEETINGS
The Board normally meets five 
times a year and at such other 
times as are necessary. It 
discusses and approves the 
Group’s strategy. In addition, 
the Board receives reports and 
recommendations from time to 
time on any matter, which it 
considers significant to the 
Group. Most meetings include 
a presentation on one of the 
Group’s divisions or on specific 
topics. During the year, 
presentations included digital 
developments within A&N 
Media, a talent review, a 
presentation on technology 
and a study of the future of 
advertising. 
The Board met six times during 
the 2010/11 financial year, 
which were attended by all 
Directors, except that Mr Fallon 
was unable to attend two  
of them and Messrs Dacre, 
Dunstone, Balsemão and 
Beatty were each unable to 
attend one of them. Individual 
attendance by Directors is set 
out below.
MATTERS RESERVED FOR THE 
BOARD
The Board’s specific 
responsibilities are set out in a 
schedule of matters reserved 
to the Board which is published 
on the Company’s website at 
www.dmgt.co.uk/corporate 
governance. 
These are summarised below:
• Board and Committee 
appointments;
• The approval of financial 
statements and all 
information sent to 
shareholders;
• The setting of dividends;
• The setting of fees payable 
to Directors;
• Approval of major 
acquisitions and disposals 
and capital expenditure; 
and
• Review of Group pension 
Schemes.
Other matters addressed by 
the Board are:
• Approval of the Group’s 
strategy.
• Approval of the Group’s 
annual budget.
• Ensuring maintenance of  
a sound system of internal 
control and risk 
management.
CHAIRMAN AND  
CHIEF EXECUTIVE
The division of responsibilities 
between the Executive 
Chairman and the Chief 
Executive is understood and 
works well. The Chairman’s  
role is to lead the Board and 
oversee the Company’s 
operations and strategy at a 
specific meeting and is 
updated on progress at each 
meeting by the Chief Executive. 
The Chief Executive’s role is to 
manage the Company, 
develop strategy and ensure 
its successful implementation.

The Board believes that five 
non-executive Directors  
may be considered to be 
independent under the Code, 
namely Messrs Dunstone, 
Balsemão, Verey, Berry and 
Trempont.
Messrs Hemingway and 
Gillespie are not regarded by 
the Board as independent 
under the Code because they 
have advised the Company 
over many years; nor is Mr 
Nelson because he is an 
advisor to the Chairman. 
Nevertheless, the Board 
believes that these non-
executive Directors make an 
important contribution to its 
deliberations and have 
invaluable experience of the 
Company, its business and its 
staff. Although Messrs 
Dunstone and Balsemao have 
been non-executive Directors 
for more than nine years,  
both have continued to 
demonstrate independence  
in terms of character and 
judgement.
INFORMATION  
AND PROFESSIONAL 
DEVELOPMENT
Procedures have been 
established to ensure that the 
Board receives timely and 
appropriate information both 
for its meetings and regularly 
between meetings. All Directors 
are offered such training as is 
considered necessary, both on 
appointment and at any 
subsequent time. Both Mr 
Daintith and Mr Trempont  
were provided with induction 
on appointment, including 
meetings with senior 
management across the 
Group. There is an agreed 
procedure for Directors to take 
independent professional 
advice at the Company’s 
expense, if necessary.
ELECTION AND RE-ELECTION
The Company’s Articles of 
Association require that a 
Director appointed by the 
Board must stand for election 
at the next Annual General 
Meeting. Thereafter all 
Directors are subject to 
re-election at least every three 
years. The Board has decided, 
however, to adopt the 
provision in the Code that all 
Directors should seek annual 
re-election.
The Company’s Articles were 
last amended by a special 
resolution of Ordinary 
shareholders in February 2010 
in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006. 
The terms and conditions  
of appointment of the 
non-executive Directors are 
available for inspection at  
the Registered Office of the 
Company during usual 
business hours.
BOARD EVALUATION
The Board has undertaken its 
annual evaluation of its own 
performance and that of its 
individual Directors. It reviewed 
its performance by reference 
to the schedule of matters 
reserved for it. The evaluation 
process took the form of a 
questionnaire sent to each 
Director, seeking their views on 
the handling of strategy by the 
Board; the structure of Board 
meetings, quality of papers 
and communications; areas of 
operations presented; balance 
of skills; consideration of 
Directors’ views; and solicited 
other comments. The Chairman 
reported the consensus view 
on performance to the Board 
at its meeting in October 2011, 
enabling it to conclude that it 
had been effective in the year 
under review. No changes to 
procedures were judged 
necessary.
BOARD COMMITTEES
The Board has established 
Nominations, Remuneration, 
Audit, Risk and Corporate 
Responsibility Committees with 
mandates to deal with specific 
aspects of its business. The 
remits of these committees are 
published on the Company’s 
website at www.dmgt.com. 
Details of the membership of 
these committees are given on 
pages 48 and 49 and 58 to 60. 
Each committee reports to  
the Board at every regular 
meeting. In October 2011,  
the Board carried out a review 
of the performance of its 
committees and concluded 
that they had been effective  
in the year. DAILY MAIL AND GENERAL TRUST PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2011 58

INVESTMENT AND FINANCE 
COMMITTEE
Operating decisions are 
delegated to the Investment 
and Finance Committee which 
determines all matters relating 
to the Group’s financial affairs.
The Investment and Finance 
Committee works alongside 
the DMGT Leadership Team 
with the objective of improving 
investment decision making and 
Group strategy development. 
The Committee comprises  
the Viscount Rothermere (its 
chairman) and Messrs Morgan, 
Daintith, Dutton, Hemingway 
and Nelson. Mr Daintith 
succeeded Mr Williams in 
March. The Deputy Finance 
Director, Mr Perry, is secretary 
to the Committee. The director 
of strategy development, Ms 
FitzGerald, attends meetings 
at the invitation of the 
Committee. It held eight 
meetings during the year 
which were attended by all  
of its members, except by Mr 
Hemingway in June and 
September.
VALUE CREATION AND 
STRATEGY
The basis on which the 
Company generates value 
over the longer term and  
the strategy for delivering its 
objectives are set out in the 
Chief Executive’s Review on 
pages 12 to 21.
COMPANY SECRETARY
The Company Secretary, Mr 
Jennings, is responsible for 
advising the Board through the 
Chairman on all governance 
issues. All Directors have 
access to the advice and 
services of the Secretary.
NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE
The Nominations Committee 
comprises three Directors: the 
Viscount Rothermere (its 
chairman), Mr Hemingway 
and Mr Balsemão. Mr Perry, is 
secretary to the Committee. 
The Chief Executive and the 
HR director attend most 
meetings at the invitation  
of the Committee.
The Committee met three 
times during the year and all 
meetings were attended by all 
serving members. Individual

The Committee reviews the 
structure, size and composition 
of the Board and makes 
recommendations to the 
Board on any changes.  
During the year it nominated 
Mr Trempont to the Board  
as a new independent 
non-executive Director. It 
determined from its search of 
international, including female, 
candidates centred in the  
US with a strong technology 
background, that Mr Trempont’s 
experience made him the 
preferred candidate. 
Dominique Trempont is based 
in Menlo Park, California, and  
is an executive and board 
member in large multinational 
high tech companies and  
start ups.
His appointment has brought 
considerable technology and 
international experience to  
the Board, widening further 
the range of insights and 
perspectives brought to its 
deliberations.
External advice was taken, but 
advertising was not required in 
this instance. 
The Committee considered the 
benefits of diversity, including 
gender, during this search as 
recommended by the Code. In 
May it considered the Davies 
Report, published in February, 
on how to increase the number 
of women on the Board.
It subsequently reviewed the 
Company’s statement on 
gender diversity. It agreed to 
re-evaluate its search criteria. 
Whilst supportive of the Davies 
recommendation, which is a 
focused aspiration, the 
Committee’s view is that the 
diversity discussion is broader 
than gender. It is about 
ensuring that there is an 
appropriate range and 
balance of skills, experience 
and background on the Board. 
Achieving this balance is a key 
determinant of any new Board 
appointment we make.
The Committee continued to 
review succession planning  
for both executive and 
non-executive Directors. It also 
formally nominated Mr Daintith 
to the Board as Finance 
Director in succession to Mr 
Williams, as explained in last 
year’s Annual Report.
RELATIONS WITH 
SHAREHOLDERS
The Company maintains  
a regular programme of 
contact with its institutional 
shareholders. In the past year, 
this has included meetings in 
London, Scotland, Canada 
and the USA.
Non-executive Directors are 
kept informed of the views of 
institutional shareholders by 
the regular distribution of 
analysts’ reports and feedback 
is provided from institutional 
meetings.
All shareholders are welcome 
to attend the Annual General 
Meeting, of which 20 working 
days’ notice is given, where 
they have the opportunity  
to speak to Directors.
In the interests of transparency 
and to assist private 
shareholders, the Company 
posts all announcements and 
general presentations given to 
analysts and institutions on its 
corporate website. 
Shareholders and others 
interested in the Group are 
encouraged to use the site 
and to email questions which 
they might have to investor.

Questions to particular 
Directors should be addressed 
through the Secretary.
INTERNAL CONTROLS AND 
MANAGEMENT OF RISK
The Board has overall 
responsibility for the Group’s 
system of internal control. This 
system is designed to provide 
reasonable assurance over the 
safeguarding of assets and 
shareholders’ investment and 
the reliability of financial 
information. Any such system 
can, however, provide only 
reasonable, and not absolute, 
assurance of these matters. 
The Group operates on a 
divisional basis with each of 
the divisions described on 
pages 6 and 7 of the Annual 
Report having considerable 
autonomy as regards its 
operation and establishment 
of control systems. Overseeing 
the divisional structure is a 
central management 
responsible to the Board. 
Certain functions are 
undertaken centrally, notably 
newsprint buying, insurance, 
treasury, tax, pensions, and risk 
and assurance (including 
internal audit).
The Directors confirm that  
they have reviewed the 
effectiveness of the Group’s 
system of internal control for the 
period up to the date of the 
approval of the Accounts. The 
Board has not identified any 
significant failings or 
weaknesses during this review. 
In reviewing the effectiveness 
of the system of internal control, 
the Board has considered 
material controls (including 
those undertaken through its 
committees), including 
financial, operational and 
compliance controls and risk 
management systems as 
follows: 
1)  Operations of the Audit 
Committee
The Audit Committee, on 
behalf of the Board, has 
responsibility for the review of 
internal financial controls. It 
fulfils its remit by: 
• considering a summary of 
Group internal audit reports 
and such individual reports 
as it sees fit, management’s 
response to any 
recommendations and the 
progress of any required 
actions.
• reviewing a summary of 
letters to management

which are set centrally. 
2) Risk & Assurance
DMGT Risk & Assurance carries 
out internal audit activities for 
the Audit Committee across 
the Group. It has a direct 
reporting line to the Audit 
Committee and operates 
under its internal audit charter 
which covers: its purpose and 
objective; its authority and 
scope; independence issues; 
standards of professional 
practice; performance 
monitoring; planning; and 
reporting. 
An annual plan is developed 
each year using a risk focused 
approach and considering 
every part of the Group’s 
operations. Input is received 
from divisional and executive 
management, the Audit 
Committee, external auditors, 
and with reference to past 
reviews and key risks. The Audit 
Committee approve the 
internal audit plan for the 
forthcoming year in September. 
Any necessary changes to  
the plan during the year are 
agreed with the Chairman of 
the Audit Committee.
Risk & Assurance schedule, 
plan and complete internal 
audit reviews in accordance 
with the annual plan across the 
year; working closely with local 
and divisional management to 
determine a detailed scope of 
each review. Audit findings are 
categorised according to their 
significance and the overall 
control environment is rated for 
each review. Audit findings are 
cleared at the completion of 
the fieldwork and a formal 
report is issued which includes 
agreed actions and the 
timescale for remediation of 
control weaknesses identified. 
Regular follow up of audit 
points is completed by Risk & 
Assurance to ensure that 
management actions are 
completed within the 
timeframes agreed. 
The department also 
coordinates with a number of 
the divisions who undertake 
internal controls assurance 
reviews within their divisions. 
In addition to the schedule of 
reviews set out in the annual 
plan, an annual fraud risk 
assessment is completed by 
each key business in the Group 
detailing fraud risks and 
mitigating controls. Where 
mitigating controls are not 
identified, Risk & Assurance 
follow up with divisional 
management to ensure that 
these controls are subsequently 
implemented. All divisions  
are required to notify Risk & 
Assurance of any fraud 
incidents identified. This allows 
action to be taken where it is 
felt that control weaknesses 
may exist. 
The Head of Risk & Assurance 
meets regularly with the Audit 
Committee chairman and, at 
each Audit Committee 
meeting, reports on the internal 
audit activity across the Group, 
including progress against 
completion of the annual plan, 
a summary of the findings of 
assurance reviews undertaken 
both by internal audit and by 
divisional teams and the results 
of follow up reviews.
3)  Confirmation of Key Internal 
Controls
In 2011, the Finance Director 
implemented new internal 
controls and financial reporting 
checklists (replacing the 
existing year end checklist). 
Operating businesses within the 
Group are required to confirm 
their compliance with key 
internal financial controls to the 
Group Accounting department 
annually which, in turn, reports 
to the Finance Director. Risk & 
Assurance review these 
submissions and follow up on 
exceptions as appropriate. Risk 
& Assurance will complete a 
short audit at each sizeable 
business location around the 
Group to validate these key 
controls in 2012.
4) Risk Committee
The Risk Committee oversees 
the quality and formality of risk 
management processes across 
the Group by embedding the 
DMGT risk management model 
into the operating divisions. 
The remit and operation of the 
Risk Committee are described 
in more detail below. 
5)  Review of relevant and 
timely financial information
Divisional and executive 
Boards regularly review 
relevant and timely financial 
information that is produced 
from the management 
information systems operated 
across the Group. This is 
supported by a framework of 
rolling 12-month forecasts as 
well as annual budgets that 
are approved at a divisional 
level by the Investment and 
Finance Committee. During 
the year, the Finance Director 
implemented a new format for 
the management accounts, 
known as the GRID. This 
standardises the information 
and presentation across 
divisions and includes some 
additional information thus 
enabling better variance 
analysis of actual results  
versus budget, forecast  
and prior year.
6)  Operations of the 
Investment and Finance 
Committee
The evaluation of the benefits 
and risks of investment 
opportunities and financing 
proposals is undertaken by  
the Investment and Finance 
Committee. Above certain 
defined levels, however,  
the Board must approve 
programmes relating to 
acquisition and divestment 
proposals and capital 
expenditure. 
RISK COMMITTEE
The oversight and 
management of significant 
risks around the Group is 
undertaken by the Risk 
Committee and it accords with 
the Turnbull Guidance on 
internal control, appended to 
the Code. 
The Committee comprises 
Messrs Morgan, its chairman, 
Daintith, Dutton, Verey, Kass, 
the legal director of A&N 
Media and Mr Page, its deputy 
finance director. Mr Daintith 
succeeded Mr Williams as a 
member in March. Mr Verey 
provides a non-executive 
perspective to the review of 
risk management processes 
within the Group, as well as 
providing a direct link to the 
Audit Committee.
The Committee met four times 
during the year and all meetings 
were attended by all serving 
members. Individual

management addresses  
the opportunities and 
uncertainties relating to  
the business activities of the 
Group. The risk management 
process consists of the 
identification, evaluation  
and control of risks,  
which could threaten the 
achievement of the Group’s 
strategic, operational and 
financial objectives, as well as 
the active management of 
opportunities. The processes 
described below were in place 
throughout the year.
The Committee oversees the

Committee reviews specific 
risks and monitors 
developments in relevant 
legislation and regulation to 
consider the impact these 
might have on the Group and 
on its system of internal control. 
This year the Committee’s main 
focus was on the UK Bribery 
Act and implementation of the 
Group’s compliance 
programme. This included an 
update to the Group’s Code of 
Conduct and whistle blowing 
policy; issuance of a number 
of new employee policies and 
a training programme for the 
2,000 staff with roles potentially 
impacted by the new Act. 
Other topics considered by the 
Risk Committee included: key 
risks (and their management) 
for two major capital projects; 
health and safety, fraud (as 
part of the annual fraud risk 
assessment), data protection; 
information security; and 
business continuity and 
disaster recovery planning 
Members of the Risk Committee 
also maintain direct links with 
each of the main divisions 
through attendance of 
divisional board meetings as 
directors of these boards. 
Editorial Process Review
During the year the Risk 
Committee and the Editor-in-
Chief initiated an internal 
review of Editorial Processes. 
This was performed by the 
Head of Editorial Legal 
Services under the direction of, 
and reporting, initially, to the 
Editor-in-Chief. The completed 
report was then presented  
to the Risk Committee. The 
scope included processes  
and controls to support 
compliance with the PCC 
code, the Data Protection Act 
and the Bribery Act, including: 
editorial policies (and the 
policy over the use of ‘inquiry 
agents’); ethics; training; 
communications; and 
payments in Mail Newspapers.
The Committee concluded 
that the report provided 
comfort over the processes 
and controls to support 
compliance with the PCC 
code, the Data Protection Act 
and the Bribery Act. Further, 
the degree of regular 
communications from editorial 
management to staff on these 
matters over the past five years 
was encouraging. The report 
also included a number of 
recommendations for process 
improvements that are now 
being implemented. 
The Committee reports to the 
Board after each of its meetings 
to assist the Board in its 
determination of the overall 
effectiveness of the system of 
internal control and risk 
management.
AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Audit Committee, on 
behalf of the Board, has 
responsibility for the review of 
financial risk management 
and of internal financial 
controls, as these directly 
relate to the quality of 
financial reporting. In addition, 
the Committee is mandated 
to:
•  review all public financial 
statements of the Company 
and of the Group, including 
the half year and annual 
financial statements, before 
such statements are 
submitted to the Board;
•  consider any appointment 
of external auditors to 
Group companies, to review 
audit fees and to consider 
any questions of resignation 
or dismissal of auditors;
•  monitor and review the 
resources and effectiveness 
of internal audit (including 
approval of the 
appointment and removal 
of the Head of Risk & 
Assurance);
•  agree the internal audit 
programme for the 
forthcoming year; and
•  to consider a summary of 
Group internal audit reports 
and such individual reports 
as the Committee sees fit 
and corresponding 
management responses to 
any recommendations, and 
to monitor the progress of 
any required actions.
The Committee monitors the 
financial reporting process 
and the Group’s statutory 
annual audit. It also considers 
significant financial reporting 
issues, approves any changes 
to Group accounting policies 
and reviews a summary of 
recommendation letters to 
management prepared by  
the Group’s external auditors 
following their audit 
procedures.
The Committee comprises four 
non-executive Directors: 
Messrs Verey, its chairman, 
Hemingway, Berry and Nelson. 
The Code recommends that 
an audit committee should 
comprise at least three members, 
all of whom should be 
independent non-executive 
Directors. Only Messrs Verey 
and Berry are considered to  
be independent under the 
Code. Nevertheless, the Board 
believes that the Committee 
operates independently. 
Members’ qualifications are 
set out in their biographies on 
pages 48 and 49. The Board is 
satisfied that Mr Nelson, senior 
partner of a firm of chartered 
accountants, and Mr Verey, 
the Committee chairman, have 
recent and relevant financial 
experience. The Company 
Secretary, Mr Jennings, also a 
Chartered Accountant, is 
secretary to the Committee.
The Audit Committee met four 
times during the year and all 
meetings were attended by all 
serving members. Individual 
attendance by members is set 
out below:
Number 
of 
meetings 
eligible 
to attend 
Number

meetings

D J Verey 4 4
J G 
Hemingway 4 4
N W Berry 4 4
D H Nelson 4 4
The Finance Director attended 
all meetings and the Chief 
Executive two meetings by 
invitation.
The Committee has 
implemented the procedures 
set out in the updated 
Guidance on audit committees, 
published by the Financial 
Reporting Council in December 
2010, which are within its control. 
It reviews the Group’s policy on 
whistle blowing.
In addition, the Committee has 
primary responsibility for making 
a recommendation to the 
Board on the appointment, 
reappointment and removal of 
the external auditors, together 
with approval of their 
remuneration. As part of its  
role in ensuring the 
effectiveness of the audit 
process, the Committee also 
undertakes an annual 
assessment of the 
qualifications, expertise and 
resources of the external 
auditors.
The appointment of Deloitte LLP 
as the Group’s external auditors 
(incumbents since the last audit 
tender in 2001) is kept under 
annual review, and, if satisfactory, 
the Committee will recommend 
the reappointment of the audit 
firm. The appointment of Deloitte 
followed a formal tender process 
undertaken in 2001 and, rather 
than adopting a policy on 
tendering frequency, the annual 
review of the effectiveness of the 
external audit is supplemented 
by a periodic comprehensive 
reassessment by the Committee. 
The last such reassessment was 
performed in 2008/09, as with 
many suppliers, when having 
received assurances on the 
continued quality of the audit, 
the Committee determined to 
recommend the reappointment 
of the incumbent firm. As the 
appointment of the auditors is for 
one year only, being subject to 
annual approval at the 
Company’s AGM, there is no 
contractual commitment to the 
current audit firm and, as such, 
the Committee may undertake 
an audit tender at any time at its 
discretion.
In performing its review, the 
Committee evaluated the 
adequacy of the audit firm’s 
key processes and controls in 
certain key areas including, 
but not limited to:
•  arrangements for ensuring 
independence and 
objectivity, including the 
rotation of key audit 
partners;
•  appropriateness of the 
planned audit scope and its  61 DAILY MAIL AND GENERAL TRUST PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2011

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE continued
execution;
•  the robustness and 
perceptiveness of the 
auditors in their handling of 
the key accounting and 
audit judgements; and
•  the quality of their reporting.
Procedures exist to monitor the 
independence of the external 
auditors and include a policy 
on employment of former 
audit principals. During the 
year, the Committee reviewed 
its policy on the provision of 
non-audit services in with the 
light of the Ethical Standard, 
issued by the Auditing Practices 
Board in December 2010. 
REVISED POLICY ON NON-
AUDIT FEES 
The Audit Committee 
considers services under the 
three headings, set out in the 
Ethical Standard. 
SERVICES WHERE THREATS TO 
DELOITTE’S INDEPENDENCE 
ARE CONSIDERED LOW
The first category comprises 
pre-approved services where 
threats to Deloitte’s 
independence are considered 
low, typically where the 
engagement is routine in 
nature and the fee immaterial 
in the context of the total 
annual Group audit fee. In 
addition such pre-approved 
services include those which 
are audit-related, as defined 
by the APB Ethical Standard. 
Services which may fall in this 
category include the review of 
the Half Yearly Report, 
reporting on regulatory returns 
and accountancy advice. 
SERVICES WHERE THERE 
COULD BE A PERCEIVED 
THREAT TO INDEPENDENCE
The second category is services 
where there could be a 
perceived threat to 
independence for which 
approval is required before they 
are undertaken. Non-audit 
services in these areas are 
considered by the Committee 
on an individual basis and are 
put out to tender where the 
amounts in question are 
significant. Non-audit services 
in this category would include 
those with a contingent fee 
arrangement. In these areas, 
the choice of firm is determined 
on the basis of professional 
expertise and competitiveness. 
SERVICES WHERE THERE IS A 
REAL THREAT TO 
INDEPENDENCE
The third category is services 
where there is a real threat to 
independence and from 
which the external auditors are 
therefore excluded. These 
services are specifically 
prohibited by the APB Ethical 
Standard and comprise: 
• internal audit and IT services 
where the external auditor 
would place significant 
reliance as part of its audit 
work; 
• valuation and tax services 
and litigation support where 
the respective valuation, 
calculations or estimation  
of the likely outcome would 
have a material effect on 
the financial statements;
• any services where the 
auditor would undertake 
the role of management or 
take on the role of 
advocate; and
• contingent fee arrangements 
where the outcome is 
dependent on a future  
or contemporary audit 
judgment relating to a 
material matter in the financial 
statements or on a new  
or uncertain tax law 
interpretation.
In addition to considering the 
non-audit fees to be incurred, 
the Committee also considers 
both the nature of the services 
to be performed and the 
safeguards required to 
maintain independence.
In July, it approved the 
appointment of Deloitte to 
carry out part of an IT project 
for A&N Media, designed to 
improve business confidence 
in its information security and 
risk management which had 
the potential to exceed the 
£100,000 limit in the 
Committee’s policy on 
non-audit fees. Deloitte were 
appointed on merit. The 
project is not one on which 
they would need to place 
significant reliance as part of 
their audit. 
Non-audit fees payable to 
Deloitte LLP in 2010/11 
amounted to £0.6 million, 
compared to £1.2 million the 
previous year. 
During the year, the 
Committee received reports 
from management on 
litigation matters, investor 
relations messages, 
preparations for the Bribery 
Act, on analyst and media 
reaction to the Group’s 2010 
preliminary announcement 
and Annual Report, on going 
concern and on developments 
in international financial 
reporting standards.
The Committee also reviewed 
the annual internal audit  
plan, summaries of reports 
received and reviewed the 
effectiveness and resources  
of the Group’s internal audit 
function. In September, it 
carried out an annual review 
of its terms of reference and  
of its effectiveness and 
concluded that it did not need 
to recommend to the Board 
any substantive changes to its 
remit or operations. In 
September, the Board 
conducted its own review of 
the Committee’s performance 
and confirmed that the 
Committee had fulfilled its 
obligations and been effective 
in the year under review.
Euromoney Institutional 
Investor plc is subject to the 
requirements of the Code in its 
own right. As disclosed in its 
latest annual report, it has in 
place its own system of internal 
control and risk management 
processes which forms part of 
the Group’s overall framework 
of control. The joint ventures 
and associates of the Group 
are not included in the Group’s 
system of internal control 
described above.

REMUNERATION REPORT
The Viscount Rothermere 
Chairman
The Remuneration Committee 
reviews the design and 
operation of its incentive 
arrangements for senior 
executives on an ongoing 
basis to ensure the right 
balance between fair rewards 
for executives and the  
delivery of strong business 
performance for shareholders. 
The Committee firmly believes 
that a high calibre 
management team should  
be supported by incentive 
arrangements that create real 
focus on the fundamentals 
that drive long-term growth 
whilst also ensuring the 
necessary attention to annual 
delivery of profit, cash and  
the Company’s key 
performance indicators.
REVIEW OF 2010/1 1
We have been operating in  
a challenging trading 
environment and executive 
Directors’ remuneration for the 
current financial year reflected 
this:
•  Although the Board 
considers the performance 
of the Group in 2010/11 
satisfactory, annual bonus 
payments for 2010/11  
were slightly below the 
target levels;
•  The latest forecast outcomes 
for the LTIP awards made  
in December 2009 and  
2010 indicate outcomes  
also to be slightly below  
target levels;
•  The LTIP award granted in 
2004 vested in 2011 at 75% of 
the initial award, which 
reflected the performance 
of DMGT over the seven-year 
performance period. During 
this period DMGT’s Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) was 
ranked 5th out of 12 
comparator companies;
•  The 2005 LTIP has already 
vested;
•  Neither the 2006 nor the 
2007 LTIP is currently in a 
vesting position;
•  Whilst the 2008 LTIP transition 
award vested in full, the 
incentive award did not vest.
FUTURE POLICY FOR CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE AND FINANCE 
DIRECTOR
Following a detailed review of 
reward policy, the Committee 
intends to strengthen the 
alignment between the 
interests of the executives and 
shareholders. The Committee 
also wishes to ensure that 
executive compensation is not 
overly complex. 
The main changes are to 
increase the performance 
measurement period under a 
new long-term incentive plan 
from three to five years and for 
2011/12 to reduce the size of 
the annual LTIP award from the 
current 187.5% of salary to 
100% of salary for both the 
Chief Executive and Finance 
Director. In order to balance 
these changes, we propose to 
introduce a simpler and more 
focused set of performance 
criteria linked to achievement 
of strategic goals. These goals 
will replace the four separate 
performance measures that 
applied to 2009 and 2010 LTIP 
awards. Awards will in future 
only vest after five years rather 
than the current phased 
vesting scale between three 
and six years. Awards will 
receive dividend equivalents 
on vesting, which is now 
regarded as best practice.
We are also changing the 
annual bonus plan for these 
individuals to improve the 
focus on key strategic goals.  
In future a portion of the bonus 
will depend on achieving or 
progress towards such goals  
in the year: for 2011/12 this will 
be 20% of the bonus. 
At the same time, we are 
making minor changes to the 
way such bonuses are paid. 
Any bonus earned up to 50% 
of salary, will be paid in cash 
and any amounts above this 
will be paid in shares deferred 
for two years. Their maximum 
bonus remains at 100%  
of salary.
The Company’s strategic plans 
and specific targets are of 
course commercially sensitive, 
and of interest to competitors.  
I trust that fellow shareholders 
will understand why these 
cannot therefore be disclosed 
at this stage. Future 
Remuneration Reports will 
provide you with further 
information at the end of the 
period over which the relevant 
incentive plan has operated.
These changes, when 
combined with the current 
share ownership of our Chief 
Executive, will further 
strengthen the alignment of his 
rewards with the interests  
of shareholders. 
I hope our shareholders will 
agree that our new approach 
combines the necessary 
attention to short-term 
performance with a focus on 
the fundamentals that drive 
long-term value.
My own remuneration will 
continue to follow the 
approach adopted in 2009.

SUBSIDIARY PLANS
The Committee also spends 
considerable time reviewing 
the incentive plans of our main 
subsidiaries. Developing the 
right incentives is a key part  
of ensuring we have the right 
entrepreneurial culture and 
growth strategies in our various 
businesses. Total incentive 
compensation costs in our 
subsidiaries have the potential 
far to outweigh the amounts 
paid to executive Directors.
All of our work is aimed at 
ensuring the sustainability  
and long-term success of  
our Company, DMGT.
This report has been prepared 
in accordance with the 
relevant requirements of the 
Large and Medium-Sized 
Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) 
Regulations 2008 (the 
Regulations) and of the Listing 
Rules of the Financial Services 
Authority. As required by  
the Regulations, a resolution  
to approve the report  
will be proposed at the 
Company’s AGM.
1. THE REMUNERATION 
COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee 
is responsible inter alia for 
overall Group remuneration 
policy and for setting the 
remuneration, benefits and 
terms and conditions of 
employment of the Company’s 
executive Directors and other 
senior executives. The 
Committee’s terms of 
reference are available on the 
Company’s website.
The members of the 
Committee are the Viscount 
Rothermere, its chairman, Mr 
Berry and Mr Nelson. The UK 
Corporate Governance Code 
(‘the Code’) recommends that 
a remuneration committee 
should be composed entirely 
of independent non-executive 
directors. The Board considers 
it appropriate that the 
Viscount Rothermere, as the 
Company’s largest 
shareholder, is a member of 
the Committee. He always 
leaves meetings in advance of 
any discussion of his own 
remuneration. While Mr Nelson 
is not considered to be 
independent under the Code, 
the Board does consider him to 
act independently as regards 
remuneration issues.
The Committee met seven 
times during the year, five of 
which were regular meetings. 
All meetings were attended by 
all serving members, except 
that the Viscount Rothermere 
did not attend any part of one 
meeting, when matters 
affecting his own remuneration 
were discussed. Individual 
attendance by members is set 
out below:

meetings

The Viscount 
Rothermere 7 6
N W Berry 7 7
D H Nelson 7 7
The Finance Director, Mr 
Daintith, replaced Mr Williams 
as secretary to the Committee 
in March.
The Committee seeks the 
recommendations of the Chief 
Executive, as regards the 
remuneration of the other 
executive Directors and of 
other senior executives. He 
usually attends meetings of the 
Committee by invitation. It also 
seeks input from the Finance 
Director, regarding financial 
performance and other issues, 
from the HR director and from 
the Company Secretary.  
No executive is present when 
his own remuneration is  
being discussed.
The Committee makes 
reference, where appropriate, 
to pay and employment 
conditions elsewhere in the 
Group, especially when 
determining annual salary 
increases, and to external 
evidence of remuneration 
levels in other companies, 
particularly in the media field. 
It also makes reference to 
advice sought from external 
advisors. During the year such 
advice was received from 
MM&K and Phil Wills Associates 
Ltd. MM&K provided market 
data and gave advice on best 
practice. MM&K were 
appointed by the Committee. 
MM&K also provided the 
Company with advice on 
share schemes and other 
matters. Phil Wills Associates 
were was appointed by 
management and provided 
remuneration advice to the 
Committee.
In September, the Committee 
conducted a formal review of 
its effectiveness and 
concluded that it had fulfilled 
its remit and been effective in 
the year.
2. REMUNERATION POLICY 
– EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Committee seeks to 
structure remuneration 
packages on an individual 
basis appropriate to the level 
of responsibility, that is 
generally designed to 
motivate and retain the 
individual.
The Company encourages 
Directors to own shares in the 
Company and executive 
Directors have a target of a 
minimum shareholding of 1.5 
times their salary, to be built up 
over a suitable period. The 
design of the incentive plans 
encourages executive 
Directors to achieve this goal 
which aligns their interests with 
those of shareholders.

*  in the case of Mr Fallon, who 
is an executive Director of 
Euromoney, shares in 
Euromoney are included.
The Committee considers that 
a successful remuneration 
policy needs to be sufficiently 
flexible to take account of 
commercial demands, 
changing market practice and 
shareholder expectations. 
Ordinary shareholders will be 
provided with the opportunity 
to endorse the Company’s 
remuneration policy on a 
regular basis through the 
annual vote on the 
Remuneration Report.
A significant proportion of 
each executive Director’s 
remuneration is performance-
related. 
The main components of the 
remuneration package for 
executive Directors are:
(i) Basic fees and salary;
(ii) Annual performance-
related bonuses;
(iii) Long-term performance-
related incentive 
arrangements – through 
membership of the  
Group’s LTIP;
(iv) Share options – grants are 
no longer made, other 
than in exceptional 
circumstances; 
(v) Pension entitlements/cash 
allowances – in lieu of 
pension allowances under 
the DMGT Senior 
Executives Pension Fund 
(‘SEPF’) or AN 
PensionSaver, DMGT’s 
defined contribution 
scheme; and
(vi)  Other benefits.
In setting the remuneration  
of the executive Directors 
other than Mr Fallon, the 
Committee takes note of the 
remuneration increases being 
given around the Group.

are given on page 64.  DAILY MAIL AND GENERAL TRUST PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2011 64

Notes
(i) The Chairman’s substantial 
shareholding in the 
Company provides an 
alignment with long-term 
shareholders that is not the 
case in most other 
companies. Consequently, 
in 2009 the Committee, 
without the Viscount 
Rothermere present, 
decided that with effect 
from 1st October, 2009, the 
Chairman would not 
receive any future LTIP 
awards, but as partial 
compensation would be 
entitled to a maximum 
annual cash bonus of 50% 
salary, and a deferred 
annual bonus paid in 
shares of at most 150% 
salary, which would not 
vest until a further three 
years. The Committee 
reserves the right to vary 
the proportions paid in 
shares and cash. The 
Committee believes this 
approach is both simple 
and transparent and 
provides a strong 
alignment with other 
shareholders over the  
long term.
(ii) The Chief Executive 
participates in the DMGT 
Executive Bonus Scheme, 
with a maximum payment 
of 100% of salary and 
receives awards under the 
DMGT LTIP. 
(iii) Mr Daintith participates in 
the DMGT Executive Bonus 
Scheme (with his award 
pro-rated for the nine 
months since his 
appointment) with a 
maximum payment of 
100% of salary. He 
received an award of 
DMGT ‘A’ shares, valued at 
£100,000 at his date of 
appointment, with the 
performance condition 
being that he is employed 
three years later. He will 
receive future awards 
under the LTIP. 
(iv) Mr Dutton is entitled to 
receive an annual bonus, 
based on achievements 
during the year.
(v) The Committee decided in 
the previous year that it 
was in all stakeholders’ 
interests to recognise the 
contribution and to retain 
the services of Mr Dacre in 
his current role. The 
Committee decided that 
Mr Dacre be paid an 
additional £500,000 for 
each full year that he 
continues working until he 
is 65. Mr Dacre, who is 63, 
will not participate in any 
bonus or other long-term 
incentive scheme. 
(vi) Mr Beatty is also eligible to 
receive an LTIP award and 
participates in an annual 
bonus scheme, with a 
maximum payment of 60% 
of salary, based on his 
division’s results.
(vii) In the case of Mr Fallon, 
the Committee considers 
that his remuneration as 
executive chairman of 
Euromoney, a separately 
listed company, should  
be set by the remuneration 
committee of that 
company. The report  
on this is set out in 
Euromoney’s Annual 
Report.
(viii) Mr Williams participated in 
a bonus scheme for 
2010/11 up until retirement 
from the Company, but 
did not receive further 
awards under the DMGT 
LTIP. Mr Williams retained 
fees of £9,375 (2010 
£12,500) from his outside 
non-executive 
directorships.
The Committee also reviews 
the Chief Executive’s 
recommendations for the 
remuneration packages of 
other senior executives, except 
those in Euromoney, and 
oversees the bonus 
arrangements established in 
each division, including 
long-term incentive 
arrangements. These are 
designed individually to reflect 
the targets and objectives of 
each division.
Non-executive Directorships
The Company allows its 
executive Directors to take a 
very limited number of outside 
directorships. Individuals retain 
the payments received from 
such services since these 
appointments are not 
expected to impinge on their 
principal employment. 65

3. REMUNERATION – NON-
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The remuneration of non-
executive Directors is 
determined by the Board. A 
base fee is paid for Board 
membership and fees are paid 
for membership of Board 
committees ranging from 
£4,000 per annum to £25,000 
per annum. No fee is paid for 
chairing a committee, except 
that the Audit Committee 
chairman receives a fee of 
£25,000. From 1st October, 
2010 the fee for the 
Remuneration Committee 
membership was increased to 
£12,000 and members of the 
Investment and Finance 
Committee, which replaced 
previous committees and 
subsidiary boards, receive 
£25,000 p.a. An increase in the 
base fee from £30,000 to 
£35,000 per annum is being 
made for the 2011/12 financial 
year, the first such increase for 
five years.
4. RISK AND REWARD
During the year the Committee 
reviewed and confirmed that 
the plans in operation 
throughout the Group did not 
incentivise excessive risk and in 
particular that the 
remuneration incentives in 
DMGT are compatible with its 
risk policies and systems.

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
i) Basic fees and salary
Basic salaries are set by the 
Committee and reviewed 
annually. The figures for fees 
and salary for the Viscount 
Rothermere and Messrs 
Morgan and Fallon include 
fees as directors of Euromoney. 
For non-executive Directors 
they also include Committee 
fees, where applicable.
ii) Cash allowances
Annual cash allowances 
include an allowance paid to 
each of the Viscount 
Rothermere and Messrs 
Williams and Beatty, in lieu of 
continued membership of the 
DMGT Senior Executives 
Pension Fund. Mr Dacre was 
paid a similar allowance until 
December 2009. Until January 
2010, he also received an 
allowance instead of the 
Company providing Central 
London accommodation. Mr 
Daintith is paid an allowance 
as an alternative to 
membership of the company’s 
defined contribution pension 
scheme, AN PensionSaver.
During the prior year, the 
allowances of Mr Dacre were 
bought out for a payment of 
£973,500. Under the terms of 
his contract, Mr Morgan was 
due to receive an annual 
housing allowance as part of 
his relocation from the USA 
which was also bought out 
during the previous years for 
an additional payment of 
£880,000. The table above 
includes, for the prior year, the 
allowances paid up to the buy 
out date, but not the buy out 
payments to Messrs Morgan 
and Dacre. 
The Viscount Rothermere, Mr 
Morgan and Mr Daintith also 
receive a cash allowance 
instead of having a company 
car, as did Mr Williams prior to 
his retirement. Further 
relocation costs of £10,000 
were also paid on behalf of Mr 
Morgan during the year.
Mr Trempont receives a travel 
allowance for each Board 
meeting he attends in London.
iii) Benefits in kind
Benefits in kind include the 
taxable value of company 
cars, fuel allowances and 
company contributions to 
medical insurance plans.
iv)  Annual performance-
related bonuses
The Viscount Rothermere, Mr 
Morgan, Mr Daintith and Mr 
Beatty are members of the 
DMGT Executive Bonus 
Scheme (‘the Scheme’) which 
was approved by Ordinary 
shareholders in February  
2003. The bonus is paid in  
a combination of cash and 
either ‘A’ Ordinary Non-Voting 
Shares, which must be retained 
for at least three years, or 
nil-cost options in DMGT, which 
cannot be exercised for at 
least three years. Mr Morgan 
and Mr Daintith may choose 
the proportion of the bonus 
which is to be deferred in the 
form of shares or options, but 
must defer at least 50%.
The maximum annual bonus 
payable to the Viscount 
Rothermere is 200% of salary, 
for Mr Morgan 100% and Mr 
Daintith 75% (being pro-rated 
for nine months). For 2010/11, 
the Committee targeted the 
bonus against adjusted 
pre-tax profits, but with a 
requirement of a trading cash 
flow conversion rate of 96% or 
more, below which it was 
tapered down to nil, if below 
90%. Mr Williams was also 
eligible for a bonus but no LTIP 
award: the maximum bonus 
was 150% (being 200% 
pro-rated for the nine months 
he was employed in the year). 
The Group adjusted profit 
before tax for the year ended 
2nd October, 2011 (before 
amortisation and impairment 
of intangible assets and 
exceptional items) was slightly 
below target. This resulted in a 
(profit-linked) bonus of 80.4% 
of salary being earned by the 
Viscount Rothermere, 40.2% by 
Mr Morgan and Mr Daintith 
and 60.3% by Mr Williams. For 
Lord Rothermere, a quarter is 
payable in cash and three 
quarters will be deferred into 
shares in the form of nil price 
options. Mr Williams was also 
paid a discretionary bonus of 
£417,000, based on his long 
and distinguished service to 
the Group. For Messrs Morgan 
and Daintith, half of this bonus 
is payable in cash and half will 
be deferred into shares in the 
form of nil price options. For  
Mr Williams, all will be paid in 
cash. The cash component of 
the bonus is shown in the table 
on page 65.
Mr Beatty’s bonus is based on 
the performance of A&N 
Media. The maximum bonus 
he could earn is 60% of salary. 
Half of this bonus is payable in 
cash and half will be deferred 
into shares in the form of nil 
price options. The cash 
component of this bonus is 
shown in the table on page 65.
Mr Dutton received a bonus of 
£75,000, payable in cash, in 
recognition of his performance 
and that of the Company’s.
Mr Fallon is entitled to 6.49% of 
the pre-tax profit earned by 
Euromoney, which has a 
comprehensive profit sharing 
scheme that links the pay of its 
executive directors to the 
profits of that group.
v) Pension contributions
Pension contributions were 
made on behalf of Mr Morgan 
in lieu of continued 
membership of the DMGT 
Senior Executives Pension Fund, 
as explained on page 76.
7. LONG-TERM 
PERFORMANCE-RELATED 
INCENTIVE 
ARRANGEMENTS
The 2008 Daily Mail and 
General Trust Long-Term 
Incentive Plan (2008 LTIP), is 
designed to align the interests 
of participants and 
shareholders. Further, the 2008 
LTIP will only provide rewards 
for participants if the 
Company achieves stretching 
performance targets.
These Award levels have been 
set to take account of the 
current remuneration strategy. 
The Committee’s intention is to 
continue to monitor market 
practice and will consider the 
appropriate targets in relation 
to each year’s Awards. It will  67

therefore ensure that Award 
levels are competitive and 
motivational to the Executives 
concerned and acceptable to 
shareholders. The Committee 
intends to operate the  
LTIP annually.
The 2008 LTIP is supervised by 
the Committee and is 
operated in conjunction with 
an employee discretionary 
trust (the ‘Trust’). The Trust will 
acquire ‘A’ Ordinary Non-
Voting Shares in the Company 
(‘shares’) to satisfy awards 
under the LTIP, or Treasury 
shares will be used.
The expected value of an 
Award of 62.5% of salary 
(which was the maximum 
award that has been made in 
2008, 2009 and 2010) has been 
calculated by PwC as 68% of 
salary using a Monte Carlo 
valuation model using 
assumptions based on their 
historical analysis which do not 
indicate a forecast of 
management of expected 
outcomes for DMGT.
In exceptional circumstances, 
an initial grant of up to 100% of 
salary may be made, which 
could result in a maximum 
award after six years of 300% 
of salary.
2001 to 2007 LTIP awards
From 2001 to 2007, Executives 
were invited to commit shares 
in the Company at a market 
price and receive a matching 
award under the LTIP. If a 
participant holds the 
committed shares for five 
years, he will be eligible to 
receive matching shares on a 
sliding scale. Such Awards 
under the LTIP are subject to 
performance conditions, 
which will determine whether, 
and to what extent, shares 
under awards will vest. The 
performance conditions relate 
to the TSR of the Company 
initially over a five-year period 
against a peer group of UK 
and overseas companies 
determined by the Committee. 
TSR is the aggregate of share 
price growth and dividends 
paid (assuming that such 
dividends are reinvested in 
shares during the five-year 
period), and is commonly 
adopted as a measure of 
comparative performance. 
These performance conditions 
were chosen by the 
Committee in order to 
incentivise the Executives to 
increase long-term 
shareholder value. Individuals 
were given six months to make 
commitments in order to allow 
for them to make purchases of 
shares, where appropriate. 
Once an individual agreed to 
commit shares which were 
owned by him or by his close 
family, the Trustee of the Trust 
decided whether to make an 
award of an equal number of 
shares to those committed.
Having received agreements to commit shares, the Trustee made the awards set out in the table 
below:

Graphs
Graphs of DMGT’s 
performance against each of 
its comparators for each of 
these periods are set out on 
page 71. These graphs have 
been plotted using the relative 
rankings of each comparator 
at the end of each month. As 
such, they are approximations 
to the actual rankings under 
the rules, which are calculated 
using a two-month average for 
the starting point and for each 
subsequent month. This can 
give different results between 
the table above and  
the graphs.
The graphs on page 70 
compare the DMGT total 
shareholder return with that of 
the FTSE 100 index and of the 
media index over a period of 
five years, as required by the 
Regulations. As a constituent 
of the FTSE 100 from 1999 to 
2006 and during 2007 and as a 
constituent of the media index 
throughout the period, the 
Directors regard both indices 
as the most appropriate 
indices for purposes of 
comparison of the Group’s 
performance. Additional 
graphs on that page illustrate 
performance over a 25 year 
period for which data is 
available.
The graphs on pages 70 and 71

Description of how the 2011 
LTIP works
Following a revision to the 
Scheme in 2008, LTIPs awarded 
subsequently comprise either 
Core Awards, Matching 
Awards or Transition Awards.
The normal maximum Core 
Award to an executive is 62.5% 
of salary annually, and the 
maximum Matching Award is 
two times the number of 
Shares that vest under the 
Core Award.
The vesting level of both the 
Core Awards and Matching 
Awards is determined by 
performance over the initial 
three year performance 
period. The vesting profile of 
Matching Awards is designed 
to achieve retention of 
executives, and encourages 
long-term shareholding.
Core Awards will vest under 
normal circumstances after 
three years. 
The employee would then 
receive Matching Awards of 
Shares equivalent to 50% of the 
vested Core Award which will 
vest at the end of three, four, 
five and six years from the date 
of Award, so long as he 
continues to hold the Shares in 
the Core Award.
Thus, if the participant 
continues to be employed by 
the Company six years after 
the Award was granted, the 
employee could receive a 
maximum of Shares, valued at 
the Award date, of 187.5% of 
salary. He would have to wait 
six years to be able to receive 
this maximum. 
For executives whose main 
focus is on their Division, the 
performance criteria may 
reflect the performance of 
their Division.
Participants will not receive 
dividends on Shares under 
their Awards. However, the 
number of Shares which vest 
under an Award will be 
increased during the Relevant 
Period by reference to 
dividends which would have 
been paid on those Shares 
during the Relevant Period.
2007/08 LTIP awards
The first Core Awards were 
made in March 2008. 
The proportion of the Shares 
that vest will depend on 
Earnings Per Share (EPS) 
performance over the three 
year performance period.
As these Core and Matching 
Awards were not capable of 
vesting in full until 2014, the 
Committee also made 
‘Transition Awards’ in 2008.
The Transition Awards made in 
2008 vested to the executives 
because they were still 
employed in the Company 
three years after the Award, 
i.e. 19th March, 2011. There 
were no post-grant 
performance conditions 
attached to the Transition 
Awards. Transition Awards did 
not benefit from any linked 
Matching Awards.
2008/09 
No Awards were made in 
2008/9 because the 
Committee decided to set a 
special bonus incentive 
instead in the light of the 
challenges faced by the 
Group due to the prevailing 
economic environment. In 
December 2009, the 
Committee granted a core 
incentive award.
2009/10 LTIP awards
The proportion of the Shares 
that vest will depend for the 
December 2009 award on 
performance against four 
equally weighted measures 
– EBITA, Free Cash Flow, Net 
debt/EBITDA and Performance 
against the Group’s Strategic 
Plan. In the case of Mr Beatty, 
the fourth part of his LTIP 
performance target is based 
on his divisional results.
2010/11 LTIP awards
The Committee agreed in 
December 2010 that LTIP 
awards would be made, with 
appropriately stretching 
performance targets linked to 
the business strategy with four 
equally weighted measures 
– EBITA, Free Cash Flow, Debt 
Rating and Performance 
against the Group’s Strategic 
Plan. In the case of Mr Beatty, 
his 2010/11 LTIP performance 
target is based on his divisional 
Strategic Plan. 
Policy for 2011/12 LTIP 
awards 
The policy for future LTIP 
awards is that awards will be 
made with appropriately 
stretching performance targets 
linked to the achievement of 
strategic goals. This is 
described in the circular to 
shareholders, seeking 
approval at the AGM for a new 
2012 LTIP, which accompanies 
this Annual Report. 
The award prices in the tables 
below are the prices on the 
date the awards were made. 
These were used to determine 
the number of shares awarded.

realised his award (net of a deduction for income tax and employee national insurance) which 
was made on 30th March at the prevailing share price of £4.958, and each of them retained all of 
the shares awarded. This gave rise to respective gains of £232,894, £113,710, £216,746, £104,624 and 
£212,729 by the Viscount Rothermere and Messrs Morgan, Williams, Dutton and Beatty which are

8. SHARE OPTIONS
1997 Executive Share Option Scheme: options were granted under this Scheme prior to 2006. 
Options granted do not normally vest until three years after the award and two performance 
conditions have been met. The first condition is that, in respect of four out of six consecutive 
monthly calculation dates (which start in the 30th month following the date of grant of a 
particular option), the total shareholder return (TSR) of the Company must exceed that of the FTSE 
100 index. Secondly, there must be real growth in earnings per share (‘eps’) over a period of three 
consecutive financial years.
The status of both performance conditions on share options outstanding during the year is  
as follows:
1997 Scheme Exercise price
TSR condition 
(performance to date 
v. FTSE100) EPS condition Status 
Dec 00 8.34 met met not vested; lapsed
Jul 01 7.25 met met vested

Dec 02 5.73 -92% met not vested
Dec 03 6.08 -73% met not vested
Dec 04 7.24 -69% met not vested
2006 Executive Share Option Scheme: under the 2006 Scheme, each award of options has a 
maximum life of 10 years. The maximum award limit is 100% of salary in any year in normal 
circumstances and 200% of salary in exceptional circumstances. Awards to Directors and persons 
discharging managerial responsibility will not normally vest until three years after the award and 
the performance conditions have been met. No options were outstanding to Directors during the 
year under this scheme. DAILY MAIL AND GENERAL TRUST PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2011 74

The nil-cost options granted 
during the year were earned 
by the Directors in the prior 
year. After the date of 
approval of this Report, the 
nil-cost options earned in the 
current year, explained on 
page 66, will be granted.
On 30th September, 2011,  
Mr Williams exercised his 
156,193 nil cost options when 
the share price was £3.631. This 
resulted in a deemed gain of 
£567,000 which is included in 
the analysis of Directors’ 
remuneration on page 65.
There were 5,399,633 options 
outstanding under all the 
schemes at the end of the 
year. This represents 1.41% of 
the Company’s total issued 
share capital (excluding 
treasury shares). 
The mid-market price of the  
‘A’ Ordinary Non-Voting  
Shares was £3.631 at  
2nd October, 2011 and  
£5.255 at 3rd October, 2010.  
It ranged from £3.465 to  
£5.95 during the year.
10. PENSIONS ENTITLEMENTS 
AND CASH ALLOWANCES
The Group operates a two-tier 
defined benefit pension 
scheme for senior employees 
(including most of the 
Company’s executive 
Directors), details of which are 
given on page 76. It is the 
Company’s policy that annual 
bonuses, payments under  
the Executive Bonus Scheme 
and benefits in kind are  
not pensionable.
Prior to 6th April, 2006, the 
Committee reviewed in detail 
the impact of the pensions’ tax 
regime operating from that 
date. It developed a new 
policy, designed to be neutral 
in terms of cost compared to 
existing expenditure on 
pensions. This new policy 
incorporated the removal of 
the pensionable earnings cap 
for pension accruing after  
6th April, 2006.
Individual executive Directors 
were affected very differently 
by these changes and for 
some it was not tax-efficient to 
accrue further pension for 
service from 6th April, 2006. 
However, it is for individual 
Directors to decide when to 
opt out of the scheme, in 
which case a cash allowance 
is paid. Cash allowances paid 
in lieu of pensions are shown 
on page 65.
Under the prescribed 
transitional arrangements their 
accrued pension at that date 
has remained linked to 
increases in pensionable 
earnings. However, from the 
date of the first salary increase 
awarded on or after 1st April, 
2011, this salary link is replaced 
by a link to the annual increase 
in the Retail Prices Index. This 
change is entirely consistent 
with that applied to all other 
employees participating in the 
Group’s defined benefit 
pension schemes. They will 
continue to be eligible for 
death in service benefits. DAILY MAIL AND GENERAL TRUST PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2011 76

Notes to Directors’ Pension 
Entitlements
(i)  No executive Directors are 
now accruing further 
pension in the DMGT Senior 
Executives Pension Fund. 
The normal retirement age 
under the Fund for this 
group is 60 For each 
Director, the accrued 
entitlement at 2nd October, 
2011 represents the annual 
pension that is expected to 
be payable on eventual 
retirement, based on the 
salary of each Director at 
this date and pensionable 
service accrued to 5th April, 
2006 or subsequent date of 
opting out of the Fund. A 
spouse’s/dependant’s 
pension equal to two thirds 
of the Director’s pension is 
incorporated and the 
Director can elect to 
receive the pension from 
age 50, subject to a 
discount if retirement takes 
place before 60. The 
pension, when in payment, 
will receive annual 
increases in line with 
inflation, which may be 
limited when inflation 
exceeds 3% per annum.
(ii)  All transfer values have 
been calculated on the 
basis of actuarial advice in 
accordance with UK 
legislation. The transfer 
values of the accrued 
entitlement represent the 
value of assets that the 
pension scheme would 
need to transfer to another 
pension provider on 
transferring the scheme’s 
liability in respect of the 
Directors’ pension benefits.
(iii)  Mr Fallon’s pension benefit 
in the above table relates to 
a deferred pension in the 
Harmsworth Pension 
Scheme for pensionable 
service between 1st April, 
1978 and 1st April, 1986. This 
benefit has been increased 
for payment after Normal 
Retirement Age. Neither the 
Group nor Mr Fallon makes 
any further contributions to 
this scheme.
(iv)  Mr Morgan began to take 
his pension benefits, 
including a lump sum 
payment, on 20th March, 
2010. Mr Morgan’s pension 
benefit in the above table 
relates to a pension in the 
DMGT Senior Executive 
Pensions Fund for 
pensionable service 
between 8th May, 1989 and 
31st August, 2000, when he 
transferred to the U.S. In 
addition, Mr Morgan has 
the following pension 
arrangements:
•  A US deferred 
compensation plan, 
which is held in a rabbi 
trust. This provides a 
defined contribution cash 
benefit with a defined 
benefit pension underpin 
in respect of the period  
1st September, 2000 to  
30th September, 2008.
•  An employer financed 
retirement benefits 
scheme (EFRBS) in  
respect of service from  
1st October, 2008 
operated on behalf of 
the Company under an 
offshore trust located  
in Jersey.
(v) Mr Dacre began to take his 
pension benefits on 14th 
November, 2008.
(vi) Mr Williams retired from the 
Company on 30th June, 
2011 and immediately took 
his benefits, including a 
lump sum payment. His 
accrued entitlement and 
transfer value have been 
calculated as at this date 
and not at 2nd October, 201 1.
(vii) Mr Daintith is paid an 
allowance in lieu of 
membership of a Company 
pension scheme.
(viii) The Company does not make 
any pension contributions 
on behalf of Mr Dutton. 77

12. SERVICE CONTRACT 
ARRANGEMENTS
Contracts of service are 
negotiated on an individual 
basis as part of the overall 
remuneration package and 
their length is inevitably 
conditioned by external 
competitive pressures. For this 
reason, the contracts of two of 
the executive Directors 
exceeded the one year 
recommended in the Code. 
The Committee believes that 
the length of contract should 
be appropriate to the 
individual. Thus where DMGT 
employs individuals with unique 
talents within the areas of 
business within which it 
operates, the Committee 
believes that they should have 
longer contracts.
The Chairman and Messrs 
Williams, Dutton, Fallon and 
Beatty have contracts of up  
to one year in duration.  
Mr Morgan has a contract 
which is currently for one year 
and three months, but will 
reduce to one year on  
1st October, 2012. Mr Dacre 
had a rolling two-year 
contract which reduced to 
one year on 14th November, 
2011 and will reduce further 
In the event of earlier 
termination of their contracts, 
each Director is entitled to 
compensation equal to their 
basic salary, benefits, pension 
entitlement and, as 
appropriate, bonus or profit 
share for their notice period.
The contracts of Mr Morgan and 
Mr Daintith are subject to 
mitigation and, in the event of 
the Director obtaining 
alternative employment during 
the notice period, do not 
provide for further payment 
after such event. This mitigation 
does not apply to their pension 
benefit. Share options and LTIPs 
would be treated as for any 
member of the scheme, 
depending on the reason for 
termination of the contract.
Mr Fallon has a second service 
contract with Euromoney 
Publications (Jersey) Limited 
(‘EPJ’), a subsidiary of Euromoney 
dated 4th May, 1993. This 
contract has the same terms as 
his first contract, except that 
termination does not include a 
car allowance as Mr Fallon does 
not receive this benefit from EPJ.
Appointments and  
re-election
All Directors will be standing for 
re-election at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting, other 
than Mr Dunstone.
Non-executive Directors are 
appointed for specified terms 
and under the Company’s 
Articles of Association are 
subject to re-election by 
Ordinary shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting 
following appointment, and 
thereafter at least every three 
years. The Board has adopted 
the provision in the Code that 
they be subject to annual 
re-election. Each appointment 
can be terminated before the 
end of the one year period, 
with no notice or fees due. The 
dates of the appointment or 
subsequent re-appointment of 
the non-executive Directors are 
set out below:

Other related party 
transactions
No Director of the Company 
has, or had, a disclosable 
interest in any contract of 
significance subsisting during or 
at the end of the year.
Disclosable transactions by the 
Group under IAS 24, Related 
Party Disclosures, are set out in 
Note 42. There have been no 
other disclosable transactions 
by the Company and its 
subsidiaries with directors of 
Group companies and with 
substantial shareholders since 
the publication of the last 
Annual Report.

DAILY MAIL AND GENERAL TRUST PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2011
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
to the Members of Daily Mail and General Trust plc
We have audited the Group financial statements of Daily Mail and General Trust plc for the year 
ended 2nd October, 2011 which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the 
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, and the 
related Notes 1 to 43. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of 
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to 
the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report 
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our 
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the Group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Group financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Group financial statements:
•  give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 2nd October, 2011 and of its 
profit for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
•  have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the Group financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
•  the Directors’ statement contained within the Financial and Treasury Review in relation to going 
concern; 
•  the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the company’s compliance with 
the nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review; and
• certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on Directors’ remuneration.
Other matter
We have reported separately 
on the parent Company 
financial statements of Daily 
Mail and General Trust plc for 
the year ended 2nd October, 
2011 and on the information in 
the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report that is described as 
having been audited.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
1 BASIS OF PREPARATION
DMGT is a company 
incorporated in the United 
Kingdom. The address of the 
registered office is given on 
page 181.
These financial statements 
have been prepared in 
accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) issued by the 
International Accounting 
Standards Board as adopted 
by the European Union  
and with those parts of  
the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies 
preparing their accounts 
under IFRS.
These financial statements 
have been prepared for the  
52 weeks ending 2nd October, 
2011 (2010 52 weeks ending 3rd 
October, 2010). The Group and 
its national and local media 
divisions, prepare financial 
statements for a 52 or 53 week 
financial period ending on  
a Sunday near to the end  
of September. 
The Group’s remaining 
divisions prepare financial 
statements for a financial year 
to 30th September and do not 
prepare additional financial 
statements corresponding to 
the Group’s financial year for 
consolidation purposes as it 
would be impracticable to do 
so. The Group considers 
whether there have been any 
significant transactions or 
events between the end of the 
financial year of the other 
divisions and the end of the 
Group’s financial year and 
makes any material 
adjustments as appropriate.
The significant accounting 
policies used in preparing this 
information are set out in Note 2. 
These financial statements 
have been prepared in 
accordance with the 
accounting policies set out in 
the 2010 Annual Report and 
Accounts, with the exception 
of the change in accounting 
policy described below and  
as amended by the new 
accounting standards set  
out below.
The Group financial statements 
incorporate the financial 
statements of the Company 
and all of its subsidiaries 
together with the Group’s 
share of all of its interests in 
joint ventures and associates. 
The financial statements have 
been prepared on the 
historical cost basis, except for 
the revaluation of financial 
instruments.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, 
together with the factors  
likely to affect its future 
development, performance 
and position are set out in the 
Financial and Treasury review 
on pages 38 to 43, the Business 
Review on pages 12 to 37 and 
the Directors’ report on pages 
50 to 55. The Group’s funding 
arrangements, together with 
details of undrawn bank 
facilities, are disclosed in  
Notes 31 and 32.
As highlighted in Notes 31 and 
32 to the financial statements, 
the Company has long-term 
financing in the form of 
Eurobonds and meets its 
day-to-day working capital 
requirements through bank 
facilities which expire in two  
to four years. The current 
economic conditions create 
uncertainty particularly over 
the future performance of 
those parts of the business that 
derive a significant proportion 
of revenue from advertising. 
The Board’s forecasts and 
projections, after taking 
account of reasonably 
possible changes in trading 
performance, show that the 
Company is expected to 
operate within the terms of its 
current facilities. After making 
enquiries, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that 
the Group will have access to 
adequate resources to 
continue in existence for the 
foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, they continue  
to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the  
financial statements.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Change in accounting 
policy
The Group no longer adds 
back to its adjusted results the 
amortisation charged on 
internally generated and 
acquired computer software 
unless it was recognised as 
part of the accounting for a 
business combination. The 
effect of this change in 
accounting policy is an 
additional post tax charge of 
£17.6 million (2010 £14.0 million, 
2009 £10.5 million) in arriving  
at adjusted profit.
Change in presentation
As reported in November  
2010, the central European 
operations of the local media 
segment now report directly  
to the national media segment 
and the presentation of the 
results from these segments 
has been aligned accordingly. 
The impact of this change  
is to increase revenue in the 
national media segment and 
decrease revenue in the local 
media segment by £29.9 
million (2010 £33.1 million, 2009 
£43.4 million) and to increase 
the segment result of the 
national media segment and 
decrease the segment result of 
the local media segment by 
£4.2 million (2010 £3.6 million, 
2009 £4.7 million).
Impact of new accounting 
standards
Standards not affecting the 
reported results or the financial 
position:
The following new and revised 
Standards and Interpretations 
have been adopted in the 
current year. Their adoption 
has not had any significant 
impact on the amounts 
reported in the financial 
statements but may impact 
the accounting for future 
transactions and 
arrangements:

Amendments to IFRS 2 clarify 
that an entity which receives 
goods or services in a share-
based payment arrangement 
must account for those goods 
or services no matter which 
entity in the Group settles the 
transaction, and no matter 
whether the transaction is 
settled in shares or cash.  
The Standard is effective  
for periods beginning on or 
after 1st January, 2010 and is 
applied retrospectively. The 
amendment does not affect 
the reported results nor the 
financial position.
•  IFRIC 19 Extinguishing 
Financial Liabilities with 
Equity Instruments
If a debtor issues equity 
instruments to a creditor to 
extinguish all or part of a 
financial liability, those equity 
instruments are ‘consideration 
paid’ and should be measured 
at fair value or fair value of  
the financial liability, 
whichever is more reliably 
determined. Any difference 
between the carrying value  
of the financial liability 
extinguished and the initial 
measurement of the equity 
instrument is included in the 
entity’s profit and loss for the 
period. This interpretation does 
not affect the reported results 
nor the financial position.
•  Amendment to IAS 32 
Financial Instruments 
Presentation.
This amendment has no 
impact on the Group’s 
financial statements.
•  Improvements to IFRSs 2009 
(various amendments). 
Improvements to IFRSs 2009 
included various amendments 
some of which were required 
to be adopted in the prior 
year. In the current year, the 
remaining amendments have 
been adopted. None of those 
amendments affect the 
reported results nor the 
financial position
•  Improvements to IFRSs 2010 
(relating to IFRS 3 and IAS 
27). None of these 
amendments affect the 
reported results nor the 
reported financial position.
At the date of authorisation  
of the combined financial 
information, the following 
Standards and Interpretations, 
which have not been applied 
in the combined financial 
statements, were in issue  
but not yet effective (and in 
some cases had not yet been 
adopted by the EU). Other  
than IAS 19 Employee Benefits, 
which will change the 
presentation and 
measurement of pensions in 
the Consolidated Income 
Statement and Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position, 
their adoption is not expected 
to have a significant impact on 
the amounts reported in the 
financial statements but may 
impact the accounting for 
future transactions and

Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries 
and businesses are accounted 
for using the acquisition 
method. The consideration for 
each acquisition is measured 
at the aggregate of fair values 
of assets given, liabilities 
incurred or assumed, and 
equity instruments issued by 
the Group in exchange for 
control of the acquiree. 
Acquisition related costs are 
recognised in the 
Consolidated Income 
Statement as incurred.
Where applicable, the 
consideration for the 
acquisition includes any asset 
or liability resulting from a 
contingent arrangement, 
measured at its acquisition 
date fair value. Subsequent 
changes in such fair values  
are adjusted through the 
Consolidated Income 
Statement. All other changes  
in the fair value of contingent 
consideration classified as an 
asset or liability are accounted 
for in accordance with 
relevant IFRSs. Changes in the 
fair value of contingent 
consideration classified as 
equity are not recognised.
If the initial accounting for a 
business combination is 
incomplete by the end of the 
reporting period in which the 
combination occurs, the 
Group reports provisional 
amounts for the items for which 
the accounting is incomplete. 
Those provisional amounts are 
adjusted during the 
measurement period, or 
additional assets or liabilities 
are recognised, to reflect new 
information obtained about 
facts and circumstances that 
existed as of the date of the 
acquisition that, if known, would 
have affected the amounts 
recognised as of that date.
The measurement period is  
the period from the date of 
acquisition to the date the 
Group obtains complete 
information about facts and 
circumstances that existed as 
of the acquisition date and  
is a maximum of one year.
Business combinations 
achieved in stages
Where a business combination 
is achieved in stages, the 
Group’s previously held 
interests in the acquired entity 
are remeasured to fair value   89

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
at the date the Group attains 
control and the resulting gain 
or loss is recognised in the 
Consolidated Income 
Statement. Amounts arising 
from interests in the acquiree 
prior to the acquisition date 
that were recognised in other 
comprehensive income are 
reclassified to the 
Consolidated Income 
Statement where such 
treatment would be 
appropriate if the interest were 
disposed of.
Purchases and sales of 
shares in a controlled entity
Where the Group’s interest in a 
controlled entity increases,  
the non-controlling interests’ 
share of net assets, excluding 
any allocation of goodwill, is 
transferred to retained 
earnings. Any difference 
between the cost of the 
additional interest and the 
existing carrying value of the 
non-controlling interests’ share 
of net assets is recorded in 
retained earnings.
Where the Group’s interest in a 
controlled entity decreases, 
but the Group retains control, 
the share of net assets 
disposed, excluding any 
allocation of goodwill, is 
transferred to the non-
controlling interest. Any 
difference between the 
proceeds of the disposal and 
the existing carrying value of 
the net assets or liabilities 
transferred to the non-
controlling interests is recorded 
in retained earnings.
Disposal of controlling 
interests where non-
controlling interest retained
Where the Group disposes of a 
controlling interest but retains 
a non-controlling interest in the 
business, the Group accounts 
for the disposal of a subsidiary 
and the subsequent 
acquisition of a joint venture, 
associate or available-for-sale 
asset at fair value on initial 
recognition. On disposal  
of a subsidiary all amounts 
deferred in equity are  
recycled to the Consolidated 
Income Statement. 
Business combinations 
occurring prior to 4th 
October, 2009
The acquisition of subsidiaries is 
accounted for using the 
purchase method. The cost of 
the acquisition is measured as 
the aggregate of the fair 
values, at the date of 
exchange, of assets given, 
liabilities incurred or assumed, 
and equity instruments issued 
by the Group in exchange for 
control of the acquiree, plus 
any costs directly attributable 
to the business combination. 
The acquiree’s identifiable 
assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities are 
recognised at their fair values 
at the acquisition date, other 
than non-current assets and 
liabilities of disposal groups 
which are recognised at fair 
value less costs to sell. Where 
an adjustment to fair values 
relating to previously held 
interests (including interests 
which were equity accounted 
under IAS 28, Investments  
in Associates) is required  
on achieving control, this  
is accounted for as an 
adjustment directly in equity.
Goodwill arising on 
acquisitions is recognised as 
an asset and initially measured 
at cost, being the excess  
of the cost of the business 
combination over the Group’s 
interest in the net fair value of 
the identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities 
recognised. Where control  
is achieved in more than  
one exchange transaction, 
goodwill is calculated 
separately for each transaction 
based on the cost of each 
transaction and the 
appropriate share of the 
acquiree’s net assets based  
on net fair values at the time  
of each transaction.
The interest of non-controlling 
interest in the acquiree is 
initially measured at the 
non-controlling interest’s 
proportion of the net fair  
value of the assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities 
recognised. 
Purchase and sale of shares 
in a controlled entity 
occurring prior to 4th 
October, 2009
Where the Group’s interest  
in a controlled entity increases, 
no adjustments are recorded 
to the fair values of the  
assets already held on the 
Consolidated Statement of 
Financial Position. The Group 
calculates the goodwill arising 
as the difference between the 
cost of the additional interest 
acquired and the increase in 
the Group’s interest in the fair 
value of the subsidiary’s net 
assets at the date of the 
exchange transaction. Any 
difference between the cost  
of the additional interest, 
goodwill arising and the 
existing carrying value of the 
non-controlling interest’s share 
of net assets is adjusted 
directly in equity.
Where the Group’s interest in a 
controlled entity decreases, 
which does not result in a 
change of control, the Group 
increases the non-controlling 
interest’s share of net assets by 
the book value of the share of 
net assets disposed. Any profit 
or loss on disposal of the share 
of net assets to the non-
controlling interest is 
calculated by reference to the 
consideration received, the 
book value of the share of net 
assets disposed and a 
proportion of any relevant 
goodwill in the Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position 
relating to the subsidiary.
Accounting for subsidiaries
A subsidiary is an entity 
controlled by the Group. 
Control is achieved where the 
Group has the power to 
govern the financial and 
operating policies of an entity 
so as to obtain benefits from  
its activities.
The results of subsidiaries 
acquired or disposed of during 
the year are included in the 
Consolidated Income 
Statement from the effective 
date control is obtained or up 
to the date control is 
relinquished, as appropriate. 
Where necessary, adjustments 
are made to the financial  DAILY MAIL AND GENERAL TRUST PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2011 90

statements of subsidiaries to 
bring their accounting policies 
into line with those used by 
other members of the Group.
All intra-group transactions, 
balances, income and 
expenses are eliminated on 
consolidation.
Non-controlling interests
Non-controlling interests in the 
net assets of consolidated 
subsidiaries are identified 
separately from the Group’s 
equity therein. Non-controlling 
interests consist of the amount 
of those interests at the date  
of the original business 
combination and the non-
controlling interest’s share of 
changes in equity since the 
date of the combination. 
Losses attributable to non-
controlling interests in excess  
of the non-controlling interest’s 
share in equity are allocated 
against the interests of the 
Group except to the extent 
that the non-controlling 
interest has a binding 
obligation and is able to make 
an additional investment to 
cover such losses. When the 
subsidiary subsequently reports 
profits, the non-controlling 
interest does not participate 
until the Group has recovered 
all of the losses of the non-
controlling interest it  
previously reported.
Interests in joint ventures 
and associates
A joint venture is a contractual 
arrangement whereby the 
Group and other parties 
undertake an economic 
activity that is subject to joint 
control, that is when the 
strategic financial and 
operating policy decisions 
relating to the activities require 
the unanimous consent of the 
parties sharing control.
An associate is an entity over 
which the Group has 
significant influence and that is 
neither a subsidiary nor an 
interest in a joint venture. 
Significant influence is the 
power to participate in the 
financial and operating policy 
decisions of the investee, but is 
not in control or joint control 
over those policies.
The post-tax results of joint 
ventures and associates are 
incorporated in the Group’s 
results using the equity method 
of accounting. Under the 
equity method, investments in 
joint ventures and associates 
are carried in the Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position 
at a cost as adjusted for 
post-acquisition changes in 
the Group’s share of the net 
assets of the joint venture and 
associate, less any impairment 
in the value of investment. 
Losses of joint ventures and 
associates in excess of the of 
the Group’s interest in that joint 
venture or associate are not 
recognised. Additional losses 
are provided for, and a liability 
is recognised, only to the 
extent that the Group has 
incurred legal or constructive 
obligations or made payments 
on behalf of the joint venture 
or associate.
Any excess of the cost of 
acquisition over the Group’s 
share of the net fair value of 
the identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities of the 
joint venture or associate 
recognised at the date of 
acquisition is recognised as 
goodwill. The goodwill is 
included within the carrying 
amount of the investment.
Foreign currencies
For the purpose of presenting 
consolidated financial 
statements, the assets and 
liabilities of entities with a 
functional currency other  
than Sterling are translated to 
Sterling using exchange rates 
prevailing on the period end 
date. Income and expense 
items and cash flows are 
translated at the average 
exchange rates for the period 
and exchange differences 
arising are recognised directly 
in equity. On disposal of  
a foreign operation, the 
cumulative amount recognised 
in equity relating to that 
operation is recognised in  
the Consolidated Income 
Statement as part of the  
gain or loss on sale.
The Group records foreign 
exchange differences arising 
on retranslation of foreign 
operations within the 
translation reserve in equity.
In preparing the financial 
statements of the individual 
entities, transactions in 
currencies other than the 
entity’s functional currency are 
recorded at the exchange rate 
prevailing on the date of the 
transaction. At each period 
end date, monetary items 
denominated in foreign 
currencies are retranslated at 
the rates prevailing on the

represents the excess of the 
cost of acquisition over the 
Group’s interest in the net fair 
value of the identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent 
liabilities of the entity 
recognised at the date of 
acquisition. Goodwill is initially 
recognised as an asset at cost 
and is subsequently measured 
at cost less any accumulated 
impairment losses. Negative 
goodwill arising on an 
acquisition is recognised 
directly in the Consolidated 
Income Statement.
Goodwill and fair value 
adjustments arising on the 
acquisition of a foreign entity 
are treated as assets and 
liabilities of the foreign entity 
and are translated at the 
closing exchange rates on the 
period end date.
Goodwill arising before the 
date of transition to IFRS, on 4th 
October, 2004, has been 
retained at the previous UK 
GAAP amounts subject to 
being tested for impairment at 
that date. 
On disposal of a subsidiary or a 
jointly controlled entity, the 
attributable amount of 
goodwill is included in the 
determination of the profit or 
loss recognised in the 
Consolidated Income 
Statement on disposal. 
Goodwill written off to reserves 
under UK GAAP prior to 1998 
has not been reinstated and is 
not included in determining 
any subsequent profit or loss 
on disposal.
Impairment of goodwill
The Group tests goodwill 
annually for impairment, or 
more frequently if there are 
indicators that goodwill might 
be impaired. Intangible assets 
are tested separately from 
goodwill only where 
impairment indicators exist. 
The Group has no intangible 
assets with indefinite lives
For the purpose of impairment 
testing, assets are grouped at 
the lowest levels for which 
there are separately 
identifiable cash flows, known 
as cash-generating units 
(CGUs). If the recoverable 
amount of the cash-
generating unit is less than the 
carrying amount of the unit, 
the impairment loss is 
allocated first to reduce the 
carrying amount of any 
goodwill allocated to the unit 
and then to the other assets of 
the unit, pro-rated on the basis 
of the carrying amount of 
each asset in the unit, but 
subject to not reducing any 
asset below its recoverable 
amount. An impairment loss 
recognised for goodwill is not 
reversed in a subsequent 
period.
When testing for impairment, 
the recoverable amounts for 
all of the Group’s CGUs are 
measured at the higher of 
value in use and fair value less 
costs to sell. Value in use is 
calculated by discounting 
future expected cash flows. 
These calculations use cash 
flow projections based on 
management approved 
budgets and projections which 
reflect management’s current 
experience and future 
expectations of the markets in 
which the CGU operates. Risk 
adjusted discount rates used 
by the Group in its impairment 
tests range from 8.5% to 10.0% 
post tax (9.2% to 10.7% pre tax) 
(2010 8.5% to 11.5% post tax, 
9.3% to 12.3% pre tax), the 
choice of rates depending on 
the market and maturity of the 
CGU. The Group’s estimate of 
the weighted average cost of 
capital has not changed 
significantly from the previous 
year. The projections consist of 
Board approved budgets for 
the following year, three year 
plans and growth rates 
beyond this period. The 
long-term growth rates range 
between -3.0% and +3.0% 
(2010 0.0% and 3.0%) and vary 
with management’s view of 
the CGU’s market position, 
maturity of the relevant market 
and do not exceed the 
long-term average growth  
rate for the market in which  
it operates.
Any impairment is recognised 
immediately in the 
Consolidated Income 
Statement and is not 
subsequently reversed.
Research and development 
expenditure
Expenditure on research 
activities is recognised as an 
expense in the period in which 
it is incurred.
An internally-generated 
intangible asset arising from 
the Group’s development 
activity, including software for 
internal use, is recognised only 
if the asset can be separately 
identified, it is probable the 
asset will generate future 
economic benefits, the 
development cost can be 
measured reliably, the project 
is technically feasible and the 
project will be completed with 
a view to sell or use the asset. 
Additionally, guidance in 
Standing Interpretations 
Committee (SIC) 32 has been 
applied in accounting for 
internally developed website 
development costs.
Internally-generated 
intangible assets are amortised 
on a straight-line basis over 
their estimated useful lives, 
when the asset is available for 
use, and are reported net of 
impairment losses. Where no 
internally-generated 
intangible asset can be 
recognised, development 
expenditure is charged to the 
Consolidated Income 
Statement in the period in 
which it incurred.
Licences
Radio licences are stated at 
cost less accumulated 
amortisation. Amortisation is 
charged to the Consolidated 
Income Statement on a 
straight-line basis over the 
estimated useful lives from the 
commencement of service of 
the network, estimated by 
management to be 20 years.
Computer software licences 
are capitalised on the basis of 
the costs incurred to acquire 
and bring in to use the specific 
software. These costs are 
amortised over their estimated 
useful lives, being three to  
five years. DAILY MAIL AND GENERAL TRUST PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2011 92

Costs that are directly 
associated with the production 
of identifiable and unique 
software products controlled 
by the Group, and that are 
expected to generate 
economic benefits exceeding 
costs and directly attributable 
overheads are capitalised  
as intangibles. 
Computer software which is 
integral to a related item of 
hardware equipment is 
accounted for as property, 
plant and equipment.
Costs associated with 
maintaining computer 
software programmes are 
recognised as an expense  
as incurred.
At each period end date, the 
Group reviews the carrying 
amounts of its tangible and 
intangible assets to determine 
whether there is any indication 
that those assets have suffered 
an impairment loss. If any such 
indication exists, the 
recoverable amount of the 
asset is estimated in order to 
determine the extent of the 
impairment loss (if any). Where 
the asset does not generate 
cash flows that are 
independent from other assets, 
the Group estimates the 
recoverable amount of the 
cash-generating unit to which 
the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an 
indefinite useful life is tested for 
impairment annually and 
whenever there is an 
indication that the asset may 
be impaired.
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets with 
finite lives are stated at cost 
less accumulated amortisation 
and impairment losses. 
Amortisation is charged to the 
Consolidated Income 
Statement on a reducing 
balance or straight-line basis 
over the estimated useful lives 
of the intangible assets from 
the date they become 
available for use. The 
estimated useful lives are as 
follows:
Publishing rights, 
titles and 
exhibitions 5 – 30 years
Radio licences 20 years
Brands 3 – 20 years
Market and 
customer-related 
databases 3 – 20 years
Customer 
relationships 3 – 20 years
Computer software 
licences 2 – 5 years
Impairment of intangible 
assets
At each period end date, 
reviews are carried out of the 
carrying amounts of tangible 
and intangible assets and 
goodwill to determine whether 
there is any indication that 
those assets have suffered an 
impairment loss. If any such 
indication exists, the 
recoverable amount, which is 
the higher of value in use and 
fair value less costs to sell, of 
the asset is estimated in order 
to determine the extent, if any, 
of the impairment loss. Where 
the asset does not generate 
cash flows that are 
independent from other assets, 
value in use estimates are 
made based on the cash flows 
of the cash-generating unit to 
which the asset belongs.
If the recoverable amount of 
an asset or cash-generating 
unit is estimated to be less than 
its net carrying amount, the 
net carrying amount of the 
asset or cash-generating unit is 
reduced to its recoverable 
amount. Impairment losses are 
recognised immediately in the 
Consolidated Income 
Statement.
The Group assesses at the end 
of each reporting period 
whether there is any indication 
that an impairment loss 
recognised in prior periods, for 
an asset other than goodwill, 
may no longer exist or may 
have decreased. If any such 
indication exists, the Group 
estimates the recoverable 
amount of that asset. In 
assessing whether there is any 
indication that an impairment 
loss recognised in prior periods 
for an asset other than 
goodwill may no longer exist  
or may have decreased, the 
Group considers, as a 
minimum, the following 
indications:
(a) Whether the asset’s market 
value has increased 
significantly during the 
period
(b) Whether any significant 
changes with a favourable 
effect on the entity have 
taken place during the 
period, or will take place in 
the near future, in the 
technological, market, 
economic or legal 
environment in which the 
entity operates or in the 
market to which the asset is 
dedicated and
(c) Whether market interest 
rates or other market rates 
of return on investments 
have decreased during the 
period, and those 
decreases are likely to 
affect the discount rate 
used in calculating the 
asset’s value in use and 
increase the asset’s 
recoverable amount 
materially.
Property, plant and 
equipment
Land and buildings held for 
use are stated in the 
Consolidated Statement of 
Financial Position at their cost, 
less any subsequent 
accumulated depreciation 
and subsequent accumulated 
impairment losses. 
Assets in the course of 
construction are carried at 
cost, less any recognised

of these assets commences 
when the assets are ready for

have been incurred in bringing 
the inventories to their present 
location and condition. The 
Group uses the Average Cost 
(AVCO) method in the national 
and local media divisions and 
the First In First Out (FIFO) 
method in the remaining 
divisions.
Pre-publication costs
Pre-publication costs represent 
direct costs incurred in the 
development of titles prior to 
their publication. These costs 
are recognised as work in 
progress on the Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position 
to the extent that future 
economic benefit is virtually 
certain and can be measured 
reliably.
Marketing costs
Marketing and promotional 
costs are charged to the

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents 
shown in the Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position 
includes cash, short-term 
deposits and other short-term 
highly liquid investments with 
an original maturity of three 
months or less. For the purpose 
of the Consolidated Cash Flow 
Statement, cash and cash 
equivalents are as defined 
above, net of bank overdrafts.
Revenue
Group revenue comprises 
revenue of the Company and 
its subsidiary undertakings. 
Revenue is stated at the fair 
value of consideration, net of 
value added tax, trade 
discounts and commission 
where applicable and is 
recognised using methods 
appropriate for the Group’s 
businesses. 
Where revenue contracts have 
multiple elements (such as 
software licences, data 
subscriptions and support), the 
Company considers all aspects 
of the transaction to determine 
whether these elements can 
be separately identified. Where 
transaction elements can be 
separately identified and 
revenue can be allocated 
between them on a fair and 
reliable basis, revenue for each 
element is accounted for 
according to the relevant 
policy below. Where transaction 
elements cannot be separately 
identified, revenue is recognised 
over the contract period. 
The principal revenue 
recognition policies, as 
applied by the Group’s major 
businesses, are as follows:
• Subscriptions revenue, 
including revenue from 
information services, is 
recognised over the period 
of the subscription or 
contract.
• Publishing and circulation 
revenue is recognised on 
issue of publication or report. 
• Advertising revenue is 
recognised on issue of 
publication, over the period 
of the online campaign or 
on the date of broadcast. 
• Contract print revenue is 
recognised on completion 
of the print contract. 
• Exhibitions, training and 
events revenues are 
recognised over the period 
of the event. 
• Software licence revenue is 
recognised on delivery of 
the software licence or over 
the period of the contract  
if support is unable to be 
separately identified and 
revenue allocated on a fair 
and reliable basis.
• Support revenue associated 
with software licences and 
subscriptions is recognised 
over the term of the support 
contract.
• Long-term contract revenue 
is recognised under the 
percentage of completion 
method according to  
the percentage of work 
completed at the period 
end date.  DAILY MAIL AND GENERAL TRUST PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2011 94

Operating profit before

impairment of goodwill and 
acquired intangible assets
The Group discloses as 
operating profit, profit before 
exceptional operating costs, 
impairment of goodwill and 
intangible assets, amortisation 
of acquired intangible assets 
arising on business 
combinations, share of results 
from associates and joint 
ventures, other gains and 
losses, investment income  
and finance costs, but after 
amortisation of internally 
generated and acquired 
computer software. The 
Directors believe that this 
measure is useful to readers  
as it shows the results of the 
Group’s operations before 
contribution from joint ventures 
and associates and because  
it excludes one-off gains  
and losses on disposal of 
businesses, properties  
and similar items of a non-
recurring nature.
Other gains and losses
Other gains and losses 
comprise profit or loss on sale 
of trading investments, profit or 
loss on sale of property, plant 
and equipment, impairment of 
available-for-sale assets, profit 
or loss on sale of businesses 
and profit or loss on sale of 
joint ventures and associates.
Leasing
Leases are classified as 
finance leases whenever the 
terms of the lease transfer 
substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership of the 
asset to the lessee. All other 
leases are classified as 
operating leases. 
Assets held under finance 
leases are recognised as assets 
of the Group at their fair value 
at the inception of the lease 
or, if lower, at the present value 
of the minimum lease 
payments as determined at 
the inception of the lease. The 
corresponding liability to the 
lessor is included in the 
Consolidated Statement of 
Financial Position as a finance 
lease obligation. Lease 
payments are apportioned 
between finance charges and 
reduction of the lease 
obligation so as to achieve a 
constant rate of interest on the 
remaining balance of the 
liability. Finance charges are 
recognised in the Consolidated 
Income Statement.
Rentals payable under 
operating leases are charged 
to the Consolidated Income 
Statement on a straight-line 
basis over the term of the 
relevant lease. Benefits 
received and receivable as an 
incentive to enter into an 
operating lease are also 
spread on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term.
Dividends
Dividend income from 
investments is recognised 
when the shareholders’ rights 
to receive payment have been 
established. Dividends are 
recognised as a distribution in 
the period in which they are 
approved by the shareholders. 
Interim dividends are recorded 
in the period in which they  
are paid.
Borrowing costs
Unless capitalised under IAS 23 
all borrowing costs are 
recognised in the 
Consolidated Income 
Statement in the period in 
which they are incurred. 
Finance charges, including 
premiums paid on settlement 
or redemption and direct issue 
costs and discounts related to 
borrowings, are accounted for 
on an accruals basis and 
charged to the Consolidated 
Income Statement using the 
effective interest method.
Retirement benefits
As permitted by IFRS 1, 
First-time adoption of 
International Financial 
Reporting Standards, the 
Group elected to recognise  
all cumulative actuarial gains 
and losses in the pension 
schemes operated by the 
Group at 4th October, 2004 
the date of transition to IFRS. 
Pension scheme assets are 
measured at market value at 
the period end date. Scheme 
liabilities are measured using 
the projected unit credit 
method and discounted at a 
rate reflecting current yields on 
high quality corporate bonds 
having regard to the duration 
of the liability profiles of  
the schemes.
For defined benefit retirement 
plans, the difference between 
the fair value of the plan assets 
and the present value of the 
plan liabilities is recognised as 
an asset or liability on the 
Statement of Consolidated 
Financial Position. Actuarial 
gains and losses arising in the 
year are taken to the 
Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income. For 
this purpose, actuarial gains 
and losses comprise both the 
effects of changes in actuarial 
assumptions and experience 
adjustments arising because of 
differences between the 
previous actuarial assumptions 
and what has actually 
occurred. For defined benefit 
schemes, the cost of providing 
benefits is determined using 
the projected unit credit 
method, with actuarial 
valuations being carried out 
triennially. In accordance with 
the advice of independent 
qualified actuaries in assessing 
whether to recognise a surplus, 
the Group has regard to the 
principles set out in IFRIC 14.
Other movements in the  
net surplus or deficit are 
recognised in the 
Consolidated Income 
Statement, including the 
current service cost, any past 
service cost and the effect of 
any curtailment or settlements. 
The interest cost less the 
expected return on assets  
is also charged to the 
Consolidated Income 
Statement within net  
finance costs. 
Since the assets and liabilities 
of the Group’s defined benefit 
plans cannot be allocated to 
individual entities on a fair and 
reasonable basis, the scheme’s 
assets and liabilities are not 
attributed to reporting 
segments and the pension 
charge in each segment in the 
segmental analysis represents  95

The Group’s contributions to 
defined contribution pension 
plans are charged to the 
Consolidated Income 
Statement as they fall due.
Taxation
Income tax expense represents 
the sum of the current tax 
payable and deferred tax for 
the year.
The current tax payable or 
recoverable is based on the 
taxable profit for the year. 
Taxable profit differs from profit 
as reported in the Consolidated 
Income Statement because 
some items of income or 
expense are taxable or 
deductible in different years or 
may never be taxable or 
deductible. The Group’s 
liability for current tax is 
calculated using the UK and 
foreign tax rates that have 
been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the period end date. 
Current tax assets and liabilities 
are offset and stated net in the 
Consolidated Statement of 
Financial Position when there is 
a legally enforceable right to 
set off current tax assets 
against current tax liabilities 
and when they either relate to 
income taxes levied by the 
same taxation authority or on 
the same taxable entity or on 
different taxable entities which 
intend to settle the current  
tax assets and liabilities on  
a net basis.
Deferred tax is the tax expected 
to be payable or recoverable 
in the future arising from 
temporary differences 
between the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities in the 
financial statements and the 
corresponding tax bases used 
in the computation of taxable 
profit. It is accounted for using 
the balance sheet liability 
method. Deferred tax liabilities 
are generally recognised for all 
taxable temporary differences 
and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it 
is probable that taxable profits 
will be available against which 
deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. 
Such assets and liabilities are 
not recognised if the 
temporary differences arise 
from the initial recognition of 
goodwill or from the initial 
recognition other than in a 
business combination of other 
assets and liabilities in a 
transaction that affects neither 
the taxable profit nor the 
accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are 
recognised for taxable 
temporary differences arising 
in investments in subsidiaries 
and associates, and interests in 
joint ventures, except where 
the Group is able to control the 
reversal of the temporary 
difference and it is probable 
that the temporary difference 
will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
Goodwill arising on business 
combinations also includes 
amounts corresponding to 
deferred tax liabilities 
recognised in respect of 
acquired intangible assets.  
A deferred tax liability is 
recognised to the extent that 
the fair value of the assets for 
accounting purposes exceeds 
the value of those assets for tax 
purposes and will form part  
of the associated goodwill  
on acquisition.
The carrying amount of 
deferred tax assets is reviewed 
at each period end date and 
reduced to the extent that it is 
no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profits will be 
available to allow all or part of 
the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at 
the tax rates that are expected 
to apply in the period when 
the liability is settled or the 
asset realised, based on tax 
rates that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by 
the period end date, and is  
not discounted.
Deferred tax assets and 
liabilities are offset when there 
is a legally enforceable right to 
set off current tax assets 
against current tax liabilities 
and when they relate to 
income taxes levied by the 
same taxation authority and 
the Group intends to settle its 
current assets and liabilities on 
a net basis.
Tax is charged or credited to 
the Consolidated Income 
Statement, except when it 
relates to items charged or 
credited directly to equity, in 
which case the tax is also 
recognised directly in equity.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial 
liabilities are recognised on the 
Statement of Consolidated 
Financial Position when the 
Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the 
instrument.
Financial assets and liabilities 
are offset and the net amount 
reported in the Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position 
when there is a legally 
enforceable right to settle on a 
net basis, or realise the asset 
and liability simultaneously 
and where the Group intends 
to net settle.
Financial assets
Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry 
any interest and are stated  
at their nominal value as 
reduced by appropriate 
allowances for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts.
Available-for-sale investments
Investments and financial 
assets are recognised and 
de-recognised on a trade 
date where a purchase or sale 
of an investment is under a 
contract whose terms require 
delivery of the investment 
within the timeframe 
established by the market 
concerned, and are measured 
at fair value, including 
transaction costs.
Investments are classified as 
either held-for-trading or 
available-for-sale. Where 
securities are held-for-trading

Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest 
bearing and are stated at their 
nominal value.
Financial liabilities and equity 
instruments issued by the 
Group are classified according 
to the substance of the 
contractual arrangements 
entered into and the 
definitions of a financial 
liability and an equity 
instrument. An equity 
instrument is any contract that 
evidences a residual interest in 
the assets of the Group after 
deducting all of its liabilities. 
The accounting policies 
adopted for specific financial 
liabilities and equity 
instruments are set out below:
Capital market and bank 
borrowings
Interest-bearing loans and 
overdrafts are initially measured 
at fair value (which is equal to 
net proceeds at inception), 
and are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost, using the 
effective interest rate method. 
A portion of the Group’s bonds 
are subject to fair value hedge 
accounting as explained 
below and this portion is 
adjusted for the movement in 
the hedged risk to the extent 
that hedge effectiveness is 
achieved. Any difference 
between the proceeds, net of 
transaction costs and the 
settlement or redemption of 
borrowings is recognised over 
the term of the borrowing.
Equity instruments 
Equity instruments issued by 
the Group are recorded at the 
proceeds received, net of 
transaction costs.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised 
when the Group has a present 
obligation, legal or 
constructive, as a result of a 
past event, and it is probable 
that the Group will be required 
to settle that obligation. 
Provisions are measured at the 
Directors’ best estimate of the 
expenditure required to settle 
the obligation at the period 
end date, and are discounted 
to present value where the 
effect is material.
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled 
and cash-settled share-based 
payments to certain 
employees. Equity-settled 
share-based payments are 
measured at fair value 
(excluding the effect of 
non-market-based vesting 
conditions) at the date  
of grant. The fair value 
determined at the grant date 
of the equity-settled share-
based payments is expensed 
on a straight-line basis over the 
vesting period, based on the 
Group’s estimate of the  
shares that will eventually  
vest and adjusted for the 
effect of non-market-based 
vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured using a 
binomial pricing model which 
is calibrated using a Black-
Scholes framework. The 
expected life used in the 
models has been adjusted, 
based on management’s best 
estimate, for the effect of 
non-transferability, exercise 
restrictions and behavioural 
considerations.
A liability equal to the portion 
of the goods or services 
received is recognised at the 
current fair value determined 
at each period end date for 
cash-settled share-based 
payments.
The Group has applied the 
requirements of IFRS 2, 
share-based payments to all 
equity instruments granted after 
7th September, 2002 but not 
fully vested at 4th October, 2004 
the date of transition to IFRS.
Critical accounting 
judgements and key sources 
of estimation uncertainty
In addition to the judgement 
taken by management in 
selecting and applying the 
accounting policies set out 
above, management has 
made the following 
judgements concerning the 
amounts recognised in the 
consolidated financial 
statements:
Forecasting
The Group prepares medium-
term forecasts based on Board 
approved budgets and 
three-year outlooks. These are 
used to support judgements 
made in the preparation of the 
Group’s financial statements 
including the recognition of 
deferred tax assets in different 
jurisdictions, the Group’s going 
concern assessment and for 
the purposes of impairment 
reviews. Longer term forecasts 
use long-term growth rates 
applicable to the relevant 
businesses.
Impairment of goodwill and 
intangible assets
Determining whether goodwill 
and intangible assets are 
impaired or whether a reversal 
of an impairment of intangible 
assets should be recorded 
requires an estimation of the 
value in use of the relevant 
cash-generating units. The 
value in use calculation 
requires management to 
estimate the future cash flows 
expected to arise from the 
cash-generating unit and 
compare the net present value 
of these cash flows using a 
suitable discount rate to 
determine if any impairment 
has occurred. A key area of 
judgement is deciding the 
long-term growth rate of the 
applicable businesses and the 
discount rate applied to those 
cash flows (Note 18). The 
carrying amount of goodwill 
and intangible assets at the 
period end date was £1,035.2 
million (2010 £1,113.7 million,  97

net impairment charge of 
£24.4 million (2010 reversal of 
£19.9 million, 2009 charge 
£346.6 million) was recognised 
during the year (Notes 18  
and 19).
Acquisitions and intangible 
assets
The Group’s accounting policy 
on the acquisition of 
subsidiaries is to allocate 
purchase consideration to the 
fair value of identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent 
liabilities acquired with any 
excess consideration 
representing goodwill. 
Determining the fair value of 
assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities acquired 
requires significant estimates 
and assumptions, including 
assumptions with respect to 
cash flows and unprovided 
liabilities and commitments, 
including in respect to tax, are 
often used. The Group 
recognises intangible assets 
acquired as part of a business 
combination at fair values at 
the date of the acquisition. The 
determination of these fair 
values is based upon 
management’s judgement 
and includes assumptions on 
the timing and amount of 
future cash flows generated by 
the assets and the selection of 
an appropriate discount rate. 
Additionally, management 
must estimate the expected 
useful economic lives of 
intangible assets and charge 
amortisation on these assets 
accordingly.
Contingent consideration 
payable
Estimates are required in respect 
of the amount of contingent 
consideration payable on 
acquisitions, which is determined 
according to formulae agreed 
at the time of the business 
combination, and normally 
related to the future earnings 
of the acquired business. The 
Directors review the amount of 
contingent consideration likely 
to become payable at each 
period end date, the major 
assumption being the level of 
future profits of the acquired 
business. The Group has 
outstanding contingent 
consideration payable 
amounting to £11.8 million 
(2010 £17.8 million, 2009  
£23.5 million).
Contingent consideration 
payable is discounted to its fair 
value in accordance with 
applicable International 
Financial Reporting Standards. 
For acquisitions completed 
prior to 4th October, 2009, the 
difference between the fair 
value of these liabilities and 
the actual amounts payable is 
charged to the Consolidated 
Income Statement as notional 
finance costs with 
remeasurement of the liability 
being recorded against 
goodwill. For acquisitions 
completed in the current 
period, movements in the fair 
value of these liabilities are 
recorded in the Consolidated 
Income Statement  
in Financing.
Contingent consideration 
receivable
Estimates are required in 
respect of the amount of 
contingent consideration 
receivable on disposals, which 
is determined according to 
formulae agreed at the time of 
the disposal and is normally 
related to the future earnings 
of the disposed business. The 
Directors review the amount of 
contingent consideration likely 
to be receivable at each 
period end date, the major 
assumption being the level of 
future profits of the disposed 
business. The Group has 
outstanding contingent 
consideration receivable 
amounting to £1.6 million (2010 
£4.9 million, 2009 £nil).
Contingent consideration 
receivable is discounted to its 
fair value in accordance with 
applicable International 
Financial Reporting Standards. 
For disposals completed prior 
to 4th October, 2009, the 
difference between the fair 
value of these liabilities and 
the actual amounts payable is 
charged to the Consolidated 
Income Statement as notional 
finance costs with 
remeasurement of the liability 
being recorded against 
goodwill. For acquisitions 
completed in the current 
period, movements in the fair 
value of these liabilities are 
recorded in the Consolidated 
Income Statement  
in Financing.
Adjusted profit
The Group presents adjusted 
earnings by making 
adjustments for costs and 
profits which management 
believe to be exceptional in 
nature by virtue of their size or 
incidence or have a distortive 
effect on current year 
earnings. Such items would 
include costs associated with 
business combinations, one off 
gains and losses on disposal of 
businesses, properties and 
similar items of a non-recurring 
nature together with 
reorganisation costs and 
similar charges, tax and by 
adding back impairment of 
goodwill and amortisation and 
impairment of intangible assets 
arising on business 
combinations. See Note 13 for 
a reconciliation of profit before 
tax to adjusted profit. 
Share-based payments
The Group makes share-based 
payments to certain 
employees. These payments 
are measured at their 
estimated fair value at the 
date of grant, calculated using 
an appropriate option pricing 
model. The fair value 
determined at the grant date 
is expensed on a straight-line 
basis over the vesting period, 
based on the estimate of the 
number of shares that will 
eventually vest. The key 
assumptions used in 
calculating the fair value of 
the options are the discount 
rate, the Group’s share price 
volatility, dividend yield, 
risk-free rate of return, and 
expected option lives. 
Management regularly 
perform a true-up of the 
estimate of the number of 
shares that are expected to 
vest, this is dependent on the 
anticipated number of leavers. 
See Note 40 for further details. DAILY MAIL AND GENERAL TRUST PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2011 98

Taxation
Being a multinational Group 
with tax affairs in many 
geographic locations 
inherently leads to a highly 
complex tax structure which 
makes the degree of 
estimation and judgement 
more challenging. The 
resolution of issues is not always 
within the control of the Group 
and is often dependent on the 
efficiency of legal processes. 
Such issues can take several 
years to resolve. The Group 
takes a conservative view of 
unresolved issues, however, the 
inherent uncertainty regarding 
these items means that the 
eventual resolution could differ 
significantly from the 
accounting estimates and, 
therefore, impact the Group’s 
results and future cash flows. 
As described above, the 
Group makes estimates 
regarding the recoverability of 
tax assets relating to losses 
based on forecasts of future 
taxable profits which are, by 
their nature, uncertain.
Retirement benefit obligations
The cost of defined benefit 
pension plans is determined 
using actuarial valuations 
prepared by the Group’s 
actuaries. This involves making 
certain assumptions 
concerning discount rates, 
expected rates of return on 
assets, future salary increases, 
mortality rates and future 
pension increases. Due to the 
long-term nature of these 
plans, such estimates are 
subject to significant 
uncertainty. The assumptions 
and the resulting estimates are 
reviewed annually and, when 
appropriate, changes are 
made which affect the 
actuarial valuations and, 
hence, the amount of 
retirement benefit expense 
recognised in the 
Consolidated Income 
Statement and the amounts of 
actuarial gains and losses 
recognised in the Statement of 
Changes in Equity. The 
carrying amount of the 
retirement benefit obligation 
at 2nd October, 2011 was a 
deficit of £336.2 million (2010 
£271.4 million, 2009 £430.4 
million). Further details are 
given in Note 33. 99

3 SEGMENT ANALYSIS
The Group’s business activities are split into seven operating divisions: RMS, business information, 
events, Euromoney, national media, local media and radio. These divisions are the basis on  
which information is reported to the Group Board. The segment result is the measure used for the 
purposes of resource allocation and assessment and represents profit earned by each segment, 
including share of results from joint ventures and associates but before exceptional operating 
costs, amortisation and impairment charges, other gains and losses, net finance costs and taxation.
Details of the types of products and services from which each segment derives its revenues are 
included within the business review on pages 12 to 37.
The accounting policies applied in preparing the management information for each of the 
reportable segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies described in Note 2.
Inter-segment sales are charged at prevailing market prices other than the sale of newsprint and 
related services from the national media to the local media division which is at cost to the Group 
plus a margin where relevant. The amount of newsprint sold between segments during the year 
amounted to £23.6 million (2010 £22.0 million). DAILY MAIL AND GENERAL TRUST PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2011 100

A current tax credit of £nil (2010 £0.6 million) and a deferred tax credit of £17.7 million (2010 £45.2 million) was recognised directly in

The net prior year credit of £6.5 million (2010 £67.6 million), which includes a charge of £nil (2010 £0.5 million) relating to discontinued 
operations, arose largely from a reassessment of prior year capital allowance claims.
Adjusted tax on profits before amortisation and impairment of intangible assets, restructuring costs and non-recurring items 
(adjusted tax charge) amounted to a charge of £35.5 million (2010 £31.2 million) and the resulting rate is 15.0% (2010 13.7%). The 
differences between the tax credit and the adjusted tax charge are shown in the reconciliation below:

Tax on other exceptional items (38.7) (34.6)
Adjusted tax charge on the profit for the period (35.6) (31.2)
In calculating the adjusted tax rate, the Group excludes the potential future deferred tax effects of intangible assets and goodwill 
(other than internally generated and acquired computer software) as it prefers to give the users of its accounts a view of the tax 
charge based on the current status of such items.
Tax on other exceptional items includes a credit of £29.6 million (2010 £30.4 million) relating to the recognition of further UK tax losses 
and other temporary differences which are treated as exceptional due to their material impact on the Group’s adjusted  
tax charge. 111

14 EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share of 29.2p (2010 52.1p) and diluted earnings per share of 29.1p (2010 52.1p) are calculated, in accordance 
with IAS 33, Earnings per share, on Group profit for the financial period of £111.6 million (2010 £199.8 million) and on the weighted 
average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the period, as set out below.
As in previous years, adjusted earnings per share have also been disclosed since the Directors consider that this alternative 
measure gives a more comparable indication of the Group’s underlying trading performance. Adjusted earnings per share of 47.0p 
(2010 50.0p) are calculated on profit for continuing and discontinued operations before exceptional operating costs, impairment of 
goodwill and intangible assets, amortisation of intangible assets arising on business combinations, other gains and losses and 
exceptional financing costs after taxation and non-controlling interests associated with those profits, of £179.7 million (2010 £177.8 
million), as set out in Note 13 above, and on the basic weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the period. 113

16 SUMMARY OF THE EFFECTS OF ACQUISITIONS
In July, 2011 the Group acquired 84.99% of the equity share capital of Ned Davis Research Group (NDR).
The remaining interest in NDR is subject to a put and call option under an earn-out agreement, in two equal instalments, based  
on the profits of NDR for the years to 31st December, 2012 and 2013. The total discounted amount that the Group expects to pay  
under this option agreement is US$15.7 million (£10.1 million). The maximum amount payable for 100% of NDR is US$173.0 million 
(£111.0 million).

NDR contributed £4.6 million to the Group’s revenue, £1.2 million to the Group’s operating profit and £0.5 million to the Group’s  
profit before tax for the period between the date of acquisition and 30th September, 2011. In addition, acquisition related costs  
of £1.0 million and restructuring costs of £0.9 million were incurred and recognised as an exceptional item in the Consolidated 
Income Statement.
If the above acquisition had been completed on the first day of the financial year, NDR would have contributed £25.3 million to the 
Group’s revenue for the year and £5.0 million to the Group’s profit before tax for the year (excluding the exceptional costs above).

(i) The amount of goodwill which is deductible for the purposes of calculating the Group’s tax charge amounts to £39.5 million.
(ii) The contingent consideration is based on future business valuations and profit multiples and has been estimated on an 
acquisition by acquisition basis using available data forecasts. The range of undiscounted outcomes for contingent 
consideration relating to acquisitions in the year is £7.4 million to £25.0 million. Certain contingent consideration arrangements 
are not capped since they are based on future business performance (Note 34).
Directly attributable costs in relation to the above acquisitions amounted to £1.0 million.
The contingent consideration has been discounted back to current values in accordance with IFRS 3, Business Combinations. In 
each case, the Group has used acquisition accounting to account for the purchase.
If all acquisitions had been completed on the first day of the financial period, Group revenues for the period would have been 
£2,017.0 million and Group profit attributable to equity holders of the parent would have been £134.0 million. This information takes 
into account the amortisation of acquired intangible assets together with related income tax effects but excludes any pre-
acquisition finance costs and should not be viewed as indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred if the 
acquisitions had actually been completed on the first day of the financial period.
Total loss attributable to equity holders of the parent since the date of acquisition for companies acquired during the period 
amounted to £0.8 million.
Goodwill arising on the acquisitions is principally attributable to the anticipated profitability relating to the distribution of the 
Group’s products in new and existing markets and anticipated operating synergies from the business combinations.

During the period, the Group acquired additional shares in controlled entities amounting to £2.7 million (2010 £12.8 million). In 
addition, the Group opted to receive a scrip dividend from Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC (Euromoney) amounting to £14.2 
million (2010 £10.7 million) thereby acquiring a further 0.5 % (2010 0.9 %) of the issued Ordinary Share capital of Euromoney. Under 
the Group’s accounting policy for the acquisition of shares in controlled entities, no adjustment has been recorded to the fair value 
of assets and liabilities already held on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. The difference between the cost of the 
additional shares and the carrying value of the non-controlling interests share of net assets is adjusted in retained earnings. The 
adjustment to retained earnings in the period was a charge of £4.3 million (2010 £2.8 million). 117

The Group’s tax charge includes a charge of £3.1 million (2010 £nil) in relation to these disposals.
In addition, the Group’s interest in Euromoney was diluted during the period by 0.29% (2010 1.65%). Under the Group’s accounting 
policy for the disposal of shares in controlled entities, no adjustment has been recorded to the fair value of assets and liabilities 
already held on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. The difference between the Group’s share of net assets before 
and after this dilution is adjusted in retained earnings. The adjustment to retained earnings in the period was a credit of £0.5 million 
(2010 charge £2.3 million).
All of the businesses disposed of during the year generated £14.0 million of the Group’s net operating cash flows, had £nil 
attributable to investing and £nil attributable to financing activities.

Goodwill impairment losses recognised in the year were £18.3 million (2010 £3.2 million).
The Group’s policy on impairment of goodwill is set out in Note 2.
Further disclosures in accordance with paragraph 134 of IAS 36, Impairment of assets, are provided where the Group holds an 
individual goodwill item relating to a CGU that is significant, which the Group considers to be 15.0% of the total net book value, in 
comparison with the Group’s total carrying value of goodwill.
The only significant item of goodwill included in the net book value above relates to BCA, a business within Metal Bulletin, which has 
a carrying value of £148.4 million (2010 £146.7 million, 2009 £144.6 million) together with intangible assets with a carrying value of 
£71.8 million (2010 £78.0 million, 2009 £84.1 million). The carrying value of BCA has been determined using a value in use calculation 
in line with IAS 36. The methodology applied to the value in use calculations reflects past experience and external sources of 
information including:
(i) Forecasts by the business based on cash flows derived from budgets for 2011. The Directors believe these to be reasonably 
achievable.
(ii) Subsequent cash flows for one additional year increased in line with growth expectations of the business.
(iii) A discount rate of 8.5% and
(iv) Long-term nominal growth rates of 3.0%.
Using the above methodology the recoverable amount exceeded the total carrying value by £84.0 million. For this business the 
Directors performed a sensitivity analysis on the total carrying value of the CGU. For the recoverable amount to be equal to the 
carrying value then the discount rate would need to be increased by 3.8% or the long-term growth rate would need to be reduced 
by 4.0%.
The carrying values of the Group’s significant items of goodwill in relation to material business combinations, which the Group 
considers to be those which have a purchase consideration in excess of £100.0 million, are further analysed as follows:

(i) Represents a reduction in the useful economic life of print assets in the national media segment following the Group’s decision 
to relocate its Surrey Quays South London print facility to a new site in Thurrock, Essex. The change in estimate of the useful 
economic life will also result in accelerated depreciation estimated to be £14.0 million in the period to 30th September, 2012 
and £14.0 million in the period to 29th September, 2013.
(ii) Included within exceptional operating costs is an impairment charge of £7.3 million (2010 £23.7 million) in relation to property, 
plant and equipment. Of this charge £1.9 million relates to computer equipment in the national media segment (2010 
£16.8 million related to printing equipment within the national media segment relating to assets considered obsolete). In 
addition, £5.4 million relates to properties held centrally following a review of the Group’s property portfolio.
Included within property, plant and equipment are assets held under hire purchase agreements with a net book value of £nil (2010 
£34.4 million) relating to the Group’s colour press operation.

In accordance with the Group’s accounting policy these properties have been transferred out of property, plant and equipment 
and into investment property at net book value.
The fair value of the Group’s investment properties as at 2nd October, 2011 was £25.0 million (2010 £11.6 million). This was arrived at 
by reference to market evidence for similar properties and was carried out by an officer of the Group’s property department. 
Property rental income earned by the Group from its investment properties amounted to £0.5 (2010 £nil). Direct operating expenses 
arising on the investment properties in the period amounted to £0.1 million (2010 £nil). The leases have an expiry date of between

The investments above represent listed equity securities and unlisted securities, which are recorded as non-current assets unless 
they are expected to be sold within one year, in which case they are recorded as current assets. The investments in listed securities 
have no fixed maturity or coupon rate and the fair value of these investments is based on quoted market prices. Since there is no 
active market upon which they are traded, other unlisted equity securities are recorded at cost less provision for impairment, as 
their fair values cannot be reliably measured.

26 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 
In December 2009, the Group sold a 50.0% interest in dmg radio Australia to Illyria Radio Investments Limited (Illyria). As required by 
IFRS 3 (2008) this transaction was accounted for as a disposal of dmg radio Australia and the subsequent acquisition of a 50.0% 
interest in the jointly controlled business. As part of this transaction Illyria invested A$37.5 million of equity which corresponded with 
the acquisition fair value of the Group’s 50.0% stake. In addition, both the Group and Illyria subscribed A$15.0 million each in 
redeemable preference shares at the time of the transaction. As a result of the funding and borrowings established during the 
transaction, a balance of A$112.5 million owed to the Group was repaid. Since the Group has joint control over the management of 
this business, the Group’s remaining 50.0% interest has been accounted for as a joint venture. The revenue of the Radio segment 
was £38.4 million from 17th December, 2009 to 3rd October, 2010. There was no inter-segment revenue for this segment.

Committed borrowing facilities
The Group’s bank loans bear interest charged at LIBOR plus a margin based on the Group’s ratio of net debt to EBITDA. Additionally 
each facility contains a covenant based on a minimum interest cover ratio. EBITDA for these purposes is defined as the aggregate 
of the Group’s consolidated operating profit before share of results of joint ventures and associates before deducting depreciation, 
amortisation and impairment of goodwill, intangible and tangible assets, before exceptional items and before interest and finance 
charges. These covenants were met at the relevant test dates during the period.
During the period the Group renewed certain bank facilities for a further five year term. The new facilities amount to £300.0 million 
and are denominated in sterling and US dollars. The terms of the new facilities are substantially the same as those of the existing 
facilities other than the net debt: EBITDA ratio is capped at 3.75 times. The Group also has access to £90.0 million of facilities, £30.0 
million of which mature in December, 2012 and £60.0 million which mature in September, 2013.

The Group’s bonds have been adjusted from their nominal values to take account of the premia, direct issue costs, discounts and 
movements in hedged risks. The issue costs, premia and discounts are being amortised over the expected lives of the bonds using 
the effective interest method. The unamortised issue costs amount to £3.8 million (2010 £4.5 million, 2009 £3.1 million), the 
unamortised premia £10.5 million (2010 £13.6 million, 2009 £13.9 million).
The fair value of the Group’s bonds have been calculated on the basis of quoted market rates.
Further details of the Group’s borrowing arrangements are set out in the Financial and Treasury Review on pages 38 to 43.
Loan notes
The Group has issued loan notes which attract interest at rates of approximately LIBID to LIBID minus 1.0%. The loan notes are 
repayable at the option of the loan note holders with a six month notice period and are treated as current liabilities.
32 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group is exposed to credit, interest rate and currency risks arising in the normal course of business. Derivative financial 
instruments are used to manage exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates but are not 
employed for speculative purposes. 
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital, defined as equity shareholders’ funds and net borrowings, to ensure that entities in the Group are 
able to continue as going concerns for the foreseeable future.
Debt management
The Group borrows on an unsecured basis and arranges its debt to ensure an appropriate maturity profile. The Group’s principal 
sources of funding are the long-term sterling bond market and committed bank facilities. The Group is mindful of its credit rating, 
currently BB and ensures it has sufficient committed bank facilities in order to meet short-term business requirements, after taking 
into account the Group’s holding of cash and cash equivalents together with any distribution restrictions which exist. The Group 
aims to maximise the term and flexibility of indebtedness and retain headroom in the form of undrawn committed bank facilities of 
approximately £100.0 million. Additionally, the Group arranges its currency borrowings in order that they are in proportion to the 
ratio of earnings in that particular currency to total Group earnings.
The Directors consider that the Group’s bond issuances together with its bank facilities will be sufficient to cover the likely medium-
term cash requirements of the Group. 
Associates, joint ventures and other investments in general arrange and maintain their own financing and funding requirements. In 
all cases such financing is non-recourse to the Company. DAILY MAIL AND GENERAL TRUST PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2011 136

The Group’s interim internal target of Net Debt to EBITDA cover is 2.0 to 2.5 times whilst the limit imposed by its bank covenants is no 
greater than four times. The actual ratio for the year was 1.99 times (2010 2.31 times, 2009 2.99 times). On a bank covenant basis the 
ratio uses average exchange rate in the calculation of net debt. The resultant Net Debt to EBITDA ratio is 1.96 times.
Cash and liquidity risk management
The Group monitors cash balances and ensures that sufficient resources are available to meet entities operational requirements. 
Short-term money market deposits are used to manage liquidity whilst maximising the rate of return on cash resources, giving due 
consideration to credit risk. 
Market risk management
The Group’s primary market risks are interest rate fluctuations and exchange rate movements. 
Interest rate risk management
The limit imposed by the Group’s bank covenants is at least three times EBITDA to net interest. The actual ratio for the year was 6.36 
times (2010 4.91 times, 2009 4.45 times).
The Group’s interest rate exposure management policy is aimed at reducing the exposure of the consolidated businesses to 
changes in interest rates. Group policy is to have 70% to 80% of interest exposures fixed with the balance floating. This is achieved 
by issuing fixed rate sterling bond debt and entering into derivative contracts that economically swap fixed rate interest into 
floating rate. Derivatives are used to hedge or reduce the risks of interest rate and exchange rate movements and are not entered 
into unless such risks exist. The derivatives in place to meet Group policy are as follows:
(i) Fixed to floating interest rate swaps hedging a portion of the Group’s bonds; Changes in the fair value of the swaps are 
recognised in the income statement and at the same time the carrying value of the hedged bonds is adjusted for movements 
in the hedged risk to the extent effective and those adjustments are also recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. 
These interest rate swaps amount to £75.0 million (2010 £75.0 million, 2009 £75.0 million) with the Group paying floating rates of 
between 1.24% and 1.61% (2010 1.24% and 3.60%, 2009 1.99% and 6.03%).
(ii) Cross currency fixed to fixed interest rate swaps. These amounted to £192.3 million / US$355.0 million (2010 £227.6 million / 
US$435.0 million 2009 £227.6 million / US$ 435.0 million) resulting in the Group paying fixed US dollar interest at rates of between 
4.40% and 6.07% (2010 4.40% and 6.07%, 2009 4.40% and 6.07%), £8.5 million / AUS$20.0 million (2010 £8.5 million / AUS$20.0 
million, 2009 £18.8 million / AUS$45.0 million) with the Group paying fixed Australian dollar interest at 6.22% (2010 6.15% and 
6.22%, 2009 6.15% and 6.22%).
(iii) The Group also had a number of outstanding interest rate caps. These amounted to US$100.0 million notional (2010 US$100.0 
million, 2009 US$100.0 million) at a rate of 6.00% (2010 6.00%, 2009 6.00%).
The fair values of interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and forward foreign exchange contracts represent the replacement costs 
calculated using market rates of interest and exchange at 2nd October, 2011. The fair value of long-term borrowings has been 
calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at market rates.
Foreign exchange rate risk management
Translation exposures arise on the earnings and net assets of business operations in entities with functional currencies other than 
that of the parent company. The net asset exposures are economically hedged, to a significant extent, by a policy of denominating 
borrowings in currencies where significant translation exposures exist, most notably US dollars.
The Group also designates currency swaps and forward contracts as net investment hedges, hedging the Group’s  
overseas investments.
Credit risk management
The Group’s principal credit risk relates to its trade and other receivables and non-performance by counterparties to financial 
instrument contracts.
Trade and other receivables
The Group’s customer base is diversified geographically and by division with customers generally of a good financial standing. 
Before accepting any new customers, the Group assesses the potential customers’ credit quality and sets credit limits by customer. 
The average credit period is 42 days (2010 44 days, 2009 48 days). The Group considers the credit risk of trade receivables to be low, 
although the Group remains vigilant in the current economic climate. The Group reserves the right to charge interest on overdue 
receivables, although the Group does not hold collateral over any trade receivable balances. The Group makes an allowance for 
bad and doubtful debts specific to individual debts. This provision is reviewed regularly in conjunction with a detailed analysis of 
historic payment profiles and past default experience.
The Group’s receivables are stated net of allowances for doubtful debts and allowances for impairment are made  
where appropriate.
Institutional counterparty risk
The Group seeks to limit interest rate and foreign exchange risks, described above, by the use of financial instruments. As a result, 
credit risk arises from the potential non-performance by the counterparties to those financial instruments, which are unsecured.  
The amount of this credit risk is normally restricted to the amounts of any hedge gain and not the principal amount being hedged. 
The Group also has a credit exposure to counterparties for the full principal amount of cash and cash equivalents. Group policy  
is to have no more than £20.0 million deposited (or at risk) with any AA counterparty, £10.0 million for A rated counterparties.  137

Credit risk is controlled by monitoring the credit quality of these counterparties, principally licensed commercial banks and 
investment banks with strong long-term credit ratings, and of the amounts outstanding with each of them. The Group has no 
significant concentration of risk with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The credit risk on short-term deposits and derivative financial instruments is considered low since the counterparties are banks with 
high credit ratings. Group policy is to have no more than £20.0 million deposited (or at risk) with any AA counterparty, £10.0 million 
for A rated counterparties. The Group has no significant concentration of risk with exposure spread over a large number of 
counterparties and customers.

Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value at the date the derivatives are entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured to fair value at each reporting date. The fair value is determined by using market data and the use of established 
estimation techniques such as discounted cash flow and option valuation models. The Group designates certain derivatives as:
(i) Hedges of the change of fair value of recognised assets and liabilities (‘fair value hedges’); or
(ii) Hedges of highly probable forecast transactions (‘cash flow hedges’); or
(iii) Hedges of net investment in foreign operations (‘net investment hedges’)
To qualify for hedge accounting, each individual hedging relationship must be expected to be effective, be designated and 
documented at its inception and throughout the life of the hedge relationship.
Fair value hedges
The Group’s policy is to use interest rate swaps to convert a proportion of its fixed rate debt to floating rates in order to hedge the 
interest rate risk with changes in fair value of the hedging instrument recognised in the income statement for the period together 
with the changes in the fair value of the hedged item due to the hedged risk, to the extent the hedge is effective. When the 
hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, hedge accounting  
is discontinued.

Cash flow hedges
The Group’s policy is to use certain derivative financial instruments in order to hedge the foreign exchange risk arising from  
certain firm commitments or forecast highly probable transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant 
Group entity.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are 
recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement. 
If a hedged firm commitment or forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, then, at the time 
that the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains and losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in 
equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects the Consolidated Income Statement.  DAILY MAIL AND GENERAL TRUST PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2011 138

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, revoked, or no longer 
qualifies for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained 
in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or 
loss previously recognised in equity is included in the Consolidated Income Statement for the period.
All cash flow hedges were effective throughout the year ended 2nd October, 2011. All amounts deferred in equity at the year end 
are expected to impact the Consolidated Income Statement in the next 18 months when the related cash flows are expected  
to occur.
Net investment hedges
The Group seeks to manage the foreign currency exposure arising on retranslation of the reporting entity’s share of net assets of 
foreign operations at each reporting date by designating certain derivative financial instruments and foreign currency borrowings 
as net investment hedging instruments.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are recognised directly in equity in the 
translation reserve. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments are recognised in equity to 
the extent that the hedging relationship is effective. Any ineffectiveness is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income 
Statement for the period. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for 
hedge accounting. Gains and losses accumulated in the translation reserve are included in the Consolidated Income Statement 
on disposal of the foreign operation.
All net investment hedges were effective throughout the year ended 2nd October, 2011.
Derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting
Derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting represent forward contracts which provide a gain or loss equivalent to income tax 
payable or receivable on foreign exchange gains or losses incurred when intra Group balances are translated to the closing rate at 
the year end. These contracts (Tax Equalisation Swaps) are marked to market with the movement in fair value taken to income. Tax 
Equalisation Swaps are not capable of being designated as hedging instruments under IAS 39.

In managing the Group’s interest rate and currency risks, the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations. However, 
changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates may have an impact on the Group’s results.
At 2nd October, 2011, it is estimated that an increase of 1.0% in interest rates would have increased the Group’s finance costs by  
£1.1 million (2010 £1.0 million, 2009 £3.7 million). There would have been no effect on amounts recognised directly in equity. This 
sensitivity has been calculated by applying the interest rate change to the Group’s variable rate borrowings, net of any interest rate 
swaps, at the year end date.
At 2nd October, 2011, it is estimated that a decrease of 1.0% in interest rates would have decreased the Group’s finance costs by 
£1.3 million (2010 £1.0 million, 2009 £4.0 million). There would have been no effect on amounts recognised directly in equity. This 
sensitivity has been calculated by applying the interest rate change to the Group’s variable rate borrowings, net of any interest rate 
swaps, as at the year end date.
At 2nd October, 2011, it is estimated that a 10.0% strengthening of sterling against the US dollar would have reduced the net loss 
taken to equity by £55.6 million (2010 £51.1 million, 2009 £51.4 million) and increased the net loss taken to income by £nil (2010 £nil, 
2009 £nil). A 10.0% weakening of sterling against the US dollar would have increased the net loss taken to equity by £64.0 million 
(2010 £62.4 million, 2009 £63.8 million) and decreased the net loss taken to income by £nil (2010 £nil, 2009 £nil). This sensitivity has 
been calculated by applying the foreign exchange change to the Group’s financial instruments which are affected by changes in 
foreign exchange rates.
At 2nd October, 2011, it is estimated that an increase of 1.0% in the rate used to discount the expected gross value of payments 
would lead to a decrease in the fair value of acquisition put option commitments of £0.2 million (2010 £nil, 2009 £nil).
At 2nd October, 2011, it is estimated that a decrease of 1.0% in the rate used to discount the expected gross value of payments 
would lead to an increase in the fair value of acquisition put option commitments of £0.2 million (2010 £nil, 2009 £nil). DAILY MAIL AND GENERAL TRUST PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2011 140

Valuation techniques and assumptions applied for the purpose of measuring fair value
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, 
grouped into levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:
Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted process (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets  
or liabilities;
Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable 
for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and 
Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not 
based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

33 RETIREMENT BENEFITS
The Group operates a number of pension schemes covering most major Group companies under which contributions are paid by 
the employer and employees.
The schemes include funded defined benefit pension arrangements, providing service-related benefits in addition to a number of 
defined contribution pension arrangements. The defined benefit schemes in the UK and some defined contribution plans are 
administered by trustees or trustee companies and are closed to new employees.
The Group has been progressively introducing a number of PensionSaver group personal pension plans to provide a consistent 
pensions saving vehicle across all Group divisions. These plans have replaced the trust-based defined contribution arrangements 
which are now in the final stages of being wound up.
The assets of all the pension schemes and plans are held independently from the Group’s finances.
The total net pension costs of the Group for the year ended 2nd October, 2011 were £16.5 million (2010 £27.7 million).
On 16th June, 2011 an amendment to the International Accounting Standard 19 – Employee Benefits (IAS19) was issued which will be 
effective from 1st January, 2013. The principal effect on these financial statements if the amended IAS19 had been applied to the 
year ended 2nd October, 2011 would have been an increase to Finance Costs as reported in the Consolidated Income Statement 
of £25.1 million (2010 £22.5 million) with a corresponding decrease in the actuarial loss reported within Cumulative actuarial (loss)/
gain in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (SOCI).
Defined Benefit Schemes
With effect from 1st April, 2011 the benefit design of the Harmsworth Pension Scheme changed significantly to align with the 
Company’s objective of controlling risk and cost going forward. On the same date the Scheme also ceased to be contracted-out 
of the State Second Pension. The Scheme continues to operate on a defined benefit basis but total benefits are no longer linked to 
final salary. These changes do not affect benefit entitlements accrued by members prior to 1st April, 2011. Benefits accrued up to 
31st March, 2011 are protected on a final salary basis, but they have been de-linked from pensionable salary. This part of a 
member’s benefit will instead be increased in line with the retail price index (RPI), capped at 5%.
From 1st April, 2011 benefits are accrued on a cash basis rather than a pension basis with members building up a retirement 
account (a cash balance which is used to buy an annuity from an insurance company at retirement). The accumulated retirement 
account is calculated on a Career Average Revalued Earnings (CARE) basis using pensionable pay history. 
The Company communicated these changes through a formal employee consultation process that ended in February 2011.

The reduction in accrued liabilities following the statutory change to indexation of post-1988 GMP (Guaranteed Minimum Pension) 
increases is £19.2 million. These statutory increases previously related to RPI will in future be increased in line with the consumer 
prices index (CPI).
The Scheme was closed to new employees with effect from 1st October, 2009 and will fully close to new entrants on 31st March, 
2012. Full actuarial valuations of the defined benefit schemes are carried out triennially by the actuary. The latest valuation as at 
31st March, 2010, was signed on 30th June, 2011 along with a new schedule of contributions. In view of the closure of the Scheme to 
new entrants, it was agreed to use a control period, over which the future contribution rate is assessed, equal to the average 
working lifetime of the active membership, known as the attained age method. The valuation as at 31 March, 2010 and the funding 
basis arising from it makes allowance for the scheme changes described above. 
The rates of normal cash contributions paid by the Company to the principal scheme under the two schedules of contributions in 
force during the year were 18.0% of members’ scheme salaries (2010 18.0 %) for the six-month period to 31st March, 2011 (with 
employees contributing either 5.0% or 7.5% depending on which section of the scheme they are in), followed by six months’ from 1st 
April, 2011 of the equivalent of 10.0% of members’ basic salary for the ‘Standard’ section (with members contributing 4%) and 15.0% 
of members’ basic salary for the ‘Plus’ section (with members contributing 6.0%). As a part of funding agreements with the trustees 
of the main schemes the Company has agreed Recovery Plans involving a series of annual funding payments amounting to £265.9 
million over a period to end on 5th October, 2023. The first of these payments amounting to £36.7 million was made post year end 
on 5th October, 2011. The normal and deficit funding payments described above are subject to review following subsequent 
actuarial valuations. 
The funding strategy agreed with the trustee of the principal schemes in connection with the 2007 valuation made allowance for 
assumed future investment returns on the Scheme’s assets of 3.3% p.a. above price inflation, compared with the real return of some 
2.6% p.a. implicit within the calculation of the Technical Provisions (i.e. the value of the Scheme’s benefit liabilities). The Company 
agreed with the Trustees that this margin would be covered by a contingent asset and the Company put in place letters of credit of 
an amount sufficient to cover any potential shortfall in this additional investment return arising prior to the 2010 triennial valuation. As 
at 2nd October, 2011, the letters of credit (which are due to expire on 31 March, 2012) had a value of £53.6 million (2010 £54.5 million).
At 2nd October, 2011, the defined benefit obligation to the Group relating to the DMGT AVC Plan (the Plan), as measured for the 
purposes of this disclosure under the requirements of IAS19, was £60.0 million (2010 £61.8 million). The assets of the Plan were £47.3 
million (2010 £52.1 million), producing a deficit of £12.7 million (2010 £9.7 million deficit). The Plan is closed to further member 
contributions.
The last triennial valuation of the Plan showed that the combined accumulated assets as at 31st March, 2008 represented 100.0% of 
the Plan’s Technical Provisions in respect of past service benefits. As at 31st March, 2010 the funding position of the Plan measured 
on a Technical Provisions basis stood at 92.0%. Recent quarterly updates provided to the Trustees indicate that the funding position 
has since deteriorated in common with most other defined benefit plans. The Group has not been required to make contribution 
payments in respect of the Plan. The next actuarial valuation of the Plan is due to take place as at 31st March, 2011 with the results 
not expected until 2012.
Members of the defined benefit schemes are able to make additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) into unit-linked funds held 
within each scheme. No benefit obligation arises to the Group from these AVCs and the related unit-linked AVC assets have been 
excluded from the scheme assets reported below.
The figures in this note are based on calculations using membership data as at 30th September, 2011 along with asset valuations 
and cash flow information from the schemes for the year to 2nd October, 2011.

Deficit reported in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position (336.2) (271.4) (430.4)
The International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee, in its document IFRIC 14, has interpreted the extent to which a 
company can recognise a pension surplus on its Statement of Financial Position. Having taken account of the rules of the Schemes, 
the fact that the Schemes remain open to new accrual, and the current and anticipated levels of service cost and cash 
contributions, the Company considers that recognition of surpluses in the Schemes on its Statement of Financial Position is in 
accordance with the interpretations of IFRIC 14. In 2011, 2010 and 2009 all Schemes were in deficit.  147

The assumption for the expected overall rate of return on assets is a weighted average of the expected returns for each asset class 
based on the proportion of assets held in each class at the beginning of the year. The expected return on bonds has been selected 
having regard to gross redemption yields at the start of the year. The expected returns on equities and property are based on a 
combination of estimated risk premiums over Government bond yields, the gross redemption yields on bonds, and consensus 
economic forecasts for future returns.
The actual return on Plan assets was £29.7 million (2010 return of £188.6 million, 2009 loss of £51.7 million) representing the expected 
return plus the associated actuarial gain or loss during the year.  
The main financial assumptions are shown as follows:

Discount rate for scheme liabilities 5.20  5.00  5.40 
Expected overall rate of return on assets 6.70  6.60  7.00 
The discount rate for Scheme liabilities reflects yields at the period end date on high quality corporate bonds. The assumption  
for salary growth has been adjusted to take account of the limit on the extent to which expected future pay increases will count 
towards pension accrued and being earned in the Schemes. All assumptions were selected after taking actuarial advice. 
Mortality assumptions take account of Scheme experience, and also allow for further improvements in life expectancy based  
on ‘medium cohort’ projections but with a minimum rate of reduction in mortality rates in future of 1.0% per annum. Allowance  
is made for the extent to which employees have chosen to commute part of their pension for cash at retirement and for the 
proportion of members with dependants at retirement eligible for a pension.

UK defined contribution plans
The Group has introduced a number of PensionSaver group personal pension plans that have replaced the trust-based defined 
contribution pension plans previously offered to employees. These plans create a consistent pensions savings vehicle across all 
Group divisions.
The aggregate value of the Group personal pension plans and the remaining trust-based defined contribution pension plans was 
£39.8 million (2010 £39.1 million, 2009 £29.6 million) at the year end. The pension cost attributable to these plans during the year 
amounted to £3.4 million (2010 £2.6 million, 2009 £1.1 million).
Overseas pension plans
Overseas subsidiaries of certain Group divisions operate defined contribution retirement benefit plans, primarily in North America 
and Australia. The pension cost attributable to these plans during the year amounts to £2.7 million (2010 £2.2 million, 2009  
£1.4 million).

35 DEFERRED TAXATION continued
The Group has reanalysed the deferred tax balances above from that presented in the prior period to allow users of the Report and 
Accounts to obtain a better understanding of the Group’s deferred tax balances.
The deferred tax assets disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position in respect of tax losses and tax credits are 
analysed as follows:
At  
2nd October, 
2011
£m
At  
3rd October,

At

UK 19.4 31.1 18.3 
North America 62.4 55.1 59.1 
Australia 6.8 3.7 1.9 
88.6 89.9 79.3 
These losses have been recognised on the basis that the Directors are of the opinion based on recent and forecast trading, that 
sufficient suitable taxable profits will be generated in the relevant territories in future accounting periods, such that it is considered 
probable that these assets will be recovered. Of these assets, £45.0 million will expire between 2018 and 2027. The remaining assets 
have no expiry date.
Included in the credit to income of £25.2 million (2010 £31.2 million, 2009 £68.7 million) is £nil (2010 £0.5 million, 2009 £15.4 million) 
relating to discontinued operations.
Included in Other deferred tax are deferred tax assets of £5.3 million (2010 £3.6 million, 2009 £4.9 million) in respect of financial 
instruments and £3.2 million (2010 £3.4 million, 2009 £4.9 million) in respect of capital losses and deferred tax liabilities of £3.2 million 
(2010 £6.6 million, 2009 £5.6 million) in respect of revaluations and rolled over gains. The £1.7 million credit to equity (2010 £nil, 2009 
£nil) relates entirely to financial instruments.
There is an unrecognised deferred tax asset of £72.9 million (2010 £89.2 million, 2009 £68.0 million) which relates to revenue losses 
where there is insufficient certainty that these losses will be utilised in the foreseeable future. Of these assets £19.6 million will expire 
between 2018 and 2030. The remaining assets have no expiry date. There is an additional unprovided deferred tax asset relating to 
capital losses carried forward of £63.1 million (2010 £42.2 million, 2009 £23.6 million). 
No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of £79.8 million (2010 £68.2 million, 2009 £52.9 million) relating to the 
unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences 
and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The temporary differences at 2nd October, 2011 represent only 
the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries where remittance to the UK of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, 
principally as a result of a dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which these subsidiaries operate.
The UK Government has announced a future decrease in the UK corporation tax rate from 26.0% to 23.0% over the next three years. 
The impact of these proposed rate changes would be to reduce the UK deferred tax assets included within non-current assets from 
£128.6 million to £118.3 million if they were all to reverse at 23.0%.

and to secure supply. At the year end, the commitment to purchase ink over this period was £91.2 million (2010 £109.6 million,  
2009 £130.5 million).
The Group has entered into agreements with certain printers for periods up to 2022 at competitive prices and to secure supply. At the 
year end, the commitment to purchase printing capacity over this period was £100.5 million (2010 £130.8 million, 2009 £141.9 million).
Contingent liabilities
As set out in Note 33 the Group has issued stand by letters of credit in favour of the Trustees of the Group’s defined benefit pension 
fund amounting to £53.6 million (2010 £54.5 million, 2009 £37.8 million) together with other guarantees of £9.3 million (2010 £8.1 
million, 2009 £5.3 million).
The Group is exposed to libel claims in the ordinary course of business and vigorously defends against claims received. The Group 
makes provision for the estimated costs to defend such claims when incurred and provides for any settlement costs when such an 
outcome is judged probable.
Four writs claiming damages for libel were issued in Malaysia against the Company and three of its employees in respect of an 
article published in one of the Company’s magazines, International Commercial Litigation, in November, 1995. The writs were 
served on the Company on 22nd October, 1996. Two of these writs have been discontinued. The total outstanding amount claimed 
on the two remaining writs is Malaysian Ringgits 82.0 million (£16.5 million) (2010 Malaysian Ringgits 82.0 million £14.8 million).  
No provision has been made for these claims in these financial statements as the Directors do not believe the Company has any 
material liability in respect of these writs. 
40 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The Group offers a number of share-based remuneration Schemes to Directors and certain employees. The principal Schemes 
comprise share options under the DMGT, Euromoney and within DMG Information, Risk Management Solutions (RMS), Genscape 
and Trepp Executive Share Option Schemes (ESOS), the Euromoney Capital Appreciation Plan and the Company’s LTIP. Share 
options are exercisable after three years, subject in some cases to the satisfaction of performance conditions, and up to 10 years 
from the date of grant at a price equivalent to the market value of the respective shares at the date of grant at a price equivalent 
to the market value of the respective shares at the date of grant. Details of the performance conditions relating to the DMGT 
Schemes are explained in the Remuneration Report on pages 66 and 69.
For equity-settled share-based payment transactions, IFRS 2 applies to grants of shares, share options or other equity instruments 
made after 7th November, 2002 that had not vested by 1st January, 2005. The charge to the Consolidated Income Statement 
arising from the most significant Schemes is as follows:

The fair value of share options for each of these Schemes was determined using a Black-Scholes model. Full details of inputs to the 
models, particular to each Scheme, are set out overleaf. With respect to all Schemes, the share price volatility has been estimated, 
based upon relevant historic data in respect of the DMGT ‘A’ Ordinary Share prices. Expedited volatility has been estimated, based 
upon relevant historic data in respect of the DMGT ‘A’ Ordinary share price. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, 
based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability. The Group did not reprice any of its outstanding 
options during the year.

Nil-Cost Options under the DMGT Executive Bonus Scheme
Since December 2009, half of the Executive Bonus paid to the Executive Directors has been deferred into shares in the form of 
nil-cost options which cannot be exercised for at least three years. These options are to the value of the equity portion of the bonus 
and are fully expensed in the year in which they are earned. A portion of the bonus earned by Directors under the Scheme in the 
current year will also be deferred into shares in the form of nil-cost options. The cash portion of the bonus is included in the 
remuneration table on page 65 of the Remuneration Report. The total bonus is calculated in accordance with the Scheme rules,  
as set out on page 65 of the Remuneration Report.

RMS options plan
RMS options were granted at market value. The options become exercisable after a four year vesting period and lapse after five 
years and five years from grant date under the 2001 and 2005 option plan respectively. Previously, the stock issued under the plan 
was subject to a nine month holding period, which has been subsequently removed during 2007. The stock issued under the plan is 
subject to put or call options where DMGT has the right to settle in DMGT ‘A’ Ordinary shares or cash. The options plan classification 
changed from a cash settled plan in June 2005 to an equity settled plan following this change of settlement feature of stock issued 
under the plan. After 30th September, 2011 options under the 2001 and 2005 plan will no longer be awarded.
During fiscal year 2011 RMS introduced the Executive Incentive Plan (EIP) and the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). Under the  
EIP options and Restricted Stock Units (RSU) were awarded to Senior Management. Under the LTIP RSUs were awarded to key 
employees. The options and RSUs were granted at market value under both plans. The options vest based on the conditions of time 
and Company performance at three and five years from date of grant. The options lapse after seven years from grant date. The 
RSUs under both plans vest annually over three years.
RSU expense is determined by the fair market value of RMS stock at the date of grant. The expense is amortised using an 
accelerated method. Under this method the RSUs are equally allocated to each of the three annual vesting components and the 
related expense is amortised over 12, 24, and 36 months respectively.

Euromoney Capital Appreciation Plan 2010 (CAP 2010)
The CAP 2010 executive share option scheme was approved by shareholders on 21st January, 2010. Each CAP 2010 award 
comprises two equal elements – an option to subscribe for Ordinary Shares of 0.25p each in the Company at an exercise price of 
0.25p per Ordinary Share, and a right to receive a cash payment. The awards will vest in two equal tranches. The first tranche of 
awards will become exercisable on satisfaction of the primary performance condition, but no earlier than February 2013 and lapse 
to the extent unexercised by 30th September, 2020. The second tranche of awards becomes exercisable in the February following a 
subsequent financial year in which adjusted pre-tax profits of the Euromoney Group again equal or exceed £100.0 million 
(increased to £105.0 million following the acquisition of NDR), but no earlier than February, 2014. The second tranche only vests on 
satisfaction of the primary performance condition and an additional performance condition. The number of options received 
under the share award of the CAP 2010 is reduced by the number of options vesting with participants from the 2010 Company 
Share Option Plan (see opposite). The primary performance condition was achieved in the 2011 financial year, two years earlier 
than expected, when adjusted pre-tax profits were £101.3 million. However, the internal rules of the plan prevent the awards vesting 
more than one year early so although the primary condition has been achieved the award pool will be allocated between the 
holders of outstanding awards by reference to their contribution to the growth in profits of the Group from the 2009 base year to the 
profits achieved in the 2012 financial year and these awards are expected to become exercisable in February, 2013.
The CAP 2010 options were valued using a fair value model that adjusted the share price at the date of grant for the net present 
value of expected future dividend streams up to the date of expected exercise. The expected term of the option used in the 
models has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and 
behavioural considerations.  163

Company Share Option Plan (CSOP 2010)
In parallel with the CAP 2010, the shareholders approved the CSOP 2010 UK and Canada at the AGM on 21st January, 2010. The 
CSOP 2010 UK was approved by HM Revenue and Customs on 21st June, 2010 and granted on 28th June, 2010. The CSOP 2010 UK 
option enables each participant to purchase up to 4,972 shares in the Company at a price of £6.03 per share, the market value at 
the date of grant. The options will vest and become exercisable at the same time as the corresponding share award under the CAP 
2010 providing the CSOP option is in the money at that time and does not vest before 28th June, 2013. The CSOP 2010 Canada, 
granted on 30th March, 2010, enables each participant to purchase up to 19,960 shares in the Company at a price of £5.01 per 
share, the market value at the date of grant. No option may vest after the date falling three months after the preliminary 
announcement of the results for the financial year ended 30th September, 2019 and the option shall lapse to the extent unvested at 
the time. The CSOP has the same performance criteria as that of the CAP 2010 as set out above. The number of CSOP 2010 awards 
that vest proportionally reduce the number of shares that vest under the CAP 2010, the CSOP is effectively a delivery mechanism 
for part of the CAP 2010 award. The CSOP 2010 option exercise price of £6.03 (UK) and £5.01 (Canada) will be satisfied by a funding 
award mechanism and results in the same net gain on the CSOP options (calculated as the market price of the Company’s shares 
at the date of exercise less the exercise price multiplied by the number of options exercised) delivered in the equivalent number of 
shares to participants as if the award had been delivered using £0.0025 CAP options.

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was £nil (2010 £nil, 2009 £nil).
The options outstanding at 2nd October, 2011 had a weighted average exercise price of £5.72 (2010 £5.72, 2009 £nil) and a 
weighted average remaining contractual life of 8.38 years (2010 9.38 years, 2009 nil years).
The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options granted during the year is £nil million (2010 £3.4 million, 2009 £nil).

The number of CSOP 2010 awards that vest proportionally reduce the number of shares that vest under the CAP 2010, the CSOP  
is effectively a delivery mechanism for part of the CAP 2010 award. The CSOP 2010 options have an exercise price of £6.03
1
, which 
will be satisfied by a funding award mechanism which results in the same net gain
2
 on these options delivered in the equivalent 
number of shares to participants as if the same award had been delivered using £0.0025 CAP options. The amount of the funding 
award will depend on the Company’s share price at the date of exercise. Because of the above and the other direct links between 
the CSOP 2010 and the CAP 2010, including the identical performance criteria, IFRS 2 – Share-based Payments combines the two 
plans and treats them as one plan (vesting in two tranches). As such the long-term incentive expense recognised in the year for the 
CSOP 2010 and CAP 2010 options (including the charge in relation to the cash element) was £15.9 million (2010 £3.9 million).
1. Exercise price of Canadian CSOP is £5.01.
2. Net gain on the CSOP options is the market price of the Company’s shares at the date of exercise less the exercise price (£6.031) 
multiplied by the number of options exercised. 
*Exercise price excludes the effect of the funding award.
Cash-settled options
Euromoney has liabilities in respect of three share option schemes that are classified by IFRS 2 – Share-based Payments as cash 
settled. These consists of the cash element of the CAP 2010 scheme, options held by employees over new equity shares in Internet 
Securities Inc., a subsidiary of the Group, and, from 2011, options held by employees over equity shares in Structured Retail Products 
Limited (previously Arete Consulting Limited), a subsidiary of the Group. The total carrying value at 30th September, 2011 included in 
the Statement of Financial Position is a liability of £10.3 million (2010: £2.1 million). Of these schemes, options with an intrinsic value of 
£7,000 (2010: £36,000) had vested but are not yet exercised. 
The Euromoney Capital Appreciation Plan 2004 (CAP 2004)
The CAP 2004 executive share option scheme was approved by shareholders on 1st February, 2005. Each of the CAP awards 
comprises an option to subscribe for Ordinary Shares of 0.25p each in the Company for an exercise price of 0.25p per Ordinary 
Share. The awards become exercisable on satisfaction of certain performance conditions and lapse to the extent unexercised on 
30th September, 2014. The initial performance condition was achieved in the financial year 2007 and the option pool (a maximum 
of 7.5 million shares) was allocated between the holders of outstanding awards. One third of the awards vested immediately.  165

The primary performance target was achieved again in 2008 and, after applying the additional performance condition, 2,241,269 
options from the second tranche of options vested in February 2009. The primary performance target was also achieved in 2009 
and 1,521,498 options (including a true-up adjustment of 5,654) for the third (final) tranche of options in 2009 vested in February 
2010. The additional performance condition was applied again to profits for the 2010 financial year for those individual participants 
where the additional performance conditions for the second and final tranches had not been met and 303,321 options vested in 
February, 2011. For individual participants’ businesses where the additional performance conditions for the second and final 
tranche have not been met, the vesting is deferred until the profits are at least 75% of that achieved in 2007 but no later than by 
reference to the year ending 30th September, 2012. The Directors estimate 334,997 of options will vest in February 2012 following 
satisfaction of the additional performance test.
The CAP options were valued using a fair value model that adjusted the share price at the date of the grant for the net present 
value of expected future dividend streams up to the date of the expected exercise.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
to the Members of Daily Mail and General Trust plc
We have audited the parent Company financial statements of Daily Mail and General Trust plc for the year ended 2nd October, 
2011 which comprise the Balance Sheet, and the related Notes 1 to 18. The financial reporting framework that has been applied  
in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for 
the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the parent 
Company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express 
an opinion on the parent Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for 
Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes  
an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent Company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors;  
and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the parent Company financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the parent Company’s affairs as at 2nd October, 2011;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
•  the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006; and
•  the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the parent Company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our 
opinion:
•  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
•  the parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Daily Mail and General Trust plc for the year ended  
2nd October, 2011.

NOTES TO THE COMPANY BALANCE SHEET – UK GAAP
1 BASIS OF PREPARATION 
The separate financial 
statements of the Company 
are prepared under the 
historical cost convention, 
modified to include the 
revaluation to fair value of 
certain financial instruments as 
described below, in 
accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006 and UK 
Generally Accepted 
Accounting Principles (UK 
GAAP). The following 
paragraphs describe the main 
accounting policies under UK 
GAAP, which have been 
applied consistently in both 
the current and prior year.
Profit for the financial year
As permitted by section 480 of 
the Companies Act 2006, a 
separate profit and loss 
account for the Company has 
not been included in these 
accounts. The Company’s loss 
after tax for the year, 
calculated on a UK GAAP 
basis, was £108.8 million (2010 
profit £142.0 million).
Impact of amendments to 
accounting standards
In the current year certain 
minor amendments to UK 
financial reporting standards 
were issued by the UK 
Accounting Standards Board. 
The adoption of these 
amendments has not had any 
impact on the Company’s 
accounting policies.
2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING 
POLICIES
Intangible fixed assets
Intangible assets principally 
comprise purchased 
trademarks and are 
capitalised and amortised 
through the profit and loss 
account over the lower of their 
useful economic lives and a 
period of 20 years.
The Company tests intangible 
assets at the end of the first 
financial year after acquisition 
and where there is any 
indication of impairment, or 
more frequently if there are 
indicators that the intangible 
assets might be impaired. 
When testing for impairment, 
the recoverable amounts for 
all the Company’s income 
generating units (IGUs) are 
measured at their value in use 
by discounting future 
expected cash flows. These 
calculations use cash flow 
projections based on 
management approved 
budgets and projections which 
reflect management’s current 
experience and future 
expectations of the markets in 
which the IGU operates.
Tangible fixed assets
Depreciation is provided on all 
tangible fixed assets at rates 
calculated to write off the 
cost, less estimated residual 
value, of each asset on a 
straight line basis over its 
expected useful life. Some of 
the Company’s tangible fixed 
assets are artworks with a 
residual value at least equal to 
cost and therefore no 
depreciation has been 
applied in either the current or 
prior period on the basis that 
any change would not  
be material.
Foreign exchange
Transactions in currencies 
other than the entity’s 
reporting currency are 
recorded at the exchange rate 
prevailing on the date of the 
transaction. At each balance 
sheet date, monetary items 
denominated in foreign 
currencies are retranslated at 
the rates prevailing on the 
balance sheet date. Non-
monetary items carried at fair 
value that are denominated in 
foreign currencies are 
retranslated at the rate 
prevailing on the date when 
fair value was determined. 
Non-monetary items that are 
measured in terms of historical 
cost in a foreign currency are 
not retranslated. Exchange 
differences arising on the 
settlement of monetary items, 
and on the retranslation of 
monetary items, are included 
in the income statement for 
the period.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are 
stated at cost, less any 
provision for impairment, 
where appropriate.
Other investments are 
classified as either held for 
trading or available-for-sale 
and are measured at either 
fair value or at cost less 
provision for impairment where 
fair value cannot be reliably 
determined.
Where investments are 
classified as held for trading, 
gains and losses arising from 
changes in fair value are 
included in net profit or loss for 
the period. For available-for-
sale investments, gains and 
losses arising from changes in 
fair value are recognised 
directly in equity, until the 
investment is disposed of or is 
determined to be impaired, at 
which time the cumulative 
gain or loss previously 
recognised in equity is 
included in the net profit or loss 
for the period. Impairment 
charges are recorded in the 
profit and loss account when 
they occur.
Investments and financial 
assets are recognised and 
de-recognised on a trade 
date where a purchase or sale 
of an investment is under a 
contract whose terms require 
delivery of the investment 
within the time frame 
established by the market 
concerned, and are measured 
at fair value, including 
transaction costs.
Taxation
Current tax, including UK 
corporation tax and foreign 
tax, is provided at amounts 
expected to be paid (or 
recovered) using the tax rates 
and laws that have been 
enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet 
date. Deferred tax is provided 
in full on timing differences 
that result in an obligation at 
the balance sheet date to pay 
more tax, or a right to pay less 
tax, at a future date, at rates 
expected to apply when they 
crystallise based on current tax 
rates and law. Timing 
differences arise from the 
inclusion of items of income 
and expenditure in taxation 
computations in periods 
different from those in which  175

NOTES TO THE COMPANY BALANCE SHEET – UK GAAP
they are included in financial 
statements. Deferred tax is not 
provided on timing differences 
arising from the revaluation of 
fixed assets where there is no 
commitment to sell the asset, 
or on unremitted earnings of 
subsidiaries and associates 
where there is no commitment 
to remit these earnings. 
Deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it 
is regarded as more likely than 
not that they will be recovered. 
Deferred tax is not discounted.
Financial instruments 
disclosures
Financial assets
– Trade debtors
Trade debtors do not carry any 
interest and are stated at their 
nominal value as reduced by 
appropriate allowances for 
estimated irrecoverable 
amounts.
– Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents 
comprise cash in hand, 
short-term deposits and other 
short-term highly liquid 
investments that are readily 
convertible to a known 
amount of cash and are 
subject to an insignificant risk 
of changes in value.
Financial liabilities and 
equity instruments
Financial liabilities and equity 
instruments issued by the 
Company are classified 
according to the substance of 
the contractual arrangements 
entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that 
evidences a residual interest in 
the assets of the Company 
after deducting all of  
its liabilities.
– Trade creditors
Trade creditors are not interest 
bearing and are stated at their 
nominal value.
–  Capital market and bank 
borrowings
Interest-bearing loans and 
overdrafts are initially 
measured at fair value (which 
is equal to net proceeds at 
inception), and are 
subsequently measured at 
amortised cost, using the 
effective interest rate method. 
A portion of the Company’s 
bonds are subject to fair value 
hedge accounting and this 
portion of the carrying value is 
adjusted for the movement in 
the hedged risk to the extent 
hedge effectiveness is 
achieved. Any difference 
between the proceeds, net of 
transaction costs and the 
settlement or redemption of 
borrowings is recognised over 
the term of the borrowing.
– Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by 
the Group are recorded at the 
proceeds received, net of 
direct issue costs.
Financial assets and liabilities 
are offset and the net amount 
reported in the balance sheet 
when there is a legally 
enforceable right to settle on a 
net basis, or realise the asset 
and liability simultaneously.
Derivative financial 
instruments and hedge 
accounting
The Company’s activities 
expose it to the financial risks 
of changes in foreign 
exchange rates and interest 
rates. The Company uses 
various derivative financial 
instruments to manage its 
exposure to these risks.
The use of financial derivatives 
is governed by the Group’s 
policies, which are set out on 
pages 38 and 43 of the 
Financial and Treasury Review 
and approved by the Board of 
Directors, which provide 
written principles on the use of 
financial derivatives consistent 
with the Company’s risk 
management strategy. The 
Company does not use 
derivative financial instruments 
for speculative purposes.
The Company does not apply 
hedge accounting except for 
fair value hedges. Gains and 
losses arising on derivatives 
that form part of net 
investment hedge or cash flow 
hedge relationships in the 
consolidated financial 
statements are recorded in  
the profit and loss account in 
the Company.
Financial instruments – 
disclosures
The Company has taken 
advantage of the exemption 
provided in FRS 29, Financial 
Instruments: Disclosures which 
states that disclosure in respect 
of financial instruments is not 
required in parent company 
financial statements where 
such disclosures are included 
in publicly available 
consolidated financial 
statements.
Cash flow statement
The Company has utilised the 
exemptions provided under 
FRS 1 (Revised) and has not 
presented a cash flow 
statement. A consolidated 
cash flow statement has been 
presented in the Group’s 
Annual Report.
Related party transactions
The Company has taken 
advantage of the exemptions 
of FRS 8 which states that 
disclosure of related party 
transactions is not required in 
the parent company financial 
statements when those 
statements are presented 
together with its consolidated 
financial statements.
Share-based payments
The Company operates the 
Group’s LTIP and other Group 
share-based payment 
schemes, details of which can 
be found in Note 40 of the 
Group’s Annual Report. DAILY MAIL AND GENERAL TRUST PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2011 176

Retirement benefits
The Company contributes to defined benefit and defined contribution pension Schemes on behalf of its employees. These are 
managed on a Group basis and so the Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the defined 
benefit Scheme in which it participates on a consistent and reasonable basis. The Scheme is operated on an aggregate basis with 
no segregation of the assets to individual participating employers and, therefore, the same contribution rate is charged to all 
participating employers; the contribution rate charged to each employer being affected by the experience of the Scheme as a 
whole. The Scheme is therefore accounted for as a defined contribution scheme by the Company. This means that the pension 
charge reported in these financial statements is the same as the cash contributions due in the period.
Details of the financial position and key valuation assumptions of these Schemes can be found in Note 33 of the Group’s  
Annual Report.

issue costs and discounts. The issue costs, premia and discounts are being amortised over the expected lives of the bonds using the 
effective interest method. The unamortised issue costs amount to £3.5 million (2010 £4.5 million), the unamortised premia £12.0 
million (2010 £13.6 million).
Details of the fair value of the Company’s bonds are set out in Note 31 of the Group’s Annual Report and Accounts. 
The bonds are subject to fair value hedging using derivatives as set out in Note 32 of the Group’s Annual Report and Accounts. 
Consequently, their carrying value is also adjusted to take into account the affects of this hedging activity.

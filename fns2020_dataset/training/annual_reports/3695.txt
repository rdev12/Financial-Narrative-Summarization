Chairman’s Statement
Results
Proﬁt on ordinary activities before taxation decreased by 45%
to £54.5m (2002 - £99.9m). Earnings per share decreased by
76% to 17.2p (2002 - 70.7p). These decreases were due to the
exceptional loss on the sale of Westwind after goodwill
previously written off to reserves in 1995 has been taken into
account.
I am delighted to be able to report another set of record
underlying results for 2003. Turnover for the year increased by
13% to £832.6m (2002 - £734.6m). Profit before tax,
integration costs, goodwill amortisation and the disposal of
Westwind rose by 17% to £135.3m (2002 - £115.8m).
Underlying earnings per share of 93.5p (2002 - 86.4p) were 8%
higher than for the comparable period last year. Your directors
have recommended a ﬁnal dividend of 19.80p (2002 - 18.00p)
per share. Together with the interim dividend of 8.36p per share
(2002 - 7.60p) which was paid in December, this represents an
increase of 10% compared to 2002. Subject to shareholders’
approval, the ﬁnal dividend will be paid on 2 July 2004 to all
shareholders on the register as at 4 June 2004.
The group generated cash from operations of £147.8m (2002 -
£135.9m). Net debt at the year end of £154.4m (2002 -
£188.8m) includes the cash cost of acquisitions completed in
2003 and represents a gearing level of 34% (2002 - 63%).
The group invested £40.4m (2002 - £31.6m) in research and
development, an increase of 28%.
Our ‘Manufacturing’ companies have been reorganised into a
single Aerospace Systems group which is expected to show
further growth in future years. Trading performance was much
stronger in the second six months of the year. Excellent results
were produced by all three business groups. Avionics has
successfully acquired and integrated nine businesses.
Corporate development
The group will continue to strengthen its leading position in
aerospace markets building on the skills and systems capability
which have been developed in recent years. A combination of
organic growth and acquisition will support this strategy which
has produced consistent growth and an increasing return for
shareholders over the past two decades.
In Cobham we have the people,
products and services to satisfy our
customers’ future requirements and the
strategy that will continue to increase 
total shareholder return

We completed a successful share placing in July.
Thirteen acquisitions were made during the year for a total
consideration of £165.4m, including £14.4m of deferred and
contingent payments. In December Westwind was sold to GSI
Lumonics Inc. for £21m.
People
In November, I became the non-executive chairman of 
Cobham plc. At the end of July, Giles Irwin retired as group
ﬁnancial director after 20 years’ service. In August, Robin Clark,
managing director of Flight Refuelling Limited, left the company
as a result of the reorganisation of the group’s structure,
mentioned above, after 22 years’ service with Flight Refuelling
Limited. My board colleagues join me in thanking them for their
long and valuable contribution to the successful development
of the group.
During the year there were two executive appointments to the
board. In July, Warren Tucker became group ﬁnancial director
and in November, Andy Stevens was appointed managing
director of the newly formed Aerospace Systems group. In
March 2004, Marcus Beresford was appointed to the board as
an independent non-executive director. I welcome each of them
and look forward to their contribution in continuing our record
of sustained proﬁtable growth.
Outlook
The breadth of Cobham group activities is such that we are now
able to manage variations in individual sectors with some
conﬁdence. Defence markets are growing in the USA and this
has directly beneﬁted the group. We have also successfully
anticipated the technologies required by military priorities.
Commercial aerospace still has some way to go before we can
be conﬁdent that a genuine recovery is in progress. However,
Cobham’s presence on the most modern commercial aircraft
and a growing aftermarket have, to some extent, mitigated the
effects of the downturn in the commercial aerospace sector.
Overall, I am conﬁdent that in Cobham we have the people,
products and services to satisfy our customers’ future
requirements and the strategy that will continue to increase
total shareholder return.
Gordon Page Chairman
18 March 2004
The proposed UK future 
strategic tanker aircraft 
Airbus A330-200 converted 
to carry Flight Refuelling’s 
centreline and wing pod 
refuelling equipment. Introduction
2003 proved to be a very successful year for Cobham.
Signiﬁcant progress was made in the implementation of our
long-term strategic plan whilst delivering excellent ﬁnancial
results. New orders worth £925m were achieved and the order
book at the end of 2003 stood at £1.2bn.
Organisation
Cobham’s business has been organised into three specific
product and service groups:
•
Aerospace Systems
•
Avionics
•
Flight Operations & Services.
Aerospace Systems, under Andy Stevens, is a new group
dedicated to the design and manufacture of fluid and air
distribution, life support, countermeasures, air refuelling and
aviation auxiliary mission equipment.
Geoff Cooper and Alex Hannam continue in their roles of group
managing director, Avionics and Flight Operations & Services
respectively.
I am conﬁdent that the executive team now in place will ensure
Cobham’s continued success in the years to come.
Strategic direction
The key tenets of Cobham strategy are:
•
to sustain earnings growth in our existing businesses and to
support further organic and acquisitive growth;
•
to strengthen our focus and retain a balanced portfolio of
companies which are leaders in their particular ﬁeld;
•
to seize opportunities as they arise with the aerospace and
defence industry consolidation; and
•
to create an environment which encourages, rewards and
motivates staff at all levels within the organisation.
The group has, throughout 2003, worked steadily towards
meeting these aims. Not least has been the achievement of
sustained earnings growth in a dynamic and challenging
business environment.

Chief Executive’s Review
The Cobham group enters 2004 with a
strong order book of £1.2bn, a streamlined
organisation, a balanced portfolio of
companies and its activities aligned with
priority military expenditure conﬁdent that
the business will continue its growth proﬁle
through 2004
Allan Cook

” COBHAM PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003 9
well placed for any increase in the world demand, although it is
difﬁcult to predict when this will occur.
Prospects
The Cobham group enters 2004 with a strong order book of
£1.2bn, a streamlined organisation, a balanced portfolio of
companies and its activities aligned with priority military
expenditure, confident that the business will continue its
growth proﬁle through 2004.
In January 2004, the Ministry of Defence announced that the
AirTanker consortium, in which the group has a 25%
shareholding, had been selected as the bidder which offers “the
best prospect of securing a value for money PFI service” for the
future strategic tanker aircraft (FSTA) – a 27 year programme to
supply air refuelling capability to the Royal Air Force. It is
expected that a contract will be awarded in 2005, allowing
substantial beneﬁts to the group companies engaged in the
supply and support of equipment and through the group’s
shareholding in AirTanker.
The underlying strength of Cobham is based on the key
positions which have been established in existing and future
work platforms and programmes. This in turn relies heavily on
market intelligence, excellent product technology and services
and the enthusiastic support of all employees. I am delighted
with the progress achieved in 2003 and remain conﬁdent of
sustained success in the future.
Allan Cook Chief Executive
18 March 2004
Components for Euroﬁghter Typhoon
supplied by Cobham have a ship set
value of some £800,000.
The successful acquisition of thirteen companies during this
period, coupled with organic growth, has ensured a strong
increase in revenue.
Work is being undertaken to ensure improvements in the
group’s operational performance as part of our continuous
improvement programme. The divestment of Westwind to 
GSI Lumonics in December 2003 has further balanced our
product and service portfolio and improved group underlying
proﬁtability.
The group continues to invest in new products, processes,
facilities and people development to create a positive,
challenging and productive working environment for its
employees.
The group’s success in 2003 gives us conﬁdence in our strategic
direction.
Markets
The aerospace and defence market is polarised between the
military and commercial areas. Cobham has experienced
growth in its military business, particularly in the USA. However,
growth in European defence business is subject to budgetary
pressure and there is a widening gap in research and
development spending between other NATO countries and 
the USA.
In the civil aviation market the volume of air trafﬁc has now
stabilised following the downturn after 11 September 2001, the
conﬂict in Iraq and the SARS virus epidemic. Airbus has, for the
ﬁrst time, outpaced Boeing in the supply of civil airliners.
Cobham remains a major supplier to both companies and is  Review of operations
Flight Refuelling Limited (FRL) and US sister company
Sargent Fletcher Inc (SFI) are complementary leaders in
the design and manufacture of air refuelling (AR) and
auxiliary mission equipment. Both companies have together
met an accelerated United States Marine Corps requirement
for C-130J AR capability by offering upgraded standard
equipment. FRL has also continued the development of a
refuelling pod to meet United States Air Force Special
Operations Command (AFSOC) requirements. Earlier
commitments have been met with the delivery of refuelling
pods for both German and Royal Canadian Air Force A310
tankers and to Sukhoi for integration with an AR capable 
SU-30 ﬁghter.
FRL being the AR equipment supplier to the AirTanker
consortium, which is now the UK MoD’s potential service
provider for the FSTA contract, expects to retain its position
as the premier AR provider for the foreseeable future.
SFI secured record sales and orders throughout the year.
These orders amounted to US$103m and were largely
influenced by refuelling pod orders for the C-130J and
external fuel tank orders for the F-22 and Japanese Air Self
Defence Force F-2 programmes.
FRL and SFI are also heavily engaged in the production and
supply of weapon carriage and release systems. At FRL,
bomb release unit orders were received from the Korean 
Air Force and for technology demonstration equipment in
support of the Future Offensive Air Systems (FOAS)
programme. Deliveries of Brimstone missile launchers to 
the Royal Air Force and multi-missile launchers for 
Sweden’s JAS 39 Gripen defence ﬁghters also commenced 
in 2003.
SFI further reinforced its position as a world leader in this
ﬁeld of specialised equipment by securing a contract to
supply pneumatic bomb ejection racks for the Lockheed
Martin F-16 and Boeing Small Diameter Bomb 
programmes.
FR-HiTEMP achieved satisfactory trading ﬁgures despite the
continued recession in civil aerospace. Deliveries of fuel
system equipment to Airbus have, however, been robust and
demand for spares and repairs for both civil and military
sources remain strong. The supply of replacement fuel
pumps for Boeing 747 aircraft is now underway to three
major airlines; more operators are expected to place orders
shortly.
Cobham Fluid Systems, based at Blandford, responded to a
UK MoD urgent operational requirement by supplying
tactical fuel handling equipment to support the 2003
operation in Iraq.

aerial vehicles (UAV). The company’s technical capabilities
were increased by the completion of a compact range test
facility for radar cross section and antenna measurements
and a unique high power, high temperature, high altitude
test facility.
In the search and rescue sector, Artex and ACR performed
exceptionally well in their respective airborne and maritime
markets. The acquisition of Nauticast strengthened ACR’s
position for the pending US Coast Guard automatic
identiﬁcation system shipboard mandate. Seimac added a
maritime locator beacon product line via the acquisition of
Novatech,whilst development of its spread spectrum radio
and completion of a military personal locator beacon is
expected to enhance its performance in 2004. The
acquisition of Sea Tel expanded Chelton’s maritime market
presence into the high performance, stabilised antenna and
data transmission arenas.

Review of operations
In the UK FR Aviation’s £24m Falcon 20 ﬂeet upgrade
programme contracted by the UK MoD is progressing well
with two aircraft fully converted and in operational service
as planned. The programme calls for a further six aircraft to
be converted in 2004 with the remaining six in 2005.
A company Falcon 20 aircraft is engaged in the operational
evaluation of the Euroﬁghter Typhoon Defensive Aids Sub
System (DASS) and will continue to support Typhoon’s entry
into service and ongoing development of DASS.
FR Aviation Services (FRAS), working with BAE SYSTEMS
under a partnering agreement, extended the scope and
duration of its existing Nimrod MR2 aircraft maintenance
contract at RAF Kinloss. FRAS has been nominated as the
preferred maintenance provider for the Nimrod MRA4 when
it enters service.
Tank Devils, the company’s specialist fuel tank repair
services business, has continued to expand successfully 
in the UK and mainland Europe and now actively supports
42 aircraft operators.
Flight Precision Limited (FPL) signed a ﬁve-year contract
with the Manchester International Airports group, for
Manchester International and its associated airports, to
ensure all the equipment needed to guide aircraft to and
from runways is regularly checked and calibrated. The
contract came as FPL celebrated its tenth anniversary,
during which time it has become the European leader in the
outsourced calibration of civil and military airports. In
support of the UK MoD, FPL sent an aircraft to Basra, Iraq,
on three separate occasions during 2003 to install new
navigation aids prior to the re-opening of the airport.
The group’s Australian subsidiaries produced a strong 
trading performance with some notable achievements.
National Air Support (NAS), which focuses on government
and special mission aviation opportunities in Australia and
the Asia Paciﬁc region, completed the installation of an
Inmarsat system into its ﬂeet of ﬁve Dash 8 aircraft. In so
doing it became the world’s ﬁrst civilian aerial surveillance
operator to provide such a system, transmitting real time
video, still images, radar, voice and data from patrolling
Coastwatch aircraft via satellite direct to the Customs’
national surveillance centre. It was one of the company’s
Coastwatch aircraft, operating a routine surveillance
exercise, which played a pivotal role in the recent successful
rescue of a British tourist on a remote Australian beach. NAS
also renewed a three-year contract with the developer of
the laser aerial depth sounder system to operate a 
Dash 8 aircraft in Australia and on worldwide deployments.
During the year National Jet Systems (NJS), which focuses
on freight and passenger services, entered into a new  Flight Operations & Services strong order book
extends to 2012, revenue increased by 2.8%
and underlying operating proﬁt by 13.5%.
The group operates a ﬂeet of 135 ﬁxed 
and rotary wing aircraft in the UK, Europe,
Asia Paciﬁc and Australia.
New long-term contracts have been won 
including the supply and support of aerial
targets for the UK MoD and, with Australian 
Air Express, Australia’s largest overnight 
freight service, extending existing 
air freight operations.

five-year support contract with Minara Resources,
Australia’s largest nickel mine, and secured a two-year
contract with the giant Newcrest Telfer Gold Mine. Both
mines are located in Western Australia. Building on its
relationship with Australian Air Express in cargo operations,
NJS won a seven-year extension to its existing BAe 146
freighter contract. In addition, NJS won a new A$100m
contract to operate ﬁve Boeing 727 aircraft, acquired as part
of TransAustralian Air, consolidating its position as the
market leader in the provision of overnight freight services.
The new service will see more than 59 million kilograms of
freight delivered annually to Australia’s major cities.
FR Aviation’s joint venture with Bristow Helicopters, FBS, has
successfully completed its sixth year of a fifteen-year
support contract to the tri-service UK Defence Helicopter
Flying School at RAF Shawbury, RAF Valley, and the School 
of Army Aviation at Middle Wallop, adding a further two 
Bell 412 Grifﬁn helicopters in the year. It continues to
provide exceptional levels of aircraft availability with its ﬂeet
of 38 AS 350 Squirrel and eleven Bell 412 Grifﬁn aircraft,
training more than 200 pilots a year.
2003 also saw further expansion following the successful
introduction to service of three Bell 212 helicopters
providing support to the British Army in Belize and four Bell
412 helicopters for the British forces in Cyprus. These
contracts run for three and ﬁve years respectively.
AVdef, the French-based joint venture, had another
successful year growing its order book with the addition of
two three-year contracts with the French Navy and
Direction Générale de l’Aviation Civile. The company will
begin a new high speed target service in 2004 using its
recently acquired A4 Skyhawk aircraft.

HOBART COBHAM PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003 21
Business Review continued
TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
Part of Cobham’s success has been from its long term
strategy of investment in innovation. In 2003 Cobham
increased the level of development expenditure by some
28% to £40.4m. This equates to 6.4% of annual revenue in
the Aerospace Systems and Avionics product areas.
Investment at this level is expected to continue.
In the Aerospace Systems group Sargent Fletcher’s
advanced technology is currently embracing a non-
pyrotechnic store ejection system and an autonomous
hook-up system for use in air vehicle docking operations. A
new control system, for use with Flight Refuelling’s 900
Series aerial refuelling pods, is now being implemented on
the AFSOC KC-130H tanker aircraft. Consistent with today’s
glass cockpit designs, it allows multiple refuelling systems to
be controlled from a single multi-function display.
Additional benefit is gained by single point access for
improved maintenance diagnostics. The lessons learned
during the development of the low-speed variable drag
drogue (VDD) for the KC-130H air refuelling pods will
signiﬁcantly assist the design of a new high-speed VDD for
use on the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft. In the case of the
KC-130H, the VDD facilitates refuelling of multi-receivers,
i.e. helicopters, tilt-rotor and low-speed ﬁxed-wing aircraft,
during the same mission.
Chelton has focused speciﬁcally on satellite communications
systems, digital radio technology and cockpit avionics
equipment. Continued development of the electronic ﬂight
instrument system (EFIS) at Chelton Flight Systems has
led to approval for use on helicopter platforms. This
investment was rewarded by winning NASA’s prestigious
‘Turning Goals into Reality’ award. Chelton’s consolidation
as a major sub-system provider is evidenced by the ongoing
investment in interference cancellation technology and the
introduction of a range of customised high power solid state
microwave switching networks.
The addition of ERA Technology to the Chelton group has
added substantial research and development capability
across the Cobham group.
Part of Cobham’s success has been from
its long term strategy of investment in
innovation. In 2003 Cobham increased the
level of development expenditure by some
28% to £40.4m

Cobham’s Commitment to
Corporate Social Responsibility
As a multi-national organisation, Cobham plc recognises its
corporate social responsibility (CSR) to carry out business in an
economically, environmentally and socially responsible way.
Over the past year a strategy has been developed that
incorporates many elements of CSR which were already in
place. This has resulted in a revised corporate framework that
provides a set of principles to guide behaviour and business
operations for our employees at all levels. It addresses business
ethics, anti-fraud, equal opportunity, health and safety,
environment and community involvement.
The strategy also includes the development of key indicators
and a supporting data collection infrastructure for the
measurement of CSR performance.
A CSR working group, which includes corporate, environmental,
health and safety and communication personnel has now been
established.
In 2003 a number of key performance indicators were
identified which allowed CSR performance to be
measured and a supporting data collection system
was introduced across the Cobham group.
Looking after the environment
Under the group’s environmental policy Cobham is
committed to meeting legislative requirements, to the
prevention of pollution and to the continuous improvement
of environmental performance.
In 2003:
•
A high-level environmental impact analysis was conducted
at the start of the year.
•
19 sites have developed an Environmental Management
System (EMS), six of which are certiﬁed to ISO 14001.
A further seven sites have plans to implement an EMS.
•
Energy consumption was approximately 776k gigajoules,
equating to 0.93 gigajoules per £1,000 of turnover.
•
Greenhouse gas emissions from electricity use was 
40,042 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO
2
-e),
approximately 4 tonnes of CO
2
-e per employee.
•
Water consumption was 201,839m
3
, equating to around
22m
3
per employee.
•
136,542 tonnes of waste was generated, 60% of which 
was recycled.

Key goals in going forward
It is recognised that implementing an effective CSR strategy is a long-term challenge and work will continue towards
meeting the following goals in 2004:
•
Reﬁnement of the data collection and reporting system.
•
Veriﬁcation of CSR performance as part of the Cobham assurance process.
•
Expansion of key performance indicators and the setting of performance targets.
•
Completion of a revised organisation-wide corporate framework and the setting out of policies in the CSR area.
•
Using the Cobham internet website to communicate with stakeholders and facilitate CSR awareness and continual
improvement within the group.
Looking after our workforce
Cobham’s human resources policies seek to provide all
employees with a safe place to work, equality of opportunity
and freedom from harassment. Career and skills development
of people is the key to future growth and success, with
training an essential element of everyday business activity.
In 2003:
•
The average number of employees within the Cobham
group was 8,990. Of these 23% were women.
•
Greater than 50% of the group’s employees have more
than ﬁve years’ service.
•
Worldwide, 77 injuries and other occurrences were
recorded which were reportable under UK legislation.
Overall incidence rate, as deﬁned by the UK Health and
Safety Executive, reduced by 19% from 945 in 2002 to 769.
•
No penalties or ﬁnes were received for health and safety
matters.
•
Companies throughout the group continued to develop
leadership programmes, including the Cobham Managing
for Excellence programme.
•
Development of targeted training activity is being assisted
by enhancing the group’s appraisal and mentoring systems.
Working with the community
The maintenance of good community links is clearly
fundamental to Cobham’s long term viability and success.
In 2003 support for community issues and 
events included:
•
The support of CANTEEN, a charity for children with
cancer, by National Jet Systems in Australia. This involved
fundraising activities and providing a ﬂight on a BAe 146
for sick children.
•
The donation by Artex (USA) of time and money to a local
trust that provides activities for children with special
needs.
•
The provision by Credowan (UK) of sports kit for a local
soccer team and sponsorship of a local school.
•
The support by Cobham of Young Enterprise in Dorset, UK,
which is designed to bring business experience into
schools.
In addition, ERA Technology (UK) was awarded a contract by
the UK Department for International Development for the
development and trial of innovative hand-held mine detectors
for use in worldwide humanitarian landmine clearance
operations. 24
Financial record
•
In 2003 the share price increased by 14.4% and Cobham
delivered total shareholder returns of 16.9%.
•
Operating cash ﬂow of £108.6m (2002 - £106.9m), which is
a conversion rate of 76% (2002 - 90%) to operating proﬁt
(excluding the exceptional impact of the loss on the disposal
of Westwind, integration costs of £0.8m (2002 - £3.2m),
goodwill amortisation and proﬁts from joint ventures and
associates).
•
Free cash ﬂow £77.3m (2002 - £74.7m).
•
Underlying proﬁt before tax up 16.8% to £135.3m (2002 -
£115.8m). Underlying proﬁt excludes integration costs, the
impact of the loss on the disposal of Westwind and goodwill
amortisation.
•
Underlying earnings per share rose 8.2%.
•
Recommended dividends per share increase of 10%.
Accounting policies
The board has reviewed the accounting policies in accordance
with FRS 18 and determined they are appropriate for the group.
The board has decided to adopt FRS 17 for accounting for
pension costs. The 2002 comparative results have been restated
to reflect this change, with the main impacts being an
additional credit to 2002 proﬁts before tax of £0.5m and a
charge to 2003 proﬁts before tax of £2.5m. Shareholders’ funds
at 31 December 2003 are reduced by £70.0m (2002 - £61.8m).
Share Placing
On 9 July the company issued 9,159,560 ordinary shares by
way of a placing, raising £104.6m net of expenses. The primary
purpose was to fund the higher level of investment in
acquisitions.
Acquisitions
During the year, the group made 13 acquisitions for a total 
cash consideration of £138.8m, borrowings incurred as
consideration of £12.2m and deferred and contingent
consideration of £14.4m.
The larger of the acquired businesses were Litton Life Support,
Dräger Aerospace, ERA Technology, Sea Tel, Thales Antennas 
and the assets of TransAustralian Air. Further detail is in note 29.
Financial Review
These underlying results represent
another record for the group. They complete
a year that has also seen a successful share
placing, 13 acquisitions and the disposal 
of Westwind. I believe the group is well
positioned for the future
Warren Tucker

” COBHAM PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003 25
Disposal of Westwind
In line with the group’s strategy, Westwind Air Bearings Limited
and Westwind Air Bearings Inc. (together ‘Westwind’), were sold
on 10 December 2003 for total proceeds of £21.2m. This gave
rise to a proﬁt on disposal of tangible assets of £4.3m which
became an exceptional loss of £64.1m after the reversal of
£68.4m of goodwill originally written-off to reserves in 1995.
Results
Group turnover increased by 13.3% to £832.6m (2002 -
£734.6m). Excluding integration costs, amortisation of goodwill
of £15.8m (2002 - £12.6m), the loss on the disposal of
Westwind and the group’s share of joint venture and associate
results, operating profit increased by 20.3% to £142.5m 
(2002 - £118.5m). The share of operating proﬁt from joint
ventures and associates before goodwill amortisation of £0.1m
(2002 - £0.1m) rose from £4.9m in 2002 to £5.2m in 2003.
Selling and distribution and administration costs were 12.7% of
turnover (2002 - 12.7%).
Profit on ordinary activities before taxation decreased to
£54.5m (2002 - £99.9m). Proﬁt on ordinary activities before tax
and excluding integration costs, goodwill amortisation and 
the loss on the sale of Westwind amounted to £135.3m 
(2002 - £115.8m). This represented a 16.8% increase.
Net interest costs, including those of joint ventures, rose from
£10.2m to £11.5m as a result of higher interest rates and higher
net debt prior to the placing in July.
Turnover analysis
The table below categorises turnover into the various end
market segments, of which military remains the largest:
2003 2002
% %
Military 50 49
Commercial Aerospace 16 17
General Aviation 6 5
Outsourcing – non military 11 12
Government – non military 7 8

Marine/ Space 4 4
Westwind (sold in December 2003) 2 2
T axation
The tax charge of £36.0m (2002 - £28.1m) on the proﬁt before
tax of £54.5m (2002 - £99.9m) represents a rate of 66.1%
(2002 - 28.1%). Excluding the exceptional loss of £64.1m 
(2002 - £nil) on the sale of Westwind, integration costs of
£0.8m (2002 - £3.2m) and goodwill amortisation of £15.9m
(2002 - £12.7m), the effective rate for the year would be 26.6%
(2002 - 24.3%). This adjusted tax charge is lower than the
prevailing tax rates across the various countries in which the
group operates, primarily because part of the goodwill charge 
is an allowable expense for taxation and a beneﬁt has arisen
from the tax credit for research and development. Further
details on the tax charge can be found in note 7 to the 
ﬁnancial statements.
Earnings per share
The basic earnings per share was 17.2p (2002 - 70.7p) whilst
the fully diluted earnings per share amounted to 17.1p 
(2002 - 70.2p). However, after adjusting for integration costs,
the amortisation of goodwill and the loss on the disposal of
Westwind, underlying earnings per share increased by 8.2% 
to 93.5p (2002 - 86.4p).
Dividends
The directors are recommending a ﬁnal ordinary dividend of
19.8p per share (2002 - 18.0p) which represents an increase of
10.0% on last year. If approved by shareholders, this will result
in a total dividend of 28.16p per share (2002 - 25.6p), also an
increase of 10.0%.
The total ordinary dividend for the year will absorb £31.3m
(2002 - £25.9m) leaving (loss)/proﬁt retained of £(13.1)m
(2002 - £45.6m).
Financing
During 2003, the group continued to generate funds and, at 
the year end, the net debt as deﬁned by FRS 1 was £154.4m
(2002 - £188.8m). Included in this ﬁgure are all amounts owing
under bank loans, debenture loans, ﬁnance leases and other
borrowings. This level of debt represents a gearing level of
33.9% (2002 - 63.5%). Net interest cover is at a prudent level
of 12.8 times (2002 - 12.1). 2003 net debt is 0.9 times 2003
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation,
excluding integration costs and the exceptional loss on the sale
of Westwind. 26
Financing continued
The Australian subsidiaries have a number of operating leases
for the provision of aircraft which are used to provide services to
third parties under back-to-back contracts.
The group had three main borrowings outstanding at the year
end, under the following facilities:
(a) the March 1996 private placement of Cobham guaranteed
senior notes which raised US$50m. These notes carry a
ﬁxed interest rate of 6.28% for the seven year notes and
6.42% for the ten year notes. Principal repayments to date
amount to US$15m.
(b) the October 2002 private placement of Cobham
guaranteed senior notes which raised US$225m.The facility
comprises two series of notes repayable in seven and ten
years. As a result of an interest rate swap, the interest
expense varies with LIBOR.
(c) the £200m club multi-currency credit agreement which
was entered into in December 2002. The borrowings carry a
variable rate of interest. At the end of 2003 £42m had 
been drawn under this agreement. The facility reduced to
£150m after the ﬁrst year of operation and is repayable 
in full in January 2008.
Cash ﬂow
The group gives high priority to cash management. It is
therefore particularly pleasing to highlight the operating and
free cash flow generated in 2003 shown in the following
summary. The operating cash flow amounted to £108.6m 
(2002 - £106.9m), which is 76% (2002 - 90%) of operating
proﬁt (excluding the exceptional impact of integration costs
and profits from joint ventures and associates). £77.3m 
(2002 - £74.7m) of free cash ﬂow was generated.
Control over working capital continues to be a major focus
within the operating companies. As was the case in 2002, a
substantial amount of business was invoiced in the latter part
of 2003 due, in part, to the defence procurement cycle.
Stock turns at the end of 2003 were 3.2 (2002 - 3.3).
Notwithstanding this, trade debtor days at the end of 2003
were 54 (2002 - 57). The impact of acquisitions was to increase
debtors by £22.0m and stocks by £18.4m.
The net cash outflow in respect of capital expenditure 
on tangible and intangible fixed assets was £39.2m 
(2002 - £29.0m). As a percentage of turnover this increased
from 3.9% to 4.7%. We continue to invest in our 
operating companies at a level higher than the annual
depreciation charge.
Further detail relating to the cash ﬂows and movement in net
debt of the group is given in notes 26, 27 and 28 of the ﬁnancial
statements. A summary of the change in net debt is set 
out below:

Financial Review continued COBHAM PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003 27
Pensions
The group has adopted FRS 17 for the 2003 financial
statements and comparative 2002 ﬁgures have been restated.
FRS 17 is a more prescriptive accounting treatment than
SSAP24, and we consider that the greater transparency and
consistency offered are signiﬁcant beneﬁts.
Under FRS 17, the group’s ﬁnancial statements reﬂect the net
surplus/deﬁcit in deﬁned beneﬁt plans, taking assets at their
market values at 31 December and evaluating liabilities by
discounting at year-end AA corporate bond interest rates.
Following actuarial reviews of the funding of the main UK
schemes in June 2003, the operating companies increased their
contribution rate. Additional contributions of £3.8m have been
made during 2003. In addition, the majority of employees have
elected to increase their contributions by 2 percentage points
from the beginning of 2004.
Foreign exchange 
The group’s aim has been to reduce, or eliminate where
practicable, foreign exchange risk. The pound sterling/US dollar
exchange rate is the most important as far as the group is
concerned. This is primarily due to the level of US dollars which
the UK and European subsidiaries expect to receive from their
business activities, as certain global aerospace and defence
contracts are denominated in US dollars. Equally, some
exposure arises from operating companies based in the USA,
offset partially by dollar denominated borrowings. All
signiﬁcant foreign exchange transactions are approved by the
parent company. In addition to the structured borrowing, a
number of ﬁnancial instruments are used to manage the foreign
exchange exposure, such as forward rate contracts and options.
Details of the most signiﬁcant of these are described in note 30
of Notes to the Financial Statements. In January 2004 the
group entered into additional forward contracts to sell US$ for
sterling and euros throughout 2004. As a consequence, the
majority of the anticipated exposure to US$ in UK and
European subsidiaries is hedged at average rates of 1.59 for
sterling and 1.23 for euros respectively.
Going concern
The group’s ﬁnances are sound and the balance sheet remains
strong. Accordingly, after making enquiries, the directors have
formed a judgement at the time of approving the ﬁnancial
statements that there is a reasonable expectation that the
company and the group as a whole have adequate resources to
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For
this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in
preparing the ﬁnancial statements.

31 December 2003.
Dividends
An interim dividend of 8.36p per ordinary share (2002 - 7.60p) was paid in December 2003. The directors are recommending a ﬁnal dividend
of 19.8p per ordinary share (2002 - 18.0p) payable on 2 July 2004 to ordinary shareholders on the register as at 4 June 2004, making a total
ordinary dividend for the year of 28.16p (2002 - 25.60p). It is proposed that the retained loss of £13.1m be transferred to the proﬁt and 
loss reserve.

Board of directors 
The current directors are listed with short biographical notes on pages 29 to 31. They held ofﬁce throughout the year with the exceptions of
Warren Tucker, Andy Stevens and Marcus Beresford who were appointed on 28 July 2003, 10 November 2003 and 1 March 2004 respectively.
In addition, Giles Irwin and Robin Clark were directors until 27 July 2003 and 15 August 2003 respectively.
The directors retiring by rotation at the annual general meeting are Allan Cook and Geoff Cooper who, being eligible, will offer themselves for

are required to be disclosed by the Companies Act 1985 or the Financial Services Authority’s Listing Rules.
Details of directors’ share interests and of their rights to subscribe for shares are shown in the directors’ remuneration report on pages 36
to 44.
Corporate governance
This statement describes how the company has applied the principles of good governance set out in section 1 of the combined code on
corporate governance annexed to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority (‘the Code’); it also contains a statement regarding
compliance with the provisions set out in section 1 of the Code. The Code has been superseded and replaced by the revised combined code
on corporate governance published in July 2003 which takes effect for the company from 1 January 2004.
Directors: The Cobham board currently comprises a non-executive chairman, the chief executive, four other executive directors and four
other non-executive directors of whom Mike Smith is recognised as the senior member. All the non-executive directors, with the exception
of the chairman, are considered to be independent.
Board members have access to the advice and services of the company secretary and, if required, independent external advice at the
company’s expense in connection with the furtherance of their duties as directors. No external advice was sought during the year.
Directors’ Report COBHAM PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003 33
The board as a whole meets regularly during the year to make and review major business decisions and to monitor and test the operational
performance of the group in accordance with the schedule of matters reserved by the board for its decision. There is regular contact between
meetings to progress the group’s business.
To assist in the discharge of its duties and responsibilities, the board has established a number of committees, the most signiﬁcant of which
are the audit, remuneration, nomination and executive committees. Each committee has its own terms of reference and these are reviewed
from time to time. Meetings take place on a regular basis throughout the year save in the case of the nomination committee, the meetings
of which take place as required.
The respective roles and responsibilities of the chairman and chief executive are clearly understood and the board’s policy is that these two
positions should normally be held by different people. In addition to his other duties, the chairman is responsible for carrying out a formal
review of the board’s effectiveness on an annual basis.
The board and its committees receive relevant and appropriate information relating to the business to be transacted in sufﬁcient time to
enable it to be fully considered. Additional information is made available to all directors if requested and reports in respect of the group’s
activities and performance for those months during which a meeting of the board is not scheduled to take place are routinely circulated to
all directors.
The nomination committee is responsible for recommending new directors, both executive and non-executive, to the board. In appropriate
cases recruitment consultants are used to assist in the process and normally no offer of a directorship is made before all board members have
had a reasonable opportunity to meet the prospective director concerned. Advice was received during the year from Egon Zehnder
International and Sciteb in connection with the recruitment of Warren Tucker and Marcus Beresford respectively. The membership of the
committee consists of Gordon Page (chairman), Allan Cook, Mike Smith, Jeff Edington, Peter Hooley and Marcus Beresford (appointed 
1 March 2004).
The executive committee, among other things, develops the group’s strategy for board approval, makes recommendations as to acquisitions
and divestments, reviews operational activities and manages the signiﬁcant risks faced by the group. Membership of the committee
comprises all the executive directors and the chief executive is the committee’s chairman.
Non-executive directors are initially appointed for three years and, under the articles of association, all directors are required to retire at least
every three years. Directors who have reached the age of 70 are required to retire, and not to seek re-appointment, at the annual general
meeting following their seventieth birthday.
Directors’ remuneration: Information on the company’s policy with regard to executive directors’ remuneration, the role and function of the
remuneration committee, and details of the remuneration of each director are contained in the directors’ remuneration report on pages 36
to 44. A committee of the board is responsible for determining the fees of the non-executive directors within the limits contained in the
articles of association.
Relations with shareholders: The company welcomes discussions with shareholders where practicable. During the year the company made
presentations to fund managers both in the UK and overseas and received a number of visits. Presentations to analysts and others were also
made following the announcements of the full and half year’s results and at other times during the year.
Shareholders have the opportunity to question the chairmen of the board and of the principal board committees at the company’s annual
general meeting and also to receive at that meeting the chairman’s statement as to any signiﬁcant developments during the year to date.
Information relating to the level of proxies lodged at the 2003 annual general meeting was formally announced to shareholders after each
resolution had been dealt with on a show of hands and was subsequently reported on the company’s website.
Accountability and audit: The chairman’s statement, the chief executive’s review, the business review and the ﬁnancial review on pages 6
to 27 contain information relevant to an assessment of the company’s position and prospects. Statements regarding the directors’
responsibilities for preparing the company’s ﬁnancial statements and the auditors’ responsibilities for reporting on them are set out on pages
45 to 47. The directors’ going concern statement is set out on page 27.
The board is responsible for the group’s system of internal control the aim of which is to manage risks that are signiﬁcant to the fulﬁlment
of the group’s business objectives and to contribute to the safeguarding of shareholders’ investment and the company’s assets. It is also
responsible for reviewing the effectiveness of the system. However, such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of
failure to achieve business objectives, and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material mis-statement or loss. 34
Corporate governance continued
The board conﬁrms that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the signiﬁcant risks faced by the group. This
process has been in place for the year under review and up to the date of approval of the annual report and ﬁnancial statements and accords
with the guidance for directors on internal control issued by the Turnbull Committee.
The process comprises, among other things, an assurance programme based around signiﬁcant risks and key procedures/control processes.
Integral to the process are the Group Finance Manual and the Corporate Framework which contain comprehensive policies of a ﬁnancial and
non ﬁnancial nature. During the year the group executive committee undertook a top-level review of signiﬁcant risks and risk management
has been embedded into the group’s management process through the adoption of a requirement for subsidiaries to carry out formal risk
management assessments as part of the annual ﬁve-year planning exercise. In addition, the audit committee monitors the adequacy of
internal ﬁnancial controls and compliance with group standards through a self-assessment process involving all subsidiaries, supplemented
by risk-based assurance visits and reviews.
The board receives reports on a regular basis from the executive and audit committees in relation to the effectiveness of the group’s system
of internal control and has accordingly reviewed the group’s system of internal control in respect of 2003.
The audit committee comprises Peter Hooley (chairman), Mike Smith, Jeff Edington and Marcus Beresford (appointed 1 March 2004). The
committee normally meets on three occasions during the year and the auditors attend meetings twice yearly. The group ﬁnancial director
attends meetings as required but he is not present throughout.
The audit committee reviews the group’s ﬁnancial statements, internal ﬁnancial controls and risk management. It also approves the selection
of the auditors, approves their fees and reviews their performance, independence and objectivity.
Compliance statement: Throughout the year ended 31 December 2003 the company has complied with the provisions set out in section 1
of the Code except that, with regard to Code provision B.1.7, the company did not for part of the year have as an objective the reduction of
Robin Clark’s notice period to one year or less. However, he left the company as a result of the reorganisation of the group’s structure on 
15 August 2003.
The auditors have, as mentioned in their report on page 46, reviewed whether or not this statement reﬂects the company’s compliance with
the seven provisions of the Code speciﬁed for their review by the Financial Services Authority.
Share capital
Details of movements in the share capital of the company during the year are given in note 23 to the ﬁnancial statements.
Research and development
The group continues to invest in the important area of research and development. During the year the group expended £40.4m 
(2002 - £31.6m) on non customer funded research and development. The management of each of the group’s businesses is responsible for
identifying and carrying out research and development programmes which are suitable having regard to particular market and product needs.
Further information on research and development appears on page 21.
Major interests in shares
Major interests in the issued ordinary share capital of the company appearing in the register maintained in accordance with Section 211 of
the Companies Act 1985 as at 18 March 2004 were as follows:
Percentage at
Number of Date of

3% or more.
Directors’ Report continued COBHAM PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003 35
Employment
The group’s employment policies include a commitment to equal opportunities regardless of sex, race, colour, nationality or ethnic origin,
disability, and other forms of discrimination. With regard to employees who become disabled, the policy is to take all reasonable steps,
including retraining, to ensure that they can remain in employment wherever practicable.
The importance of employee development and training is recognised and group businesses are required to encourage employees to take
advantage of available and relevant training programmes and opportunities for advancement.
The group encourages employee participation and consultation at all levels and also the sharing of relevant business information. Such an
approach facilitates the development of new ideas and practices that add value to the business, promotes team member commitment and
helps to focus company and employee expectations. In-house newsletters, intranet and internet communications, company announcements
and team meetings all play a part in this process.
UK employees are given the opportunity to become shareholders in the company through the Cobham Savings Related Share Option
Scheme. This scheme will, subject to shareholder approval, be replaced by a similar scheme at the forthcoming annual general meeting.
Selected UK and overseas employees may become shareholders through participation in the Cobham Executive Share Option Scheme; this
will also, subject to shareholder approval, be replaced at the annual general meeting. Further information relating to these new schemes is
contained in the circular sent to shareholders separately with this annual report.
Further information relating to employment matters is contained in the section on corporate social responsibility on pages 22 and 23.
Environment
The group has adopted an environmental policy under which it is committed to meeting legislative requirements, to the prevention of
pollution and to the continuous improvement of its environmental performance.
The chief executive has been appointed as the main board member with overall environmental responsibility whilst, at the operating
company level, the responsibility for ensuring compliance with the environmental policy lies with the appropriate subsidiary board.
Further information relating to environmental matters is contained in the section on corporate social responsibility on page 22.
Creditor payment policy
Payment is generally made by group companies to their creditors in accordance with agreed terms of business provided that those terms
have been met. It is the policy of the parent company that all invoices are paid within 30 days following the end of the month in which the
invoices are approved. The total amount of the parent company’s trade creditors falling due within one year at 31 December 2003 represents
35 days’ (2002 - 36 days) worth as a proportion of the total amount invoiced by suppliers during the year ended on that date.

Annual General Meeting
The company’s annual general meeting will be held at 12 noon on Wednesday, 16 June 2004 at Painters’ Hall, 9 Little Trinity Lane, London

to shareholders separately with this annual report.
By order of the board
John Pope Secretary
18 March 2004 36
In accordance with The Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (‘the Regulations’), shareholder approval of this directors’
remuneration report will be sought at the forthcoming annual general meeting. The report has been approved by the board.
The remuneration committee, which met on three occasions during the year, determines the remuneration, beneﬁts and terms and
conditions of service of the executive directors and makes recommendations to the board with regard to the company’s policy on executive
directors’ remuneration. It also considers the remuneration of certain senior managers. The membership of the committee consists of 
Mike Smith (chairman), Jeff Edington, Peter Hooley and Marcus Beresford (appointed 1 March 2004), each of whom is an independent 
non-executive director.
The relationship between the board and the committee is governed by formal terms of reference. Under these terms, the committee is
authorised, among other things, to obtain external legal or other professional advice at the company’s expense as required.
Remuneration policy
The company’s policy is to recruit, motivate and retain executive directors of high calibre by rewarding them with competitive salary and
beneﬁt packages, increasingly linked to measured performance. More speciﬁcally, the current strategy is to position base salaries at the
median of the market and to provide an opportunity to earn a total cash payment (i.e. base salary and annual incentive) at the upper quartile
for high performance. Remuneration is also linked to performance through participation in share incentive schemes which ensures that
directors’ interests are closely aligned with shareholders’ interests. In considering remuneration matters, the committee has received advice
from New Bridge Street Consultants and reports from Inbucon. New Bridge Street Consultants were appointed by the committee. None of
the foregoing provided other services to the company during the year. The committee also consulted with Gordon Page and Allan Cook and
they attended one or more of the committee’s meetings on matters which did not directly affect them. No director is involved in deciding
his own remuneration. The board, through the committee, will continue to consult with principal shareholders when it is considering
structural changes to its policy on executive directors’ remuneration.
The main elements of directors’ remuneration are described in the paragraphs that follow. Remuneration information and details of directors’
interests in Cobham ordinary shares are set out in tables 1 to 5 on pages 40 to 44.
Basic salary
Basic salaries are reviewed annually, usually in November, to take effect from 1 January of the following year. The committee takes into
account internal and external advice and data from a range of companies, such as the total reward survey produced annually by New Bridge
Street Consultants, as well as personal performance and business responsibilities.
Annual performance-related bonus
The company operates an annual cash bonus scheme for its executive directors. Bonuses are awarded by the committee having regard to the
performance of the group, the individual and, in the case of executive directors with speciﬁc subsidiary company responsibilities, the
performance of the relevant subsidiaries. Bonuses in respect of the year under review were capped at 60% of basic salary except for Gordon
Page whose bonus was capped at 100% of basic salary in view of his ineligibility, as a result of proximity to retirement, to receive an award
during the year under the Cobham Long Term Incentive Plan. Gordon Page will not be eligible for a bonus in respect of 2004 as he is now a
non-executive director. Giles Irwin’s bonus was pro-rated for the period to his retirement from the board. The policy in respect of the
payment of bonuses for 2004 is the same as for 2003.
In the cases of Gordon Page, Allan Cook and Warren Tucker the constituent elements of their bonus plans are earnings per share in excess of
inﬂation, cash generation against budget and proven achievement of personal objectives for each individual. Up to 75% of the maximum
achievable bonus is determined by the company’s ﬁnancial performance with the balance being attributable to the achievement of personal
objectives.
In the cases of Geoff Cooper, Andy Stevens and Alex Hannam the constituent elements of their bonus plans are earnings per share in excess
of inﬂation (as for other directors), net proﬁt against budget for the group of subsidiary companies for which they are operationally
responsible, cash generation against budget and proven achievement of personal objectives for each individual. Up to 75% of the maximum
achievable bonus is determined by the ﬁnancial performances of the company or the relevant subsidiary groups, as appropriate, with the
balance being attributable to the achievement of personal objectives.
Personal objectives for the other executive directors are set by Gordon Page and Allan Cook and agreed with the committee. Those for Allan
Cook are set by Gordon Page and agreed with the committee.

Performance graph
The graph set out below is required by the Regulations and illustrates the performance of the company and a ‘broad equity market index’
over the ﬁve year period commencing on 31 December 1998. The FTSE 350 Index, of which the company has been a constituent throughout
the period in question, is considered the most appropriate form of ‘broad equity market index’ against which the company’s performance
should be measured having regard to the size of company included and the fact that it includes most of the companies which form the
comparator group for the purposes of the Cobham Long Term Incentive Plan. Performance is measured by Total Shareholder Return (share
price growth plus dividends paid).
Total shareholder return
Source: Datastream
This graph looks at the value, by the end of 2003, of £100 invested in Cobham plc on 31 December 1998 compared with that of £100
invested in the FTSE 350 Index. The other points plotted are the values at the intervening ﬁnancial year ends.
Pensions
Executive directors may join the Cobham Executives Pension Plan (‘the Plan’) at the invitation of the company. The Plan is established under
trust, contracted out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme and approved by the Inland Revenue under the Income and Corporation
Taxes Act 1988. All the executive directors, with the exception of Geoff Cooper, who has a personal money-purchase pension scheme, are
members of the Plan.
The Plan provides beneﬁts for executive directors on ﬁnal pay principles against a normal pension age of 60 with retirement before that age
being subject to actuarial reduction. Pensionable earnings are taken as the member’s basic annual salary at each April, restricted where
applicable to the earnings cap. The rate at which members are required to contribute to the Plan is 7% of pensionable earnings. Annual bonus
payments are not taken into account when calculating pensionable earnings.
Retirement pension accrues at 1/30th of pensionable earnings for each year of service in the Plan with, where applicable, a further 1/60th of
pensionable earnings for each year of pensionable service within the main Cobham pension plan. At retirement, members may commute a
portion of their pension for a cash sum.
All pensions in payment relating to post April 1997 rights are increased in line with the retail price index, subject to a minimum of 3% per
annum and a maximum of 5% per annum, with the balance of pension being increased at 3% per annum.
On death in service, a lump sum of four times pensionable earnings is payable together with a spouse’s pension of two thirds of the member’s
prospective pension. On death after retirement, a spouse’s pension is paid at the same rate as applied to the member’s pre commutation
pension. Similar spouse’s pensions are payable on the death of a deferred pensioner prior to retirement. 38
Directors’Remuneration Report continued
Pensions continued
The company establishes funded, unapproved retirement beneﬁt schemes by which additional retirement provision is made on money
purchase principles for each member whose entitlement under the Plan is restricted by the earnings cap. Payments are made to these
schemes on the basis of actuarial advice. Currently, schemes have been established for Gordon Page, Allan Cook and Alex Hannam. A scheme
is also being established for Andy Stevens. Details of company contributions made in the year are set out in table 2(b) on page 42. The policy
in respect of newly appointed directors is that contributions should normally be 2% of annual basic salary per month.
Long Term Incentive Plan
The Cobham Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) was operated again during the year under review. Under the LTIP – which has been approved by
shareholders – Cobham ordinary shares may be conditionally awarded to participants. However, they will normally only be entitled to these
shares in full at the end of a three-year period – known as the restricted period – if, and to the extent that, certain company performance
conditions are achieved.
Awards under the LTIP were made during the year to Allan Cook, Robin Clark, Geoff Cooper, Alex Hannam, Warren Tucker and Andy Stevens.
The value of the awards made was limited to 100% of basic salary (two thirds of basic salary in the case of Warren Tucker). The performance
measure applicable to these awards is total shareholder return subject to a minimum level of absolute growth in earnings per share of an
average of at least 3% (2% in respect of awards made prior to 2000) per annum above the rate of inﬂation. It is intended that awards will be
made under the LTIP in 2004 on the same basis as in 2003 except that the level of awards made to participants will be reduced where they
also participate in the new executive share option scheme described below.
With regard to total shareholder return, each participant will be entitled to 100% of his awards if the company’s return over the performance
period results in it being ranked in the top quartile of a comparator group comprising companies included in the FTSE engineering sector
index (in respect of awards made prior to 2000) and in the FTSE All Share aerospace and defence sector and the engineering and machinery
sector (in respect of awards made after 1999). If the company’s performance is at the median, 30% of the awarded shares will vest (40% in
respect of awards made prior to 2000). Between these two levels, the award will vest on a straight-line scale. Participants will lose their
awards if the company’s performance is below the median.
Earnings per share and total shareholder return are considered by the committee to be the most fair and appropriate measures of the
company’s performance relative to the performance achieved by other comparable companies and of the company’s underlying
performance.
In assessing whether performance conditions have been met, the committee relies upon performance status and veriﬁcation reports
prepared by Inbucon.
Full details of all allocations under the LTIP are set out in table 5 on page 44.

The rules of the LTIP were amended at the company’s 2000 annual general meeting in various ways including the removal of a requirement
for the awarded shares to be held in trust for a period of up to two years after the expiry of the restricted period and the removal of the ability
for participants to receive shares on a matching basis pro rata to investments made by them in Cobham shares. COBHAM PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003 39
Other share schemes
The company made ﬁnal grants of share options under the Cobham Executive Share Option Scheme (1994) in 2003.The scheme will, subject
to shareholder approval at the forthcoming annual general meeting, be replaced by a new scheme which is described in the circular which is
being sent to shareholders with this annual report. Executive directors will be eligible to participate in this new scheme. The maximum value
of shares a participant may receive pursuant to options granted in any ﬁnancial year under the new scheme may not exceed once times basic
salary, and the exercise of options granted will be conditional upon the company’s earnings per share growth exceeding inﬂation by a
speciﬁed margin over a three-year period. There will be no provision for retesting this performance condition if it is not met after three years.
Earnings per share growth is considered by the committee to be the most appropriate measure of the company’s underlying ﬁnancial
performance and it is proposed that the following targets will apply to options granted in 2004:
Average growth in EPS in excess of Value of shares under option which
inﬂation over three years may be exercised
Less than 3% per annum Nil
3% per annum 50% of salary
5% per annum or more 100% of salary
3%-5% per annum 50%-100% of salary (pro rata, on a straight line basis)
Certain executive directors are also participants in the Cobham Savings Related Share Option Scheme an all-employee share scheme
approved by the Inland Revenue. Under the scheme, participants save a ﬁxed monthly sum for three or ﬁve years and may use the sum
generated by their savings contracts to exercise options which are granted at a 20% discount to market price. Depending upon the option
period chosen, exercise can normally take place after three, ﬁve or seven years. This scheme has been approved by shareholders and does not
contain performance conditions, since the Inland Revenue requires that they must be offered to all eligible employees on the same basis
without such conditions. Subject to shareholder approval, the scheme will be replaced at the forthcoming annual general meeting. Further
information is contained in the circular which is being sent to shareholders with this report.
Service contracts
The board’s policy on setting notice periods for new directors is that these should not normally exceed one year. It recognises, however, that
it may be necessary in the case of new executive appointments to offer a longer initial notice period which would subsequently reduce to
one year after the expiry of that period. There are no explicit provisions in directors’ service contracts for early termination compensation
commitments. The committee accepts and endorses the principle of mitigation of damages on early termination of a service contract.
The service contract of Gordon Page dated 15 October 1991 expired on his 60th birthday in November 2003 and he is now non-executive
chairman and does not have a service contract. Giles Irwin’s service contract dated 15 May 1987 expired on his 60th birthday in July 2003.
Robin Clark was employed under a service contract, dated 6 May 1993, containing a notice period of two years until he left the company as
a result of a reorganisation of the group’s structure on 15 August 2003. The service contracts of Allan Cook (dated 13 June 2001), Geoff
Cooper (dated 1 June 1989) and Alex Hannam (dated 13 February 2003) are terminable on one year’s notice by either party. Warren Tucker
and Andy Stevens are employed under service contracts (both of which are dated as of 1 January 2004) containing notice periods of two
years by the company which reduce to one year after twelve months’ service. It was necessary to agree to initial two-year notice periods in
order to recruit both directors. These contracts are terminable by six months’ notice to the company.
Subject to earlier termination in accordance with their terms, the service contracts of Allan Cook, Warren Tucker, Alex Hannam and Andy
Stevens will expire on their 60th birthdays. The service contract of Geoff Cooper does not contain an expiry date.
Personal shareholding
The committee’s approach with regard to personal shareholding is to encourage executive directors to acquire and hold, over time,Cobham
ordinary shares to the value of at least one year’s salary. 40
Non-executive directors
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts. Mike Smith, Jeff Edington, Peter Hooley and Marcus Beresford have been
appointed pursuant to letters dated 14 March 1996, 12 August 1996, 10 May 2002 and 29 January 2004 respectively. Subject to
appointment or re-appointment by shareholders in the interim, the current terms will expire on 31 March 2005, 30 September 2005, 12 June
2005 and 28 February 2007 respectively. No compensation is payable in the event of their appointments being terminated. Under Gordon
Page’s letter of appointment, which is dated 22 October 2003, his current term will expire, subject as aforesaid, on 30 November 2006.
Six months’ notice of termination is required under this letter to be given by either party.
Each non-executive director, with the exception of Gordon Page, receives an annual fee of £20,000 with an additional fee of £2,000 being
paid to the chairmen of the audit and remuneration committees. Fees in respect of the services of Peter Hooley are paid to Smith & Nephew
plc. Gordon Page receives an annual fee of £160,000 which is ﬁxed until 30 November 2006. Non-executive directors do not participate in
any of the company’s share schemes, pension schemes or bonus arrangements with the exception of Gordon Page who has received awards
in the past under the LTIP and the Cobham Savings Related Share Option Scheme. He is not, however, entitled to participate in future awards
under these schemes.

Accrued pension information for Messrs Page, Irwin and Clark is based on service to 17 November, 27 July and 15 August respectively. As Messrs Page and
Irwin reached normal retirement age during the year their accrued pensions did not receive an inﬂationary increase before retirement.
2
The transfer basis was amended during the year following guidance issued by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries and this has had the effect of increasing
the additional transfer values to a greater extent than if the original basis had applied throughout the year.
3
These values, other than in respect of the position at 31 December 2002, are higher than would otherwise be the case because of understatements of
accrued pension entitlements in prior years resulting from assumptions in respect of ﬁnal pensionable salary and ﬁnal remuneration. Had the transfer value
of accrued pension at 31 December 2002 been calculated using assumptions consistent with the calculation in respect of the position at 31 December 2003,
the sum of £1,649,324 would have been £1,999,714. Consequently, £681,743 would have reduced to £256,426 and £1,035,673 would have reduced 
to £685,283.
The accrued pension shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of the ﬁnancial year. The transfer
values represent the present value of future payments from the pension plan rather than remuneration currently due to the individual and
cannot be meaningfully aggregated with annual remuneration. Members of the pension plan have the option of paying additional voluntary
contributions. Neither the contributions nor the resulting beneﬁts are included in the above.
Under Inland Revenue regulations, members’ retirement benefits may be reduced on account of retained benefits from previous
employments.
Inﬂation during 2003 has been taken to be 1.7% being the statutory increase to deferred pensions from 2002 to 2003.
Transfer values payable are calculated in accordance with Section 4 ‘Minimum Cash Equivalent’ of Guidance Note 11 issued by the Institute
and Faculty of Actuaries. 42

The above interests are all beneﬁcial and include interests in shares provisionally allocated under the Cobham Long Term Incentive Plan.
The executive directors, in common with all UK employees of the group, are interested in the shares held within the Cobham plc Qualifying
Employee Share Ownership Trust (‘QUEST’). The QUEST is used in connection with the transfer of shares to participants in the Cobham
Savings Related Share Option Scheme. As at 31 December 2003, 3,422 (2002 - 233,927) ordinary shares were held within the QUEST.
Interests at 18 March 2004, being a date not more than one month prior to the date of the notice convening the annual general meeting,
were the same as at 31 December 2003 save that the interests of Gordon Page had increased by 1,727 ordinary shares upon the exercise of
options under the Cobham Savings Related Share Option Scheme on 9 February. In addition, the number of ordinary shares held within the
QUEST had reduced to two as at 18 March 2004. Also, shares awarded under the Cobham Long Term Incentive Plan in 1999 vested 
absolutely on 17 March 2004 as follows: Gordon Page - 21,132 shares and Geoff Cooper - 12,845 shares.

Directors’Remuneration Report continued COBHAM PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003 45
The following statement, which should be read in conjunction with the report of the auditors set out overleaf, is made with a view to
distinguishing for shareholders the respective responsibilities of the directors and of the auditors in relation to the ﬁnancial statements.
The directors are required by the Companies Act 1985 to prepare ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year which give a true and fair view
of the state of affairs of the company and the group as at the end of the ﬁnancial year and of the proﬁt or loss for the ﬁnancial year.
The directors consider that in preparing the ﬁnancial statements on pages 48 to 80 the company has used appropriate accounting policies,
consistently applied and supported by reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates and that all accounting standards which they
consider to be applicable have been followed. The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The directors have responsibility for ensuring that the company keeps accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy the
ﬁnancial position of the company and which enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
The directors have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the company and
to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities 46
To the members of Cobham plc
We have audited the ﬁnancial statements which comprise the consolidated proﬁt and loss account, the balance sheets, the consolidated cash
ﬂow statement, the statement of total recognised gains and losses and the related notes and the accounting policies set out in the statement
of accounting policies. We have also audited the disclosures required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 contained in the
directors’ remuneration report (‘the auditable part’).
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law
and accounting standards are set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities. The directors are also responsible for preparing the
directors’ remuneration report.
Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁnancial statements and the auditable part of the directors’ remuneration report in accordance with
relevant legal and regulatory requirements and United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. This report,
including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the
Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to
any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view and whether the ﬁnancial statements and the
auditable part of the directors’ remuneration report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.We also report
to you if, in our opinion, the directors’ report is not consistent with the ﬁnancial statements, if the company has not kept proper accounting
records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information speciﬁed by law regarding
directors’ remuneration and transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the annual report and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the ﬁnancial statements. The other information comprises the chairman’s
statement, the chief executive’s review, the business review, the ﬁnancial review, the directors’ report including the corporate governance
statement and the unaudited part of the directors’ remuneration report.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reﬂects the company’s compliance with the seven provisions of the Combined
Code, issued in June 1998, speciﬁed for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We
are not required to consider whether the board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or to form an opinion on the
effectiveness of the company’s or group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a
test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements and the auditable part of the directors’
remuneration report. It also includes an assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of
the ﬁnancial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the company’s circumstances, consistently applied and
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide
us with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements and the auditable part of the directors’ remuneration
report are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated
the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the ﬁnancial statements.

Notes
a) The maintenance and integrity of the Cobham plc website is the responsibility of the directors; the work carried out by the auditors does
not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to
the ﬁnancial statements since they were published in this annual report and accounts on the website.
b) Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may differ from legislation of
other jurisdictions. 48
Accounting convention
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards under the historical cost convention, as
modiﬁed by the revaluation of certain ﬁxed assets. Compliance with SSAP 19 ‘Accounting for Investment Properties’ requires departure from
the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 relating to depreciation and an explanation of the departure is given in the tangible ﬁxed assets
accounting policy note below.
Basis of consolidation
The group ﬁnancial statements include the ﬁnancial statements of the parent company and of all its subsidiaries made up to the end of the
ﬁnancial year. Joint ventures are accounted for using the gross equity method in accordance with FRS 9 ‘Associates and Joint Ventures’.
Associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Businesses acquired are accounted for as acquisitions, with effect from the date control passes. Those disposed of are accounted for up until
the point of their disposal.
Turnover
Turnover is measured at the fair value of the right to consideration and excludes inter-company sales, value added tax and other sales taxes.
In the case of long term contracts, turnover is recognised based upon the fair value of work performed to date.
Pensions
The group has changed its accounting policy from SSAP 24 ‘Accounting for Pension Costs’ to FRS 17 ‘Retirement Beneﬁts’. Prior year results
have been restated to reﬂect this change and its impact is shown in note 3 to the ﬁnancial statements.
For deﬁned beneﬁt schemes the amounts charged to operating proﬁt are the current service costs and gains and losses on settlements and
curtailments. They are included as part of staff costs. Past service costs are recognised immediately in the proﬁt and loss account if the
beneﬁts have vested. If the beneﬁts have not vested immediately, the costs are recognised over the period until vesting occurs. The interest
cost and expected return on assets are shown as a net amount of other ﬁnance costs or credits adjacent to interest. Actuarial gains and losses
are recognised immediately in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Deﬁned beneﬁts schemes are funded, with the assets of the scheme held separately from those of the group, in separate trustee
administered funds. Pension scheme assets are measured at fair value and liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected
unit method and discounted at a rate equivalent to the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent currency and
term to the scheme liabilities. The actuarial valuations are obtained at least triennially and are updated at each balance sheet date. The
resulting deﬁned beneﬁt asset or liability, net of the related deferred tax, is presented separately after other net assets on the face of the
balance sheet.
For deﬁned contribution schemes the amount charged to the proﬁt and loss account in respect of pension costs and other post-retirement
beneﬁts is the contributions payable in the year. Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are
shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is recognised on a full provision basis on all timing differences which have originated, but not reversed, at the balance sheet
date calculated at rates of tax expected to apply, based on current tax rates and law. Timing differences represent accumulated differences
between the company’s taxable proﬁt and its ﬁnancial proﬁt and arise primarily from the difference between accelerated capital allowances
and depreciation. Deferred taxation liabilities are not discounted.
Intangible ﬁxed assets
Goodwill arising on acquisitions of subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures made after 1 January 1998 and expenditure on other
intangible ﬁxed assets, comprising patents, licences and trade marks, is capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over estimated
useful lives of up to 20 years. These periods have been determined after taking into account the nature of the intangible assets acquired and
the markets in which these intangible assets operate.
In accordance with the group’s accounting policy prior to the introduction of FRS 10, goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 January 1998
has been written off to reserves, but will be charged to the proﬁt and loss account on any subsequent disposal of the business to which it is
related.
Accounting Policies COBHAM PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003 49
T angible ﬁxed assets
Freehold land and investment properties are not depreciated. Other ﬁxed assets are depreciated on a straight line basis to their estimated
residual values over their estimated useful lives. These lives are as follows:
Freehold buildings – 50 years
Leasehold properties – The period of the lease
Other ﬁxed assets – 3 to 15 years
Investment properties are included in the balance sheet at open market value. In accordance with SSAP 19, investment properties are
revalued annually and the aggregate surplus or deﬁcit is transferred to revaluation reserve, and no provision is made for depreciation of
freehold properties. This departure from the requirements of the Companies Act 1985, which requires all properties to be depreciated, is, in
the opinion of the directors, necessary for the ﬁnancial statements to show a true and fair view in accordance with applicable accounting
standards.
The depreciation (which would, had the provisions of the Act been followed, have reduced proﬁt for the year) is only one of the factors
reﬂected in the annual valuation and the amount attributable to this factor cannot reasonably be separately identiﬁed or quantiﬁed.
Investments
Investments are stated at cost less any provision for permanent diminution in value.
Investment in own shares
Investment in own shares represents shares held in the Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust (QUEST), which are shown at their
estimated recoverable amount, being the option price of the shares payable by the employee. The amounts contributed to the QUEST in
excess of the option price are charged against reserves. The excess of the option price over the nominal value of the shares has been taken
to the share premium account.
Aircraft engine overhaul expenditure
Expenditure is capitalised when it is incurred on aircraft engine overhauls and this ﬁxed asset addition is depreciated over its useful 
economic life.
Research and development
Research and development expenditure not chargeable to customers is written off as incurred.
Finance leases
Where assets are ﬁnanced by lease agreements that give rights approximating to ownership (ﬁnance leases), the assets are treated as if they
had been purchased outright and the corresponding leasing commitments are shown as an obligation under ﬁnance leases. The relevant
assets are depreciated on the basis of expected utilisation over the shorter of the life of the contract on which they are employed or the life
of the lease. Lease payments are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements and the interest is charged to the proﬁt and loss
account.
Operating leases
Operating lease payments for assets leased from third parties are charged to the proﬁt and loss account as incurred.
Stocks
Stocks and work in progress are stated at the lower of cost, which includes an appropriate proportion of productive overheads, and net
realisable value.
Payments received and receivable on account of work in progress are deducted from the cost of the work carried out at the balance sheet
date to the extent of the valuation of the work done. 50
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction or, where forward cover contracts
have been arranged, at the contracted rate. Monetary assets and liabilities denoted in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate
ruling at the balance sheet date or at a contractual rate if applicable and any exchange differences arising are taken to the proﬁt and loss
account.
For consolidation purposes the assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures are translated at the closing
exchange rates. Proﬁt and loss accounts of such undertakings are consolidated at the average rates of exchange during the year. Exchange
differences arising on these translations are taken to reserves.
Financial instruments
Derivative instruments utilised by the group include currency and interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, forward rate agreements and forward
currency contracts. Receipts and payments on ﬁnancial instruments are recognised on an accruals basis, over the life of the instruments.
Finance costs associated with debt issuances are charged to the proﬁt and loss account over the life of the instruments.

3Prior Y ear Adjustment
In the period the group has adopted FRS 17. In prior periods the group had accounted for pension costs under SSAP 24. The resulting restatement to group
profit and loss account reserve is as follows:
Group profit and loss 
account reserve
£m £m
At 31 December 2002 as previously stated 254.5
On removing SSAP 24 prepayment at 1 January 2002 (14.6)

Adjustment to profit retained in the year 0.3
Actuarial loss in the year (net of tax) (42.8)
Net effect of restatement (61.8)
At 31 December 2002 as restated 192.7
This change in accounting policy has resulted in an increase in staff costs of £1.6m (2002 - £2.1m) and other finance (charges)/income of £(0.9)m (2002 - £2.6m),
an decrease/(increase) in the tax charge of £0.7m (2002 - £(0.2)m), a decrease in profit for the year by £1.8m (2002 - increase of £0.3m) and a decrease in total
recognised gains and losses of £8.2m (2002 - £43.5m). Other debtors at December 2002 have been reduced by £21.7m, together with related deferred tax of
£6.5m.
If stated on a SSAP 24 basis, profit on ordinary activities before taxation would have been £2.5m greater (2002 - £0.5m less) at £57.0m (2002 - £99.4m)
giving a basic earnings per share of 18.8p (2002 - 70.4p) and an underlying earnings per share of 95.2p (2002 - 86.2p). Notes to the Financial Statements continued
4Integration Costs
Connected with the acquisition of the Thales Antennas business of Thales in July 2003, costs of £0.8m have been incurred in respect of restructuring the
business.
Following the acquisition of the Power and Control business of BAE Systems at the end of 2002, costs of £3.2m were incurred in that year in respect of the
integration of the business with various parts of Aerospace Systems.
5 Disposal of Group Undertakings
In line with the group’s strategy to focus on its core aerospace and defence markets, Westwind Air Bearings Limited and Westwind Air Bearings Inc. (together
‘Westwind’), were sold on 10 December 2003 for total proceeds of £21.2m. This gave rise to a profit on disposal of tangible assets of £4.3m which became
an exceptional loss of £64.1m after the reversal of £68.4m of goodwill originally written-off to reserves. There was no tax payable or recoverable in relation
to this disposal.
This business has been treated as a discontinued operation in the financial statements.

(2002 - £4.5m), the effective rate for the year is 28.9% (2002 - 29.0% restated). This adjusted tax charge is lower than the prevailing rates principally because
part of the goodwill charge is an allowable expense for tax purposes and some group expenditure on research and development qualifies for additional
tax deduction.

Contribution to the QUEST – (0.3)
Adjustments to tax charge in respect of prior years (0.5) (1.5)
Current tax charge for the year 33.3 23.3
Factors that may affect future tax charges:
The group’s effective rate of current tax on underlying profits is expected to be lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK primarily because
of timing differences arising on fixed assets and because some of the goodwill amortisation is an allowable deduction for tax purposes. The group expects that
this will remain broadly unchanged in the foreseeable future.
No provision has been made for deferred tax on gains recognised on revaluing property to its market value. Also, no deferred tax is recognised on the
unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures as no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.

preference dividend, and on the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, being 105,941,221 (2002 - 101,113,784, excluding the
weighted effect of 229,350 which were issued to the QUEST). The weighted average number of ordinary shares used for the fully diluted earnings per share
is 106,622,128 (2002 - 101,875,012, excluding the weighted effect of 229,350 which were issued to the QUEST).

Pensions
The group’s pension arrangements comprise various defined benefit and defined contribution schemes throughout the world with assets held in separate
trustee administered funds.
From 1 January 2003, new employees in the UK have only been able to join the defined contribution scheme. In the USA, both the Carleton Technologies and
Stanley Aviation defined benefit schemes have been closed to new members from 31 December 2003 and 31 January 2004 respectively. Since the majority
of the defined benefit schemes operated by the group are closed to new entrants, the age profile of the schemes’ in service membership will increase over
time. Under the funding method prescribed by FRS 17, the current service cost will increase as a percentage of pensionable salaries as members approach
retirement.
In the year, the group assumed the defined benefit schemes of Dräger Aerospace in Germany and ERA Technology in the UK. Both of these schemes have been
included in the assessment of the FRS 17 liability and in the tables below.
FRS 17 assumptions
The group operates a number of defined benefit schemes, the most significant being the Cobham Pension Plan (‘CPP’). A full valuation of the CPP scheme was
undertaken as at 1 April 2001 and updated to 31 December 2003 by a qualified independent actuary. During the period, employer contributions for the period
were raised to 17.3%.
The major assumptions used by the actuaries of the group schemes as at 31 December 2003 in respect of FRS 17 were as follows:

For the Dräger Aerospace scheme in Germany the following assumptions were used for 2003: rate of increase in salaries 4.00%, discount rate 5.50%,
inflation 1.00% and rate of pensions increase 1.5%.
The assets of the various schemes are held in managed and segregated funds held with various companies. The fair value of the assets held at 31 December
2003 and the expected rates of return are as follows:

The contributions paid by the company are accounted for as a defined contribution scheme, as the company is unable to identify its share of the underlying
assets and liabilities of the scheme. The cost of contributions to the group scheme for 2003 amounted to £927,000 (2002 - £225,000), being 58% (2002 -

On 9 July 2003 the company completed a private placing of 9,159,560 ordinary shares of 25p each in exchange for 11% of the equity and entire preference
share capital of Lockman Capital Limited (LCL), a company incorporated in Jersey. LCL was incorporated to undertake the private placing. Prior to the private
placing Cobham plc owned 89% of the share capital of LCL. The placing was made to a number of institutional investors. The market price on 9 July 2003 was
£11.92.
In accordance with the provisions of merger relief under section 131 of the Companies Act 1985, the company recorded the cost of investment in LCL at the
nominal value of the shares issued. On consolidation, the excess of the fair value over the nominal value of the shares issued has been recorded as a merger
reserve. Also in 2003 the preference shares in LCL have been redeemed and £104.0m has been transferred to the profit and loss reserve. LCL is now 
in dissolution.
In addition to the placing, during the year 163,407 ordinary shares were issued in connection with the executive share option schemes, 18,303 were issued in
connection with the Cobham Savings Related Share Option Scheme and 138,836 were issued in connection with the Cobham Long Term Incentive Plan. The
aggregate nominal value of such shares was £0.1m and the cash consideration received net of costs was £1.1m. In addition £1.2m was transferred from other
reserves to called up share capital and share premium account in relation to the Cobham Long Term Incentive Plan.

Fair value adjustments
Revaluations
The adjustments to tangible fixed assets and stocks represent the write-off of assets that had no economic benefit. The adjustment to creditors reflects
additional losses on contracts and development costs not previously recognised.
Accounting policies
The adjustment in respect of tangible fixed assets relates to the harmonisation of depreciation rates in line with group policy.The adjustment to intangible
fixed assets reflects the write off of items in line with group policy. The adjustment to stocks represents amendments to stock obsolescence provisions to align
them with group policy. The adjustment to creditors and provisions reflects adjustments to warranty provisions offset by the deferred tax impacts of the fair
value adjustments made. The adjustment to the pension asset/(liability) represents the impact of accounting for the acquired defined benefit schemes in line
with the group’s accounting policy for pensions.

Set out below are the narrative disclosures relating to financial instruments. The numerical disclosures are set out in notes 31 to 34. The group has taken
advantage of the exemption available under FRS 13 “Derivatives and other financial instruments” not to provide numerical disclosures in relation to short term
debtors and creditors, other than currency risk disclosures.
Financial instruments
The group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and borrowings. The group does not use complex derivative financial instruments.Where
it does use financial instruments these are mainly to manage the currency risks arising from normal operations and to raise finance for the group’s operations.
The group’s financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, cash and various items such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise
directly from its operations. The group also uses forward foreign currency contracts to manage transactional currency risks arising from the group’s operations
and interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risks.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the group’s policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Foreign currency risk is the most significant aspect for the group in the area of financial instruments. It is exposed to a lesser extent to other risks such as
interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. The policies have
remained unchanged throughout the year.
Foreign currency risk
The group, which is based in the UK and reports in sterling, has significant investment in overseas operations in the USA, with further investments in other EU
countries, Australia, Canada, South Africa and Asia. As a result, the group’s balance sheet can be affected by movements in these countries’ exchange rates. The
group’s policy is to reduce, or eliminate where practicable, both structural and transactional foreign exchange risk. Where significant, currency denominated
net assets are partially hedged by currency borrowings. Currency exposures are reviewed regularly and all significant foreign exchange transactions are
approved by the parent company.
The pound/US dollar exchange rate is the most important as far as Cobham is concerned, particularly given the level of US dollars which the subsidiaries expect
to receive from their normal business activities. In addition to the longer term borrowing structure, a number of financial instruments are used to manage the
foreign exchange position, such as forward contracts. The most significant of these instruments is a foreign exchange contract, which was entered into in 1997,
whereby the group has agreed to exchange dollars for sterling at a rate of £1: US$1.6263 over the period to 2012 with US$82m of this commitment being
outstanding at 31 December 2003. Approximately US$13m of the commitment applies to 2004, US$53m from 2005 to 2008 with the balance of US$16m
over the remaining four years. It is the group’s current belief that the net dollar receipts from its subsidiaries will exceed the level of the outstanding
commitment.
The group also has transactional currency exposures. Such exposures arise from sales and purchases by operating units in currencies other than the unit’s
functional currency. The group’s policy is to minimise trading in subsidiaries’ non operating currencies. However, where this is impractical the group will seek
to reduce its exposure through the use of forward contracts.
The group does not hedge balance sheet and profit and loss translation exposures. Generally, borrowings are arranged in local currencies to provide a natural
hedge against overseas assets.
Interest rate risk
The group has various long and short term borrowings, principally in sterling and US dollars, at fixed and floating rates of interest. The group is continually
monitoring its exposure to movements in interest rates in order to bring greater stability and certainty with respect to borrowing costs. Group policy is to
assess borrowings with regard to fixed or variable rates of interest depending on prevailing market conditions, including instances where interest rate swaps
are used.
Surplus funds are placed on short term deposit. These deposits have floating rates of interest, and thus there is some modest exposure to interest rates.
Liquidity risk
The group has a strong cash flow and where practicable the funds generated by operating companies are managed on a regional basis. For short term working
capital purposes in the UK, most operating companies utilise local bank facilities within an overall group arrangement. In the USA a central treasury function
is maintained which all US subsidiaries use. These practices allow a balance to be maintained between continuity of funding, security and flexibility.
As regards liquidity, the group’s policy has throughout the year been to maintain a mix of short, medium and long term borrowings with their lenders. The
private placement of Cobham guaranteed senior notes which raised US$225m in October 2002 enabled the group to reduce short term and increase long
term borrowings. Short term flexibility is achieved by overdraft facilities. Details of the year end position, which is in accordance with this policy, are given in
note 33. It is, in addition, the group’s policy to maintain undrawn committed borrowing facilities in order to provide flexibility in the management of the
group’s liquidity; details are also given in note 33.

Hedges of foreign currency transactions

matched, the group recognises all gains and losses on these in the period in which they are incurred.

All the group’s short term creditors (other than borrowings) are excluded from the above tables either due to the exemption granted to short term items or
because they do not meet the definition of a financial liability. In addition provisions for liabilities and charges of £23.3m (2002 - £23.3m) and long term
creditors of £5.7m (2002 - £8.4m) have been excluded as they do not meet the definition of a financial liability under FRS 13.
In order to reflect the associated interest rate swap, the US dollar senior notes issued in 2002 have been classified as floating rate financial liabilities. The 2002
comparatives have been restated to reflect this classification.

34 Fair values
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities
The following table provides a comparison by category of the carrying amounts and the fair values of the group’s financial assets and liabilities. Fair value is
the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm’s length transaction between informed and willing parties, other than a forced or
liquidation sale, and excludes accrued interest. Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values. Where market values are not available,
fair values have been calculated by discounting expected cash flows at prevailing interest and exchange rates. For floating rate loans, fair values closely
approximate to cost.

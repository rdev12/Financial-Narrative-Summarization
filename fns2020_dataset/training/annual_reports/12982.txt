DIRECTORS’ REPORT: CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
– Overview of 2009 –
Rank has delivered strong growth
in earnings in 2009. As a
consequence, the board has
recommended a resumption
of dividend payments.
Peter Johnson
Chairman
a change in culture, allying broader retail
expertise to our strong understanding
of the gaming market and its
regulatory framework.
Since 2008, Rank has appointed new
managing directors in its three largest
businesses. Each has an operational
background in either leisure retail or
online retail.
In June 2009, Mark V Jones, an
experienced operator of pubs and
restaurants, joined us as managing
director of Mecca Bingo to lead the
transformation of that business.
Reflecting this cultural shift, Rank
has started to build a reputation for
innovation in the development,
refinement and deployment of new
concepts and new customer experiences
in leisure, based around gaming.
In 2009, the Group stepped up the
pace of expansion for its proven G Casino
format. By the end of the year, the
G Casino brand had grown from six to
ten casinos, with each delivering levels of
customer visits and revenue significantly
higher than the average across the
remainder of the estate.
The year also saw the launch of
the Mecca ‘Full House’ club concepts.
The first Mecca ‘Full House Destination’
opened in Nottingham in May 2009,
offering a new style of gaming-based
social entertainment, aimed principally
at women. The early performance of the
club has been encouraging and we have
A year of progress
O
ver the course of the year,
Rank delivered a total return
to shareholders of 22.6% as
the stock market responded
positively to the Group’s
revenue growth, the effectiveness of
its cost control measures and further
substantial reductions in net debt and
financial leverage.
Operating successfully
At the heart of Rank’s strategy to achieve
long-term growth in earnings per share
is a focus on reaching out to a wider
customer base, extending both the reach
and the relevance of our businesses.
In order to achieve this, the board
recognised that it needed to bring about

Shares in Rank have under-performed the FTSE 350 in
recent years as the effect of negative legislative changes
to the taxation and operation of land-based gaming
businesses in Britain caused the market to reduce
forecast earnings for the Group.
Between 2007 and 2009, Rank grew adjusted earnings
per share by 20.3% as the Group stabilised its operating
performance and achieved substantial reductions in
net debt.
As part of management’s response to the difficult trading
conditions, Rank suspended payment of dividends in 2007.
Following a review of the Group’s capital structure, the
board has recommended the resumption of dividend
payments from May 2010. THE RANK GROUP PLC: ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2009 5
now developed two additional sites under
the format.
At the same time, the Group achieved
much closer integration between its
online and land-based gaming brands,
exploiting opportunities for revenue and
cost synergies.
Operating responsibly
The benefits of the Group’s actions are
reflected not simply in its financial
performance but also in forward-looking
measures which indicate the success
of our businesses in engaging
with both customers and
employees. During the
year, the Group
achieved increases in
satisfaction and
engagement scores
from both customers
and employees.
The ability of our
businesses to delight
and entertain their
customers in a safe and
social environment is
fundamental to our strategy.
Within this framework, the
Group recognises its responsibility
to minimise the incidence of any
negative issues, particularly around
problem gambling.
Whilst we are continually seeking
improvement, we are nevertheless proud
of our record with regard to
understanding, managing and mitigating
problem gambling. For example, in
2008/9, of the 22,691 incidences of
underage gambling in Britain reported by
the Gambling Commission, only seven
(or 0.03%) took place in our premises.
We recognise too that we have a
responsibility to our shareholders, to our
employees and to our customers to
engage fully with regulators and
governments to help shape a supportive
and responsible operating environment
for our businesses.
We have recently set out a
new vision for the British
gaming industry, based
around the principles of
fairness, responsibility
and sustainability. This
forms the basis for the
Group’s future
engagement with the
Gambling
Commission, the
Government and the
wider political
establishment, our peer
companies and other
interested parties.
Capital structure and
dividend policy
During 2009, the Group carried out
a review of its capital structure and
dividend policy, against a background
of operational improvements, significant
growth in earnings per share and a
sustained reduction in net debt. As a
result of this review, Rank intends to
adjust its capital structure to target a level
of around 2.5 times net debt to EBITDA
over the medium term.
In addition, the board has determined
to recommend a resumption of dividend
payments, beginning with a 1.35p per
share final dividend for 2009. The dividend
will be paid on 5 May 2010 to shareholders
on the register at 6 April 2010.
We plan to adopt a progressive
dividend policy, taking into
consideration the Group’s capital
investment requirements and the stability
of the wider operating and economic
environment. Within this context, the
board intends to set dividends such that
Rank achieves a dividend cover of around
3.0 times over the medium term.
Outlook
While the board is pleased with
the progress achieved during 2009,
opportunities and challenges lie ahead.
The current year is forecast to be a period
of gradual, if fragile, economic recovery
in the UK, Rank’s key market (see market
review, page 7), whilst the outcome of the
forthcoming general election is likely to
influence the regulatory and tax landscape
for gaming and betting in Britain.
Rank’s primary focus remains on
delivering service excellence to our
customers as a means of generating value
for our shareholders. The board believes
that the quality of Rank’s customer
propositions, its standards of service and
insight and the in-depth strength of its
management team give the Group
a platform for sustainable growth.

Total shareholder return overview
Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) measures
the combined benefit to shareholders
from any equity investment based upon
share price appreciation and distributions,
such as dividends.
For Rank, it is an important measure
of shareholder value, benchmarking
investor return from Rank shares with the
yield available from other investments.
Between 2007 and 2009, Rank’s TSR
under-performed the FTSE 350 index
of shares. This was due in large part to
a ‘perfect storm’ of negative changes to
the legislation, regulation and taxation
of Britain’s land-based gaming sector.
During 2009, shares in Rank
delivered a much improved TSR as a
result of management actions and as
the UK equities market strengthened.

update see:

We have progressed by taking
a single-minded approach
to improving the customer
experience in each
of our businesses.

A resilient performance
DIRECTORS’ REPORT: CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Ian Burke
Chiefexecutive
Summary of results
D
uring 2009, the Group
achieved 21.9% growth in
adjusted earnings per share,
despite the effects of the
global economic recession.
This resulted largely from an improved
operational performance and lower
ﬁnancing costs which offset higher
UK gaming taxes.
Group revenue grew by 3.4% to
£540.0m, reﬂecting the contribution
from new casinos and bingo clubs and
a 0.8% like-for-like increase. Operating
proﬁt of £58.0m was 3.8% lower than
in 2008 as increases in UK gaming
taxation introduced in HM Government’s
2009 Budget outweighed the beneﬁt
of a temporary reduction in the standard
rate of VAT.
Taxation accounted for more than
50% of operating cost increases in the

year. Excluding the effects of tax changes,
foreign exchange movements and
changes to our estate of bingo clubs and
casinos, the Group maintained operating
costs in line with 2008 levels.
Across the Group, our businesses
served a total number of 2.4 million
customers, representing a 4.4% increase
over the prior year. Customer visits
(land-based only) of 22.1 million were
slightly ahead of 2008 levels.
Our two largest businesses, Grosvenor
Casinos and Mecca Bingo, each delivered
revenue growth. In Grosvenor Casinos,
this performance was driven by a
signiﬁcant increase in both active
customers and customer visits; in Mecca
Bingo, growth in average spend per visit
offset a modest decline in customer visits.
Grosvenor Casinos grew operating
proﬁt by 19.3% to £30.9m, even after
incurring £1.3m in additional taxation
on player-to-player card room games.
Despite the growth in revenue, operating
proﬁt of £32.3m from Mecca Bingo was
14.8% lower than in 2008, largely as a
result of increased taxation.
Top Rank España grew revenue by
1.1%, beneﬁting from the strength of the
euro against Sterling. In euros, revenue
declined by 8.9%, with customer visits
and spend per visit both down as Spain’s
severe economic conditions continued to
impact trading. Operating proﬁt declined
by 18.8% to £5.6m.
Revenue from Rank Interactive
declined by 3.4% to £50.8m with
continued growth from meccabingo.com
outweighed by lower revenue from sports
betting, casino and poker. Operating
proﬁt of £7.5m was in line with 2008,
principally as a result of reduced
marketing expenditure.
Central costs of £18.3m were slightly
higher than in 2008 due to an increase in
share-based payments.
Current trading
During the eight weeks to 21 February
2010, the Group grew revenue by 11%
and like-for-like revenue by 5%.

main driver of growth with like-for-like
revenue up 14% on increased customer
visits and an above-average win margin
in our London casinos.
Like-for-like revenue from Mecca
Bingo declined by 3% as a result of lower
customer visits. This performance was
adversely affected by the unusually
cold weather at the start of January.

A – The gambling
market –
The global economic recession
impacted gaming and betting in
2009. This section assesses the
prospects for gaming in Rank’s
main geographic markets.
THE RANK GROUP PLC: ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2009 7
State of play
Great Britain
W
ith annual revenues in
excess of £11bn, Britain
is one of the largest
gaming and betting
markets in Europe.
Nevertheless, in 2009, the economic
recession caused a 2.5% contraction in
industry-wide revenues, according to
estimates from Keynote Research.
Within this picture, certain sectors
are likely to have fared better than others.
National Lottery operator, Camelot,
delivered steady revenue growth in the
year; the prevalence of internet-based
gambling continued to increase; and a
number of operators (including Rank)
reported improvements in gaming
machine revenue. However, some
traditional land-based activities, such
as over-the-counter sports betting and
bingo played in bingo clubs, appeared
to decline.
Regulatory changes
The major regulatory changes in 2009
focused on revisions to amusement
machine regulations. Britain’s bingo clubs
were perhaps the biggest beneﬁciaries
of the changes with a doubling of the
maximum allocation of Category B3
machines and an increase in stakes
and prizes on Category C machines
(unrestricted in bingo clubs and
amusement arcades).
Separately there were a number
of changes to gaming taxation in the
Budget (see tax fact ﬁle, page 38), which
negatively impacted bingo clubs and
certain casinos.
Economic outlook
At the end of 2009, Britain emerged from
economic recession. Muted growth in
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) during
the ﬁnal quarter of 2009 broke a trend
of six consecutive quarters of decline.

The Economic Intelligence Unit forecasts
that the economy will grow by 2.4% in
2010 and 2.6% in 2011. Unemployment
is forecast to peak at 9.1% during
2011 and with the national debt at
record levels and interest rates forecast
to rise over time, economists fear that
economic recovery is likely to be gradual
and fragile.
Spain
Despite the effects of economic depression,
the Spanish gambling market remains one
of the largest in Europe.
In 2008 Spanish gaming generated
revenues of €5.2bn, according to
Datamonitor. This was expected to dip
in 2009 as the Spanish economy declined
by 4.8%. The national unemployment rate
more than doubled between 2007 and
2009 and at 18.2% is at present one of the
highest in Europe.
According to the most recently
available data from the Comisión
Nacional del Juego (CNJ), the overall
gambling market grew revenue slightly
during 2008, although casinos and bingo
clubs experienced declines.
Economic outlook
According to the Economic Intelligence
Unit, the economy will begin to grow
again in 2010, whilst unemployment is
forecast to peak at 19.8% during 2010.
The route to economic recovery for Spain
is forecast to be a long and gradual one.
Belgium
According to Datamonitor, the Belgian
gambling market generated revenues of
€958.7m in 2008. Of this, the country’s
nine casinos generated €116.0m or 12.1%
of the total. Whilst overall gambling
revenues were expected to dip in 2009, the
market is forecast to grow again from 2010.
Economic outlook
According to the Economist Intelligence
Unit, the Belgian economy will return to
growth during 2010 whilst unemployment
is forecast to peak at 9.5% in the year
before gradually recovering in 2011
and 2012.

For risks and uncertainties
which could impact our
strategy see:
p.14-15
Risks
– Customer engagement
(i) The effect of macro-economic conditions
on consumer conﬁdence may lead to a
decline in customer visits and spending.
(ii) The failure of our businesses to provide
engaging and valuable experiences may result
in a decline in customer visits and spending.
– Competitive threats
The attractiveness of Rank’s businesses may
be undermined by superior or better value
propositions from competitors. 
– Loss of licence
Serious breach of gambling regulations may
result in the partial or complete loss of Rank’s
licences to operate.
– Financing and taxation
(i) Absence of or withdrawal of ﬁnancing
facilities adequate to meet the Group’s
requirements. 
(ii) Signiﬁcant increases in the cost of ﬁnancing.
(iii) Reversal of rulings on VAT reclaims.
– Taxation
Increases in gaming taxation may damage
the Group’s proﬁtability.
During 2009, HM Treasury announced plans
for the reform of taxation for gaming
machines. If implemented, Treasury’s
proposals may result in an increase in tax
costs for Rank.
– Regulation
Given the politicised nature of gambling
market governance, Rank’s operations may
be at risk from adverse changes in regulations,
such as restrictions to advertise or to offer
certain games.

advantage in the markets where
they operate.
As a result of our investment in
enhanced management information
systems and the creation of insight
teams, we have gained a deeper
understanding of consumer motivation.
Everything that we do – from the
development of concepts like G Casino and
Mecca ‘Full House’ to everyday operational
improvements – is built around qualitative
and quantitative research into customer
preferences and behaviours.
Product and service
improvements
Electronic gaming
Progress – Across the Group we have made
improvements to the quality of both the
product and the service levels applied to
electronic gaming. In 2009, we introduced
amusements service teams into Mecca
Bingo, increased the number of Category
B3 ‘jackpot’ machines deployed across the
Group from 727 to 991 and continued to
invest in server-based gaming technology.
Priorities – During 2010, we will continue
to invest in the quality of our electronic
gaming product, with particular focus on
upgrading gaming machines and electronic
roulette in our British casinos and
introducing enhanced electronic bingo
and video bingo terminals in Mecca Bingo.
Food and drink
Progress – We have made substantial
improvements to both the quality of
our food and drink and the manner of
its delivery. In 16 Mecca Bingo clubs we
replaced servery-style catering with cook-
to-order meals; and in six of these clubs
we introduced waiter table service. In these
clubs we have seen improvements in
average spend per visit on food and drink.
Priorities – We will continue to invest in
the quality of the dining and drinking
experience in our bingo clubs and
casinos. In particular, we will extend
cook-to-order and table service to at least
another 30 Mecca clubs.
Entertainment
Progress – We have introduced a number
of industry-leading innovations to make
our customer experiences more
entertaining. In Mecca ‘Full House’ clubs
we fused music with gaming to create
After Dark Binglo and Rock and Roll Bingo
– both of which have been instrumental
in helping these clubs to reach out to a
broader range of customers and extend
operational hours.
Priorities – During 2010, we will expand
Mecca’s After Dark suite of branded late
night games, adding poker, quizzes and
other forms of entertainment.
Accessibility
Progress – We have continued to seek
ways to make the customer experience
more ﬂexible and to generate more value
from our venues. During the year, we
offered 24-hour opening in 17 of our
British casinos and we gained licensing
approval to do likewise in the remainder
of the estate. The move has proved
popular with customers and has been a
driver of incremental revenue and proﬁt.
Priorities – During 2010, we will extend
24-hour opening to a number of additional
casinos and seek to gain extended opening
hours for our bingo clubs in tandem with
the roll-out of our After Dark brand and
our enhanced amusement machines offer.
Customer rewards
Progress – During 2009, we extended our
Play Points customer rewards programme
to a total of eight of our Grosvenor Casinos
and G Casinos, following tests in 2008.
At 31 December 2009, more than 75,000
customers were members of Play Points,
and in excess of £0.4m worth of rewards
had been redeemed via the programme.
Play Points provides us with extensive
empirical data regarding spending and
behavioural patterns, enables us to
target our marketing expenditure more
efﬁciently and has proved popular with
customers. In the clubs where Play Points
has been introduced we have experienced
enhanced levels of operating performance
and higher net promoter scores.
Priorities – During 2010, we will
introduce Play Points to a further
ten casinos at a combined cost of
approximately £2.0m. We are continuing
to assess opportunities to extend this
approach to player rewards across the
Group’s businesses.
Key performance indicators
Ultimately, we believe that the success of
our insight-led approach to business will
be reﬂected in growth in customers and
customer visits, which will in turn give
rise to enhanced earnings per share. 
During 2009, total Group customer visits
of 22.1 million was slightly ahead of 2008,
following a number of years of decline.
As a forward-looking indicator, we
use the net promoter score system to
assess our effectiveness in meeting and
exceeding customer expectations. Net
promoter score tracks the net propensity
of our customers to recommend (or
otherwise) our businesses to their friends.
It is based upon quarterly feedback from
more than 12,000 customers and the
results form a key component of how
our management teams are rewarded.
Net promoter score

Mecca Bingo 30.1% 38.6% 45.0%

* Net promoter score for Top Rank España was not
measured in 2009; it will be measured from 2010
onwards. The lower target for 2010 reﬂects
this circumstance.
Note: net promoter scores are derived by subtracting
negative (‘detractor’) customer feedback scores from
positive (‘promoter’) scores.

Our core market
Great Britain is Rank’s principal market.
Our bingo clubs and casinos in England,
Scotland and Wales account for more
than 80% of Group revenue and
operating proﬁt (before central costs). In
addition, the majority of Rank Interactive’s
customers are based in Britain.
Despite the volatility of recent years,
our core market has provided a relatively
stable environment for gaming and
betting by comparison with many other
jurisdictions around the world. This is
built upon the following characteristics: 
• Cultural acceptance – Regulated gaming
and betting have a long history within
Britain and there is a widespread
cultural acceptance of the individual’s
right to ‘have a ﬂutter’ as a means of
entertainment. According to the 2007
Gambling Prevalence Survey, 68% of
British adults participate in at least one
form of gaming or betting.
• Cautiously enlightened regulation –
British governments have in general
adopted a cautiously enlightened
approach to the regulation of gambling.
While at times overly conservative
operating restrictions have held back
development, they have also prevented
over-supply and the regulatory volatility
witnessed in certain other jurisdictions. 
• Opportunity to integrate with
mainstream leisure – Britain’s willingness
to modernise regulations in line with
changing social attitudes is in itself a
catalyst for controlled growth. Over
time, the rescinding of some of the
more repressive gaming regulations
(e.g. permitting casino advertising
and customer rewards programmes,
withdrawing the 24-hour cooling-off
periods for bingo club and casino
membership) has gradually allowed
the industry to move from the margins
towards the mainstream of leisure retail.
Selective investment 
During 2009, Rank’s capital investment
programme totalled £34.3m, roughly half
of which was deployed in expanding the
Group’s reach or developing new concepts.
The majority of this investment was
focused on our two largest businesses,
Grosvenor Casinos and Mecca Bingo.
In both businesses we have used
customer insight to deﬁne innovative
modern leisure venues – G Casino and
Mecca ‘Full House’ – delivered within the
scope of the licensing regime for gaming
in Britain.
We have budgeted to invest between
£40.0m and £45.0m of capital in 2010,
with a large part directed towards the
expansion and enhancement of our
British land-based gaming businesses. 
G Casino 
G Casino combines traditional casino
gaming with good quality food and
drink, entertainment and community
games such as card room poker offered in
large and high proﬁle venues. Launched
in Manchester in 2006, the G Casino
brand had grown to ten casinos by the
end of 2009. G Casino’s success in
reaching out to a broader base of British
adult consumers is reﬂected in average
levels of weekly customer visits more
than 50% higher than the average for
a provincial casino in Britain.
During the year, we added four new
casinos to the G Casino estate at a cost
of £12.8m (see table above).
During the current year, we will open
at least two G Casinos, converting the
Grosvenor Casinos at Brighton and
Newcastle-upon-Tyne.
Our target is to have built a portfolio
of 20 G Casinos in Britain by the end
of 2012, developing new casinos and
re-branding existing casinos to the
G Casino format. Despite the cap on
casino licences in Britain, we have
ample scope to develop our business
beyond this medium-term target, with
12 non-operating (unutilised) casino
licences and the opportunity to upgrade
or relocate a large number of our existing
casinos. 
Electric Casino
As announced previously, we are
developing a number of smaller format
casinos for those locations which do not
yet support investment in a full
G Casino. These formats will typically
generate a higher proportion of revenue
from electronic gaming and require
lower levels of capital and operating
expenditure than G Casinos.
In July 2009 we launched
the Grosvenor Electric Casino, a fully
electronic gaming venue co-located
with our traditional Grosvenor Casino
in Leeds. Capital investment in the
casino was £0.3m.
We plan to develop six of our
12 non-operating casino licences under
similar smaller formats. 
Mecca ‘Full House’ 
During 2009, Rank launched the Mecca
‘Full House’ concepts with the ambition
of offering female-friendly gaming-based
entertainment within the framework of
the bingo licensing regime.
Mecca ‘Full House Destination’
clubs combine affordable social gaming
(e.g. bingo) with good value food and
drink, live entertainment, After Dark
events and an extensive electronic
gaming offer. 
The format is designed to appeal 
to bingo players and non-bingo players
alike, accommodating the key strengths
of bingo within a modern leisure venue.
The ﬁrst ‘Full House Destination’ club
was opened in Beeston, Nottingham in
May 2009 after a £5.0m investment.
New to the G Casino estate in 2009
Bolton – conversion from Grosvenor Casino to G Casino – April 2009
Capital investment £1.3m
Coventry – acquisition and conversion to G Casino – April and September 2009
Capital investment £1.7m to acquire and convert

p.22-23 12 THE RANK GROUP PLC: ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2009
A DIRECTORS’ REPORT: STRATEGY CONTINUED
Trading to date has been encouraging,
with average weekly customer visits two-
thirds higher than the estate average for
Mecca Bingo.
In December 2009, an existing Mecca
Bingo club at Catford in London was
converted to the Full House Destination
format at a cost of £1.0m.
In January 2010, we re-opened our
club in Oldbury, West Midlands following
a £1.6m conversion to the Full House
Destination format; and in April we will
complete a similar project at Aberdeen.
We will determine the further roll-out
of this format based upon the success
of the Catford, Oldbury and Aberdeen
conversions but estimate that
approximately 50% of our Mecca Bingo
clubs may in time be suitable.
For the remainder of the estate,
we developed Mecca ‘Full House Local’,
targeted at the traditional bingo market
and based around product and service
improvements supported by modest
capital investment.
In December 2009, we converted our
Eltham Hill and Hackney Road clubs in
London to the Full House Local concept,
following a combined investment of
£0.5m. Early results in both clubs have
been encouraging and we plan to convert
our Chester club to the format in the
ﬁrst half of 2010.
Rank Interactive
During 2009, the Group’s remote gaming
business (previously reported under our
Blue Square sports betting brand) was
renamed Rank Interactive. The move
signalled a shift in focus for our strategy
in remote gaming and betting, with a
greater emphasis on leveraging our brand
strengths in bingo and casino games. 
In April, we carried out a major
redevelopment of meccabingo.com and
in September we launched gcasino.com
to support the G Casino brand building
strategy. During the year, 46% of Rank
Interactive’s marketing expenditure
supported its bingo and casino websites,
a signiﬁcantly higher proportion than
in previous years. 
Of particular note was the launch
of a TV advertising campaign for
meccabingo.com, which was aired
during October and November.
As a consequence of these actions,
we generated signiﬁcant revenue growth
from meccabingo.com, while online casino
revenue returned to growth in the ﬁnal
quarter of the year after seven consecutive
quarters of year-on-year decline.
During the current year, we
will maintain brand support for
meccabingo.com including a second
TV advertising campaign. In addition,
we will continue to support
gcasino.com, migrating customers from
grosvenorcasinos.co.uk and continuing
our in-club marketing campaign. In the
second half of the year, we will launch
poker on gcasino.com, leveraging the
strength of our land-based card
room business. 
Overseas development
Rank has an established track record
operating land-based gaming businesses
outside Britain, through our bingo clubs
in Spain and our casinos in Belgium. As
part of the Group’s strategic development,
we aim to expand the scale of our overseas
operations over the medium term, opening
up wider growth opportunities and
gradually redistributing the Group’s
regulatory and economic risk weighting.
In the near term, we see overseas
growth potential for Rank Interactive
with opportunities to enter other
European markets as governments
establish regulatory frameworks for
remote betting and gaming.
Our priority market is Spain,
which is moving gradually towards the
establishment of a regulated regime for
online gaming. Our position in Spain,
where we have operated as a gaming
company since 1994, gives us a sound
understanding of the market and would
provide a ﬁrm base upon which to
develop an online business.
The Group remains interested
in expanding its land-based gaming
operations within Europe. However, in
the immediate term our focus will be on
stabilising Top Rank España where severe
economic conditions and the threat of
a full smoking ban present challenges.

Work positively with governments and regulators
3
Positive engagement
Gaming is generally subject to a far
higher degree of regulation and political
inﬂuence than other sectors of the
leisure industry. 
Rank recognises that it has a
responsibility to its shareholders, employees
and customers to maintain an active and
open programme of engagement with
regulators, governments and other
interested parties in order to promote
fairness, responsibility and sustainability.
Despite a heightened programme
of engagement in 2009, the year brought
mixed results for Rank with positive
regulatory developments undermined by
generally negative changes to taxation.
Regulation
Britain
During the year, Mecca Bingo beneﬁted
from a number of progressive changes
to gaming machine entitlements for
licensed bingo clubs, following a
campaign by Rank and the Bingo
Association.
In February, the maximum number
of Category B3 machines permitted in
bingo clubs was increased from four to
eight; and in June the maximum stakes
and prizes on Category C machines were
raised from 50p to £1 and from £35 to
£70 respectively. 
Rank estimates that the aggregate
beneﬁt of these changes was approximately
£3.0m in revenue on an annualised basis.
Spain
In October, changes to gaming machine
regulations in the autonomous region of
Madrid (where Rank operates three bingo
clubs) allowed licensed bingo clubs to
offer an expanded range of gaming
machines. Under the new system, the
maximum jackpot available on machines
in these clubs increased from €120
to €18,000.
Taxation
Britain
In April 2009, regressive new regimes
of taxation were brought into effect
for bingo played in licensed clubs and
card room games played in casinos.
The rate of bingo duty was increased
from 15% to 22%; card room games
such as poker and mah jong (previously
subject to VAT at the standard rate) were
brought into the casino gaming duty
regime at rates of up to 50%. 
In aggregate the changes resulted in
£5.7m of unbudgeted taxation costs for
Rank in 2009. 
Following lobbying from Rank and
the Bingo Association, HM Government
agreed to ameliorate the tax increase on
bingo to 20% from the time of the 2010
Budget. The Conservative Party, Liberal
Democrats and Scottish National Party
have all called for the rate to be
reduced further.
The net full-year effect of all the
changes is estimated to be approximately.
Spain
In January 2010, the bingo clubs trade
association, the Confederación Española
de Organizaciones de Empresarios del
Juego del Bingo (CEJ) achieved a modest
reduction in bingo duty in the autonomous
region of Catalonia (where Rank operates
ﬁve clubs). Rank estimates that the change
will beneﬁt Top Rank España’s annual
operating proﬁt by approximately €0.6m.
Responsibility, fairness
and sustainability
We accept that our right to operate
gaming and betting businesses comes with
certain responsibilities; and we understand
that our long-term commercial success
rests on how society perceives the value
of what we contribute to the communities
within which we operate.
We believe that our contribution
to society is overwhelmingly positive,
through the enjoyment we give to our
customers and the wide economic
beneﬁts that arise from our operations.
We are also proud of our record with
regard to upholding the principles of the
Gambling Act – to protect young people
and the vulnerable, to keep crime out and
to ensure fairness.
We have a vision for the gaming
industry, involving operators, regulators
and governments, and built around
three principles:
• Responsibility – for all parties to act
with consideration for the welfare
of customers, employees and the
wider communities;
• Fairness – fairness and transparency
should be fundamental to the way that
gaming and betting businesses are run,
regulated and taxed;
• Sustainability – any industry’s ability to
contribute to society via job creation and
tax generation requires an environment
where long-term commercial success and
stability are encouraged.
These principles form the basis for Rank’s
engagement with the governments and
regulators in Britain, Spain and Belgium.
Taxation – fair, 
simple, sustainable
As part of this approach, Rank has
published ‘Responsible taxation: Fairness,
Simplicity, Sustainability’, calling for a
comprehensive review of the taxation
system for betting and gaming in the UK.
Under the Group’s proposals, the current
patchwork regime of taxation would be
replaced by a single rate of duty for all
activities governed by the Gambling Act. 
We consider that this system offers
a number of beneﬁts in terms of the
economy, social policy and the
safeguarding of employment in the
British gaming and betting industry. 
Fairness – removal of arbitrary
distinctions, particularly those which
penalise UK-domiciled companies and
beneﬁt offshore companies;
Economic contribution – generates
greater and more sustainable revenues
for the Exchequer and stimulates job
creation in Britain;
Lower administration costs – less onerous
to administer, enabling both gaming
companies and HM Revenue and
Customs to achieve cost savings;
Support social policy – achieves
alignment with the aims of the Gambling
Act by ending the current discrimination
against those forms of betting and
gaming which offer the highest levels
of customer protection. 
In Spain, Rank is supporting the CEJ
in making a similar submission, calling for
online gambling to be made subject to the
country’s regulatory and tax frameworks
and the harmonisation of taxation across
all forms of gaming and betting. 14 THE RANK GROUP PLC: ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2009
Effective risk management
A DIRECTORS’ REPORT: RISK MANAGEMENT
T
he Group has established
procedures to identify, evaluate
and manage signiﬁcant risks
and to monitor performance.
This framework is reviewed
annually and is designed to safeguard
the value of shareholders’ investments
and the Group’s assets, while ensuring
that proper accounting records are
maintained. The senior management
team is responsible for making sure that
controls and procedures are enforced and
that the board is informed of any risks
and control issues that arise.
For more information on our
risk management processes, see:
p.46
Area Speciﬁc risks/threats
Taxation (i) Reversal of rulings on VAT reclaims:
During 2008, Rank received from HMRC £59.1m relating to
overpaid VAT. Rank’s claim has been upheld both in tribunal and
the High Court. However, HMRC continues to appeal the case.
In the event that Rank were to lose a subsequent appeal (the case
goes before the Court of Appeal in April 2010), the Group would
be required to pay back to HMRC the consideration plus interest.
(ii) Increases in gaming taxation:
Since 2007, Rank’s earnings have been negatively impacted by
successive increases in UK gaming taxation, with particular regard
to casino games, bingo and player-to-player card room games.
During 2009, HM Treasury launched a consultation into reform
of taxation for gaming machines. If implemented, Treasury’s
proposals could result in an increase in tax costs for Rank.
Regulation (i) Negative regulatory reform:
Given the politicised nature of gambling market governance,
Rank’s operations may be at risk from adverse changes in
regulations, such as restrictions on advertising or on offering
certain games.
(ii) Loss of licence:
Serious breach of gambling regulations may result in the partial
or complete loss of Rank’s licences to operate.
Financing (i) Absence of or withdrawal of ﬁnancing facilities adequate
to meet the Group’s requirements.
(ii) Signiﬁcant increases in the cost of ﬁnancing.
Consumer
engagement
Competitive
threats
(i) The effect of macro-economic conditions on consumer
conﬁdence may lead to a decline in customer visits and spending.
(ii) The failure of our businesses to provide engaging and
valuable experiences may result in a decline in customer visits
and spending.
The attractiveness of Rank’s businesses, to customers, employees
and other stakeholders, may be undermined by superior or better
value propositions from direct and indirect competitors.
  THE RANK GROUP PLC: ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2009 15
Potential impact on KPIs Mitigation
(i) Requirement to repay VAT reclaims would have a negative
impact on Group basic and adjusted earnings per share. Whilst
the Group forecasts that it would remain comfortably within
banking covenants, it would increase ﬁnancial gearing and
may potentially limit Rank’s ability to invest in its businesses.
(ii) Further increases in gaming taxation would have a negative
impact on Group operating proﬁt and earnings per share.
Investment in the Group’s businesses may be adversely affected,
which would thus restrict growth. In addition, if Rank is forced
to pass on the effect of tax rises to customers, Group net
promoter score may suffer too.
(i) Rank continues to press its claims for overpaid VAT, supported
by legal counsel and the tax advisory team at Deloitte.
(ii) Rank has set out an agenda for ﬁscal reform which would
see Britain’s complicated system of gambling taxes replaced by
a single rate of duty (see page 13). The Group seeks to engage
with HM Treasury, shadow Treasury teams, MPs and the gaming
and betting industry to discuss how a fairer, simpler and more
sustainable regime might be implemented.
(i) The introduction of regressive gambling regulations may
negatively impact the customer’s experience and thus affect
net promoter scores. It is likely that this in turn would affect
customer visits, spend per visit, revenue, operating proﬁt and
earnings per share. They may also impair the attractiveness
of future investment in business expansion.
(ii) Loss of a licence to operate would affect each of Rank’s
ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial KPIs.
(i) Rank is setting forward an agenda for the regulation
of Britain’s betting and gaming industry, based around
responsibility, fairness and sustainability. To support this,
Rank maintains an active programme of engagement with
DCMS, shadow DCMS teams, MPs, trade bodies and other
interested parties.
(ii) Rank aims to maintain the highest standards of operation.
The Group has a strong track record of regulatory compliance
and conducts an extensive programme of engagement with
the Gambling Commission and other interested parties, such
as GamCare.
(i) Inadequate funding would restrict the Group’s ability to
support the growth strategies of its businesses and thus affect
customer numbers, customer visits, revenue, operating proﬁt
and earnings per share.
(ii) At present, nearly all of the Group’s debt is ﬂoating rate.
Signiﬁcant increases in ﬁnancing costs would affect earnings
per share.
Rank’s banking facilities are agreed until April 2012. The Group
maintains a programme of active engagement with its banking
syndicate. In addition, the success of the Group’s efforts to
reduce net debt and ﬁnancial leverage and its tight capital
control mitigates risk on reﬁnancing.
Consumer weakness or consumer indifference have a negative
effect on most of the Group KPIs, including net promoter score,
active customers, customer visits, spend per visit, revenue,
operating proﬁt and earnings per share. These conditions would
also impair the attractiveness of our business expansion plans.
The Group invests in a broad programme of customer
insight research to identify ways to improve the attractiveness
of our customer propositions and to forecast the effects of
macro-economic conditions. Mitigation may take the form
of actions to support revenues as well as actions to control
costs in challenging conditions.
It is likely that increased competition would negatively affect
all of Rank’s KPIs.
Although the highly regulated nature of gaming does
provide certain barriers to direct competitive intrusion, it
does not protect against the impact of indirect competition
(e.g. television, internet). The Group invests in a broad
programme of customer insight research to develop ways to
improve the attractiveness of our customer propositions and
to identify new competitive threats.   Step inside for so much more...

Bingo clubs – Great Britain
Licensed bingo clubs first appeared
in Britain’s communities in 1961 and
today bingo remains an important
social pastime, particularly for women.
According to the 2007 British Gambling
Prevalence Survey, one in ten British
women (or 7% of all British adults)
played in bingo clubs between 2006
and 2007.
Bingo itself is a pari-mutuel lottery-
style game where customers can compete
for high prizes (Mecca Bingo has paid out
jackpots of £1 million) with low stakes.
In addition, clubs typically incorporate
large amusement machine arcades and
licensed bars and restaurants.
Customers are required to be 18 years
or older in order to play in a bingo club
and the sector has a strong record for
responsible gaming (see ‘Responsible
operation’ above).
–Industryoverview–
Licensed bingo clubs have
been in existence in Great Britain
for almost half a century.
They provide a fun and sociable
form of gaming, targeted
principally at women.

During the 12 months to February
2010, the number of bingo clubs operating
in Britain declined by 4.7% to 564 clubs as
substantial tax increases contributed to the
closure of 29 clubs.
The only full bingo club to be opened
in the year was Rank’s new Mecca
Full House Destination club at Beeston
in Nottingham.
Gala Bingo closed ten clubs during
the year and Top Ten Bingo closed eight.
Over the same period, there was some
growth in micro-bingo clubs, largely
electronic high street businesses offering
automated bingo and gaming machines.
At present, these are excluded from the
Gambling Commission’s analysis of the
bingo clubs market.
The most recently available data from
the Gambling Commission shows that
licensed bingo clubs in Britain generated
£523m of revenue from games of bingo
and £214m from amusement machines in
the year to 31 March 2009.

Spain
Licensed bingo clubs first appeared in
Spain following the legalization of gaming
in 1977. Today, bingo is the fourth biggest
form of gaming in Spain, after gaming
machines, lotteries and scratchcards.
The most recently available data on
the Spanish gaming market is drawn from
the 2008/9 report from the country’s
gambling regulator, the Comisión
Nacional del Juego.
The report shows bingo revenues
declined by 7.3% to €1.3bn in 2008.
The number of bingo clubs operating fell
by 1.4% to 419 clubs by the end of 2008.
Responsibility for the taxation and
regulation of gaming and betting in
Spain is devolved to the country’s 19
autonomous authorities, under the
guidance of the national Ministry of
Finance and Ministry of the Interior.
The new
Mecca Full House
Destination club
at Beeston in
Nottingham was
the only full-scale
bingo club to
open in 2009.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT: BINGO A
M
ecca Bingo delivered
a positive revenue
performance in the year
although operating profit
was lower than in 2008,
largely as a result of changes in taxation.
Revenue of £233.0m was 2.4% higher
than in 2008, although this was due in
large part to the change in bingo taxation
which had the effect of magnifying
revenue and reducing operating profit.
On a like-for-like basis, revenue was in
line with 2008.
Operating profit of £32.3m was
14.8% lower than in 2008, due in large
part to the increase in bingo taxation,
which cost £4.4m in the year and to the
non-recurrence of a £2.1m VAT refund
(received in 2008).
Mecca Bingo added one club to its
estate, the new Mecca ‘Full House
Destination’ club at Beeston in
Nottingham. At 31 December 2009,
Mecca Bingo operated 103 licensed bingo
clubs across Britain, comprising more
than 13,000 electronic gaming positions.
A 2.8% reduction in customer visits
(a 3.6% reduction on a like-for-like basis)
represented a lower rate of decline than
in 2007 and 2008. During the year, the
business served more than 881,000
customers, 1.9% fewer than in 2008.
Like-for-like spend per visit increased
by 5.0% principally as a result of the
improved performance from the
business’s amusement machines.
Priorities
• Mecca Full House Destination format
to be extended to a total of four clubs
by April 2010
• Continued investment in electronic
gaming – product, service
and environment
• Continued development of customer
rewards programme
• Extension of cook-to-order food to
at least a further 30 clubs and further
trials of table service
• Target 45% net promoter score in 2010

A record of responsibility
The sector is subject to a number
of restrictive regulations, particularly
with regard to the provision of gaming
machines. As a consequence, fewer than
1% of Britain’s total number of gaming
machines are located within casinos.
However, Gambling Commission data
suggests that Britain’s casinos offer higher
levels of customer protection than most
other gaming venues.

Data from the Gambling Commission
shows that customer visits to casinos
have increased steadily over recent years
as progressive changes to gaming
regulations (such as the removal of the
24-hour ‘cooling-off’ period for new
customers) and investment in larger
premises and wider amenities have
stimulated growth.

Our corporate
responsibility strategy
Our corporate responsibility (CR) strategy
focuses on five key areas, namely:
• Our customers – providing safe, fun,
enjoyable experiences for the many
while working hard to protect the
vulnerable few;
• Our people – providing a positive
working environment;
• Our natural environment – being
energy-efficient and reducing waste;
• Our suppliers – treating contractors
and suppliers fairly; and
• Our communities – targeting support
to make a difference.
The chief executive sets direction in
relation to CR issues and governance
thereof is managed through the
company secretary.
By operating responsibly we aim to
achieve sustainable growth and long-term
shareholder value:

our Group Strategy see:

•prevent gambling from being a source
of crime or disorder, being associated
with crime or disorder or being used
to support crime; and
•ensure that gambling is conducted in
a fair and open way.
The most recent British Gambling
Prevalence Survey (2007) shows that
difficulties with gambling affect a very
small percentage of people. Nonetheless,
Rank Group has a clear social and moral
obligation to assist players who may be
vulnerable to gambling difficulties. The
survey found that the incidence of
problem gambling in the adult
population was about 0.6% (a maximum
of 284,000 adults) – roughly the same
percentage as in 1999. This is on a par
with Sweden, Canada and New Zealand
and lower, for example, than the USA
(3.5%) or Hong Kong (5.3%).
Grosvenor and G Casinos achieved
accreditation from the Gambling
Commission following a successful
inspection of our responsible gambling
procedures, and all Rank’s UK-facing
businesses, (Mecca Bingo, Grosvenor
Casinos and Rank Interactive), have been
accredited to the GamCare standard for
responsible gambling operators.
Responsible gambling: management
and training
Responsible gambling is a high priority for
Rank and our policy and performance are
regularly reviewed by senior management.
This includes twice-yearly reviews by
the Rank board and the audit committee,
and quarterly reviews by Rank’s
responsible gambling committee and
our anti-money laundering group. This
year, we refreshed and re-delivered our
industry-leading responsible gambling
Our stakeholders
Rank listens and responds to opinions
and concerns and we actively engage
with our customers, employees,
shareholders, local communities,
government and regulators, Non-
Governmental Organizations (NGOs),
media and other key stakeholders. In
turn, Rank has a responsibility to raise
awareness of matters affecting the
business – a current example being our
public engagement on the issue of
gaming taxation (see page 13).
Our economic impacts
Rank contributes to the economy in
various ways. These include employment
opportunities (we had 8,957 employees as
at 31 December 2009, of which 8,170 are
in the UK, and we paid wages and salaries
amounting to £147.9m). We also
contribute to the economy through
business placed with suppliers (£130m
annual procurement spend) and taxes
(£146.8m paid in 2009).
In addition, we play a positive role
in people’s social lives and the life of
communities through our presence in
towns and cities throughout the UK. Our
103 bingo clubs and 35 casinos provide
safe leisure environments for a wide range
of customers to enjoy.
Our customers
Responsible gambling
Through our responsible gambling policy,
Rank is committed to upholding the
licensing objectives of the Gambling
Act 2005, which are to:
•protect children and other vulnerable
persons from being harmed or exploited
by gambling;

Introduce responsible gambling We introduced a computer-based assessment to the retail
assessments for all customer-facing businesses in February 2009. More than 3,500
employees in the UK employees have now been assessed for their
understanding of our policies as part of a programme
that will continue throughout 2010.
Implement a new community Each of our casinos adopted a local
investment strategy for charity and collectively raised over £71,000.
Grosvenor Casinos
We will continue to progress our
CR programme in the year ahead,
focusing on:
•Our customers – upholding the well-
established policies and procedures that
underpin our reputation as a responsible,
ethical operator so as to provide safe and
enjoyable experiences for our customers;
•Our people – continuing to implement
our comprehensive Group people plan,
including establishing a diversity forum
to review and strengthen how we
promote workforce diversity; and
•Our natural environment – managing
our environmental impacts effectively;
•Our suppliers – achieving value in the
procurement of goods and services while
maintaining business continuity and
managing risk; and
•Our communities – maintaining our
commitment to charities on a national
and local level. This includes the goal of
raising £200,000 for Marie Curie Cancer
Care, the national charity partner for
Mecca Bingo, G Casinos and Rank
Interactive; and Grosvenor Casinos will
continue to raise funds for their chosen
local charities in 2010. 32 THE RANK GROUP PLC: ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2009

face introduction so that first-time visitors
in particular can feel comfortable in the
casino environment and that customers
understand the games before they play.
Rank is vigilant in combating crime.
We have comprehensive anti-money
laundering procedures in place and are
able to exclude customers and potential
customers who could interfere with the
general enjoyment of our facilities. This
exclusion also applies to those people
who have been found to be involved in
criminal activity or are underage. We
encourage our employees to report any
suspected malpractice.
Online security is also a priority
and Rank Interactive has implemented
Payment Card Industry standards for card
transactions, which will further increase
data integrity. Online players’ accounts are
password protected, with the details
encrypted, and in addition we run daily
reports to look for any suspicious activity.
Satisfying our customers
We continuously listen to and act on
both positive and negative feedback
in order to provide the best possible
customer experience and in 2009 we saw
positive trends in our net promoter score
(NPS) and retention rates. We will
continue to drive service levels helped by
a clear understanding of what matters to
our customers. A number of initiatives are
helping us to maintain this insight:
• we have started to test an instant
customer feedback, a process for
ensuring customer views are fed rapidly
back to management;
• we carry out continuous customer
research including NPS surveys
exclude themselves from gambling or set
up spending limits, display information
to help customers identify the signs
of a problem and find support, and
highlight the Gambling Commission’s
gambleaware.co.uk address on our UK
businesses’ print advertising.
Rank Interactive continuously updates
and enhances its technologies, including
using sophisticated verification procedures
to identify and exclude underage users.
We also provide tools to reduce the risk
of problem gambling: users can set
themselves affordable budget limits and/
or temporarily or permanently exclude
themselves from online play. Rank Group’s
funding for GamCare is adding to the
charity’s capacity to provide support
services online. These include NetLine,
launched in 2007, online chat room
sessions and a self-help forum.
Security, fair play and combating crime
People’s safety and security is our top
priority, whether they are customers
coming to our clubs or our employees.
Rank promotes open and transparent
gaming, helped by a number of measures
including digital closed circuit television
covering gaming tables – which are also
overseen by our experienced gaming
supervisors – and clear ‘how to play’
guides available in our casinos. This year
we also developed the role of our
Grosvenor and G Casinos supervisors to
refocus on the customer when delivering
table games and other elements of the
casino experience. Our training for
employees in the new customer support
role is designed to ensure that customers
are offered a friendly, jargon-free, face-to-
training module to 360 managers across
the Group.
Wetrainallland-basedcustomer-facing
employees in our responsible gambling
policy. This starts with induction training,
which is comprised of three modules of
computer-based training on ‘knowing
your customer’ to help our people
recognise behaviours associated with
problem play; a total of 5,440 people
have completed this training since its
introduction. In addition, our people are
required to show that they understand
and can act on our policies on an ongoing
basis so all employees complete an
assessment on the second anniversary of
their initial training and then every two
years thereafter. In 2009, 4,380 customer-
facing employees of Grosvenor Casinos
and Mecca Bingo went through this
assessment. Any employee failing has
to repeat the training until the required
standard is achieved. The assessment
process will continue throughout 2010
with an ongoing review of content to
ensure it reflects latest developments in
the field.
Rank provides specific training
for managers on methods for engaging
potentialat-riskcustomersin‘intervention’
conversations designed to help the
individuals concerned. This training is
continuous, with 170 managers going
through the programme in 2009 and a
further 180 scheduled for 2010.
Protecting vulnerable customers
As well as the measures described
above, where appropriate, we carry out
proof-of-age checks at supervised entry
points, support customers who wish to

  Supporting research, education and treatment
Rank is a founding supporter of GamCare, the UK’s national centre for information, advice
and practical help regarding the social impact of gambling. GamCare reports that more
problem gamblers are receiving help than ever before. As a measure of effectiveness, 88% of
GamCare clients were assessed by the charity as being problem gamblers and this went down
to 15% following treatment. However, the Gambling Commission’s 2007 research suggested
that less than 1% of people who could benefit from treatment actually take it up. GamCare
recognises that there is still much to be done and Rank is committed to supporting its work.
In 2009, Rank contributed £267,000 to gambling support charities including GamCare
through the GREaT Foundation – a level of funding that will continue to 2012 subject to
a limited number of conditions.
Rank was unanimously voted ‘Donor of the Year 2009’ in GREaT’s awards. We were
nominated by an expert panel in recognition of support we have provided, not only
through financial donations but also through extra efforts made to encourage others to
donate and support. THE RANK GROUP PLC: ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2009 33
(benchmarked against the competition
and wider leisure industry), focus groups
and other regular surveys; and
• we introduced brand standards covering
everything from food preparation to
uniforms, which are regularly monitored
through management visits.
Our people
Our people are core to delivering our
vision to put customers at the centre of
our operations. We are committed to
looking after our employees and enabling
them to fulfil their potential. We aim to
provide a fair, equal, respectful and safe
workplace, rewarding and recognising a
job well done. We strive to be an employer
of choice where our people feel proud
to work.
Recruitment and retention
Through the economic recession, the
Group has largely been able to preserve
employment and avoid short time
working, pay cuts and redundancies. This
year we created 350 new jobs in the UK
through new acquisitions and openings.
Employee turnover has decreased year
on year since 2006. Retaining skilled
employees not only avoids unnecessary
attrition costs but also ensures that the
Group is well positioned to take advantage
of improvements in the economic climate.
Developing talent
Developing and attracting management
talent to deliver our strategy and help
take the company forward is a priority
for us. Our talent development
programme, which includes succession
planning, ensures the management
and development of talent within the
Group. We have also invested in the
Mecca Management Academy which
demonstrates the importance we place
on developing future leaders. Through
the human resources team the Group
delivers extensive face-to-face training
for team members at all levels. We
pay particular attention to customer
initiatives, technical training and
skills development.
Promoting a diverse workforce
Diversity is another priority for us and in
2009 we established the diversity steering
group, comprising representatives from
across the Group, to oversee our work
in this area with a particular focus on
gender and ethnicity. Diversity brings
great benefits to the Company and also
helps us understand the needs of a broad
base of customers.
Maintaining health and safety
The health and safety of our employees
is very important to us. The number of
accidents required to be reported to the
Health and Safety Executive under
The Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and
Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 1995
decreased from 23 in 2008 to 21 in 2009.
Any workplace accidents are reviewed
and corrective action and/or training is
implemented to reduce the risk of further
occurrences. Please see page 56 (statutory
information) for Rank’s approach to
health and safety management including
compliance with statutory requirements.
We were proud that our headquarters
in Maidenhead and the Grosvenor
Victoria Casino were awarded a five star
status by the British Safety Council’s
Five Star Health and Safety Management
System Audit. The five star audit is
internationally recognised as one of the
most comprehensive independent audit
measurement systems verifying best
practice in health and safety. Our rating
enables us to apply for the British Safety
Council Sword of Honour for 2010.
In dialogue with our employees
We consult with our employees, listen to
their views and respond to any concerns.
Our employees have access to feedback
channels (including face-to-face, online
and printed communications), employee
councils and consultative committees.
We also canvass opinions through our
rolling quarterly employee engagement
survey. We have seen a generally
improving trend across Rank’s brands
in Britain since we began surveying
employee opinion, regularly achieving
overall engagement results of around
70%, and sometimes above 80%. We score
particularly strongly with employees across
all brands in terms of stability (i.e. the
desire still to be with Rank in a year’s time)
and also satisfaction with the job and the
Company. A high proportion of all
employees say they would recommend
Rank as a “good place to work” and even
more are “happy to go the extra mile”
in their daily work.
Rank compares its employee
engagement results against external
benchmarks, so it knows that its
employees rate it significantly better
than similar organisations in terms of fair
and respectful treatment of the workforce
by managers. Rank also scores highly
on keeping its employees well informed.
Employees’ pride in the Company and
commitment to its goals also come across
very strongly in Rank’s survey results.
The gradual movement to increased numbers of
server-based gaming terminals not only provides
our customers with increased gaming choice but
also delivers a positive environmental benefit in
minimising transport impacts. New games can be
downloaded remotely to the terminals without the
need physically to change or move cabinets, which
has historically been common practice in the
gaming industry.
The Mecca Management Academy
The Academy was established in June
2009 to provide a first-class development
programme customised to our business
and of practical value to Mecca trainee
general managers. The 16-month
programme is tailored specifically to the
requirements of the management role
with a strong focus on leadership, and is
designed to support the delivery of
Mecca’s strategy. On successful
completion of the training, candidates
acquire a recognised qualification – the
Institute of Leadership and Management
(ILM) Certificate in Management. 34 THE RANK GROUP PLC: ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2009
DIRECTORS’ REPORT: OPERATING RESPONSIBLY CONTINUED A
• continued to work towards achieving
The Carbon Trust Standard, which
recognises good practice in the key
areas of measurement, management
and reduction (targeted for summer
2010); and
• verified our previous carbon calculations
to establish a basis for future reporting.
These and other environmental initiatives
are being undertaken to ensure Rank
fulfils its commitments in energy, carbon
and cost efficiency.
Our suppliers
Our strategy is to achieve value for
Rank Group in the procurement of goods
and services while maintaining business
continuity and managing risk. Rank’s
supply chain is predominantly UK-based
and as we continue to develop supply
partnerships with large national
companies we can be confident of their
excellent social, ethical and environmental
credentials. Our annual procurement
spend in 2009 was around £130 million,
with the greatest proportion going towards
food and beverages, utilities and cleaning.
Our communities
Our strategy is to target investment at
both a national and local level – through
our support for a flagship charity with
nationwide coverage that directs support
to where it is needed locally.
In 2009 there was continued success
in raising money for Whizz-Kidz, our
national charity partner supported by
Our natural environment
Our environmental strategy focuses on
energy efficiency as our main priority.
Having established our environment
committee in 2007, we have continued to
take steps to reduce our carbon footprint.
Approximately 90% of our emissions
come from energy use in our buildings
and the remainder from travel and waste
disposal, so we have been working with
The Carbon Trust to improve energy
efficiency and ensure compliance with the
Carbon Reduction Commitment (CRC).
Working with Inenco (an energy
management, sustainability and
environmental consultancy) and
The Carbon Trust, we have carried out
detailed energy surveys in a representative
sample of properties, identifying ways
to save energy and costs with potential
for implementation across our estate.
Recommendations cover energy use in
everything from air conditioning to
catering, and the charging procedures
used for electronic bingo terminals. In
addition to this work, the introduction
of automated gas and electricity meter
reading in Grosvenor Casinos and Mecca
Bingo is providing us with an in-depth
understanding of consumption patterns,
enabling energy use to be analysed on
a daily basis site-by-site. When fully
implemented this will lead to increased
energy efficiency across our estate.
This year we also:
• held seven regional training seminars
on CRC and energy efficiency;
In 2009 Mecca Bingo’s fundraising efforts have
provided more than 60 children with bespoke
mobility equipment. Among them is lively five-year
old Daniel who can now propel himself and join in
with classmates for the very first time on the special
trike provided by Whizz-Kidz. This equipment was
unavailable to Daniel on the NHS and is much more
expensive than a regular trike so Daniel’s parents
decided to apply to Whizz-Kidz. With the help of
funds raised by Mecca Bingo Bradford, Whizz-Kidz
was able to meet their request. As well as being
lots of fun, the trike will assist in Daniel’s physical
development, helping to strengthen his legs and
improve coordination, and all the family are
delighted with the results: “We are all over the
moon! This is the first bike Daniel has been able
to ride by himself and he really loves it!”
Mecca Bingo and Meccabingo.com.
Through the efforts and generosity of
customers and employees, we beat our
fundraising target and raised a total
of £516,000 for Whizz-Kidz this year.
Inventive campaigns were key to this
success including:
• Mobiles for Mobility – £7,000 raised
through customers donating old
unwanted phones;
• Currency for Kidz – foreign coin
recycling scheme and
• Heels for Wheels – our shoe recycling
scheme launched by Theresa May MP
and supported by local football teams,
the Wigan Warriors rugby league team
and a number of celebrities who all
donated old shoes.
This year we also worked with the public
sector on two campaigns of benefit to
our customers. First, Mecca Bingo clubs
hosted the Department of Work and
Pensions’ Eyes Down for Extra Cash
roadshows (to generate greater take-up
of entitlements by eligible pensioners
who are also Mecca customers). Second,
NHS Patient roadshows took place in
clubs across England to highlight the
different ways that Mecca customers
can access healthcare services. THE RANK GROUP PLC: ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2009 35

Key results
Group revenue from continuing
operations rose by £17.8m, resulting
from the improvements in Mecca Bingo,
Top Rank España and Grosvenor Casinos,
partially offset by the decrease at
Rank Interactive.
Group operating profit before
exceptional items was £2.3m lower than
in 2008. This was largely driven by the
changes to bingo and poker taxation
(as outlined in the tax fact file on pages
38 to 39) and the impact of the worldwide
economic recession, particularly in Spain.
These have been partially offset by the
benefit from cost saving actions taken in
2008/09 and operational improvements
in a number of areas as outlined in the
business review on pages 18 to 29.
Adjusted net interest payable of
£9.5m was £10.3m lower than in 2008,
which reflects substantially lower interest
rates and lower net debt.
Adjusted Group profit before taxation
and exceptionals of £48.5m was £8.0m
higher than in 2008.
The effective tax rate on adjusted
profit was 29.0% (2008: 29.9%), slightly
below the continuing Group’s anticipated
effective tax rate of 30% to 33% as a result
of prior year adjustments arising in

Exceptional items
In order to give a full understanding
of the Group’s financial performance
and aid comparability between periods,
the Group reports certain items as
exceptional to normal trading.
The key 2009 exceptional items are
detailed below:
2009 2008
£m £m
Mecca Bingo 4.3 40.6
Top Rank España – (8.4)
Grosvenor Casinos (1.5) (2.4)
Rank Interactive – (2.3)

Continuing operations 2.8 (69.4)
Discontinued operations 0.8 15.0
Total* 3.6 (54.4)
* Exceptionals are shown before financing and taxation
Mecca Bingo sold one non-trading
freehold property for £1.5m and the
profit on disposal, net of disposal costs,
totalled £1.4m; HMRC refunded £1.9m in
bingo gross profits tax relating to the
output VAT refund received in 2008 and
£1.0m was released from onerous lease
provisions following an increase in the
risk free discount rate (see note 26).
Grosvenor Casinos impaired a non-
operating casino licence by £1.5m
following a re-evaluation of its planned
use and the associated cash flows.
Exceptional items relating to
discontinued businesses comprise the
release of £5.0m following the expiration
of an environmental warranty given at
the time of sale of Deluxe Film and
£4.2m additional cost in settling the
Paramount legal claim.
Further details on exceptional items,
including 2008 exceptionals, are provided
in note 4 and on impairments in note 12
to the Group ﬁnancial statements.
Disposal provisions
At 31 December 2009, the Group held
£12.4m in provisions for disposed
businesses. These costs predominantly
relate to outstanding insurance claims,
onerous leases and costs of winding up
the tax and legal affairs, where Rank
remains responsible, of former Deluxe
and Hard Rock companies. The timing
and exact amounts of the expenditure
are uncertain as it is taking longer than
originally anticipated to agree the
settlement of remaining liabilities,
particularly in the area of taxation.
The expenditure in the period comprised:
• £1.6m on property related costs;
• £5.7m on settlement of the Paramount
legal claim (including related legal and
professional costs);
• £0.7m on professional support with
tax investigations by a number of
regulatory authorities in Europe and
North America; and
• £0.5m on insurance claims.
A provision was only held for legal
costs on the Paramount claim and an
additional £4.2m charge was made to
increase the amount of the provision up
to the level of the final settlement.
As noted in exceptional items above,
the Group has also released £5.0m of
provisions following the expiry of an
environmental warranty.
Further details are provided in note

the end of December 2008. The net debt
comprised syndicated loan facilities of
£222.0m, £8.9m in fixed rate Yankee
bonds, £12.7m in finance leases and
£7.3m in overdrafts, partially offset by
cash and cash equivalents of £64.1m.
Financial structure
and liquidity
The Group banking facilities comprise a
syndicated £150.0m term loan and
£250.0m multi-currency revolving credit
facility, which were arranged in April 2007
and mature in April 2012. These facilities
require the maintenance of a minimum
ratio of earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to
net interest payable and a maximum ratio
of net debt to EBITDA, both of which are
tested bi-annually at June and December.
The Group fully complied with all
covenants in 2009 and 2008.
In addition, the Group has
uncommitted borrowing facilities of
£28.0m, repayable on demand but which
are available for general use.
In January 2009, the Group repaid
its remaining £158.2m convertible bonds
from cash and existing bank facilities,
without recourse to the capital markets.

balance of the expenditure was on minor
capital works.
Rank Interactive spent £2.2m on
website development and Top Rank
España £0.6m on amusement machines
and electronic gaming.
The only significant capital
commitments and accruals at 31 December
2009 were £3.4m on amusement machine
purchases in Mecca, £0.6m on the
conversion of Sheffield to a G Casino and
£0.9m on completing the conversion of
Mecca Oldbury to the Full House
Destination concept.
In light of the challenging economic
conditions, the Group continues to
maintain strict control over committing
expenditure to capital projects. Although

to the 2010 G Casino conversions at
Newcastle and Brighton and the Mecca
Full House conversions at Aberdeen and
Oldbury are not affected by this policy.
Financial risk
The Group’s financial risk management
strategy focuses on the minimisation of
risks for the Group. The Group’s funding,
foreign exchange, liquidity, counterparty
and interest rate risks are managed by
the Group’s treasury department in
accordance with approved policies and
are subject to internal audit review. All
significant financing transactions and
treasury policies are authorised by the
board of directors. Implementation of
these policies is closely managed by the
finance director and the group treasury
manager. The treasury function is not
run as a profit centre.
The key ﬁnancial risks impacting the
Group are liquidity risk, interest rate risk
and credit risk. In addition, the Group
hedges its material exposures to foreign
currency translation risk through the use
of foreign currency borrowings.
i) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that cash may
not be available to pay obligations when
they fall due. Quarterly cash flow
forecasts are prepared that identify the
requirements of the Group and these are
regularly updated to ensure sufficient
financial headroom exists for at least
12 months. This is coupled with a
regular review of medium-term funding
requirements which, in particular, are
updated alongside the Group’s strategic
plan process. The Group negotiated new
medium-term facilities in 2007, as noted
above, which mitigate the liquidity risk
it may face.
ii) Interest rate risk
The Group primarily finances itself
through syndicated bank facilities
and the public debt market. The bank
facilities are multi-currency although
borrowings are typically drawn in Sterling
and euros at floating interest rates. The
Group currently has only $14.3m of public
bonds outstanding, which mature in
2018. The Group normally uses interest
rate swaps, caps and collars to manage
its exposure to interest rate fluctuations
and at the end of December 9% of the
Group’s borrowings were at fixed rates.
Group policy is to maintain between 40%
and 60% of its borrowing at fixed rates.
The current low interest rates combined
with the high cost of moving to fixed
rates have led the Group to operate
outside this policy for the time being.
iii) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty
may not be able to settle amounts
owing in full, when due. Surplus cash
is invested in short-term financial
instruments using a limited number of
financial institutions with strong credit
ratings. Counterparty credit ratings are
reviewed regularly and credit limits set
to avoid significant concentration of risk
with any one counterparty.
Going concern
In adopting the going concern basis
for preparing the financial statements
the directors have considered the issues
impacting the Group during 2009 as
detailed in the business review above
and have reviewed the Group’s projected
compliance with its banking covenants
detailed above. Based on the Group’s
cash flow forecasts and operating
budgets, and assuming that trading
does not deteriorate considerably from
current levels, the directors believe that
the Group will generate sufficient cash
to meet its requirements for at least the
next 12 months and comply with its
banking covenants. Accordingly, the
adoption of the going concern basis
remains appropriate.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT: TAX FACT FILE B
38 THE RANK GROUP PLC: ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2009
G
reat Britain is Rank’s principal
market. Our bingo clubs and
casinos in England, Scotland
and Wales account for more
than 80% of Group revenue
and operating profit (before central costs).
The Group’s businesses generated
£146.8m (2008: £150.2m) for the
Exchequer and local government in
VAT, gaming taxes, income tax, National
Insurancecontributions and local
business rates. The broader impact of
Rank’s operations, including taxes paid
by supplier companies and the economic
consequences of providing employment
to more than 7,000 people in the UK, is
harder to quantify but no less significant.
In 2009, the amount of VAT and
gambling duties generated by Mecca Bingo
and Grosvenor Casinos was 5% lower than
in 2008, while aggregate revenue from the
two businesses (excluding the two Belgian
casinos) rose by 4%. We paid 22% of our
gross revenue across to central government
in VAT and gaming taxes (2008: 24%).
The marginal reduction results from the
temporary lower rate of VAT and bingo
income no longer being liable to VAT.
Changes to gaming taxation
During 2009 there were a number of
changes to UK gaming taxation, with
increases for bingo, casino card room
games (e.g. poker) and gaming machines.
The rate for bingo was increased from
15% to 22% and the application of VAT
was rescinded (see details on Linneweber
claims below). The net effect of these two
changes caused an increase in taxation
for the licensed bingo clubs industry.
After intensive lobbying by the Bingo
Association, HM Treasury announced in
its 2009 Pre-Budget Report that it would
amend the rate to 20% from the time of
the 2010 Budget.
The other change in the 2009 Budget
was the inclusion of card room games
within the casino gaming duty regime
and the removal of VAT. This change
meant that in some cases the taxation
of card room games migrated from a 15%
rate of VAT to a 50% rate of gaming duty.
Lastly, the rates of Amusement
Machine Licence Duty (‘AMLD’) were
increased by approximately 9%. Rates
of gaming taxation at February 2010
are shown in the table on page 39.
Gaming taxes in 2010
In addition to the changes to gaming
taxation in 2009, HM Treasury consulted
on a “tax neutral” restructuring of the duty
regime for gaming machines. While no
final decision has yet been announced, the
Governmenthasproposedthereplacement
of AMLD and VAT with a single rate of
duty. Rank participated in the consultation
process, stating that the rate of duty
would need to be set at 15% in order
to achieve neutrality.
In response to the increasingly
volatile nature of the way that the
industry is taxed, Rank has proposed
a root and branch reform of gaming
taxation. In a submission to HM Treasury,
DCMS and the shadow teams, Rank has
proposed that the current patchwork
quilt of gambling taxes be replaced with
a single rate of duty. The submission,
which was prepared with the assistance
of Ernst & Young LLP, suggests that a
single rate of duty would generate more
sustainable income for the Exchequer,
reduce administration costs and provide
greater support for the Government’s
social policies.
Rank’s submissions to HM Treasury
are available from www.rank.com.
Effective tax rate
The Group’s effective corporation tax
rate is 29.0% (2008: 29.9%) based on a
tax charge of £14.0m on adjusted profit
before taxation and exceptionals of
£48.5m. This is lower than the anticipated
effective tax rate of 30% to 33% as a
result of prior year adjustments arising
in the UK and Spain following the
successful resolution of a number of
historical issues. The effective tax rate is
expected to increase to around 30% in
2010. Further details on the taxation
charge are provided in note 6.
Cash tax rate
The Group had a number of tax refunds
in the year, resulting in an effective cash
tax rate of – 8.9% on adjusted profit.
A refund was received in the Netherlands
as a result of the carry-back of losses
which arose on the liquidation of a
subsidiary. Tax refunds were also received
in the UK and US following the successful
resolution of historical issues. The Group
is expected to have a cash tax rate of
around 5% in 2010, excluding any tax
payable on the resolution of a number
of legacy or exceptional issues.
VAT and fiscal neutrality
Rank has submitted a number of claims
to HMRC for overpaid VAT. These claims
have their basis in the European Union’s
principle of fiscal neutrality, which
ensures that similar products and services
are taxed consistently.
The complex nature of UK gambling
taxes (see page 13, ‘Responsible, fair and
sustainable taxation’) has given rise
to a number of instances where the
principle of fiscal neutrality was not
being applied in the taxation of bingo
and amusement machines.
Linneweber
In 2005, the European Court of Justice
(ECJ) ruled that in the case of
Linneweber, the inconsistent application
of VAT to amusement machines,
depending on their location, constituted
a breach of fiscal neutrality. Based upon
this ruling, Rank has submitted a number
of claims for historic VAT paid on
products where exemptions have existed
for similar products.
Interval bingo
Prior to April 2009, HMRC adopted an
inconsistent approach to the taxation of

games of interval bingo with VAT being
applied to some but not all games. Rank
has argued that this constituted a breach
of fiscal neutrality and thus submitted a
claim for VAT paid on revenues from
interval bingo between January 2003 and
December 2005. This claim was updated
to June 2008, at which point Rank,
following a ruling in its favour by the
VAT & Duties Tribunal, elected to stop
paying VAT on interval bingo.
Value of claim: £59.1m plus interest
Status: Tribunal ruling upheld by High
Court; claim paid by HMRC November
2008 and interest of £6.8m paid in July
2009; decision appealed to the Court
of Appeal.
Main stage bingo
Prior to 2009, Rank has argued that the
taxation of main stage bingo also
constituted a breach of fiscal neutrality
and submitted a claim for VAT paid on
revenues from main stage bingo between
2004 and 2008. This claim was updated
to April 2009, at which point bingo
revenues were made exempt from VAT.
Value of claim: up to £16m plus interest
Status: in December 2009, HMRC
announced that rulings on interval bingo
would apply equally to main stage bingo;
Rank has requested payment from HMRC.
Amusement machines
Prior to December 2005, HMRC adopted
an inconsistent approach to the taxation
of amusement machines, with revenue
from certain categories of machine being
subject to VAT while other categories
were exempt. Rank has argued this
constituted a breach of fiscal neutrality
and submitted a claim for VAT paid on
revenues from amusement machines
between 2002 and 2005.
Value of claim: up to £26m plus interest
Status: Tribunal ruling upheld by High
Court; payment requested in January
2010; HMRC has appealed the decision
to the Court of Appeal.
Conde Nast/Fleming
In 1997, HMRC introduced a three-year
retrospective cap on claims for overpaid
VAT. The effectiveness of this cap was
successfully challenged in the courts (the
‘Conde Nast’/’Fleming’ cases). As a result,
Rank was able to re-visit VAT periods up
to December 1996.
Rank has submitted a series of claims
for VAT overpaid, including one for
interval bingo prior to 1996. HMRC has
issued guidance that, subject to
verification of the amount, interval bingo
claims should be paid. Therefore, the
Group expects to receive up to £35m in
2010, plus interest.
VAT claims outlined above. If HMRC
were successful, Rank would be required
to repay the value of the payments
received to date plus interest and HMRC’s
costs. In April 2010, the Court of Appeal
will hear HMRC’s appeal on interval bingo
and amusement machines. Following this
hearing it is possible that these cases will
be appealed to the Supreme Court and
ultimately the European Court of Justice.
Details of the claims are also set out
in note 36 (‘Contingent assets’). The
Group believes that it has a reasonable
chance of success with each claim. The
table below sets out the current position
on the claims (excluding interest).
The potential benefits from other
claims being made under Conde Nast/
Fleming principles cannot at present
be estimated with certainty as they
depend upon the outcome of other
litigation and the validation by HMRC
of certain calculations.
Interest
Rank is also entitled to interest on the
claims above. At present, HMRC pays
simple interest on repayments caused
by its error. However, there is ongoing
litigation that interest should be paid on
a compound basis and Rank has protected
its position with regard to such claims.

HMRC continues to appeal each of the
VAT reclaims

Corporategovernance
DIRECTORS’ REPORT: CORPORATE GOVERNANCE B
This statement explains our governance policies and practices
and how we run the business for the benefit of shareholders.
Our policy is to manage the Company in line with the
principles of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance
(‘the Code’), revised by the Financial Reporting Council (‘FRC’) in
June 2008. We complied fully with the Code throughout the year.
Where appropriate we will consider the recommendations
arising out of the recent Walker Review and the ongoing FRC
review of the Code.
Roles and relationships
Your board
The board consists of:
• A non-executive chairman.
• Four independent non-executive directors.
•Twoexecutivedirectors–thechiefexecutiveandfinancedirector.
We are responsible for:
• Group strategy, objectives and policies.
• General and long-term progress within the political, economic,
environmental and social setting of the day.
• Financial performance, annual budgets and business plans.
• Major capital expenditure, acquisitions and divestments.
• Annual and half-year financial results and interim management
statements.
• Annual audit and monitoring the independence of, and non-
audit services supplied by, the statutory auditors.
• Board committees and their terms of reference.
• Internal controls and risk management.
• Sound governance, health and safety, and environmental policies.
• Board and company secretary appointments.
• Senior management structure, remuneration and succession.
To manage the business successfully on behalf of our
shareholders, we need:
• A trusting and open two-way relationship between the board and
executive management.
• Policies and processes that monitor, control and continually
improve our performance.
• People with the skills to reach our goals.
• A company-wide culture of responsibility and compliance.
The names and biographies of all directors are published on
pages 40 and 41.
Further specific responsibilities are delegated to our four
committees – remuneration, nominations, finance and audit.
They report to the board and operate within defined terms of
reference, which can be obtained from our website or by writing
to the company secretary.
Executive team
Our executive team is not a board committee. It is responsible
for day-to-day trading and is accountable to the chief executive
for promoting and developing a profitable, long-term business.
The team is shown on page 41.
Balance and independence
We believe the board’s size and structure is well balanced,
providing a collective competence to suit the Group’s
developing needs and an appropriate blend of executive and
non-executive skill.
The board considers the chairman and non-executive
directors to be independent and suitably qualified to help steer
– and challenge – Group strategy.

Senior independent director
As senior independent director since May 2006, Richard
Greenhalgh is available to talk with shareholders who have
questions or concerns. He also chairs meetings when non-
executive directors review the performance of the chairman.
Appointment of directors
We have a thorough and transparent procedure for appointing
new directors, supported by the formal terms of reference of the
nominations committee.
The agreed terms and conditions for non-executive directors
comply with the Code and are available for inspection at the
Company’s registered office.
All new directors must stand for election at the first annual
general meeting after their appointment and, thereafter, at
intervals of no more than three years. Non-executive directors
are engaged for an initial period of three years and must stand
for election and re-appointment in the same way.
Board meetings
Board meetings allow for regular and frank discussion on
strategy, trading, financial performance and risk management.
There were eight scheduled meetings during the year and
one additional meeting to discuss a topical issue. Our meeting
in June, held away from our headquarters, was devoted entirely
to strategy.
The board’s committees also met regularly to discharge
their duties.
Attendance
The directors’ attendance at 2009 board and committee
meetings is recorded in the table below.
In exceptional circumstances when a director is unable to
attend a meeting, his comments on briefing papers can be given
in advance to the relevant chairman.

Setting the agenda
A rolling programme of items sets the agenda for board
discussion. This is regularly reviewed and updated to cover
topical issues and developments. Comprehensive briefing
papers on substantive agenda items are circulated at least five
working days before meetings where possible. These contain
detailed background information, so freeing valuable time for
informed debate.
The core business of the board focuses on: strategy; capital
expenditure; responsible operation; gaming industry issues; risk
mitigation; succession planning; and investor relations
feedback. The director of strategy and the managing directors
of Grosvenor, Mecca and Rank Interactive made presentations
to the board at three meetings during 2009.
Board committees and activities
The following committees operate under the auspices of
the board:
• Remuneration
• Nominations
• Finance
• Audit
Details of their membership are set out on page 41. A rolling
agenda and topical items determine the committees’ discussions.
Remuneration
A separate and full remuneration review is published on pages
48 to 54.
Nominations
The nominations committee is responsible for identifying
relevant talent and nominating all board appointments. We
believe it is sensible for the chairman and chief executive to sit
on the committee and be fully involved in the process – except
when their own re-appointment is discussed.
During 2009 the committee met formally on two occasions. It
did not recommend any new board appointments during the year.
Finance
The finance committee is made up of the chairman and the
two executive directors who are authorised to approve capital
expenditure and make financing decisions for the Group.
On behalf of the board, their role includes setting, monitoring
and reporting on:
• Operating plans
• Monthly comparison of operating divisions’ actual financial
performance against budget
• Year-end forecasts.
Action 2009
Having chaired the Group through difficult times into a new phase
of stability, Peter Johnson’s three-year tenure was due to expire
in January 2010. The committee, chaired by Richard Greenhalgh,
agreed that continuity was essential and a further three-year post
was approved.
Board focus 2009: succession planning
Traditionally we have tended to recruit individuals with a gaming
(casino or bingo) background, but this provided a limited pool of
talent. In making external appointments we have looked to the
broader leisure sector to help deliver excellent customer service.
Additionally, the chief executive, HR director and Misura
Consulting undertook an internal talent profile to identify high-
potential managers for the future. This was presented to the board
at its July meeting for discussion and debate. 44 THE RANK GROUP PLC: ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2009
DIRECTORS’ REPORT: CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED B
During the year the committee met formally on 14 occasions.
Audit
A separate and full audit review is published on pages 46 to 47.
Knowledge and performance
Information flow
Assisted by the company secretary, the chairman is responsible
for ensuring that directors receive accurate and timely
information on all relevant matters.
The directors receive a monthly report of current and
forecast trading results and treasury positions, as well as updates
on shareholder views.
We operate an open-door policy between the board and the
executive. Members of the executive also make regular board
presentations to ensure a flow of operational information
reaches the directors in a timely way.
Informal dinners with management have proved an
effective forum for open discussion. There were two in the
year and, at the request of the board, three have been scheduled
for 2010.
Induction
On appointment, new directors attend a comprehensive
induction programme, which includes briefings on the Group’s
trading environment, site visits and meetings with senior
management.
Advice and expertise
All directors have access to the advice and services of the
company secretary and, if required, may take independent advice
and/or professional development at the Company’s expense.
Risk information
The Company’s risk management reporting provides knowledge
of current and emerging risks, trends and opportunities that
may colour strategic decisions.
We communicate with regulators, government, non-
governmental organisations and other bodies who have
opinions about our business, its future and effects.
Action 2009
Approved capital expenditure included:
• Conversion of Mecca Bingo sites in Catford and Oldbury to our
new format, following the successful opening of Mecca Beeston.
• Acquisition of the Isle of Capri casino, Coventry, and its
conversion to a G Casino.
Action 2009
Non-executive directors undertook computer-based training on
problem gambling to find out how Rank trains its people to protect
vulnerable people from harm.
Our management of current and potential risk is explained fully
in the audit review on pages 46 and 47.
Employee engagement
Performance reviews and regular engagement surveys provided
regular insight into our employees’ opinions and their knowledge
of Group business goals. Please see page 33 of our corporate
responsibility report for further information.
Leadership and integrity
We have an employee code of conduct that sets out our values
and principles and guides everyone’s behaviour. Adherence to the
code is important. It upholds our reputation and relationships,
inside and outside the Company.
The audit committee is responsible for monitoring
management reports on employee conduct, including our
whistleblowing programme.
Relations with shareholders
We speak with institutional shareholders and city analysts
through a programme of investor relations and regular meetings
with principal shareholders.
All directors receive reports to keep them in touch with
shareholder opinion. During the year, a total of 52 meetings
of shareholders and city analysts were attended by one or more
of the chairman, chief executive and finance director. Formal
briefings on shareholder opinion are circulated after
presentation of the Company’s interim and annual results.
Listening to stakeholders
Our dialogue with stakeholders informs strategy, risk management
and our corporate responsibility agenda. Among others, we were in
touch with: The Gambling Commission; national charity GamCare;
City analysts; Government; Auditors.
• The Gambling Commission published results of a study into
gaming machines and problem gamblers in 2009. To assist the
regulator’s research, we provided access to some Mecca and
Grosvenor clubs and their customers.
• GamCare highlighted problem gambling among employees
at a conference in the year, advocating that employees should
be advised of where to find impartial debt counselling. We
consequently updated our existing employee policy to include
the advice.
• City analysts remained concerned that increased taxation –
levied on bingo in the April Budget 2009 and now proposed on
gaming machines – undermines our profitability. We lobbied the
Government to reassess its position from April through to the
Pre-Budget Report on 9 December 2009 when the Government
announced a reduction in bingo duty at the next budget.
We continue to lobby them.
Out and about in the business
The non-executive directors made a number of visits to Rank
business sites to gain first-hand knowledge of day-to-day operations. THE RANK GROUP PLC: ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2009 45
Board evaluation
The board makes sure that the chairman has enough time
to devote to his job. During the year we were unanimously
satisfied that Peter Johnson’s other commitments had no
material impact on the execution of his duties.
To monitor overall board performance, we use
questionnaires between the chairman and each director to
evaluate individuals, the committees and the board as a whole.
The chairman’s performance is evaluated through a
confidential questionnaire, completed by all non-executive
and executive directors. The non-executive directors held their
annual meeting to appraise the chairman’s effectiveness in
January 2010.
At least once a year, the chairman holds a meeting solely
with non-executive directors to consider the performance of
executive directors. This meeting took place in January 2010.
We have reviewed the questionnaire reports and are
agreed that:
• The board functioned effectively during 2009.
• Its committees continued to discharge their duties in line
with their respective terms of reference.

Accountabilityandaudit
DIRECTORS’ REPORT: ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT B
Role of the audit committee
This accountability and audit review has been prepared on
behalf of the board by the audit committee.
The committee’s duties include assessing the integrity of
all public financial statements before their submission to the
board, ensuring we present a fair assessment of the Group’s
ongoing position and prospects.
Any changes in accounting policies are authorised by the
committee, which also reviews the objectivity and effectiveness
of our external auditors every year.
The committee additionally oversees the Company’s
internal code of conduct and monitors our whistle-blowing
programme through which employees may – in confidence –
raise concerns about possible improprieties in areas of financial
reporting, financial control and other ethical matters.
Membership and meetings
Members of the audit committee are listed on page 41. The
board is satisfied that, taken as a whole, the committee has
recent and relevant financial experience.
The chairman, chief executive, finance director, company
secretary and financial controller normally attend committee
meetings, as do the external auditors.
The committee met formally three times in the year. Its
terms of reference are available from the Company’s website,
or by writing to the company secretary.
Culture and environment
We oversee a culture of strong control and risk management.
This is reflected in:
Audit committee activity
In 2009 the committee examined the effectiveness of the Group’s
approach to:
• Assessment of risk – by reviewing evidence of current and
emerging risk.
• Internal control – by approving the internal audit plan and
reviewing its findings, reviewing the annual and interim financial
statements and reviewing the reports of the external auditors.
• Action plans to address any failings or weaknesses of internal
control.
• Action plans to manage significant risks.
This process has been in place during the year and up to the
date of approval of the Annual Report and Financial Statements.
It has been reviewed by the board and meets the Internal Control
Guidance for directors contained within the Combined Code of the
Financial Reporting Council.
• Directors’ methods of enforcing control, some of which were
established through Rank’s historical activities in the USA and
the requirement to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002.
• Management style and philosophy.
• Dedicated teams for compliance and internal audit.
• Rank’s organisational structure and clear lines of
accountability, authority and responsibility.
Compliance
Compliance affects our reputation, legal position and financial
sustainability. We are responsible for compliance across the
Group and for ensuring that all Rank businesses meet local
legal and regulatory requirements.
Compliance with the Gambling Act 2005 (and its
forerunner, the Gaming Act 1968) is fundamental to the
survival of Rank’s businesses, creating a heavily compliant
culture within the Company.
A dedicated compliance team of 17 employees monitors
day-to-day adherence to the provisions of the Act and other
regulatory obligations.
Senior executives, the internal audit team and our external
auditors are responsible for monitoring overall compliance.
They report to the audit committee and the board.
Internal control and risk management
To maintain control and direction over strategic, financial,
operational and compliance issues, the board has put in place
formally defined lines of responsibility and delegation of authority.
Established procedures are geared to identify, evaluate and
manage significant risks and to monitor the Group’s businesses
and performance.
This framework is reviewed annually and is designed to
safeguard shareholders’ investments and the Group’s assets,
while ensuring that proper accounting records are maintained.
Senior management is responsible for making sure that controls
and procedures are enforced and that the board is informed
of any risks and control issues that arise.
Financial control: there is a comprehensive system for
reporting financial results to the board, a budgeting process, an
approved budget and quarterly re-forecasts. The chief executive
and finance director hold monthly review meetings with
managing directors and their respective heads of finance.
Financial reporting control: detailed policies and
procedures are in place to ensure the accuracy and reliability
of financial reporting.
Strategic control: the board reviews the Group’s strategic
plans annually and regularly reviews progress.
Improved information flow
Following 2008’s audit committee evaluation, the committee
resolved to have more dialogue with the Group’s internal audit
function.
The head of internal audit now makes regular presentations to
the committee and reporting includes comparative and trend
analysis.
To embed control further, the scores used by internal audit to
monitor each business unit’s reporting performance are considered
as part of operational executives’ appraisals and, for 2009,
determined part of our casino operational executives’ bonus
payments. From 2010 this will be extended to apply to Mecca
operational executives’ bonus payments.
–Effectivecontrolofthebusiness–
Theauditcommitteeassiststheboard
inreviewingtheintegrityoffinancial
information,reviewingandmaintaining
internalcontrols,andmanagingrisk. THE RANK GROUP PLC: ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2009 47
Operational control: our procedures are laid down in
detailed manuals and reinforced by employee training. Each
business unit carries out a monthly self-audit to test key
controls and report weaknesses to operational management.
Communication control: the executive directors and
senior management meet regularly with representatives from
the businesses to address financial, human resource, risk
management and other control issues.
Our system of internal control is designed to manage rather
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives,
and provides reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material
misstatement or loss. It controls, rather than eliminates, any
human error, deliberate misconduct or unforeseen events.
Risk assessment
Management of risk relies on effective internal controls and
the flow of information from management and the Company’s
internal and external auditors.
The process is reviewed by the audit committee and
monitored regularly by the chief executive, supported by the
company secretary.
At quarterly intervals, senior managers from each business
area are required to:
• Identify the risks to their business plans.
• Evaluate the risks, using likelihood and impact.
• Document the actions being taken to manage those risks.
The company secretary documents the findings and these
are reported to the executive committee every quarter and to
the audit committee once a year.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The table on page 14 summarises our principal risks identified
from management’s most recent internal workshop and during
subsequent risk management discussions, their impact and the
mitigation actions undertaken during 2009.
Information and independence
Internal audit
Our internal audit team provides an objective and continuous
stream of data and opinion on risk management and control.
To avoid bias, it is entirely independent of the business
operations under audit.
The team is responsible for a systematic appraisal of our
adherence to policies and procedures. Its role is to safeguard
Rank’s assets and interests from loss, including fraud, and to
ensure the integrity of financial information.
Relations with external auditors
Our auditors are employed to express an opinion on the truth and
fairness of our financial statements. They review the systems of
internal financial control and the data contained in the financial
statements to the extent necessary to express an opinion.
They discuss with management the reporting of operational
results and the financial position of the Group, and present
findings to the audit committee.
Up to date
The committee is regularly updated on accounting and legislative
changes through briefing papers from the finance director
and others.
We are not aware of any relevant information that has not
been made available to the auditors and each director has taken
steps to be aware of all such information and to ensure it is
available to the Company’s auditors.
The audit committee oversees the nature and amount of any
non-audit work undertaken by the auditors to ensure they remain
independent. Consequently, the committee is required to approve
all non-audit services above the value of £50,000 in advance.
Our policy is to invite competitive tenders when appropriate.
Details of the year’s fees paid to PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP (PwC) are set out in note 3 to the Group financial statements.
When seeking external accountancy advice in relation to non-
audit matters, it is Rank’s policy to balance the need to maintain
auditor independence with the desirability of taking advice
from the leading firm in the area of advice being taken and the
desirability of being efficient (for example, where legacy issues
are involved). The majority of non-audit work in respect of which
PwC was engaged to advise relates to legacy issues arising from
disposed businesses in relation to which either PwC is the leading
firm in the area of advice being taken and/or the audit committee
considered it to be most efficient and appropriate.
Auditor assessment
The committee meets with the auditors twice a year in a closed
session without executive directors to assess the objectivity and
accuracy of financial reporting.
It also reviews the external audit process and the auditor’s
performance at least annually, providing feedback to the auditors
frommanagementassessments.
Auditor appointment
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) has audited the Group’s
accounts since 1996 so the board agreed unanimously that it
was appropriate to put the 2010 audit out to tender. A tender
process was approved in July 2009 and several firms were
invited to take part, including PwC.
Following presentations by two short-listed firms, on the
recommendation of the audit committee, the board is proposing
that Ernst & Young LLP be appointed as auditors at a remuneration
to be agreed by the audit committee. A resolution to that effect
will be put to the forthcoming annual general meeting.
Assurance
The internal audit and external auditors presented their
findings to the committee in February, July and December. We
confirm that action plans to remedy identified weaknesses in
internal control and risk management have been in place
throughout the year.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP’s audit report is published on
page 58.
Committee evaluation
The audit committee’s performance was assessed by questionnaire
to members and other executives who have dealings with the
committee in December 2009. The board concluded that the
committee continues to function effectively.

Remunerationreport
DIRECTORS’ REPORT: GOVERNANCE B
From the chairman of the
remuneration committee
Dear stakeholder
One important duty to our shareholders is to be very clear
about how we reward our most senior people.
Our goal is to run a successful company and to maximise
shareholder value through profit growth, but we can only do
this with qualified, knowledgeable and committed people.
We must attract, retain and motivate a mix of talented
people who can run the day-to-day business and deliver our
strategy and performance targets.
At times of economic pressure, it’s even more vital that
executive remuneration is appropriate and clearly reasoned,
not least because shareholders rightly seek assurance of our
integrity and effectiveness.
In the past three years, the Group has restructured
to secure our long-term future in the gaming market.
Combined with the economic downturn, this has influenced
our performance and, consequently, shareholder returns,
employee pay in general and directors’ emoluments.
In this context, chief executive Ian Burke took the
personal decision to defer a mid-2008 bonus payment and
to recommend to the committee that he have no pay
increase until a review in January 2010. He and finance
director Paddy Gallagher have since recommended that
they should have no pay rise in 2010 as well.
In 2007 the remuneration committee agreed to employ
a new and absolute link between executive performance and
long-term incentive plans. With the help of our independent
advisors, we now use an ‘earnings per share’ target to
calculate performance and additionally take account of the
FTSE 350 ‘total shareholder return’ to decide whether awards
will vest or not.
The key remuneration issues facing the committee in
2009 were as follows:
• Long-term incentives for 2010 and beyond
• Executive pay review 2010
• Design of 2010 bonus scheme
• Long term incentive plan award targets for 2009
We are committed to reporting openly and I invite you
to find out how the board reached its decisions in the
following review.

andexpectationsofourshareholders.
This report has been prepared on behalf of the board by the
remuneration committee, under the chairmanship of our senior
independent director.
In all its dealings, the committee has applied the principles
of good governance as set out in the Combined Code on
Corporate Governance and has complied with Regulation 11
and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and
Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (‘the
Regulations’).
Our external auditors are required to report to shareholders
on the audited information contained at the end of this report
and to state whether, in their opinion, it has been prepared in
accordance with the Regulations.
A resolution to approve this remuneration report will
be proposed at the annual general meeting on 22 April 2010.
A summary of the directors’ total emoluments 2009 is set out
in Table 1, page 53.
Scope and policy
The remuneration committee assists the board in setting the
salary, benefits and employment packages for the Company’s
chairman, executive directors, the executive committee and
others who report to the chief executive.
The committee regularly reviews the Company’s
remuneration policies and practices, as well as the structure and
size of rewards, so that the Company is well placed to employ
people of quality to meet our goals – now and in the future.
Our approach
Our policy is to agree levels of remuneration that attract, retain
and motivate high-calibre executives, without paying more
than necessary.
We believe that a properly set up remuneration committee
is central to establishing policies that maintain this equilibrium.
Committee matters
The names and biographies of all committee members are
published on pages 40 and 41.
The committee met four times during the year to discuss
a rolling agenda of substantive and topical items. There were
no absentees.
By invitation, the chairman, chief executive, human
resources director and the company secretary attend and
contribute to committee meetings, but are not present at
discussions about their own remuneration.
The committee’s formal terms of reference are available on
our website, or by written request to the company secretary. THE RANK GROUP PLC: ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2009 49
External advice
Independent consultants Watson Wyatt (now Towers Watson)
were appointed in 2006 to advise on remuneration issues and
on the granting and vesting of share-based incentive
arrangements. During 2009 they assisted the committee in
devising a new long-term incentive plan for senior executives in
addition to providing general advice to the committee. Watson
Wyatt have not provided any other services to the Group
during 2009.
Pay and benefits for non-executive directors
The chairman and non-executive directors receive fees only and
do not participate in the Company’s bonus, share, pension or
long-term incentive plans.
Fees are set at a level to reflect the time and commitment
they bring to their roles and to attract and retain relevant skills
and experience.
Chairman
The chairman’s fee of £150,000 has not increased since
1 January 2007. He also receives a travel expense allowance
of £10,000.
Non-executive fees
The chairman and executive directors determine fees for non-
executive directors. They are as follows:
• Basic annual fee £38,000
• Audit committee chair £8,500
• Remuneration committee chair £7,500
• Senior independent director £2,500
The directors’ remuneration table on page 53 shows fees
paid during the year to each non-executive director. These have
not increased since January 2006.
2010 non-executive fees
Chairman and non-executive directors’ fee increases for 2010
Committee agenda 2009
• Develop a new executive long-term incentive strategy to
replace the current long-term incentive plan, which expires on
27 April 2010 – taking into account the now closed executive
share option scheme.
• Consider 2010 executive pay reviews – taking account of pay
and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group.
• Determine 2009 LTIP award targets.
• Plan the structure of future performance-related executive
bonus schemes.
were considered at meetings in December, after a report from
our remuneration advisors. It was agreed that there would
be no increases to fees paid to either the chairman or the
non-executive directors, but that the position would be
reviewed in 12 months.
Executive performance and remuneration
Pay and benefits
The committee’s role is to agree levels of pay and benefits for
executive directors that are in the interests of shareholders and
akin to similar-sized companies.
We believe that performance-related pay should make up a
significant element of the executive remuneration package and
that, with executive shareholding requirements, this is the most
appropriate way to motivate and reward people for meeting our
short- and long-term goals.
Remuneration package
Key components of the executive remuneration package are:
• Base salary
• Pension and other benefits
• Annual cash bonus
• Long-term incentives
The following charts show the fixed and variable elements of
the remuneration package for the executive directors in 2010
assuming target bonus and expected value levels of
remuneration are achieved:
1. Base salary
Base salaries are set broadly in line with the market norm
(median levels) and our independent remuneration consultants
provide data on the salary levels of comparator groups, taking
into account our sector, scale and area of operations.

Finance director 2010 target remuneration (%)
Base salary Pension Annual bonus Long-term incentive 50 THE RANK GROUP PLC: ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2009
DIRECTORS’ REPORT: GOVERNANCE CONTINUED B
When agreeing individual base salaries, the committee
considers: comparable salary levels, individual performance,
Group performance and across-the-board employee pay trends.
Base salary is normally reviewed annually and any
increase awarded from 1 January. However, the restructuring
of the Company, combined with the economic downturn, saw
a trading decline in late 2007 and a decision was made to defer
the 2008 review for executive directors and members of the
executive committee.
Following a marked performance upturn during the first
half of 2008, a pay increase was implemented on 1 July 2008,
with the proviso that a further review would not take place
until January 2010.
At his own instigation, chief executive Ian Burke was
excluded from the 1 July 2008 pay review and his next salary
review scheduled to be effective from 1 January 2010. Our
finance director Paddy Gallagher, who joined the Company in
June 2008, was also excluded. Both recommended to the
committee that they receive a nil increase in 2010 and the
committee accepted the recommendation.
2. Pension and other benefits
Directors’ benefits are defined by market levels and include
disability and health insurance, life assurance and a car, or
car allowance.
Additionally:
• Ian Burke receives a Company contribution of 35% of base
salary to his Self-Invested Pension Plan (SIPP).
• Paddy Gallagher received a cash supplement of 15% of
base salary in lieu of pension provision which ceased on
31 March 2009. From 1 April 2009 he joined the Group’s
Stakeholder Pension Plan and now receives a Company
pension contribution of 15% of base salary less the statutory
‘Lower Earnings Limit’.
3. Annual cash bonus
We operate an annual cash bonus scheme to reward executive
directors for successfully achieving strategic goals and stretching
financial targets. A maximum bonus can be triggered by
performance gains significantly in excess of target.

Profitability remained the executive team’s main focus, with
Group operating profit the sole bonus measure for the chief

2010 pay review
In view of the UK economic situation, the board decided that –
with a few exceptions that bring pay into line with the market –
there would be no across-the-board employee increase on
1 January 2010.
The pay freeze includes the chief executive, whose last increase
was 3% in January 2007, and the finance director, who has not had
a pay increase since joining the Company in June 2008.
No bonuses are paid for below target performance and
maximum bonus opportunity is set at a stretching 120% of
target. The outcome for 2009 was achievement of 69.5% and
55.5% of base salary, respectively for each of the chief executive
and finance director. Payments are detailed in the summary of
total directors’ emoluments for the year – Table 1, page 53.
Operational executive committee members have as their
primary measure operating profit targets relating to their
specific business unit. This applies to 75% of the total bonus
opportunity with the balance based on a secondary Group
profit measure. The bonus potential for the executive team
as a whole was 40% of base salary for target achievement, and
80% maximum for reaching stretch targets.
2010 bonus scheme
The committee has reviewed the operation of the current bonus
scheme and concluded that, in the main, it remains appropriate.
However, one amendment to the plan will be incorporated in
2010 to include an element relating to ‘net promoter score’
(‘NPS’). This is an important performance indicator for the
Group’s businesses and, consequently, the committee concluded
it was appropriate for an element of executive director and other
executive committee member bonus entitlement be measured
on the basis of an absolute NPS score. The committee therefore
agreed that:
• Target and maximum bonus parameters would remain at
2009 levels save that, in relation to all executive committee
members with the exception of the Top Rank España
managing director (whose business does not yet measure
NPS), an element (2.5% of target opportunity) would be
measured by reference to NPS on a discrete basis; and
• No bonus would be paid below target and maximum bonus
would remain at 120% of target. In determining appropriate
targets in relation to profit the Company takes into account
consensus market forecasts and its internal operating plan
among other considerations.
4. Long-term incentives
Save-as-you-earn scheme (SAYE)
The SAYE scheme previously offered to all UK employees is now
lapsed, following a board review of regulatory changes in the
accounting treatment of share options. All outstanding options
are unlikely to be exercised.
Executive share option scheme (ESOS)
Our shareholders agreed a board proposal to suspend grants
under the ESOS at the 2007 AGM and, consequently, no grants
were made in 2007, 2008 and 2009.
During the year, the committee considered the earnings
per share (EPS) measures for share option grants made in 2006.
For these to be exercisable, an increase in average EPS over the
three-year performance period had to be in excess of the Retail
Price Index (RPI).
On face value the EPS was sufficient for options to vest.
However, the committee recalculated EPS on the basis of the
Company’s revised capital structure after Rank’s March 2007
share consolidation. On that basis, as the EPS was 40% below
the vesting level, it was decided that the grants should lapse.
The executive directors’ interests in ESOS options are
detailed in Table 2, page 54.
Long-term incentive plans (LTIPs)
2006 LTIP award
Under the terms of the 2006 LTIP, awards to executive directors
and selected senior executives could vest subject to: THE RANK GROUP PLC: ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2009 51
• Average total shareholder return (TSR) against a comparator
group.
• 2% per annum growth in average EPS over a three-year period.
No vesting takes place where performance is below the midpoint
of comparator companies’ TSR. The committee selected the TSR
criterion because of its direct link to shareholder value. The
second, EPS, criterion was to ensure awards would not vest at
a time of unsatisfactory financial performance.
Comparative TSR is measured and monitored by Watson
Wyatt, who track changes in ordinary share prices across the
period and the gross value of dividends, assuming immediate
reinvestment in shares.
The committee reviewed relative TSR performance (as at
31 December 2008) at its February 2009 meeting, agreeing
that no payout was appropriate and that the 2006 LTIP award
would lapse.
TSRranking Vesting
2006 awards 13 out of 14 NIL
2007 LTIP award
In 2007 the board approved an LTIP award of shares of up to
100% of base salary for senior executive directors and agreed a
new performance measure.
The grants could only vest on achievement of targeted EPS
gains over a three- and four-year period, taking into account the
Group’s overall performance against the FTSE-350 TSR index.
The choice of absolute EPS by the committee as the new
primary measure reflects in part Rank’s specialist sector and
few direct competitors, making the selection of a relevant
comparison problematic. The selection of an absolute earnings
measure was also felt as appropriate given the strategic direction
to become purely a gaming business with a strong emphasis on
operational efficiencies.
Following the year end, the committee decided that it would
not be appropriate for any part of the three year 2007 LTIP
award to vest. Whilst, on the basis of the EPS measure alone,
59.6% of the award was due to vest, the committee considered
the Group’s three-year TSR performance, relative to the
FTSE-350, over the same period.
2008 LTIP award
The executive directors and other selected executives were made
an award of shares of up to 100% of base salary in September
2008. The grant is subject to EPS performance over three years
and a review of performance against the FTSE-350 TSR index.
2009 LTIP award
Targets for the 2009 award are set against a number of factors,
as in 2007 and 2008, including analysts’ consensus forecasts for
the Rank Group, current low inflation and the impact of the
2009 Finance Act. The EPS threshold (7.5p) was set ahead of the
market consensus level of 7.1p at the time of grant. Maximum
vesting can be achieved at approximately 20% ahead of
consensus target, which was considered a significant stretch

To agree the new EPS and TSR performance criteria for the purposes
of the 2007 and subsequent awards, the committee sought the
views of major shareholders and institutional investment bodies
such as the Association of British Insurers and Research
Recommendations and Electronic Voting.

2 2010 LTIP
At the 2010 annual general meeting the board will propose
new long-term incentive arrangements to replace the 2005
LTIP which expires in April 2010.
The committee is proposing to replace the 2005 LTIP,
with an umbrella plan (‘the New Plan’) full details of which
are set out in the AGM circular. The New Plan will enable the
committee to provide a variety of awards including shares and
options utilising new, treasury and/or existing shares. The
committee believes the benefits of such an approach are:
• Flexibility to respond to different markets and changing
circumstances by tailoring awards without the need to
introduce new plans.
• Ensuring consistency across plans in provisions such as
good/bad leaver treatment and administrative efficiency.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT: GOVERNANCE CONTINUED B
In summary the changes being made are:
• Introduce a new umbrella plan to give the committee the
flexibility to make awards of shares (conditional, forfeitable or
nil cost), options, including approved options; SARs, payable
in cash and/or shares
• Provide for a maximum award of up to 150% of base salary
(200% in exceptional circumstances) subject to an agreed
exchange ratio to account for the value of different instruments
• Provide flexibility for the committee to determine financial
targets for awards to be made in 2010 onwards.
As the board is of the view that current arrangements are
operating relatively well, initial awards under the New Plan
will be primarily in the form of performance shares.
However, in recognition of the UK tax changes in 2010, the
committee wishes to incorporate an HMRC tax approved share
option plan to grant options, within the tax allowable limit of
£30,000, for each eligible participant. These may form the first
part of awards under the New Plan for eligible participants.
Participants will include executive directors, other executive
committee members and other selected key individuals and the
maximum individual award is unlikely to exceed 100% of
base salary.
EPS will be maintained as the primary performance
condition with the committee taking into account total
shareholder return over the performance period, against the
FTSE-350 when determining vesting.
These proposals have been developed following a full review
of incentive arrangements undertaken by the remuneration
committee and have been subject to consultation with the
Group’s major shareholders.
Terms of appointment
Chairman
Peter Johnson entered a contract with the Company to become
chairman on 1 March 2007, for an initial period of three years.
His appointment was extended for three years with effect from
1 January 2010 (see page 43). Either party can terminate the
appointment on three months’ notice without liability
for compensation.
Non-executive directors
All non-executive directors have letters of appointment with
the Company for an initial three-year term, terminable on three
months’ notice by either party without liability for
compensation. Their dates of appointment are as follows:
Date first appointed
Richard Greenhalgh 1 July 2004
John Warren 1 January 2006
Bill Shannon 3 April 2006
Owen O’Donnell 11 September 2008
Executive directors
The Company’s policy is that executive directors’ contractual
notice periods should normally not exceed 12 months. Ian
Burke and Paddy Gallagher have one-year notice periods.
Any compensation payment made as a consequence of an
executive director leaving the Company is subject to
remuneration committee approval, the terms of the contract
and the reasons for the termination.
Except where stipulated in a contract, severance payments
are usually limited to the payment of un-worked contractual
notice, comprising base salary and a cash payment for fixed
benefits (including pension contributions).
In situations involving breach of the Company’s policies
and dismissal, either a reduced payment or no payment will be
made. Depending on the circumstances, the executive may be
entitled to exercise outstanding share options or long-term
incentive grants, subject to the rules of the relevant plan.
External appointments
Executive directors are permitted to accept one external
appointment in a non-executive capacity and to retain any fees
received, provided there are no conflicts of interest or time. We
recognise that this can broaden the knowledge and experience
of executive directors to the benefit of Rank.
Neither Ian Burke nor Paddy Gallagher currently holds any
non-executive directorships.
Directors’ shareholdings
Chairman
The chairman is expected to acquire a sizeable shareholding in
the Company during the course of his appointment.
Non-executive directors
Until 1 January 2009, non-executive directors were required to
use 30% of their base net fees (after tax) to purchase ordinary
shares in the Company at quarterly intervals. These had to be
retained throughout their tenure of service.
While non-executive directors are no longer required to do
so, at the date of this report all non-executive directors were
continuing to purchase shares in this way.

Periodically, an estimate is made of the awards likely to
vest in future and shares are purchased for that purpose.
Remuneration committee evaluation
The committee’s performance was assessed via confidential
questionnaires with committee members and other individuals
who support its work. Results were then reviewed by the
committee chairman and discussed with the board.
The board agreed that the committee continued to
perform effectively.

Change of control
Our principal loan term and credit facility agreement contains
a provision that, on a change of control of Rank, immediate
repayment can be demanded of all advances and any
accrued interest.
We have arrangements with one employee to provide
compensation for loss of employment in the event of a change
of control at Rank, should no suitable role be offered by a
new owner.
The provisions of the Company’s share schemes and
incentive plans may cause options and awards granted to
employees to vest in the event of a takeover.
A change of control may also affect licences to operate,
as specified in the provisions of the Gambling Act 2005, the
Alderney eGambling Regulations 2009 and the Belgian Games
of Chance Act 1999.
Charitable donations
In 2009 we made, or committed, charitable donations in the
UK of £315k (2008: £264k), of which the largest was £267k
(2008: £258k) to the Responsibility in Gaming Trust (now
known as The GREaT Foundation).

responsibility section of this report, pages 30 to 34. 56 THE RANK GROUP PLC: ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2009
DIRECTORS’ REPORT: STATUTORY INFORMATION CONTINUED B
Political donations
We made no political donations during the year.
Contractual arrangements
We assess and record any risks in our dealings with major
suppliers as part of the Group’s overall risk management process.
Contingency plans are in place to deal with events should key
supply arrangements be terminated without due warning.
Our procurement team also reviews the financial health of
our main suppliers. We have concluded that, while unexpected
termination of any of the Group’s major contractors would be
disruptive, it would not have a severe adverse effect.
Creditor payment policy
The Company and its individual businesses agree terms and
conditions for business transactions with their respective
suppliers. Payments are made to suppliers once they have met
these terms and conditions.
The Company has no trade creditors.
Powers and provisions
Directors’ powers
Subject to legislation, the directors may exercise all the powers
permitted by the Company’s memorandum and articles of
association. A copy of these can be obtained by writing to the
company secretary, or from Companies House.
The articles contain provisions to empower the directors
on certain specific matters, including:
• Appointment of directors, subject to subsequent shareholder
approval.
• Delegation of powers to a director, secretary or committee
of one or more persons.
• The Company’s powers to borrow money.
• The ability of a director to vote on matters in which he has
an interest.
Changes to the Company’s articles of association can only be
made by a resolution passed by a majority of no less than 75%
of shareholders. Shareholder approval will be sought at
the 2010 annual general meeting to adopt new articles of
association in order to update the existing articles, primarily
to reflect the implementation of the remaining provisions of
the Companies Act 2006. Further details are contained in the
explanatory notes to the 2010 annual general meeting circular.
Conflicts of interest
We have a statutory duty to avoid directors’ conflicts of interest.
Our articles of association permit directors to adopt a policy and
procedure for managing and, if appropriate, authorising actual
or potential conflicts of interest.
We review directors’ conflicts of interest at least once a year.
Directors are required to disclose any other new appointments
before agreeing to take them on, so that any conflicts of interest
can be identified and addressed. The board assesses conflicts of
interest before making any new appointments.
Employment policies
We recognise the essential contribution of our employees. Our
policy is to devote a substantial budget to train, develop and
motivate employees and, in particular, to encourage high levels
of employee and customer satisfaction.
Diversity
We believe companies benefit from having a diverse workforce
and we apply equal opportunities policies when recruiting. Our
policy is to provide fair conditions for all employees, regardless
of gender, family status, religion, creed, colour, ethnic origin,
age, disability or sexual orientation.
Health and safety
Safety is as important to the performance of our business as it is
to the well being of our people. We believe that operational
excellence – customer satisfaction and financial strength –
cannot be achieved without safety excellence.
We undertake to demonstrate our commitment to the safety
of our people by promising to:
• uphold safety as the top priority and a core value of our
business;
• maintain an effective safety management system;
• provide visible leadership to promote safety;
• provide the training and tools necessary to perform work
safely; and
• guarantee all employees the freedom and power to demand
safe working conditions, prevent hazards and correct
deficiencies on the job.
The chief executive is the main board director responsible for
health and safety throughout the Group. Rank has in place a
health and safety policy including a statement of intent which
is reviewed and signed by the chief executive on an annual
basis. The policy and associated health and safety arrangements
apply to all Rank’s businesses (UK and overseas). The business
managing directors are responsible for the implementation of
the safety management systems across their individual
businesses. Designated responsible personnel are identified and
responsible for maintaining safety management systems to
ensure legal compliance and reflecting best practice and
advising line management on how to implement such systems.
Satisfactory employee consultation processes are in place
and the board is regularly informed of health and safety issues
and controls.
Financial statements and disclosure
We are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the
Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Financial Statements
of the Group and the Company, in accordance with the law.
To prepare our Financial Statements, we are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and apply them
consistently.
• Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and
prudent.
• Confirm that the Financial Statements comply with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as
adopted by the European Union.
• Prepare the Financial Statements for both the Company
and the Group on the going concern basis, unless it is
appropriate to presume that the Group will not continue
in business, in which case there should be supporting
assumptions or qualifications.
Company law requires us to prepare Financial Statements for
each financial year. The Financial Statements must give a true
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and
the Group and of profit or loss for the period.
We confirm that we have complied with all of the above.
Accounting records
We must keep proper accounting records that disclose with
reasonable accuracy, at any time, the financial position of the
Company and the Group and ensure that the Financial THE RANK GROUP PLC: ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2009 57
Statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply
with the Companies Act 2006 and – for the Group financial
statements – Article 4 of the International Accounting Standard
(IAS) Regulation.
We are also accountable for safeguarding the assets of the
Company and the Group and, therefore, for taking reasonable
steps to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
The maintenance and integrity of Rank’s corporate
website, on which this Annual Report and Financial Statements
are published, is the board’s responsibility. We would draw
attention to the fact that legislation in the UK on the
preparation and publication of Financial Statements may
differ from that in other jurisdictions.
Going concern
The Company’s going concern statement can be found on
page 37.

Respective responsibilities of directors
and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities
Statement set out on pages 56 and 57, the directors are
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our
responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance
with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with
the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for

person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may
come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or
error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent company’s
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates
made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the
financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the
state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at
31 December 2009 and of the Group’s profit, and the Group’s
and parent company’s cash flows for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European
Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of
the Companies Act 2006; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and,
as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the
lAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matters prescribed
by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited
has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 2006;
• the information given in the Directors’ Report for the
financial year for which the financial statements are prepared
is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to
report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report
to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the
parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements and the part of
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by
law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations
we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
• the directors’ statement, set out on page 37, in relation to
going concern; and
• the parts of the Corporate Governance Statement relating
to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of
the June 2008 Combined Code specified for our review.

62 THE RANK GROUP PLC: ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2009
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS C General information
The Rank Group Plc (‘the Company’) and its subsidiaries
(together ‘the Group’) operate gaming and betting services in
Great Britain, Spain and Belgium and provide business services
to gaming operators in a number of additional markets.
The Company is a public limited company which is listed
on the London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and
domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act
2006. The address of its registered office is Statesman House,
Stafferton Way, Maidenhead, Berkshire, SL6 1AY.
Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of
these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These
policies have been consistently applied to all years presented,
unless otherwise stated.
1.1 Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared
under the historical cost convention, as modified by the
revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets and financial
assets and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments)
at fair value through profit or loss.
1.1.1 Statement of compliance
The consolidated financial statements of The Rank Group Plc
have been prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union,
IFRIC Interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable
to companies reporting under IFRS.
1.1.2 Going concern
In adopting the going concern basis for preparing the
consolidated financial statements, the directors have considered
the issues impacting the Group during 2009 as detailed in the
directors’ report on pages 1 to 39 and have reviewed the
Group’s projected compliance with its banking covenants
detailed in the finance review on pages 36 and 37. Based on
the Group’s cash flow forecasts and operating budgets, and
assuming that trading does not deteriorate considerably from
current levels, the directors believe that the Group will generate
sufficient cash to meet its borrowing requirements for at least
the next 12 months and comply with its banking covenants.
1.1.3 Accounting estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS
requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also
requires management to exercise its judgement in the process
of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The resulting
accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the
actual results. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement
or complexity, where assumptions and estimates are significant
to the consolidated financial statements, are set out below.
(a) Estimated impairment of intangible assets and property,
plant and equipment
The Group tests annually whether assets that have an indefinite
useful life, including goodwill and gaming licences, have
suffered any impairment. The Group also reviews assets that
are subject to amortisation or depreciation for events or changes
in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount of the asset
may not be recoverable. Further details of the Group’s accounting
policy in relation to impairment are disclosed in note 1.12.
The application of the policy requires the use of accounting
estimates and judgements in determining the recoverable
amount of cash-generating units to which the intangible
assets and property, plant and equipment are associated. The
recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to
sell and value in use. Estimates of fair value less costs to sell are
performed internally by experienced senior management
supported by knowledge of similar transactions and advice
from external estate agents or, if applicable, offers received.
Value in use is calculated using estimated cash flow projections
from financial budgets, discounted by selecting an appropriate
rate for each cash-generating unit. Further details of the
assumptions and estimates are disclosed in note 12.
(b) Classification of casino licences and other gaming licences
as intangible assets with an indefinite life
As disclosed in note 1.11, casino licences and other gaming
licences have been classified as intangible assets with an indefinite
life. This assumption is based on management’s belief that there
is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the licences are
expected to generate net cash inflows and that each licence holds
a value outside the property in which it resides. As a consequence,
each licence is reviewed annually for impairment.
(c) Recoverability of deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is
probable future taxable profit will be available against which
the temporary differences can be utilised. The key area of
judgement is therefore an assessment of whether it is probable
that there will be suitable taxable profits against which any
deferred tax assets can be utilised. Further details of deferred
tax assets recognised are disclosed in note 24.
(d) Income taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions,
including jurisdictions from now discontinued operations. There
are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate
tax determination is uncertain. The Group recognises liabilities
for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether
additional taxes will be due. Where the final outcome of these
matters is different from the amount recognised, such differences
will impact in the period such determination is made.
(e) Provisions
Provisions are recognised in accordance with the policy
disclosed in note 1.9. In calculating onerous property lease
provisions, estimates are made of the discounted cash flows
derived from the property and its associated operations. Estimates
have also been made in determining the amount and timing of
disposal provisions, including insurance and warranty claims.
Further details of provisions made are disclosed in note 26.
(f) Retirement benefits
The present value of retirement benefits depends on a number of
factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number
of assumptions. Any changes in these assumptions will impact
the carrying amount of retirement benefits. Following the
transfer of the Group’s defined benefit plan in 2008, any such
assumptions are unlikely to have a material impact for the
Group going forward. Further details of assumptions made
in relation to the defined benefit plan, up until its transfer,
together with the Group’s remaining retirement benefit
obligation are disclosed in note 33.
(g) Share-based payments
The Group measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with
employees by reference to the fair value of equity instruments at
the date at which they are granted. Estimating the fair value for
share-based payment transactions requires determining the most
appropriate valuation model, which is dependent on the terms
and conditions of the grant. It also requires a determination of the
most appropriate inputs to the model selected. Further details are
outlined in note 32.

in equity’ are required to be shown in a performance statement.
Entities can choose whether to present one performance
statement (the statement of comprehensive income) or
two statements (the income statement and statement of
comprehensive income). The Group has elected to present
two statements; an income statement and a statement of
comprehensive income. Comparative information has been
re-presented so that it is also in conformity with the revised
standard. As the change in accounting policy only impacts
presentational aspects, there is no impact on earnings per share.
IAS 23 Borrowing costs (revised)
The revised standard requires borrowing costs relating to
qualifying assets for which the commencement date for
capitalisation is on or after 1 January 2009 to be capitalised.
The Group previously recognised all borrowing costs as an
expense immediately. In accordance with the transition
provisions of the standard, comparative figures have not been
restated. The change in accounting policy had no impact on
earnings per share. The Group had no qualifying assets in 2009.
IFRS 2 Share-based payment (amendment)
The amendment deals with vesting conditions and
cancellations. It clarifies that vesting conditions are service
conditions and performance conditions only. Other features
of a share-based payment are not vesting conditions. The
amendment also requires that all cancellations, whether by the
entity or by other parties, should receive the same accounting
treatment. The amendment does not have a material impact
on the Group or Company financial statements.
IFRS 7 Financial instruments – Disclosures (amendments)
The amendment requires enhanced disclosures about fair value
measurement and liquidity risk. In particular, the amendment
requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of a fair
value measurement hierarchy, although this has not had a
significant impact on the Group.
IFRS 8 Operating segments
IFRS 8 replaces IAS 14 Segment reporting. It requires a
‘management approach’ under which segment information is
presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting
purposes to the chief operating decision maker. Further details
of the policy are disclosed in note 1.4. Although there is no
overall impact on operating profit, it has resulted in a reduction
in the number of reportable segments presented. The previously
reported gaming shared service segment has been allocated to
operating divisions and central costs on the same basis as that
used for internal reporting purposes. Costs that can be allocated
on a reasonable basis are now included in the operating
divisions. Unallocated costs are combined into central costs.
(b) Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing
standards that are not yet effective
The following standards, amendments and interpretations to
existing standards have been published and are mandatory
for accounting periods beginning after 1 January 2009 or later
periods, but they have not been early adopted by the Group:
• IFRIC 17 Distribution of non-cash assets to owners – effective
1 July 2009
• IFRIC 18 Transfer of assets from customers – effective
31 October 2009
• IFRIC 19 Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity
instruments – effective 1 July 2010
• IFRS 2 Share-based payment (amendment) – effective
1 January 2010
• IFRS 3 Business combinations (revised) – effective
1 July 2009
• IFRS 9 Financial instruments – effective 1 January 2013
• IAS 27 Consolidated and separate financial statements
(revised) – effective 1 July 2009
• Improvements to IFRS (issued April 2009) – effective
1 January 2010
It is not anticipated that the adoption of the above standards,
amendments and interpretations of existing standards will
have a material impact on the Group or Company financial
statements in the period of initial application.
(c) Change to revenue reporting
In previous years, the Group has reported revenue as gaming
win net of VAT where applicable. This is consistent with internal
information reviewed by the chief operating decision maker.
However, an alternative definition of revenue has become more
widely reported among betting and gaming companies. This
revised definition makes a further deduction for the fair value
of free bets, promotions and customer bonuses. The Group
previously reported the fair value of these items as an expense
in the income statement. To bring the Group in line with
this revised definition of revenue, the Group has restated its
2008 comparatives. The Group continues to report internal
information based on the previous definition of revenue, and
therefore in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating segments, has
presented a reconciliation between revenue reported internally
and the revised basis disclosed in the income statement.
The restatement has no impact on Group operating profit.

1.2 Consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power
to govern the financial and operating policies, generally
accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the
voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights
that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered
when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
All subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which
control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated
from the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for
the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an
acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given,
equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed
at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the
acquisition. Identifiable assets acquired, liabilities and
contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are
measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date,
irrespective of the extent of any minority interest. The excess
of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share
of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net
assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised
directly in the income statement.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains
on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction
provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Accounting policies as applied to subsidiaries have been
changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the
policies adopted by the Group.
The Group has no material associates or joint ventures.
1.3 Revenue recognition
Revenue consists of the fair value of sales of goods and services,
net of VAT, rebates and discounts.
(a) Gaming win
Revenue for casinos includes the gaming win before deduction
of gaming duty. Revenue for bingo is net of prizes and VAT
(where applicable) before deduction of gross profits tax.
Revenue for Rank Interactive, including sports betting and
interactive games, represents gross win. The fair value of free
bets, promotions and customer bonuses are also deducted from
all revenue streams.
Although disclosed as revenue, gaming win is accounted
for and meets the definition of a gain under IAS 39 Financial
instruments: Recognition and measurement.
(b) Food and beverage
Revenue from food and beverage sales is recognised at the
point of sale.
(c) Finance income
Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis using
the effective interest method.
1.4 Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with
the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision
maker. The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible
for allocating resources and assessing performance of the
operating segments, has been identified as the executive
management team (the composition of which is disclosed
on page 41) that makes strategic and operational decisions.
1.5 Foreign currency translation
(a) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the
Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary
economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the
functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are
presented in UK Sterling, which is the Company’s functional
and the Group’s presentational currency.
(b) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional
currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from
the settlement of such transactions and from the translation
at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income
statement in finance costs, except when deferred in equity
where hedging criteria are met.
(c) Group companies
The results and financial position of all the Group companies
(none of which has the currency of a hyper-inflationary
economy) that have a functional currency different from
the presentation currency are translated into the presentation
currency as follows:
i) assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented
are translated at the closing rate on the balance sheet
date. The closing Euro rate against UK Sterling was
1.13 (2008: 1.04) and the closing US Dollar rate against
UK Sterling was 1.61 (2008: 1.45);
ii) income and expenses for each income statement are
translated at average exchange rates unless this average is
not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect
of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which
case income and expenses are translated at the rates
prevailing on the dates of the transactions. The average
Euro rate against UK Sterling was 1.12 (2008: 1.25) and
the average US Dollar rate against UK Sterling in the year
was 1.57 (2008: 1.84); and
iii) all resulting exchange differences are recognised as
a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the
translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and
of borrowings and other currency instruments designated
THE RANK GROUP PLC: ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2009 65
1 General information and accounting policies continued as hedges of such investments, are taken to shareholders’
equity. When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange
differences are recognised in the income statement, net of
hedging, as part of the gain or loss on sale. Goodwill and fair
value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity
are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and
translated at the closing rate.
1.6 Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following
categories: loans and receivables and available-for-sale. The
classification depends on the purpose for which the financial
assets were acquired. Management determines the classification
of its financial assets at initial recognition.
(a) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with
fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an
active market. They are included in current assets, except for
maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date.
These are classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables
are classified as trade and other receivables in the balance sheet.
Impairment testing of trade receivables is described in note 1.17.
(b) Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are
either designated in this category or not classified in any of the
other categories. They are included in non-current assets unless
management intends to dispose of the investment within
12 months of the balance sheet date.
Securities are initially recognised at fair value plus
transaction costs. Subsequent changes in the fair value are
recognised in equity. The Group assesses at each balance sheet
date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset
or a group of financial assets is impaired. In the case of equity
securities classified as available-for-sale, a significant or
prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its
cost is an indicator that the securities are impaired. If any
such evidence exists for available-for-sale financial assets,
the cumulative loss – measured as the difference between the
acquisition costs and the current fair value, less any impairment
loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the income
statement – is removed from equity and recognised in the
income statement.
When securities classified as available-for-sale are sold or
impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised
in equity are included in the income statement.
1.7 Derivative ﬁnancial instruments and hedging activities
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date
a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently
remeasured at their fair value. The method of recognising the
resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is
designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of
the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives
as either:
(a) hedges of the fair value of recognised liabilities
(‘fair value hedge’);
(b) hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised
liability or a highly probable forecast transaction
(‘cash flow hedge’); or
(c) hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation
(‘net investment hedge’).
The Group documents, at the inception of the transaction,
the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged
items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy
for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Group also
documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on
an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in
hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes
in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
Certain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge
accounting and are accounted for at fair value through finance
costs in the income statement.
The fair values of various derivative instruments used for
hedging purposes are disclosed in note 21.
The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a
non-current asset or liability when the maturity of the hedged
item is greater than 12 months; it is classified as a current asset
or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item
is less than 12 months. Trading derivatives are classified as a
current asset or liability.
(a) Fair value hedge
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated
and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income
statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the
hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
The Group only applies fair value hedge accounting for hedging
fixed interest risk on borrowings. The gain or loss relating to
both the effective and ineffective portion of interest rate swaps
hedging fixed rate borrowings is recognised in the income
statement within finance costs. Changes in the fair value of the
hedged fixed rate borrowings attributable to interest rate risk are
recognised in the income statement within finance costs.
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge
accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedge
item for which the effective interest method is used is amortised
to profit or loss over the period to maturity.
(b) Cash flow hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives
that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised
in equity unless the hedge is of a recognised liability, in which
case the gain or loss is recognised within finance costs within
the income statement. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective
portion is recognised immediately in the income statement
within finance costs.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a
hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any
cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains
in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is
ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a hedged
forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative
gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred
to the income statement within operating costs.
(c) Net investment hedge
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted
for similarly to cash flow hedges of forecast transactions. Any
gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective
portion of the hedge is recognised in equity. The gain or loss
relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately
in the income statement within finance costs. Gains and losses
accumulated in equity are included in the income statement
when the foreign operation is disposed.
1.8 Leases
Leases are tested to determine whether the lease is a finance
or operating lease and treated accordingly. Property leases
comprising a lease of land and a lease of buildings within a single
contract are split into its two component parts before testing.
(a) Finance leases
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified
66 THE RANK GROUP PLC: ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2009
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED C
1 General information and accounting policies continued as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the inception
of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the leased property,
plant and equipment or the present value of minimum lease
payments. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability
and finance charges so as to achieve a constant periodic rate
of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each
period. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance
charges, are included in borrowings. The interest element of
the finance cost is charged to the income statement over the
lease period. The property, plant and equipment acquired under
finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life
of the asset or the lease term.
(b) Operating leases
Leases where a significant portion of the risks and rewards of
ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating
leases. Payments made under operating leases, net of lease
incentives or premiums, are charged to the income statement
on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
1.9 Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal
or constructive obligation as a result of past events if it is more
likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to
settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures
expected to be required to settle the obligation, taking into
account the risks specific to the obligation, and discounted at
a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments
of the time value of money. The increase in the provision due
to passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
(a) Onerous contracts
The Group is party to a number of leasehold property
contracts. Provision has been made against those leases where
the property is now vacant and the unavoidable costs under the
lease exceed the economic benefit expected to be derived from
potential sub-letting arrangements. Provision has also been
made against leases where impairment testing has indicated
that, after recognising an impairment charge, the estimated
discounted cash flows derived from the property and its
associated operations are insufficient to cover the unavoidable
lease costs and the lease is therefore deemed onerous.
(b) Provision on disposal
Following the disposal of an operation, provision is made
for the estimated future costs and potential warranty claims
directly attributable to the disposal.
1.10 Property, plant and equipment
All property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost
less depreciation and any impairment. Historical cost includes
expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition
of the items.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount
or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is
probable that future economic benefits associated with the item
will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured
reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the
income statement during the financial period in which they
are incurred.
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is
calculated using the straight line method to allocate their cost
less residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
– freehold and leasehold property 50 years or their
useful life if less
– refurbishment of property five to 20 years
– fixtures, fittings, plant and
equipment and others three to 20 years
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed,
and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to
its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater
than its estimated recoverable amount. Gains and losses on
disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying
amount. These are included in the income statement.
Pre-opening costs are expensed to the income statement
as incurred.
The Group capitalises borrowing costs directly attributable
to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying
assets, where material, as part of the cost of that asset for which
the commencement date was on or after 1 January 2009. Prior
to this date, the Group recognised all borrowing costs as an
expense immediately.
1.11 Intangible assets
(a) Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over
the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets
of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill
on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at
amortised cost as at 1 January 2004 plus cost for any acquisition
completed after 1 January 2004 less accumulated impairment
losses. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the
carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold, except
where goodwill has been previously written off directly to
reserves under previous GAAP.
Goodwill is allocated to the relevant cash-generating unit
or group of cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment
testing. A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group
of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent
of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions made before 31 December
1997 has been written off directly to reserves.
(b) Computer software and other development costs
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the
basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the
specific software. These costs are amortised on a straight line
basis over their estimated useful lives (three to 10 years).
Costs associated with maintaining computer software
programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Costs that are directly associated with the production and
development of identifiable and unique software products
controlled by the Group, and that will probably generate
economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are
recognised as intangible assets for both externally purchased
and internally developed software. Direct costs include specific
employee costs for software development.
Computer software development costs recognised as assets
are amortised over their estimated useful lives, estimated at
between three to four years.
(c) Casino and other gaming licences
The Group capitalises acquired casino and other gaming
licences. The amount capitalised is the difference between the
price paid for a property or business and the associated licence,
and the fair value of a similar property or business without a
licence. Management believes that licences have indefinite lives
as there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the
licences are expected to generate net cash inflows and each
licence holds a value outside the property in which it resides.
Each licence is reviewed annually for impairment.
Any costs in renewing licences annually are expensed
as incurred.
THE RANK GROUP PLC: ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2009 67
1 General information and accounting policies continued (d) Other purchased intangible assets
If acquired, the Group capitalises the costs of other intangible
assets such as brands, trademarks and customer relationships.
Costs incurred internally to generate these intangible assets are
expensed as incurred. For business combinations occurring after
1 January 2004, purchased intangible assets are capitalised on
the balance sheet at fair value on acquisition. The valuation
of purchased intangible assets and determining the useful
economic life involves management making assumptions
and estimates, which are highly judgemental and susceptible
to change. Purchased intangible assets with finite lives are
amortised over their useful economic lives, estimated at
three years.
1.12 Impairment of intangible assets and property,
plant and equipment
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to
amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets
that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised as the amount by which
an asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The
recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less
costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing
impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which
there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating
units). The expected cash flows generated by the assets are
discounted using appropriate discount rates that reflect the time
value of money and risks associated with the groups of assets.
If an impairment loss is recognised, the carrying amount
of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable
amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an exceptional
expense in the income statement immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the
carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased
to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to
the extent that the increased carrying amount does not exceed
the carrying amount that would have been determined had no
impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating
unit) in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as exceptional
income in the income statement immediately.
1.13 Employee beneﬁt costs
(a) Pension obligations
The Group operated a defined contribution plan in 2009.
Previously the Group operated both defined benefit and defined
contribution plans, until the transfer of the assets and liabilities
of the defined benefit plan in 2008. Further details of the
transfer are given in note 33.
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an
amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on
retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as
age, years of service and compensation. A defined contribution
plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed
contributions into a separate entity. The Group has no legal or
constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund
does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits
relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
The amount recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the
defined benefit pension plan was the fair value of plan assets less
the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance
sheet date, together with adjustments for unrecognised actuarial
gains or losses and past-service costs. The defined benefit asset
was calculated annually by independent actuaries using the
projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined
benefit obligation was determined by discounting the estimated
future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate
bonds that were denominated in the currency in which the
benefits were paid, and that had terms to maturity approximating
to the terms of the related pension liability.
The Group recognised actuarial gains and losses
immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
Past-service costs were recognised immediately in operating
profit, unless the changes to the pension plan were conditional
on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of
time (the vesting period). In this case, the past-service costs
were amortised on a straight line basis over the vesting period.
The net return or cost arising on the defined benefit
pension plan was recognised in net finance costs.
For defined contribution plans, the Group pays
contributions to publicly or privately administered pension
insurance plans on a contractual or voluntary basis. The Group
has no further payment obligations once the contributions have
been paid. The contributions are recognised as employee benefit
expense when they are due.
The Group also has an unfunded pension commitment
relating to three former executives of the Group. The amount
recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the commitment
is the present value of the obligation at the balance sheet date,
together with adjustment for unrecognised actuarial gains
or losses. The Group recognises actuarial gains and losses
immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
The net interest cost arising on the commitment is recognised
in net finance costs.
(b) Share-based compensation
The Group operates various equity-settled share-based
compensation plans. The fair value of employee services,
received in exchange for the grant of the options, is recognised
as an expense. The total amount to be expensed over the
vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of
the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market
vesting conditions (for example, profitability and sales growth
targets). Non-market vesting conditions are included in
assumptions about the number of options that are expected to
vest. At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates
of the number of options that are expected to vest. It recognises
the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the
income statement, and a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable
transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value)
and share premium when the options are exercised.
(c) Termination benefits
Termination benefits are payable when employment is
terminated before the normal retirement date, or whenever an
employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these
benefits. The Group recognises termination benefits when it is
demonstrably committed to either terminating the employment
of current employees according to a detailed formal plan; or
providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to
encourage voluntary redundancy. Benefits falling due more
than 12 months after the balance sheet date are discounted
to present value.
(d) Bonus plans
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses
based on a formula that takes into consideration the profit
attributable to the Company’s shareholders after certain
adjustments. The Group recognises a provision where
contractually obliged or where a past practice has created
a constructive obligation.
68 THE RANK GROUP PLC: ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2009
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED C
1 General information and accounting policies continued 1.14 Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable
value. Cost of inventory is determined on a ‘first-in first-out’ basis.
Thecostoffinishedgoodscomprisesgoodspurchasedfor
resale. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the
ordinary course of business, less the cost of completion and
selling expenses. When necessary, provision is made for
obsolete and slow-moving inventories.
1.15 Taxation including deferred tax
Current tax is applied to taxable profits at the rates ruling in the
relevant country.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method,
on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets
and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial
statements. However, if deferred tax arises from the initial
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a
business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects
neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted
for. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that
have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet
date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax
asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is
probable that future taxable profit will be available against
which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a
legally enforceable right to set off current taxation assets against
current taxation liabilities and it is the intention to settle these
on a net basis.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on
investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the
timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled
by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
1.16 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held
at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments
with original maturities of three months or less, and bank
overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in
current liabilities on the balance sheet.
1.17 Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision
for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is
objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all
amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability
that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial
reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments (more
than 30 days overdue) are considered indicators that the trade
receivable is impaired. The amount of the provision is the
difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present
value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original
effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is
reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the
amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement
within operating costs.
When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off
against the allowance account for trade receivables. Subsequent
recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against
operating costs in the income statement.
1.18 Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method.
1.19 Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised at cost, which is deemed to be
materially the same as the fair value, net of transaction costs
incurred. Any difference between proceeds and redemption
value is recognised in the income statement using the effective
interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the
Group has the unconditional right to defer settlement of the
liability for at least 12 months at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of the liability portion of the convertible
bond was determined on the date of issue. This amount was
recorded as a liability and was held on an amortised cost basis
until the redemption or maturity of the bonds. The remaining
proceeds were allocated to the conversion option and were
recognised in shareholders’ funds. This resulted in a higher
interest cost over the life of the bond as an equal and opposite
amount to the equity component was amortised through the
income statement as a financing cost.
1.20 Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s
equity share capital (treasury shares as defined by IAS 32),
the consideration paid, including any directly attributable
incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity
attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares
are cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently
sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly
attributable incremental transaction costs and the related
income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the
Company’s equity holders.
1.21 Discontinued operations and non-current assets
held for sale
Operations of the Group are recognised as discontinued
operations if the operations have been disposed of or meet
the criteria to be classified as held for sale. Operations held for
sale are held at the lower of their carrying amount on the dates
they are classified as held for sale and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held
for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale
transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition
is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the
asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its
present condition. Management must be committed to the
sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a
completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
1.22 Dividends
Dividends proposed by the board of directors and unpaid at the
period end are not recognised in the financial statements until
they have been approved by shareholders at the annual general
meeting. Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
1.23 Exceptional items
The Group defines exceptional items as those items which,
by their size or nature, are separately disclosed in order to give
a full understanding of the Group’s financial performance and
aid comparability of the Group’s result between periods. This
would include, to the extent they are material, gains or losses
on the disposal of assets, impairments of the carrying value
of assets and associated onerous lease provisions, costs of club
closures, onerous lease provisions on vacant properties, disposal
of businesses, changes in disposal provisions and VAT refunds
(net of gross profits tax and associated costs) relating to
previous periods.

(d) Implementation of IFRS 8 Operating segments
As detailed in note 1, the analysis of 2008 operating profit by segment has been reallocated following the implementation of IFRS 8
Operating segments. Although there is no overall impact on operating profit, the 2008 comparatives have been reallocated to be
consistent with the internal information reviewed by the executive management team, with costs from the previously reported
gaming shared service segment being allocated to operating divisions wherever possible. Costs that cannot be allocated on a
reasonable basis are combined within Central costs.

2009 exceptional items
Continuing operations
During 2009, the Group disposed of one previously closed Mecca Bingo property at Welling. The resulting profit on disposal of the
property, net of costs, was £1.4m.
The Group also recognised an impairment charge of £1.5m against a non-operating casino licence at Liverpool. The Group continues
to explore opportunities for the licence, however the directors consider that, following a prolonged period of non-operation and a
re-evaluation of the planned use for the licence, an impairment of the licence is appropriate.
The increase in the discount rate used in the calculation of the onerous property lease provision resulted in a £1.0m release to the
income statement.
An exceptional profit of £1.9m also arose following the partial refund of bingo gross profits tax accrued in 2008 and previously paid
during 2009 in relation to the £59.1m VAT refund in 2008.
Discontinued operations
A provision of £5.0m for an environmental warranty given at the time of the sale of Deluxe Film was released as no subsequent
claim was received and the warranty period has now expired.
In addition, a charge of £4.2m was made in relation to the settlement, and associated costs, of legal proceedings in the US brought
by Paramount Home Entertainment. At the end of 2008, the Group provided for the legal costs associated with defending the claim
but no provision was made for the damages claimed, which were a maximum of US$29m. On 21 August 2009, the Group agreed to
pay $5.8m to Paramount Home Entertainment in full and final settlement of the claim, which together with the associated costs,
resulted in the additional charge of £4.2m.
2008 exceptional items
Continuing operations
On 27 June 2008, the Group completed the transfer of the assets and liabilities of the Rank Pension Plan (‘the Plan’), a defined
benefit scheme, to Rothesay Life (an FSA regulated insurance company and wholly owned subsidiary of Goldman Sachs).
The transfer secured the accrued benefits for the members of the Plan and removed all financial risks and liabilities in relation
to the Plan from the Group.
Further details of the exceptional loss arising on the transfer are disclosed in the table below:

4 Exceptional items continued
On 10 November 2008, the Group received £59.1m in overpaid VAT from HMRC, following the VAT and Duties Tribunal’s ruling
in May 2008 that the application of VAT to some games of interval bingo contravened the European Union’s principle of fiscal
neutrality. The exceptional gain of £42.8m represented the element of the VAT repayment relating to the period 2003 to 2007 net
of associated gross profits tax and costs. HMRC appealed the ruling of the Tribunal at a High Court hearing in March 2009 but the
judgement again found in favour of the Group. HMRC lodged an appeal to the Court of Appeal on 6 July 2009 and is due to be
heard in April 2010. In the event of an adverse ruling, the Group would be required to repay the £59.1m plus amounts not paid
over for the period from July 2008 to 26 April 2009. A contingent liability has been disclosed in note 37. Exceptional finance
income of £5.1m relating to the period up until the end of 2007 was also recognised in relation to the refund. Based on legal
advice received by the Group, the directors are satisfied the continued recognition of this gain is appropriate.
Further details of the exceptional gain on the VAT refund in 2008 are disclosed in the table below:

At 31 December 2008, the Group recognised additional impairments of £14.5m on intangible assets and property, plant and
equipment. Further details are provided in note 12.
The net provision for onerous leases included an additional onerous lease charge of £7.9m and a £4.3m charge arising from the
reduction in discount rate, net of a £10.5m onerous lease reversal.
During 2008, the Group closed one Mecca Bingo club at Swindon and one Grosvenor Casino in Leeds. The resulting profit on
disposal of the Swindon property, together with the profit on two previously closed properties, net of associated closure and disposal
costs, was £4.1m.
Other comprised abortive software development costs incurred by Rank Interactive.
Discontinued operations
The £15.0m gain from release of disposal provisions in 2008 consisted of two items:
On 31 December 2008, the Group settled its lease obligation in relation to its remaining plant in the US retained following the sale
and closure of its Deluxe operations. The settlement represented a significant discount to the carrying value of the provision and
accordingly a release of £10.0m from the disposal provision was made.
In addition, a provision of £5.0m for warranties given at the time of the sale of Hard Rock was released as no subsequent claims were
received and the warranty period had expired. THE RANK GROUP PLC: ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2009 77

income statement. The loss for the ﬁnancial year for the Company was £28.0m (2008: loss of £351.6m). The loss in 2008 included
an impairment of £317.3m in respect of its investment in subsidiary undertakings. Further details are provided in note 13. THE RANK GROUP PLC: ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2009 79
8 Dividends
There were no dividends paid in either year. A dividend in respect of the year ended 31 December 2009 of 1.35p per share,
amounting to a total dividend of £5.3m, is to be proposed at the annual general meeting on 22 April 2010. These financial
statements do not reflect this dividend payable.
9 Earnings (loss) per share
(a) Basic earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average
number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares purchased by the Group and held as treasury shares,
as defined by IAS 32 (note 27).

Total 9.0p 0.9p 9.9p 6.5p (7.8)p (1.3)p
(b) Diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue to assume conversion
of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. Following the redemption of the convertible debt in 2009, share options are the only
remaining category of dilutive potential ordinary shares. For share options, a calculation is made to determine the number of shares
that could have been acquired at fair value (determined as the average annual market share price of the Company’s shares) based on
the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share options. The number of shares calculated is compared
with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming exercise of the share options. The convertible debt was not dilutive
in 2008.
There is no difference in the profit (loss) or the weighted average number of shares used to determine diluted earnings per share
from that used to determine basic earnings per share. Accordingly, there is no difference between diluted earnings per share and
basic earnings per share disclosed above in either year.
(c) Adjusted earnings per share
Adjusted earnings is calculated by adjusting profit attributable to equity shareholders to exclude discontinued operations,
exceptional items, other financial gains or losses, the net return on the defined benefit pension asset, unwinding of the discount in
disposal provisions, amortisation of the equity component of the convertible bond and the related tax effects. Adjusted earnings is
one of the business performance measures used internally by management to manage the operations of the business. Management
believes that the adjusted earnings measure assists in providing a view of the underlying performance of the business.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED C
The discount rate used for all impairment reviews reﬂects
management’s estimate of the Group’s pre-tax weighted average
cost of capital. Management believes that the Group’s weighted
average cost of capital is an appropriate measure for each cash-
generating unit (CGU) as they operate in gaming markets with
similar risks as set out below. The pre-tax discount rate applied
to all cash ﬂow projections is 12.2% (2008: 14.1%).
(a)Impairmentreviewofintangibleassetswithindeﬁnitelives
Assets that have an indeﬁnite useful life are not subject to
amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. In
accordance with IAS 36, goodwill is classified as an intangible
asset with an indefinite life. In addition, the Group classifies
casino licences and Spanish bingo licences as intangible assets
with an indefinite life.
i) Goodwill
The Group has goodwill with a carrying value of £53.8m (2008:
£53.8m) arising from the acquisition of Rank Interactive.
For impairment testing, the whole of Rank Interactive is
treated as a single CGU. The recoverable amount has been
determined based on a value in use calculation using cash ﬂow
projections from the Group’s budget for 2010, the Group’s
strategic plan for the following two years and a growth rate of
2% thereafter. Both the Group’s budget and strategic plan have
been approved by the board of directors.
The key assumptions in the calculation of value in use are
settled stakes, gross win margins and the discount rate. Settled
stakes represent monies placed by customers for betting and
interactive games and are estimated taking into account the
product mix, major sporting events and industry developments.
Gross win margins are based on values achieved in the past and
amended for any anticipated changes in the budget period. The
calculation also assumes that revenue from UK-domiciled
customers is not subject to UK duty or VAT.
As a result of the impairment testing, the directors do not
believe that the carrying value of the goodwill was impaired as the
value in use significantly exceeded the carrying value of goodwill.
However, there are possible changes which could adversely impact
the key assumptions and cause the carrying value of the goodwill
to exceed its recoverable amount. These include:
Possiblechange Keyassumptionimpacted
Increased or improved
competition Settled stakes, gross win margin
Poor or decreased
marketing Settled stakes
Failure to respond to
technological advances Settled stakes
Deterioration in
economic environment Settled stakes
Changes in regulation Settled stakes, gross win margin
Changes in taxation Gaming duty
Prolonged period of
adverse sporting results Gross win margin
Changes in settled stakes and gross win margin impact gross win
and consequently the cash flow projections used to determine
the recoverable amount. Any change resulting in a decrease of
in excess of 45% in projected gaming win would cause the
recoverable amount to equal the carrying value of the CGU.
The directors do not believe that there are any reasonably
possible changes to the key assumptions that would result in
a decrease in excess of 45% in projected gaming win, and
therefore cause a material impairment of the goodwill.
ii) Casino licences
The carrying value of casino licences as at 31 December 2009
was £94.3m (2008: £97.1m).
The inherent value of casino licences is deemed to be an
intrinsic part of the value of the operation of casinos as a whole
and is therefore not split out from each Grosvenor casino in an
impairment review. Each Grosvenor casino has been treated as
a separate CGU, and tested for impairment on that basis. The
recoverable amount of each Grosvenor casino, including the
licence, has been determined based on the higher of fair value
less costs to sell and value in use. The value in use has been
determined using cash flow projections from the Group’s
budget for 2010, the Group’s strategic plan for the following
two years and a growth rate of 2% thereafter. Both the Group’s
budget and strategic plan have been approved by the board
of directors. Estimates of the fair value less costs to sell are
performed internally by experienced senior management
supported by knowledge of similar transactions or, where
applicable, offers received.
Any impairment is allocated equally across all assets in
a CGU unless a fair market value exists for one or more assets.
Once an asset has been written down to its fair value less costs
to sell then any remaining impairment is allocated equally
amongst all other assets. Casino licences are generally not
impaired as they have an indefinite life and a fair market value
in excess of their carrying value.
The key assumptions in the calculation of value in use are
customer visits, spend per visit, casino duty, competition and
the discount rate. Customer visits are the number of discrete visits
by members to the casino and have been based on historic trends.
Spend per visit comprises the average amount of money (net of
winnings) spent per visit on gaming tables, machines and food
and beverages. This has also been determined by historic trends.
Casino duty is levied in bands of between 15% and 50%
depending upon the level of gaming win at each casino. The
bands and rates have been assumed to remain at current levels
without indexation, details of which are provided on page 39.
As a result of the impairment review, the directors do not
believe the carrying value of the casino licences, with the
exception of a non-operating licence at Liverpool, to be impaired.
An impairment charge of £1.5m (2008: £nil) has been recognised
in respect of the non-operating licence in Liverpool. Although
opportunities for the licence continue to be investigated, the
directors consider that, following the prolonged non-operation of
the licence, an impairment of £1.5m to the licence is appropriate.
However, there are possible changes in key assumptions that
could cause the carrying value of individual licences to exceed
their recoverable amount. These are:
Possiblechange Keyassumptionimpacted
Increased or improved
competition Customer visits
Poor or decreased
promotional activity Customer visits
Failure to respond to
technological advances Customer visits
Deterioration in
economic conditions Customer visits, spend per visit
Changes in regulation Customer visits, spend per visit
Changes in taxation Casino duty
12 Impairment review THE RANK GROUP PLC: ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2009 83
With the exception of a prolonged non-operation of a licence,
the directors do not believe that there are any reasonably
possible changes to the key assumptions that would result in
a material impairment of a UK casino licence. In respect of the
two casino licences in Belgium, the recoverable amount equates
to the carrying amount, and therefore any negative changes in
the assumptions used would separately lead to an impairment.
The original assumptions used in the calculation were:
Originalassumption
Gaming win 16.6%
Casino duty Current rates in Belgium
of between 20.0% and 50.0%
Growth rate 2.0%
Discount rate 12.2%
Customer visits and spend per visit are key components of
gaming win.
iii) Spanish bingo licences
The carrying value of Spanish bingo licences as at 31 December
2009 was £21.3m (2008: £22.9m).
The inherent value of each Spanish bingo licence is deemed
to be an intrinsic part of the value of a club as a whole and is not
therefore split out from the assets of each individual bingo club in
an impairment review. Each individual bingo club has been treated
as a separate CGU, and tested for impairment on that basis. The
recoverable amount has been determined based on a value in use
calculation using cash flow projections from the Group’s budget
for 2010, the Group’s strategic plan for the following two years
and a growth rate of 3% thereafter which reflects the long-term
opportunity in Spain. Both the Group’s budget and strategic plan
have been approved by the board of directors.
The key assumptions in the calculation of value in use are
customer visits, spend per visit and the discount rate. Customer
visits are the number of discrete visits to the bingo club and
have been based on recent trends. Spend per visit comprises the
average amount of money (net of winnings) spent by a member
on bingo games, machines and food and beverages. This has
been determined by recent trends.
In 2008, the impact of the recession in Spain resulted in the
carrying value of licences at four bingo clubs exceeding their
estimated recoverable amount and an impairment charge of
£7.9m being recognised. The 2009 impairment review indicates
the carrying value of the licences of £21.3m to be appropriate.
However, there are possible changes in the key assumptions that
could cause further impairments. These are:
Possiblechange Keyassumptionimpacted
Increased or improved
competition Customer visits
Poor or decreased
promotional activity Customer visits
Failure to respond to
technological advances Customer visits
Deterioration in
economic conditions Customer visits, spend per visit
Changes in regulation Customer visits, spend per visit
As outlined above, each Spanish bingo licence has been tested
for impairment as part of the club as a whole. Accordingly, the
sensitivity of each licence to future impairments, arising from
changes in the key assumptions, varies at each club. The fall in
gaming win required for the recoverable amount to equal the
carrying value of the club ranges between 7% and 72%.
(b) Impairment review of property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are
grouped into CGUs which are defined as individual clubs for
Mecca Bingo, Top Rank España and Grosvenor Casinos and the
whole operation for Rank Interactive.
The key assumptions and sensitivities in the impairment
reviews for Rank Interactive, Casinos and Bingo are the same
as outlined above for intangible assets.
The recoverable amount of each CGU, including the licence
if applicable, has been determined based on the higher of fair
value less costs to sell and value in use. The value in use has
been determined using cash ﬂow projections from the Group’s
budget for 2010, the Group’s strategic plan for the following
two years and a growth rate of 2% thereafter (except for Top
Rank España where a growth rate of 3% has been used). Both
the Group’s budget and strategic plan have been approved by
the board of directors. Estimates of the fair value less costs to
sell are performed internally by an experienced surveyor
supported by external estate agent advice or, where applicable,
offers received.
Any impairment is allocated equally across all assets in a
CGU unless a fair market value exists for one or more assets.
Once an asset has been written down to its fair value less costs
to sell then any remaining impairment is allocated equally
amongst all other assets.
(c) Impairment recognised during the year
Impairments of intangible assets and property, plant and
equipment are recognised as an exceptional item in operating
costs in the income statement. The impairments recognised
during the year were as follows:
2009
Grosvenor Casinos
As outlined above, an impairment charge of £1.5m has been
recognised in relation to a non-operating casino licence at
Liverpool. The licence has been subject to a prolonged period of
inactivity, and although the Group continues to investigate uses
for the licence, the directors believe it is appropriate to recognise
an impairment of £1.5m against the carrying value of £2.0m.
2008
Mecca Bingo
In 2008, an impairment charge of £1.9m was recognised
in respect of a small number of clubs where the impact of
competitor openings resulted in estimated cash flows that were
lower than the carrying value of property, plant and equipment.
Top Rank España
In 2008, an impairment charge of £8.4m was recognised in
relation to four bingo clubs where the impact of the recession
in Spain resulted in estimated cash flows that were lower than
the carrying value of the bingo licences, property, plant
and equipment.
Grosvenor Casinos
In 2008, an impairment charge of £2.8m was recognised
in respect of a limited number of casinos where the impact
of increased competition resulted in estimated cash flows
that were lower than the carrying value of property, plant
and equipment.
Rank Interactive
In 2008, an impairment charge of £1.4m was recognised in
respect of certain software development assets which had no
material value in use or resale value.

In 2008, the significant deterioration in the economy and changes in market sentiment towards the betting and gaming industry
led to a reduction in the earnings multiples used as a basis for the annual impairment review of the carrying value of the Company’s
investments in subsidiaries. As a result, an impairment loss of £317.3m was recognised. Following the 2009 impairment review, the
directors believe the net book amount remains appropriate.
14 Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets comprise UK listed equity investments, which by their nature have no ﬁxed maturity date or
coupon rate. The fair value of UK listed equity investments at 31 December 2009 was £nil (2008: £nil) and has been estimated using
valuation guidelines based on market prices. The prolonged decline in the fair value of the equities resulted in an impairment loss
of £0.1m and cumulative fair value losses of £0.6m, previously recognised in equity, being charged to other financial losses in the
income statement in 2008.

During the year ended 31 December 2008, convertible bonds with a par value of £9.5m were redeemed for a cost of £9.1m.
The discount arising of £0.4m was recognised in other financial gains in the income statement. The remaining convertible bonds
matured in January 2009 and were redeemed at par value from existing facilities. The bonds were convertible at the option of the
holder into fully paid ordinary shares at £3.5167 per share. Interest was paid half yearly in January and July. The effective interest
rate on the liability portion of the bond was 4.2%. None of the bonds were converted during either year.
At 31st December 2009, there were drawings of £222.0m (2008: £150.0m) on the syndicated bank facility. The facility was signed
on 14 April 2007 and consists of a £150.0m term loan and £250.0m multi-currency revolving credit facility. Both the term loan
and the revolving credit facility expire in April 2012. Interest is payable on a monthly basis.
Also included in borrowings is US$14.3m (£8.9m) (2008: US$14.3m (£9.9m)) of Yankee bonds which mature in 2018. Interest on
the Yankee bonds is payable half yearly in January and July at a rate of 7.125%.
Borrowings include obligations under ﬁnance leases, of which £0.7m (2008: £0.7m) expire within one year, £0.8m (2008: £0.7m)
expire between one and two years, £2.7m (2008: £2.5m) expire between two and ﬁve years, and £8.5m (2008: £9.5m) expire after
five years.
The Group complied with all its covenants during the period.

(a) Fair value hedge
There were no interest rate swap contracts at 31 December in either year.
In January 2008, $100m of swaps matured. These swaps hedged the interest due on the 2008 Yankee bonds, which were payable
in January and July of each year. For the year ended 31 December 2008, the gain on the fair value hedge instrument was £0.4m
and the loss on the underlying 2008 Yankee bond was £0.4m.
(b) Cash ﬂow hedges
At 31 December 2009, the Group did not hold any instruments designated as cash flow hedges.
During the year ended 31 December 2008, the Group entered into a series of currency forwards to hedge the repayment of US
Dollar debt and interest due in January 2018. The nominal value of the derivatives at 31 December 2008 was $25.7m with a fair
value of £2.2m. These instruments matured in January 2009.
(c) Net investment hedges
The Group has hedged the translation risk on its Euro denominated assets using a Euro denominated loan. The nominal value of
the loan at 31 December 2009 was €81.0m (2008: €nil), with a net fair value of £72.0m (2008: £nil). The gain on the retranslation
of this borrowing was recognised in equity to offset the loss on translation of the net investment in the subsidiaries. There is no
ineffectiveness for the year ending 31 December 2009.
At 31 December 2008, the Group had hedged the translation risk on its Euro denominated assets using a series of forward foreign

23 Financial risk management
Group
Financial risk factors
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks:
market risk (including currency risk, fair value interest rate risk,
cash flow interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk and
liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme
focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to
minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial
performance. The Group, where appropriate, uses derivative
financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury
department (Group treasury) under policies approved by the
board of directors. Group treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges
financial risks in close co-operation with the Group’s operating
units. The board provides written principles for overall risk
management, as well as written policies covering specific areas,
such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use
of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial
instruments, and investment of excess liquidity.
(a) Market risk
i) Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign
exchange risk arising from various currency exposures,
primarily with respect to the Euro. Foreign exchange risk arises
from recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in
foreign operations.
The Group has certain investments in foreign operations,
whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation
risk. Currency exposure arising from the net assets of the
Group’s foreign operations is managed primarily through
borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currency.
Group policy is to hedge 90% of material, identified exposures.
The Group has considered movements in US Dollar and
Euro over the last five years and has concluded that a 2.1%
movement in US Dollar and a 3.7% movement in Euro are
reasonable benchmarks.
At 31 December 2009, if the US Dollar had weakened/
strengthened by 2.1% against UK Sterling, with all other variables
held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been
materially unchanged (2008: £nil higher/lower), mainly as a
result of foreign exchange gains/losses on translation of US Dollar
denominated borrowings. The majority of US Dollar denominated
borrowings matured in January 2008. Equity would also have
been unchanged.
At 31 December 2009, if the Euro had weakened/strengthened
by 3.7% against UK Sterling, with all other variables held constant,
post-tax profit for the year would have been materially unchanged
(2008: £nil higher/lower), mainly as a result of foreign exchange
gains/losses on translation of Euro denominated cash balances.
ii) Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk
As the Group has no significant interest bearing assets
(excluding cash and cash equivalents), the Group’s income and
operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes
in market interest rates. The Group’s only interest bearing assets
are cash and cash equivalents (excluding cash floats), which
earn floating rate interest.
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from long-term
borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the
Group to cash flow interest rate risk. Borrowings issued at fixed
rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. Group
policy is to maintain between 40% and 60% of its borrowings
in fixed rate instruments using interest rate swaps to achieve
this where necessary. However, due to the current economic
climate the Group has exercised its right to operate outside
policy. At 31 December 2009, 9% of the Group’s debt was held
in fixed rate borrowings (2008: 54%).
During 2009, the Group’s borrowings at variable rate were
denominated in UK Sterling and Euro (2008: UK Sterling).
The Group analyses its interest rate exposure on a dynamic
basis. Various scenarios are simulated taking into consideration
refinancing, renewal of existing positions, alternative financing
and hedging. Based on these scenarios, the Group calculates the
impact on profit and loss of a defined interest rate shift. For each
simulation, the same interest rate shift is used for all currencies.
The scenarios are run only for liabilities that represent the major
interest bearing positions. Based on the simulations performed,
the impact on profit or loss of a 100 basis-point shift in UK
Sterling borrowings would be a maximum increase of £1.6m
(2008: £1.7m) or decrease of £1.6m (2008: £1.7m), respectively.
The impact on profit and loss of a 100 basis-point shift in Euro
borrowings would be a maximum increase of £0.7m (2008: £nil)
or decrease of £0.7m (2008: £nil), respectively.
When appropriate, the Group manages its cash flow
interest rate risk by using floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps.
Such interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting
borrowings from floating rates to fixed rates. Generally, the
Group raises long-term borrowings at floating rates and swaps
them into fixed rates that are lower than those available if
the Group borrowed at fixed rates directly. Under the interest
rate swaps, the Group agrees with other parties to exchange,
at specified intervals (primarily half yearly), the difference
between fixed contract rates and floating-rate interest amounts
calculated by reference to the agreed notional amounts.
Occasionally, the Group also enters into fixed-to-floating
interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value interest rate risk
arising where it has borrowed at fixed rates in excess of the
60% target.
During 2009, the group did not enter into any fixed-to-
floating or floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps.
(b) Credit risk
Credit risk is managed on a Group basis. Credit risk arises from
cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and
deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit
exposures on outstanding receivables.
The Group only deals with banks and financial institutions
with which they have a lending or advisory relationship.
The creditworthiness of each counterparty is checked against
independent credit ratings on at least a weekly basis, with
a minimum rating of ‘A’ required. An internal rating is then
allocated and an individual credit limit is set in accordance with
policy set by the board. Management reviews the utilisation of
credit limits on a regular basis. In 2008, the Group reduced the
credit limit of each of its counterparties and where necessary nil
limits were introduced. These have remained in place in 2009.
The Group predominantly uses ‘AAA’ rated Money Market
Funds when investing its surplus cash. The rating and portfolio
of each fund is reviewed on at least a weekly basis. In addition
to investing the Group’s cash with Money Market Funds, the
Group invests with lending banks when appropriate.
Sales to retail customers are settled in cash or using major
credit cards and therefore the exposure to credit risk is not
considered significant.
No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period
and management does not expect any losses from non-
performance of its counterparties. THE RANK GROUP PLC: ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2009 91

(c) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not have sufficient funds to meet its liabilities. Cash forecasts identifying the liquidity
requirements of the Group are produced quarterly. The cash forecasts are sensitivity tested for different scenarios and are reviewed
regularly. Forecast financial headroom and debt covenant compliance are reviewed monthly during the month-end process to
ensure sufficient financial headroom exists for at least a 12-month period.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Group treasury aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping committed
credit lines available. A four-year strategic forecast is prepared annually to facilitate planning for future financing needs. Management
actively manages its financing requirements and the range of maturities on its debt. The Group has committed financing facilities until
April 2012, of which £178.0m (2008: £250.0m) was undrawn at 31 December 2009.
The Group’s core debt facility is a £400.0m syndicated bank facility. The Group considers the counterparties to this facility to be
of high quality and proactively manages its relationships with its lending group.
The funding policy of the Group is to maintain, as far as practicable, a broad portfolio of debt diversiﬁed by source and maturity,
and to maintain committed facilities sufﬁcient to cover seasonal peak anticipated borrowing requirements.
The table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the

Capital risk management
During the difficult conditions that have developed in the global capital markets in recent years, the Group’s objectives when
managing capital have been to ensure continuing access to existing debt facilities and to manage the borrowing cost of those
facilities in order to minimise the Group’s interest charge. The Group’s leverage in 2009 was in line with its revised medium-term
strategy, which was to maintain a leverage ratio of 2.0 to 2.5 times and its overall objective is to continue to operate with prudent
levels of leverage during the current global financial crisis.
Consistent with others in the gaming industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of its leverage ratio. This ratio is calculated
as net debt divided by EBITDA. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings (including ‘borrowings’ as shown in the consolidated
balance sheet) less cash and cash equivalents, less accrued interest, less unamortised facility fees and amounts relating to
discontinued operations. EBITDA is calculated as operating profit before exceptional items plus depreciation and amortisation.
The leverage ratios at 31 December 2009 and 2008 were as follows:

Total borrowings 20 250.1 339.8

Add: Depreciation and amortisation 25.9 26.3
EBITDA 83.9 86.6
Leverage ratio 2.2 2.6
Fair value estimation
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (such as available-for-sale securities) is based on quoted market
prices at the balance sheet date. The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is
determined by using valuation techniques. The Group uses a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are based on market
conditions existing at each balance sheet date. Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments are used for long-term
bonds. Other techniques, such as estimated discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial
instruments. The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows. The fair value
of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of quoted borrowings is based on year-end mid-market quoted prices. The fair values of other borrowings and the
derivative ﬁnancial instruments are estimated by discounting the future cash ﬂows to net present values using appropriate market
rates prevailing at the year end.
Company
The Company has no financial instruments apart from insignificant levels of cash, therefore the Company does not have any
significant exposure to financial risks. THE RANK GROUP PLC: ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2009 93

Onerous leases
The Group is party to a number of leasehold property contracts. Provision has been made against those leases where the property
is now vacant and the unavoidable costs under the lease exceed the economic beneﬁt expected to be derived from potential
sub-letting arrangements. Provision has also been made against leases where impairment testing has indicated that, after recognising
an impairment charge, the estimated discounted cash ﬂows derived from the property and its associated operations are insufficient
to cover the unavoidable lease costs and the lease is therefore deemed onerous. These leases have an unexpired life of between under
one year and 80 years.

The estimated fair values for each of the ESOS and SAYE awards granted are calculated using a Black-Scholes pricing model. The fair
value of LTIP awards is calculated using a Monte Carlo model approach, and indicates the proportion of shares likely to vest. For
grants made subject to an EPS performance condition, the expense is based on expectations of these conditions being met, which
are reassessed at each balance sheet date.
There have been no ESOS or SAYE awards granted during either year.
The expected life of LTIP awards is determined by the performance period. Details of the expected life and the weighted average
fair value per share of the LTIP awards during the year were as follows:

The Group recognised a £0.9m charge in operating profit from accounting for share-based payments in accordance with IFRS 2
(2008: £nil).
National Insurance contributions are payable in respect of some share-based payments. These contributions are payable on the date
of exercise based on the intrinsic value of the share-based payments, and as such are treated as cash-settled awards. The Group has
recorded liabilities at the end of 2009 of £0.1m (2008: £0.2m) of which £nil (2008: £nil) was in respect of vested grants. THE RANK GROUP PLC: ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2009 101
33 Retirement benefits
The Group operated the Rank Pension Plan (‘the Plan’), a defined benefit plan for UK employees, until 27 June 2008 when it was
transferred to Rothesay Life (an FSA regulated insurance company and wholly owned subsidiary of Goldman Sachs). The Plan had
been closed to new entrants since 2000. The Group’s other pension arrangements include the Rank Group Stakeholder Pension Plan
which replaced the Rank Money Purchase Pension Scheme in 2006. The Rank Money Purchase Pension Scheme is currently being
wound up. The schemes are externally funded and the funds’ assets are held separately from Group assets.
In respect of the Rank Pension Plan, the accounting period was extended to 30 June 2008 to take account of the transfer of all assets
and liabilities to Rothesay Life. The Plan accounts have been reported on by their auditors without qualification.
In respect of the Rank Money Purchase Pension Scheme, accounts to 5 October 2007 included the transfer of all member liabilities
to individual Section 32A policies and have been reported on by the Scheme auditors without qualification.
Deﬁned beneﬁt plan
The Plan was a deﬁned beneﬁt scheme with pensions ﬁxed by reference to ﬁnal pay and length of service. On 27 June 2008, the
Group completed the transfer of the assets and liabilities of the Plan to Rothesay Life. The transfer secured the accrued benefits for
the members of the Plan and removed all financial risks and liabilities in relation to the Plan from the Group. Further details of the
resulting loss on transfer are disclosed in note 4.
Formal actuarial valuations of the Plan were carried out at least triennially by an independent actuary, Mercer Human Resource
Consulting Limited. The final valuation was undertaken as at 5 April 2007.
The actuarial valuation of the Plan was updated by an independent actuary to the date of transfer.

To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption set at 31 December 2007, the Company considered the
current level of expected returns on risk free investments (primarily Government bonds), the historical level of the risk premium
associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the actual asset allocation to develop the expected long-term
rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio. Over the course of 2007, the Plan’s investment strategy changed and a series
of derivatives were implemented to remove risk within the portfolio. The value of the derivative instruments was contained within
the asset values at 31 December 2007 and reflected in the expected return for 2008. Following the transfer of the Plan in 2008, no
assumptions are applicable for the Group going forward.

The Group has an unfunded pension commitment relating to three former executives of the Group. At 31 December, the Group’s
commitment was £2.9m (2008: £2.5m). The Group paid £0.1m (2008: £0.1m) in pension payments during the year. The actuarial
loss arising on the commitment, resulting from the changes in assumptions outlined below in 2009, was £0.5m (2008: £nil) before
taxation and £0.4m after taxation (2008: £nil). The cumulative amount of actuarial losses on the commitment recognised in the

36 Contingent assets
Group
The Group has lodged a claim for the repayment of VAT alleging that the tax treatment of gaming machines was inconsistently
applied and therefore breached the European Union’s principle of fiscal neutrality. In August 2008, the VAT and Duties Tribunal
ruled that, from November 2003 at least, the UK’s VAT treatment of certain types of gaming machine was inconsistent with the
European Union’s principle of fiscal neutrality. This was an interim decision and a second stage was heard at the VAT and Duties
Tribunal in October 2009. The latest ruling was also in favour of the Group. Consequently, the Group’s claim is valid for the entire
period under dispute (2002-2005). The Group has requested payment of the claim, although HMRC have appealed and final
resolution may take a number of years. The claim is estimated to be worth as much as £26m plus interest.
In December 2009, HMRC issued guidance that claims for VAT overpaid on main stage bingo will be treated in the same way as the
Group’s successful claim for overpaid VAT on interval bingo received in November 2008. The Group has submitted a claim for VAT
overpaid on main stage bingo for periods from July 2004. If successful, the Group estimates the net cash benefit to be as much as
£16m plus interest. HMRC are continuing to appeal the ruling of the VAT and Duties Tribunal that the application of VAT on some
games of interval bingo contravened the European Unions principle of fiscal neutrality and its appeal will be heard at the Court of
Appeal in April 2010. In the event of an adverse ruling on the interval bingo claim, the Group’s main stage bingo claim will not be
paid and the interval bingo claim will have to be repaid (see note 37).
The Group has lodged a number of claims following the House of Lords decision in the Conde Nast/Fleming cases on the applicability
of the three year cap that HMRC introduced to limit VAT reclaims. These claims, which had to be submitted by March 2009, are
based on management’s best estimates from the information available and the Group expects the valuation of each claim to be
reviewed by HMRC before settlement. In a number of cases, the Conde Nast claims are subject to successful outcomes of other
claims for the repayment of VAT (including the claims in the preceding paragraphs), the outcome of which is not certain.
One of the claims identified above is for the repayment of VAT on some games of interval bingo covering the period from 1996
back to 1980, when the interval bingo product was introduced. This claim has been made under the Conde Nast/Fleming ruling
detailed above and HMRC issued guidance in January 2010 that this type of claim could be paid once the amount has been verified.
As a result, the Group anticipates receiving as much as £35m plus interest during 2010.
The Group has not recognised any gain in its financial statements at 31 December 2009 in respect of the above items.
37 Contingent liabilities
Group
On 10 November 2008, the Group received £59.1m in overpaid VAT from HMRC, following the VAT and Duties Tribunal’s ruling
in May 2008 that the application of VAT to some games of interval bingo contravened the European Union’s principle of fiscal
neutrality. HMRC appealed the ruling of the Tribunal at a High Court hearing in March 2009, but the judgement found in favour of
the Group. The benefit from the ruling on interval bingo continued to be recognised in the accounts for the first 17 weeks of 2009,
covering the period to 26 April 2009, when bingo became exempt from VAT. HMRC lodged an appeal to the Court of Appeal on 6
July 2009, but the hearing is not due to be held until April 2010. In the event of an adverse ruling, Rank would be required to repay
the £59.1m and amounts not paid over for the period from July 2008 to 26 April 2009 plus interest.

Shareholderinformation
OTHER INFORMATION D
A wide range of information for shareholders and investors
is available in the Investors area of the Rank Group website:
www.rank.com.
Ordinary shares
There was a total of 390,529,314 ordinary 13 8/9p shares in issue
at 31 December 2009, which were held by 20,224 shareholders.
Share price information
The latest information on the Rank ordinary share price is
available in the Investors area of the www.rank.com website.
Closing share prices for the previous business day are quoted in
most daily newspapers and, throughout the working day, time-
delayed share prices are broadcast on the text pages of the
principal UK television channels.
Capital gains tax
For the purpose of calculating UK capital gains tax on a disposal
of ordinary shares in the Company held since 31 March 1982
(including shares held in the predecessor company, The Rank
Organisation Plc), the price of the Company’s ordinary shares
at that date was 190p per share. This price should be adjusted
for the effects of the rights issue in January 1990, the enhanced
share alternative in July 1993, the sub-division and consolidation
of shares in March 1994, the enhanced scrip dividend in March
1998, and the 18 for 25 sub-division and share consolidation
(aligned with the 65p special dividend payment) which took
place in March 2007. More information regarding these
adjustments is available on the www.rank.com website.
Share dealing services
The sale or purchase of shares must be done through a
stockbroker or share dealing service provider. The London Stock
Exchange provides a “Locate a broker” facility on its website
which gives details of a number of companies offering share
dealing services.
For more information, please visit the Private investors
section at www.londonstockexchange.com
Please note that the directors of the Company are not
seeking to encourage shareholders to either buy or to sell
shares. Shareholders in any doubt about what action to take
are recommended to seek financial advice from an independent
financial adviser authorised pursuant to the Financial Services
and Markets Act 2000.
Shareholder security
Shareholders are advised to be wary of any unsolicited advice,
offers to buy shares at a discount, or offers of free reports about
the Company. Details of any share dealing facilities that the
Company endorses will be included in Company mailings or
on our website. More detailed information can be found at
www.moneymadeclear.fsa.gov.uk.
Payment of dividends
The Company is no longer operating a dividend re-investment
plan. Shareholders may find it more convenient to make
arrangements to have dividends paid directly to their bank
account. The advantages of this are that the dividend is credited
to a shareholder’s bank account on the payment date, there is
no need to present cheques for payment and there is no risk
of cheques being lost in the post.
To set up a dividend mandate or to change an existing
mandate please contact Equiniti Limited, our registrar, whose
contact details appear below. Alternatively, shareholders who
use Equiniti’s Shareview can log on to www.shareview.co.uk
and follow the online instructions.
Shareview
The Shareview portfolio service from the Company’s registrar
gives shareholders more control of their Rank shares and other
investments including:
• direct access to data held for them on the share register
including recent share movements and dividend details;
• a recent valuation of their portfolio; and
• a range of information and practical help for shareholders
including how you can elect to receive communications
electronically.
It is easy and free to set up a portfolio – shareholders
will just need the shareholder reference printed on their proxy
form or dividend stationery. Please visit the following website
for more details: www.shareview.co.uk.
ShareGift
Shareholders with a very small number of shares, the value of
which may make it uneconomical to sell, may wish to consider
donating them to charity through ShareGift, a registered charity
administered by The Orr Mackintosh Foundation.
Further information about ShareGift is available at
www.sharegift.org or by writing to:

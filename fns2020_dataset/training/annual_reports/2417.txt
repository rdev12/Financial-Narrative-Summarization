DV Howells Braemar Seascope Group plc  Annual Report 2007     
Chairman’s statement
The Group is performing well and has posted results reflecting 
another good year. The adjusted pre-tax profits increased by 7% 
to £11.0m compared to £10.3m last year and adjusted earnings 
per share were 37.11 pence compared to 37.03 in 2006. Reported 
pre-tax profits were £10.1m (2006: £10.3m) and reported earnings 
per share were 32.29 pence. The difference between the adjusted 
and reported result was attributable to an impairment charge 
taken in the first half of £0.95m. 
The Group’s shipbroking operations benefited from trading 
conditions which remained generally favourable during the year 
and performed well though the results were adversely affected 
by a weaker US dollar. Continued newbuilding activity and an 
increase in long-term chartering business saw growth in the 
forward order book to a record level which helps to underpin 
future years’ earnings. We expanded our international footprint 
through the establishment of new dry cargo chartering offices  
in Singapore and Sao Paolo and we also consolidated our  
interest in the container market through the acquisition of 
the 50% minority interest in Braemar Container Shipping and 
Chartering Limited for £1.2m.
 
Our strategy for extending the range of shipping services 
provided has begun to bear fruit and our non-broking businesses 
contributed 17% of the adjusted operating profits, driven by 
strong year-on-year income and profit growth from both Cory 
Brothers and Wavespec. During the year these services were 
expanded with the creation of an environmental services division 
through the acquisition of DV Howells in March 2006 and Hi-bar 
in September 2006 for a maximum combined consideration of 
£0.9m. DV Howells provides pollution incident response services 
for the oil majors and other transportation companies and we 
are very proud of the role they played and their continuing 
involvement in the environmental protection of the UK coastline 
where the container vessel MSC Napoli is beached. We have also 
increased our presence in the UK ship agency market through the 
purchase of Gorman Cory which will take place over two years. 
We are pleased with the progress made in building our non-
broking businesses and we expect to continue to invest in these 
sectors as attractive opportunities arise.
The Directors are recommending that the name of the company 
changes to Braemar Shipping Services PLC. The name Braemar 
Seascope is identifiable with our shipbroking business and we 
do not intend to change the name for our shipbroking trading 
companies around the world. However, the Group has now 
successfully extended its services beyond shipbroking and will 
continue to do so. We have reached a point when we consider it 
both helpful and appropriate to recognise the broadening of the 
business with a change in the name which reflects its current and 
future composition.
The Directors are recommending for approval at the Annual 
General Meeting a final dividend of 12.25 pence per ordinary 
share, to be paid on 31 July 2007 to shareholders on the register 
at the close of business on 6 July 2007. Together with the 6.75p 
interim dividend the Company’s dividend for the year is 19.0 
pence (2006: 18.0 pence), a rise of 5.6%. The dividend is covered 
2.0 times by adjusted earnings.
These results are a testament to the skill, hard work and 
commitment of staff across the Group and on behalf of the  
Board I thank all concerned for their contribution to this year. 
After many years as an executive director Iain Shaw retired from 
the Group in June 2006 and I would like to express our gratitude 
for his significant contribution both as a shipbroker and director. 
I am delighted that Denis Petropoulos and Quentin Soanes 
agreed to join the Board in January 2007 as executive directors. 
They have both worked for the Group for many years and their 
experience will be of great value in the future.
Shipping has experienced large and rapid changes in freight 
rates and vessel values over the course of the last five years. This 
volatility is likely to remain while the demand for seaborne trade 
continues to grow and we expect our broadly-based shipping 
services business to benefit while these conditions persist.

“  Our business is more

ever and we see further  
opportunities to expand”
Chief Executive’s review of the business
The progress made across the Group over the last year continues 
to be encouraging. All of our operations have been performing 
well and we have grown the business in line with our strategy of 
expanding into complementary service areas and by increasing 
our geographic presence. We now have more than 400 employees 
worldwide based at 35 offices, of which eight are overseas, and 
our shipping services business is more diverse than ever before. 
With shipping activity remaining strong, we see no shortage of 
opportunity to continue our controlled growth in the same vein.  
A review of the market and our activities during the year is set  
out by segment below.
Shipbroking 
Shipbroking activities are undertaken under the name of 
Braemar Seascope from offices in London, Shanghai, Beijing, 
Singapore, Melbourne, Perth and Aberdeen. Revenues in 2006/7 
increased to £40.5m (2006: £39.7m) and adjusted operating 
profits were £8.7m (2006: £9.0m). The operating profit margin 
(before impairment charge) for the division was 21.6% in 2007 
(2006: 22.7%), reflecting a shift towards lower margin chartering 
business in the year. There was an average of 205 employees of 
whom 68% were fee earning and 25% were based overseas  
(2006: 189 employees).
In each of the dry market sectors freight rates dipped from the 
start of our financial year when the Baltic Dry Index (“BDI”) 
stood at 2,708, reaching a low in May 2006 (BDI 2,416) before 
recovering over the remainder of the financial year (BDI 4,765). 
The BDI currently stands at 6,585. The capesize market curve 
was particularly steep in both directions with the strong recovery 
driven by Chinese demand, during which we were able to 
conclude a number of long-term period charters at high rates. 
There has also been a considerable growth in vessel supply 
although there is still sufficient market tightness to produce 
significant fluctuations in rates from time to time. Currently 
the market is affected by load port congestion, especially in 
the east coast coal ports of Australia. This has helped reduce 
the supply of vessels and thereby to strengthen freight rates. 
Following our investment in Australia, this year we opened an 
office in Singapore and in Sao Paolo, both of which are becoming 
increasingly important as shipping centres. In view of the 
strength of the market and our investments, we expect our  
dry activities to become a more significant part of our business  
in future.
Deep sea tanker chartering increased both income and 
transaction volumes over last year, and the value of longer term 
period business grew significantly over the year. At the start of 
the financial year the Baltic Dirty Tanker Index (“BDTI”) stood at 
1,109 falling to a low of 951 in April 2006 but recovering strongly 
to reach a 12 month peak of 1,602 in August and closing at 1,101 
on 28 February 2007. It currently stands at 1,296. The weakness 
in tanker freight rates at the start of the financial year was caused 
by OPEC cutbacks which led to reduced refining. However, as the 
oil price rose from $60/barrel to $70/barrel supply restraints 
were relaxed and refineries moved quickly to source crude which 
became much in demand causing a rapid rise in freight rates. 
With increased refining came the increased demand for the 
carriage of refined products and although rates did not return to 
the high levels of the previous year, they did remain steady for 
most of the second and third quarters. In addition the constant 
Chinese and Indian demand for crude supplied not only from the 
Middle East but also from Atlantic producers in West Africa and 
the Caribbean maintained a healthy employment of large crude 
carriers. Delivery of newbuildings into the tanker markets during 
the course of 2006 has increased the deadweight available to 
carry oil which has meant that after the market weakened in 
the fourth quarter, rates did not recover as quickly following the 
increased volumes at the start of our new year. However, it is 
encouraging to note that despite the steady growth of the fleet 
during the first quarter of our new year the spot market was 
notably active with short-term demand for crude. As the year 
progresses we expect to see continuing demand from the major 
refining centres, but the growth in the tanker fleet prior to the 
phasing out of older tonnage will mean the market is likely to  
be more volatile.
Alan Marsh 
Chief Executive     Braemar Seascope Group plc  Annual Report 2007
Offshore had its best ever year driven by high activity levels and 
charter rates and the successful conclusion of some good sale 
and purchase and project transactions, some of which will benefit 
the company for many years to come. Worldwide oil and gas 
exploration has been very active and continues to be so, giving 
confidence for the coming year.
We consolidated our container business midway through the 
financial year with the purchase of the remaining 50% interest 
in Braemar Container Shipping and Chartering Limited in August 
2006. After a reasonably strong market in the first half of the year 
container charter rates fell in the second half of the year before 
recovering strongly during the first quarter of 2007. During 2006 
global growth in container volume was 10.8% and fleet capacity 
grew by 16.5%, and in 2007 the growth is expected to be in the 
region of 10-11% for container volumes and 14.5-15% for growth 
in fleet capacity. The desk performed well throughout the year in 
a rapidly changing market and we expect a similar performance 
to last year given the forecast growth in capacity, providing world 
trade is maintained. 
As at 1 March 2007 we had concluded business that should 
generate revenues in excess of $30m in the new financial year  
(1 March 2006 for the next twelve months: US$26m). 
Ship agency, forwarding and logistics
Revenues increased to £23.4m (2006: £15.9m) and operating 
profits were £0.9m (2006: £0.6m) and the Company’s 
achievements were also recognised by its customers when in 
April 2007 Cory was voted number one in the Lloyds Loading  
List Customer Service Awards 2006. 
The year overall has seen Cory consolidating its acquisitions 
made late 2005 and early 2006, and concentrating on 
organic growth with average staffing increasing from 120 to 
149. Growth was driven primarily by the liner, logistics and 
forwarding business, where revenues showed month-on-month 
improvements throughout the financial year. 
Chief Executive’s review of the business continued
Deep water construction 
vessel fixed by our offshore 
department for a minimum  
of five years.
The coastal tanker market benefited from larger contract volumes 
and falling bunker costs towards the end of the year providing 
a stimulus to activity. Deep sea chemical parcel tankers had a 
steady year with an upturn in rates in the fourth quarter due to a 
combination of increasing demand and the prospect of the latest 
biofuel regulations coming into force. This trend should continue 
during 2007 through to 2008 and while there will be seasonal 
fluctuations the market is expected to remain firm.
The LPG freight market is expected to strengthen over the next 
twelve months as new product streams and market participants, 
such as China, compete in the market for tonnage. 
The LNG transportation market remains at low levels for short-
term employment due to the delivery of new vessels, committed 
for long-term LNG transportation, the projects for which have 
since been delayed by between one and three years. However, 
such vessels will be absorbed in the long-term projects that 
they were originally intended for and while there are some 
uncommitted vessels in the market these will, in time, achieve 
gainful employment. 
Sale and purchase enjoyed another very successful year. There 
was a shift in the business with less high value second-hand 
transactions than in 2005/6 but a record year for newbuildings 
where the income is received over 2-3 years on average. The 
demand for new ships is borne out in the extended shipyard 
order books and in a tendency for payment terms to reflect 
larger up-front contracted values. The newbuilding forward order 
book is now at its highest level (both in terms of the number 
of ships and commission value) with ship deliveries stretching 
out to 2010/11. Over the last six months there has been a very 
significant increase in the market value of bulk carriers which 
is commensurate with the rise in dry freight rates and we have 
recently concluded a number of transactions at historically high 
values. Demolition business remains a small part of sale and 
purchase activity but we expect it to increase in the coming years 
in line with the phase-out of single hull tankers.
Significant business is 
transacted by the Group for 
export of minerals from Port 
Hedland, Australia. Braemar Seascope Group plc  Annual Report 2007     
The increase in liner, logistics and forwarding was driven primarily 
by sustained strong demand with in excess of 13,200 forwarding 
jobs being handled in the year compared with 9,700 last year. 
These were mostly on key logistics contracts supplemented 
with a number of one-off projects. Whilst most of the activity 
is handled out of Felixstowe, we have been developing 
forwarding activities from certain existing agency locations, 
thereby increasing the scope and capability of Cory as a whole. 
Planetwide, the forwarding acquisition made in 2005, performed 
in line with our growth expectations. During the year it handled 
1,860 of the forwarding jobs and was also able to add new 
consolidation routes to the Middle East. 
Port agency handled 17% more port calls in 2006/7 maintaining 
a leading position in an increasingly competitive market. New 
income streams commencing in early 2007 should see this 
growth continue through the remainder of 2007 and into 2008. 
The acquisition of the business and assets of Gorman Shipping, 
which handles over 750 vessels per annum concentrated on 
the Mersey and the Manchester Ship Canal, has significantly 
strengthened our UK agency activities. The business has been 
combined with the existing Cory Liverpool office making it one of 
the foremost ships’ agents in the area. Morrison Tours, a highly 
seasonal business linked closely to the cruise industry around 
the UK has added to its customer base and improved the take-up 
of the shore excursions on offer. 
With further new pieces of business being won in both agency 
and liner, logistics and forwarding, activity levels should continue 
to be maintained in all areas in the coming year. 
Technical shipping support – Wavespec
Revenues increased to £6.6m (2006: £5.2m) and operating 
profits were £0.6m (2006: £0.3m) in line with the growth in 
activity levels. The average headcount during the year was 18 
employees (2006: 17 employees) with a further 50 engineers sub-
contracted to clients within this segment (2006: 45 consultants). 
Currently, the company has site supervision teams at three 
shipyards for the construction of up to 48 new LNG vessels in 
connection with the Qatargas II project and this is expected to 
generate a positive contribution for the Company for several 
years. It is also fulfilling a similar role in connection with LNG 
vessel construction for use on the Sakhalin gas project.  
Wavespec has also been active in the development of the 
seaborne transportation of compressed natural gas, working 
with Braemar Seascope to provide technical and commercial 
assistance for a number of projects. 
Environmental services – DV Howells 
DV Howells was acquired in March 2006 and has contributed 
revenue of £3.2m and operating profits of £0.2m in the eleven 
months since it joined the Group. The average headcount 
during the year was 39 full-time employees compared to 
34 at acquisition. The addition of Hi-bar in September 2006 
completed the response coverage across the UK and enhanced 
the Company’s training and consultancy capability. The Company 
has had a busy year and has integrated well into the Group. 
Of particular note is the major role the Company has played 
following the grounding of the mini-bulker Sumni in the Orkney 
Islands and the container vessel MSC Napoli in Devon. Services 
provided, some of which are still on-going, include pollution 
control, beach clearance, decontamination wash-down facility 
and the handling of hazardous container cargoes. The Company 
also won important contracts to provide incident response 
services in Angola and for the Ministry of Defence (“MOD”), both 
of which illustrate the potential of the business to grow in the UK 
and overseas. 
Bunker trading
Revenues increased to £33.4m (2006: £7.7m), representing a  
full year’s contribution, and operating profits were £62,000 
(2006: £30,000).
Bunker sales have been lower than expected due to a 
combination of the drought conditions and high oil prices, which 
has to some extent limited demand in the Australasian region. 
Looking forward, the Australian resources and minerals sector is 
enjoying significant growth which should be a basis for increased 
bunker sales in the future. We are currently in the process of 
reviewing our strategic options with regard to this business.

Financial review
Profits and earnings
Reported pre-tax profits were £10.1m (2006: £10.3m). Adjusted 
pre-tax profits (before an impairment charge) increased by 7% to 
£11.0m on revenues of £107.2m (2006: £68.5m). As indicated at 
the half year, given the performance of all business segments in 
broadly favourable markets, we expected the operating profits 
in the second half of the year to show an improvement over the 
first half. Second half operating profits for 2006/7 were £5.8m 
compared with £4.7m (before impairment) in the first half and 
£4.7m in the second half of 2005/6. The trading improvement 
shows sustained business growth across all segments.
A reconciliation of reported profits to adjusted profits is set out 
in the table below. The impairment charge is not a cash cost and 
arose because at the half year, after a relatively weak market, a 
more prudent view was taken of the estimated future earnings 
from the Australian business.

The weighted average number of shares increased from 19.38m

Margins
Operating profits are stated after deducting both cost of sales 
and operating costs. Cost of sales comprises bunker payments, 
freight and haulage and payments to sub-contractors. The 
operating profit margin (before impairment) of 9.8% in 2007 
compares with 14.4% in 2006. The reduction is mainly due to the 
increased relative contributions of the non-broking businesses 
which generate returns at lower margins but which are less 
volatile. The margin in shipbroking was lower due to an increase 
in operating costs totalling 3.4% mainly in respect of staff costs 
and the establishment of new overseas offices. A summary of the 
segment margins is set out below.
Operating margins before impairment 
  2006/7  2005/6
Shipbroking 21.6% 22.7%
Ship agency, forwarding and logistics 3.9% 3.6%
Technical shipping support 8.3% 5.6%
Environmental services 7.0% n/a
 14.1% 16.2%
Bunker trading 0.2% 0.4%
Total 9.8% 14.4%
Foreign exchange
The average rate of exchange for conversion of US dollar income 
during the financial year, after taking account of hedging, was 
$1.86/£ (2006: $1.80/£) and at 28 February 2007 the balance 
sheet rate for conversion was $1.97/£ (28 February 2006: 
$1.75/£). If the 2006/7 US dollar denominated income had been 
translated at the 2005/6 average exchange rate, it would have 
been higher by approximately £1.2 million. At 28 February 2007 
the Group held forward currency contracts to sell US$6 million at 
an average rate of $1.95/£ and currency options giving the right 
to sell US$1.1 million for AU$ at a rate of 0.78. 
Taxation
The tax rate on reported profit before tax was 35.8% (2006: 
30.3%). The underlying rate, excluding the share of net profits 
from joint ventures and the effect of the impairment charge,  
was 33.3% (2006: 31.0%). Braemar Seascope Group plc  Annual Report 2007     

Cash flow and acquisitions
The cash balance increased over the year by £1.0m to £14.6m 
(2006: £13.6m). Operating cash flow generated in the year was 
£9.7m, from which the major cash outflows before expenditure 
on acquisitions were £0.7m for the purchase of fixed assets, 
£3.4m on corporation tax and £3.6m for dividend payments. 
Net cash expended on acquiring businesses was £2.5m, offset 
by £0.7m of cash in the acquired balance sheets, in respect of DV 
Howells and Hi-bar (£0.6m), 50% of Braemar Container Shipping 
and Chartering (£1.2m), 41% of Gorman Cory (£0.2m) and 
Planetwide (£0.5m). This does not include further potential cash 
consideration of, in aggregate, £1.1m dependent on profitability.
Treasury risk management
The Board sets the Group’s treasury policy covering financing 
decisions and treasury risk management, the objective of which 
is to manage the Group’s financial risk exposures in an effective 
manner. The Finance Director is responsible for day-to-day 
treasury risk monitoring and activity which is reviewed by the 
Board through regular reporting. The Group uses financial 
instruments to hedge underlying exposures and not for 
speculative purposes.
Liquidity risk: The Group has no net debt and did not have at 
any time during the year. An overdraft facility of £3.0m with the 
Group’s principal relationship bank, the Royal Bank of Scotland 
plc, is maintained for financial flexibility and in order to improve 
treasury efficiency and performance. 
Foreign exchange risk: The majority of the Company’s 
shipbroking, technical services and bunker trading income is US 
dollar denominated and changes in the rate of exchange relative 
to £ sterling, and to a lesser extent the Australian and Singapore 
dollar, can have an effect on the reported results and net assets. 
From time to time the Group enters into forward foreign exchange 
contracts and currency options to limit the effect of currency 
fluctuations. 
Interest rate risk: The Group has an exposure to interest rates in 
relation to its cash balances, the majority of which are held in the 
UK. Surplus cash (in £s or US$s) is deposited at institutions with 
strong credit ratings and deposits are short term in nature.

newbuilding transactions, time (or period) charters where  
income is earned over the life of the charter and uncompleted  
spot transactions. 
The majority of shipping transactions is concluded in US dollars 
with our commission income also being derived in US dollars.
Ship agency, forwarding and logistics: Ship agency, forwarding 
and logistics is undertaken by Cory Brothers which has 19 offices 
most of which are based in UK ports. Its income is fee-based and 
substantially £ sterling denominated. Fees are earned every time 
a ship makes a call into port, when the company is the appointed 
agent. Agency services provided include settlement of port dues, 
handling customs clearance and making ad-hoc arrangements 
for the vessel as required. Fees are normally determined under 
multi-year contracts which are often long-standing but technically 
terminable at short notice. Cory Brothers is agent for a number of 
major oil, gas and chemical companies and other ship owners. Its 
income is therefore a function of the number of clients it has and 
their level of port call activity.
The freight forwarding and logistics business operates both in 
tandem with the agency business and separately in its own right. 
In some instances the business is conducted under contract on the 
basis of an agreed tariff per shipment with the shipment volumes 
determined by the client, while in others cases the company 
receives a fee per box handled either as an import or an export. 
There are also individual forwarding projects which are negotiated 
separately. In all cases volumes and client activity levels are a key 
factor in driving income and profits, along with the company’s 
ability to find cost-effective solutions to suit the logistics needs. 
Volumes are difficult to predict and the company must seek and  
win a regular flow of new business to grow.
Technical shipping support: Wavespec provides independent, 
technical shipping services for ship owners and charterers 
who have taken in newbuildings from owners on long-term 
commitments. It is able to offer expertise in all types of vessel 
construction but has built up a reputation as a market leader for 
technical services in the construction of LNG carriers. 
Generally the business is divided between ships’ plan approval work 
which is normally quoted for on a project basis, and site supervisory 
work covering the vessel’s construction at the shipyard. This is 
operated on an agreed day rate basis for each engineer provided 
under contract to the client. Many construction projects will involve 
both plan approval and site supervisory services during the life of 
the project. The shipping engineering skills Wavespec has access 
to mean it is well placed to play a leading role in the development 
of new designs and technologies. The Group is currently playing 
a leading role in both a technical and commercial capacity in the 
development of seaborne transportation of compressed natural gas, 
and Wavespec is an integral part of the Group’s advisory capability 
in such an area. In addition Wavespec also acts as consultants in 
the offshore sector carrying out FMEA (Failure Mode and Effect 
Analyses) and DP (Dynamic Positioning) assessments. 
Environmental services: DV Howells provides a wide variety  
of environmental services from nine bases around the UK, 
principally for customers operating in the UK in the shipping, 
transport and oil industries, and other customers whose activities

Principal activities and review of business
The Company operates through a number of subsidiaries and 
joint ventures. A review of the Group’s activities including 
risks, business drivers, key performance indicators and future 
prospects is contained in the Chief Executive’s review of the 
business on pages 4 to 9. The Group’s business segments and 
their activities are described below.
Shipbroking: The shipbroking market is both international and 
fragmented. While there are only a small number of broking 
houses that provide the full range of services we provide there 
are many private brokers specialising in niche areas of the 
shipping market, which makes market share difficult to assess. 
Few, if any, contractual or exclusive client relationships exist, but 
many relationships have been created and developed over a long 
time based on the quality of service and advice provided. We 
represent a significant number of major ship owners, charterers, 
shipyards, trading houses, banks, demolition businesses and 
other commercial ventures based around the globe. There is no 
particular bias or theme to our client base. 
The shipbroking business is never a principal in a shipping 
transaction – it does not own ships or charter vessels for its own 
account. Income is derived from commissions earned on shipping 
transactions in which the Group has acted as broker, and is 
therefore a function of the number of transactions concluded for 
delivery in the year and the average freight rates or vessel values 
applicable to those transactions.
Transaction numbers are influenced by a combination of the 
supply and demand for ships, the number of skilled, experienced 
brokers operating in the group, and the competition from other 
broking houses (both for transactions and brokers). The demand 
for ships is related among other factors to world trade, economic 
growth particularly in the major economies, interest and 
exchange rates, and price and supply of raw materials, mainly 
for oil, iron ore and coal. The supply of available ships for a 
particular market is affected by factors such as shipyard capacity, 
order backlog, the propensity for yards to build ships of a certain 
type, speed of vessels, and regulations on ships’ ages which 
may accelerate scrapping. Overlaying all of these considerations 
are other events that can have a significant short-term impact 
on trade and trading patterns and may, for the most part, be 
unpredictable. Most importantly, the supply of oil or refined 
products is subject to OPEC and other political decisions, war and 
the threat of war, new pipelines and global warming. In the dry 
market the demand for coal and ore has been driven by industrial 
and economic growth in the Far East with short-term factors such 
as port congestion and raw material contractual pricing also 
having an influence on freight rates.
Part of the income in any particular year is derived from business 
that has already been concluded but has yet to complete, 
because for example, the delivery of the vessel has not occurred. 
Similarly at the end of the year some of the transacted spot 
business may not have been completed and therefore not 
invoiced at year-end. This forward book of business comprises  Braemar Seascope Group plc  Annual Report 2007     
 
interface with ports, motorways, railways and airports. Services 
provided include carrying out the post-incident clean up of oil, 
chemical, biological and radiological incidents; tank cleaning; 
environmental surveys; contingency planning; consultancy and 
training for customers including the IMO, overseas governments, 
coastguards, ports, harbours and international oil companies.  
As part of its role DV Howells maintains a response network with 
full UK coverage, comprising emergency equipment and a team  
of incident response staff on permanent 24-hour standby. 
Some of its business is provided under multi-year contracts 
typically including a retainer fee and an agreed incident call out 
rate. Key contracts of this type are with the Maritime Coastguard 
Agency, Network Rail and the MOD. Other business arises on a 
one-off basis as incidents occur and the company is invited to 
tender and respond. Since most income is related to the number 
of incidents or the time required for post-incident services to 
be completed, the predictability of income above a core level is 
not easy. As part of the Group DV Howells is well placed to grow 
its customer relationships and this development should see the 
benefit of a greater predictive pattern to the overall business.
Bunker trading: This activity is undertaken from Australia and 
involves the purchase of bunkers from oil companies against 
matched sales to ship owners or operators.
Results and dividends
The group profit before taxation for the year amounted to 
£10.1m (2006: £10.3m). Details of the results are set out in the 
consolidated income statement on page 23 and in the related 
notes. Details of dividends paid during the period are set out 
in note 8 to the Accounts. The Directors are recommending the 
payment of a final dividend of 12.25 pence per share on 31 July 
2007 to shareholders on the register at the close of business  
on 6 July 2007.

also have an interest in 331,495 (2006: 321,495) ordinary 10p 
shares held by Close Trustees Guernsey Limited on behalf of 
the Employee Share Ownership Plan. During the year the Board 
resolved to acquire additional shares in the market to be used 
for employee share awards. 10,000 shares were acquired at an 
average price of 373 pence.
The Directors held no material interest in any contract of 
significance entered into by the Company or its subsidiaries 
during the period. There have been no changes in Directors’ 
interests between 28 February 2007 and 10 May 2007.
Share capital
During the year ended 28 February 2007 the Company issued 
354,573 new shares pursuant to the exercise of employee  
share options. 
Substantial shareholdings
The Directors have been notified or are aware of the following 
persons who directly or indirectly are interested in 3% or more

Purchase of own ordinary shares
The Directors are authorised to make market purchases of the 
Company’s ordinary shares under an authority granted by the 
Annual General Meeting held on 21 June 2006. No purchases were 
made under this authority during the year. In accordance with ABI 
Investor Protection Guidelines, the maximum number of ordinary 
shares which may be acquired is 10% or less of the Company’s 
issued ordinary shares as at 10 May 2007. The Directors will 
seek the renewal of this authority at the 2007 Annual General 
Meeting in Resolution 10 in accordance with the Company’s 
Articles of Association. The Directors have no immediate intention 
of exercising the authority but they will keep the matter under 
review. Purchases will only be made if they result in an expected 
increase in earnings per share and will take into account other 
available investment opportunities, appropriate gearing levels 
and the overall position of the Company. Any shares purchased 
in accordance with this authority will subsequently be cancelled. 
The total number of options to subscribe for shares that were 
outstanding as at 10 May 2007 was 700,544, being 3.5% of the 
issued share capital. If the authority to purchase shares is used 
in full, the proportion of issued share capital represented by this 
number of options would amount to 4.1%.
Employment policies
The Group recognises that its employees are a key stakeholder in 
the business and that they play a vital role in its future success. 
The involvement of employees in the Group’s performance is 
encouraged where appropriate through participation in the annual 
discretionary bonuses and share options that may be granted 
under an approved share option scheme. The Group keeps its 
employees informed of all matters affecting their interests through 
managerial consultation and internal memoranda.      Braemar Seascope Group plc  Annual Report 2007
 
In preparing these financial statements the Directors are required to:
•  Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
•  Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
•  State that the financial statements comply with IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union and IFRSs issued by IASB; and 
•  Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis, 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will 
continue in business, in which case there should be supporting 
assumptions or qualifications as necessary. 
The Directors confirm that they have complied with the above 
requirements in preparing the financial statements. The Directors 
are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of 
the Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
comply with the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the Group

when the report is approved, the following applies:
•  So far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and
•  He has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a

Report of the directors for the year ended 28 February 2007 continued
The Group seeks to achieve consistency in its employment policies 
although differences in local conditions and legal requirements 
can arise due to the international nature of the business. The 
Group is committed to equal opportunities for all employees 
with full and fair consideration being given to applications 
for employment by those with a disability. Where an employee 
becomes disabled while in employment of a Group company, every 
effort is made to find continuing employment where possible. 
Community and environment
The Group takes an active role in environmental and community 
matters. Its activities in these areas vary by division. Braemar 
Seascope’s London office is located adjacent to a state school 
of multi-denominational faiths for which the Company has given 
funds to improve facilities and certain employees have voluntarily 
become involved in reading to pupils and as part of the school’s 
governance. The office is also actively working on a paper 
recycling initiative. DV Howells provides its clients with pollution 
response services including incident clean-up, training staff 
and assisting in developing response plans for environmental 
incidents. Wavespec is involved in environmental considerations 
through the development of designs for new liquefied natural gas 
and compressed natural gas carriers. The Group seeks to comply 
with all applicable regulations and legislation.
Payments to suppliers
Group companies are responsible for agreeing the terms and 
conditions under which business transactions with their suppliers 
are conducted. It is Group policy that payments to suppliers are 
made in accordance with these terms, provided that the supplier 
is also complying with all relevant terms and conditions. The 
Company has no trade creditors.
Donations
During the year the group made charitable donations amounting  
to £20,662 (2006: £26,781) to a range of different charities.  
No political donations were made during the period.
Financial instruments
The Group’s financial risk management objectives and policies 
are set out in corporate governance on pages 15 to 17.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect  
of financial statements
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have prepared the Group and Parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. In 
preparing these financial statements, the directors have also 
elected to comply with IFRSs, issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The financial statements are 
required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the 
Group for that period. Braemar Seascope Group plc  Annual Report 2007     
 
Braemar Seascope Group plc is committed to ensuring high 
standards of corporate governance. This statement together 
with the remuneration report on pages 18 to 21 describes how 
the Company has applied the principles of good corporate 
governance during the year ended 28 February 2007. The 
Board endorses the main principles and provisions set out in 
the Combined Code on Corporate Governance of the Financial 
Reporting Council (“The Combined Code”), which was published 
on 1 July 2003. The Board believes that the Company has been 
compliant with the Code throughout the year.
The Board
The Board is responsible to shareholders for the effective 
direction and control of the Group and it aims to provide 
entrepreneurial leadership within a framework of prudent and 
effective controls enabling risks to be assessed and managed.
The Board currently comprises four independent non-executive 
Directors and four executive Directors. 
The non-executive Directors, none of whom has fulfilled an 
executive role within the Company, are appointed for an initial 
three-year term serving under letters of engagement, which 
contain a formal one-month notice period. Sir Graham Hearne 
chairs the Board and is not a member of any of the Board’s 
sub-committees. Richard Agutter is the senior independent 
non-executive Director and he chairs the Audit Committee; 
John Denholm chairs the Remuneration Committee and David 
Moorhouse chairs the Nominations Committee. 
The executive Directors are engaged under service agreements, 
each of which can be terminated at 12 months’ notice. During the 
year Iain Shaw retired as an executive Director on 21 June 2006, 
and Quentin Soanes and Denis Petropoulos were appointed 
executive Directors on 10 January 2007. 
The Board believes that its current composition is appropriate 
having regard to the Company’s size and activities. 
The Board met seven times during the year and the attendance 
by the Directors is set out below. Board meetings include reviews 
of financial and business performance and consideration and 
monitoring of business risks and opportunities. The following 
matters are specifically reserved for the Board’s consideration 
and approval:
• The Group strategy;
• The Group budget;
• Major capital expenditure, disposals or leasing arrangements;
• Choice of key corporate advisors;
• Acquisitions and disposals;
•  Group financial and treasury policy including dividends  
and borrowing;
•  Establishing Board committees and setting their terms  
of reference; and
• Internal control arrangements.
On a periodic basis the Board receives reports on its activities 
from the senior management of a subsidiary company or a head 
of department. All directors are provided with appropriate and 
timely information and are properly briefed on Board matters. In 
the furtherance of his duties any director may take independent 
professional advice or receive training, if necessary, at the 
Company’s expense. The executive Directors (including those 
appointed during the year) attended a briefing on their legal 
responsibilities as directors provided by the Group’s legal advisor.
 
During the year the Board and its committees conducted a review 
of the effectiveness of their operations. The review process 
entailed individual meetings of the Chairman and each Director 
and the completion of an assessment questionnaire by each 
Director for submission to the Company Secretary. Non-executive 
Directors meet without the presence of executive Directors from 
time to time.
Under the Company’s Articles of Association, Directors should 
submit themselves for re-election every three years. The 
Director retiring by rotation at the Annual General Meeting and 
offering himself for re-election is Alan Marsh. Quentin Soanes 
and Denis Petropoulos are offering themselves for appointment 
by shareholders. The Nominations Committee and the Board all 
unanimously support these elections. Biographical information 
on the Directors can be found on pages 10 and 11 of this Annual 
Report and Accounts.
Relations with shareholders
The Board recognises the importance of maintaining good 
communications with both institutional and private shareholders. 
For several years the Group has pursued an active investor 
relations programme conducted primarily through regular 
meetings of the Chief Executive and Finance Director with existing 
and potential institutional investors following both the interim 
and preliminary announcements of the results of the Group. 
Feedback on shareholder meetings is provided via the Group’s 
corporate stockbroker or public relations advisor. Corporate 
announcements are also made available on the Company’s 
website, which can be accessed at: www.braemarseascope.com
The Company encourages attendance at its Annual General  
Meeting where each resolution is separately put to the meeting  
 and where the Chairman and/or Chief Executive makes a statement 
on the current year’s performance to date and the near-term 
financial outlook.

The Committee places great emphasis on the cost-effectiveness, 
independence and objectivity of the audit function. Company 
policy is that fees paid to auditors for non-audit services do not 
exceed audit fees unless such non-audit services are reviewed and 
approved by the Audit Committee.
In addition to the Audit Committee meetings, the Chairman of the 
Committee has regular meetings with the group audit partner.
Nominations Committee:
Non-executive Directors: David Moorhouse (Chairman),  
Richard Agutter and John Denholm.
The Nominations Committee considers the balance of skills and 
experience of the Board membership and makes recommendations 
to the Board on the appointment of new Directors. For each new 
appointment the Nomination Committee considers, amongst other 
things, the appropriateness of the qualifications and experience 
of the candidate for the role to be fulfilled and their availability 
to devote time to the job. In the case of Denis Petropoulos’s 
appointment, the Nominations Committee considered all these 
factors along with his extensive experience in tanker chartering 
shipbroking. In respect of Quentin Soanes, the Committee followed 
a similar process with particular consideration of his experience 
in shipbroking and also the business development of non-broking 
businesses. These factors made both candidates suitable Directors 
and the Committee did not therefore, use a search firm. Details of 
the Directors’ other professional commitments are set out in the 
biographical details on pages 10 and 11.
The Nominations Committee also reviews the appointment of 
non-executive Directors at the expiration of their three-year service 
letter of appointment.
Remuneration Committee
Non-executive Directors: John Denholm (Chairman), Richard Agutter 
and David Moorhouse. A report of the Remuneration Committee is 
set out on pages 18 to 21.
Risk management and internal control
The Directors acknowledge the requirements of the Combined 
Code and seek to review all aspects of risk management in relation 
to each part of the Group. These risks include, but are not limited 
to, staff errors and/or omissions, non-compliance with industry 
standard procedures, loss of broker teams, effectiveness of internal 
control systems, industry sector consolidation, currency exposure, 
credit risk and the effectiveness of financial control. Management 
monitor these risks through internal management meetings, 
subsidiary board meetings and regular dialogue with departmental 
heads. A summary of key risks and internal controls is prepared 
for consideration at the Audit Committee on an annual basis. The 
Company also holds professional indemnity insurance to an amount 
considered adequate for its size and potential exposure.

Directors. The composition and responsibilities for the Audit, 
Remuneration and Nominations Committee are as follows:
Audit Committee
Non-executive Directors: Richard Agutter (Chairman),  
John Denholm and David Moorhouse.
Although the Board as a whole has a statutory responsibility for 
the preparation and publication of the Company’s accounts, the 
Audit Committee reports to the Board and takes responsibility  
for the following matters:
•  Review of the internal control procedures and risk assessment 
processes;
•  Planning with the external auditors the half-year review and full-
year audit programme including agreement with the external 
auditors of the nature and scope of the audit, together with the 
level of the audit fee set in the context of the overall audit plan;
•  Reviewing with the external auditors their audit findings 
and responses to the matters raised, including any issues or 
reservations the auditors may have;
•  Reviewing the half-year and annual financial statements before 
they are submitted to the Board;
•  Setting the policy on the appointment of the external auditors 
for the supply of non-audit services having regard to the level  
of fees for both audit and non-audit work;
• Reviewing the need for an internal audit department; and
• Reviewing the insurance arrangements for the Group.
Corporate governance for the year ended 28 February 2007 continued Braemar Seascope Group plc  Annual Report 2007     
 
The Directors acknowledge their responsibility for the 
implementation and effectiveness of the Group’s system of 
internal controls. These are designed to identify and counter 
the particular risks to which the Group is exposed. By their 
very nature these controls can only provide reasonable but 
not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
The effectiveness of the system of internal controls has been 
reviewed by the Audit Committee during the year. Due to its 
current size and structure, it has not been considered necessary 
to have a dedicated full-time internal audit function, though the 
need for one is kept under review. 
A Group budget is prepared annually and approved by the Board. 
The performance of the Group and the individual operating 
units are monitored against budget throughout the year and 
significant variances are investigated. Regular re-forecasts for 
the remainder of the financial year are prepared during the year. 
An internal system of checks and authorisations is operated 
and independent audits are conducted in relation to the ISO 
9001:2000 certification, which both Braemar Seascope Limited 
and Cory Brothers Shipping Agency Limited undertake. There is 
also an internal “whistleblowing” procedure through which any 
member of staff may raise, in confidence, any concerns they may 
have about the way the Group is run or business is conducted.
The Group has foreign currency exposure which arises as a result 
of the majority of its shipbroking earnings being denominated in 
US dollars while the majority of its costs are denominated in  
£ sterling. The treasury policy and objective in relation to foreign 
currencies is to limit the exposure to currency risk by covering 
a proportion of expected foreign currency denominated future 
income up to two years forward. This exposure is managed 
through the use of treasury instruments: principally forward 
foreign exchange contracts and currency options. The Group 
manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by pooling 
its UK bank accounts under an offset agreement. The Board 
monitors treasury activity through regular reporting by the Finance 
Director. The Group does not enter into speculative transactions. 
Accountability and audit
A statement of the Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the 
financial statements is included in the Report of the Directors  
on page 14.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and Group has adequate  
resources to continue to trade for the foreseeable future.  
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern  
basis in preparing the accounts.
      Braemar Seascope Group plc  Annual Report 2007
 
Base salary
Each executive Director’s base salary is reviewed annually on 
performance, achievement of objectives and comparative salaries. 
The base salaries of the Chief Executive and the Finance Director 
were increased with effect from 1 March 2006 following  
the 2006 review.
Annual bonus
The Remuneration Committee believes that a significant proportion 
of an executive Director’s overall remuneration package should be 
an annual bonus based on the performance of the Group, in order 
to provide an incentive to management and to align their interests 
with those of the shareholders. The bonus policy, which was 
established two years ago, rewards executives based on achieving 
earnings per share in excess of a hurdle figure. This excess is then 
applied to a weighting selected for each participant. The hurdle 
figure for the year ended 28 February 2007 was 16.4 pence giving 
an excess of 20.7 pence. The Committee raised the hurdle by 3% 
over the prior year taking into account factors such as the relative 
strength and cyclical nature of the shipping markets and their 
influence on the base hurdle figure, the relative importance of less 
cyclical non-broking businesses and the general rate of inflation.
Where an executive Director had specific responsibilities for a 
subsidiary company or section of the Group, the Remuneration 
Committee believes it appropriate that an element of the executive 
Director’s annual bonus should be determined by reference to that 
responsibility. In the year to 28 February 2007 the annual bonus 
awarded to Alan Marsh and James Kidwell was determined solely 
with reference to the performance of the Group and a component of 
the annual bonus awards for Denis Petropoulos and Quentin Soanes 
was determined with reference to the performance of the Group.
The Group also operates a Deferred Bonus Plan (“the plan”) 
whereby part of the annual performance-related bonus is  
delivered in shares, on a discretionary basis, to staff including 
executive Directors. Under the plan the shares are held in an 
employee trust for three years after which the employee beneficiary 
will become absolutely entitled to the shares provided they remain 
in employment with the Group (or have ceased to be employed 
in certain specified circumstances). In respect of the year to 28 
February 2007 awards over 107,500 shares were made at an 
estimated total cost of £531,700.
The annual bonus is not pensionable. Executive Directors may  
elect to sacrifice some or all of their bonus entitlement in favour  
of an equivalent company pension contribution.
Pensions
The Group’s trading subsidiaries operate a number of defined 
contribution pension schemes or make other similar arrangements 
for individual members as appropriate. The assets of the scheme 
are held separately from those of the Company in an independently 
administered fund. The pension cost charge represents 
contributions payable by the Company to the fund and the  
various individual employees’ retirement plans.
The Remuneration Committee comprises the following non-
executive Directors: John Denholm (Chairman), Richard Agutter 
and David Moorhouse. The Chairman and Chief Executive attend 
as required.
The responsibilities of the Committee are:
•  To determine on behalf of the Board and the shareholders the 
Group’s overall policy for executive remuneration;
•  To determine all aspects of the individual remuneration 
packages for each of the executive Directors of the Company, 
including their base salary and all performance-related 
elements including bonus arrangements, profit share schemes, 
equity participation schemes, other long-term incentive 
schemes, pension and other benefits;
•  To review the introduction and to determine the terms of all 
bonus, profit share or equity participation schemes or any other 
schemes intended to reward and incentivise employees of the 
group and to review the participation of the executive Directors 
and senior executives in such schemes, including the award of 
any bonuses and the grant of rights or options thereunder; and
•  To maintain an overview of policy in relation to the 
remuneration and conditions of service of other senior 
executives within the Group.
In discharging these responsibilities the Committee takes advice 
from the Chief Executive, Alan Marsh, and, as appropriate, 
independent consultants. In the current year the Remuneration 
Committee took advice from Nabarro, who also provide legal 
services to the Group, in relation to the Long-Term Incentive  
Plan (“LTIP”). 
Remuneration policy
The remuneration of the executive Directors is determined after a 
review of the individual’s performance and after taking account of 
comparable arrangements for other companies of similar size or 
activity. The Remuneration Committee believes that the executive 
Directors should be rewarded fairly, competitively and at a level 
that will attract, motivate and retain directors of an appropriate 
calibre. The Committee also believes that the Company’s 
remuneration policy should seek to align, so far as possible, the 
executive Directors’ remuneration with the performance of the 
Group. No Director is involved in deciding his own remuneration.
The executive Directors’ remuneration packages are reviewed  
on a regular basis and presently comprise:
• A competitive base salary;
• Annual bonus based on performance;
•  Defined contribution scheme pension contributions linked  
to base salary;
• Life and medical insurance and similar benefits; and
• Share options and LTIP awards.

Benefits
Benefits provided relate mainly to the provision of medical, life 
and permanent health insurance.
Share options
The Company operates a discretionary share option scheme 
called The Braemar Seascope Group 1997 Executive Option 
Scheme (“The 1997 Scheme”) and an all-employee save-as-
you-earn option scheme called The Braemar Seascope Group 
PLC 2003 Savings-Related Share Option Scheme (“The SAYE 
Scheme”). The total number of shares that may be issued or 
issuable in any ten-year period under both schemes (or any  
other Group share schemes) cannot exceed 10% of the  
Company’s issued share capital (calculated at the date of  
grant of the relevant option).
The SAYE Scheme
Under The SAYE Scheme options may be granted to employees 
(including Executive Directors) to acquire a number of shares in 
the future at a price that is up to 20% below the share price at 
the time the option is granted. The grant of the option is linked 
to a contract to make monthly savings to build up the amount 
required to pay the option exercise price. The SAYE Scheme was 
first launched in July 2003 and awards have been made on 4 
August 2003, 10 June 2004, 21 June 2005 and 5 December 2006. 
All employees who participate in The SAYE Scheme are entitled  
to do so on the same terms.
The Remuneration Committee believes The SAYE Scheme, which 
offers staff a tax effective way of saving money and acquiring  
an equity interest in the Company, both helps attract and retain 
staff and aligns the interests of staff and shareholders. As at  
28 February 2007, there were options outstanding over 332,194 
shares under The SAYE Scheme (2006: 397,854 shares) of which 
15,277 shares were under options held by Executive Directors 
(2006: 25,000 shares).
Discretionary options
Under The 1997 Scheme the Remuneration Committee may grant 
options to employees (including executive directors) to acquire 
shares in the Company at a price fixed at the market value at 
the time of grant of the options. Options granted under The 
1997 Scheme can normally only be exercised if the performance 
conditions attached to the options have been met. Under The 
1997 Scheme no employee can hold, in any ten-year period, 
options over shares with a total market value (measured at  
the date of granting the options), which exceeds four times  
his remuneration (excluding benefits in kind).
The table showing the Directors’ share incentives is set out  
on page 21.
Performance conditions
Options granted under The 1997 Scheme have since July 2002 
been subject to a performance condition that the growth in the 
Company’s average adjusted earnings per share over a period of no 
less than three financial years must exceed the growth in the retail 
prices index (RPI) over the corresponding period by no less than 
3% per annum compounded. None of the options granted prior to 
2002 remain outstanding. The performance condition was chosen 
to test whether or not there had been a sustained and significant 
improvement in the Group’s financial performance over a 
continuous period. There is no retesting of performance conditions.
The Remuneration Committee determines whether the 
performance condition has been met using earnings per 
share information contained in the Group’s Annual Report and 
Accounts, after obtaining confirmation from the auditors that  
the calculation has been performed in accordance with the terms 
of the scheme. During the year the Committee determined that 
the options granted in August 2003 had met the performance 
condition and had therefore vested.
The Remuneration Committee considers that discretionary 
share options can be an appropriate method of incentivising 
senior executives. While it is the intention to use the new 
LTIP to incentivise senior management, the grant of options 
under The 1997 Scheme will remain a possibility. However, the 
Remuneration Committee proposes to bring the performance 
conditions attached to any future grant of options under The  
1997 Scheme into line with the performance conditions attached 
to the long-term incentive awards by raising the required rate 
of growth in average adjusted earnings per share from RPI plus 
3% to RPI plus 4%. As at 28 February 2007 there were 368,350 
options outstanding under The 1997 Scheme (2006: 525,000 
shares), of which 35,000 were held by Executive Directors  
(2006: 70,000 shares).
Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”)
The Remuneration Committee established a new LTIP during the 
year which was approved by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting on 21 June 2006. Participation in the plan will initially be 
limited to executive Directors and senior managers.
The LTIP will deliver benefits to participants in the form of either 
an option to subscribe for ordinary shares at nominal value or 
a conditional right to receive ordinary shares. The awards will 
normally vest over a period of three years, provided there has 
been sustained and significant improvement in the Group’s 
financial performance over the corresponding period. It is 
proposed that the performance targets which will apply to  
the initial awards made under the LTIP will be based on  
earnings per share. 
The performance test to be applied to the initial awards is based 
on the Group’s earnings per share over a period of three years. 
The awards will vest as to 50% of the shares if the Group’s 
earnings per share has increased by RPI plus 4% and will vest 
as to 100% of the shares if the Group’s earnings per share has 
increased by RPI plus 10% and will vest as to between 50% and 
100% of the shares on a sliding scale if the Group’s earnings per 
share has increased by RPI plus more than 4% but less than 10%. 
Providing the performance test has been met, the awards will 
vest in three tranches: one third on each of the third, fourth and 
fifth anniversaries of the date of the awards.  0    Braemar Seascope Group plc  Annual Report 2007
 
Non-executive Directors 
The remuneration of the non-executive Directors is determined by 
the Board with reference to comparable organisations and roles.
The performance graph
Set our below is the Company’s total shareholder return 
performance over the last five years compared with the FT all share 
index. The index has been chosen as it represents the overall return 
achieved in the UK equity market.
It is proposed that, following the publication of these accounts, 
awards will be made under the LTIP over 20,000 shares to each  
of the Executive Directors.
Contracts of service
The executive Directors have entered into service agreements 
with the Company and the independent non-executive Directors 
serve under letters of engagement for an initial three-year 
term. In the event of early termination of service contracts, 
each Director is entitled to compensation equal to their basic 
salary and contractual benefits for the notice period as set out 
below. The policy on termination payments to Directors is that 
the Company does not normally make payments beyond its 
contractual obligations. In exceptional circumstances, an  
ex-gratia payment may be considered based on the circumstances 
of the Director’s departure and their past contribution.

John Denholm 
Chairman, Remuneration Committee 
10 May 2007     Braemar Seascope Group plc  Annual Report 2007
 
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and 
consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial 
statements. The other information comprises only the Report of 
the Directors, the unaudited part of the Remuneration Report, the 
Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s review of the business, 
the Corporate Governance Statement and the five year financial 
summary. We consider the implications for our report if we become 
aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies 
with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to 
any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices 
Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence 
relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements 
and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited. 
It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and 
judgments made by the directors in the preparation of the financial 
statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate 
to the group’s and company’s circumstances, consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the 
information and explanations which we considered necessary in 
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or 
error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy 
of the presentation of information in the financial statements and 
the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:

Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union 
are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the 
part of the Remuneration Report to be audited in accordance 
with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, including 
the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the company’s 
members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the 
Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in 
giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other

to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to 
you whether in our opinion the information given in the Report 
of the Directors is consistent with the financial statements. The

and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects 
the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 
Combined Code (2003) specified for our review by the Listing 
Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it 
does not. We are not required to consider whether the board’s

General information
The Group and Company financial statements of Braemar Seascope Group plc for the year ended 28 February 2007 were authorised for issue in 
accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 10 May 2007. Braemar Seascope Group plc is a Public Limited Company incorporated in England 
and Wales.
The term ‘Company’ refers to Braemar Seascope Group plc and ‘Group’ refers to the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings and the 
employee share ownership plan trust.
1.  Accounting policies
a) Basis of preparation
The Group and Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with EU Endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS), IFRIC interpretations and the Companies Act applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
The financial statements have been prepared under the historic cost convention except for the derivative financial instruments, which are measured 
at fair value. 
The Group and Company financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds (£’000) 
except where otherwise indicated.
No income statement is presented for Braemar Seascope Group plc as provided by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985. 
The principal accounting policies adopted in the presentation of these financial statements are set out below.
b) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the accounts of the Group and the Company made up to 28 February each year.
The results of subsidiaries, which are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by the company, are consolidated using the purchase 
method of accounting, from the date on which control of the net assets and operation of the acquired company are effectively transferred to the 
Group. Similarly, the results of subsidiaries divested cease to be consolidated from the date on which control of the net assets and operations 
are transferred out of the Group. Control exists where the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to 
obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The interest of minority shareholders is stated at the minority’s proportion of the value of the assets and liabilities recognised and is presented 
separately within total equity in the consolidated balance sheet.
Investments in joint ventures and associates and where the Group has significant influence but not control are equity accounted and carried in 
the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the associate or joint venture, less any impairment in 
value. The income statement reflects the Group’s share of the post-tax result of the joint venture or associate.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
c) Use of estimates and critical judgements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that 
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during 
the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, events or actions, actual results ultimately 
may differ from those estimates.  Principal areas where the assumptions and estimates have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the 
carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are estimated impairment of goodwill (see note 11) and provisions (see note 23).
d) Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the Company and the revenue can be 
reliably measured.
Revenue of the Group consists of commission arising from tanker and dry cargo charter broking, sale and purchase broking, offshore broking, 
financial consultancy arrangement fees, fees for the supply of technical and agency services, fees for environmental services and income for the 
supply of bunkers. The policies for accounting for revenue are as follows:
 i)  Shipbroking – income is recognised when the Company has a contractual entitlement to commission, normally the point at which there is 
completion of contractual terms between the principals of a transaction.
 ii)  Agency, forwarding and logistics – agency income is recognised at the point when the ship sails from the port. Forwarding and logistics 
income is recognised on a shipment basis. Where the Group acts as a principal rather than as agent, the turnover and costs are shown gross.
 iii)  Technical services – fee income is recognised as invoiced for work performed and/or in accordance with the agreement.
 iv) Environmental services – revenue is recognised at the contractual rates, as labour hours are delivered and direct expenses incurred.
 v)  Bunker trading – revenue is recognised when sales and purchases of bunkers are contracted.
Revenue of the Company consists of dividends from investments. Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ legal 
rights to receive payment have been established.
e) Foreign currencies
The functional currency of the Group is pounds sterling. Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange 
prevailing on the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the 
translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are recognised in the income statement. Braemar Seascope Group plc  Annual Report 2007     27
In order to manage its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into derivative financial instruments contracts; mainly forward 
contracts (see the following page for details of the Group’s accounting policies in respect of such derivative financial instruments).
Assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries and associates are translated into pounds sterling at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet 
date. Trading results are translated at the average rates for the period. Exchange differences arising on the consolidation of the net assets of 
overseas subsidiaries are dealt with through the foreign currency translation reserve, whilst those arising from trading transactions are dealt with 
in the income statement. On disposal of a business, the cumulative exchange differences previously recognised in the foreign currency translation 
reserve relating to that business are transferred to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
f) Taxation
The taxation expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes items of income and expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable 
or deductible. The Group and Company’s liability for current tax is calculated using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
balance sheet date.
Full provision is made for deferred taxation on all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised separately on 
the balance sheet. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that they are expected to be recoverable. Deferred taxation is recognised 
in the income statement unless it relates to taxable transactions taken directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also recognised in equity. 
The deferred tax is released to the income statement at the same time as the taxable transaction is recognised in the income statement. Deferred 
taxation on un-remitted overseas earnings is provided for to the extent a tax charge is foreseeable.
g) Goodwill
On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the net assets (including any identifiable intangible assets) acquired. Goodwill arises 
where the fair value of the consideration given exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is recognised as an asset and is reviewed 
for impairment at least annually. Impairments are recognised immediately in the income statement. Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units 
for the purposes of impairment testing. On the disposal of a business, goodwill relating to that business remaining on the balance sheet is included 
in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal. Goodwill written off to reserves prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and will not be included 
in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal. As permitted by IFRS1 goodwill on acquisitions arising prior to 1 March 2004 has been 
retained at prior amounts and will be tested annually for impairment.
h) Other intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are stated in the balance sheet at their fair value at the date of acquisition less 
accumulated amortisation and any provisions for impairment. The amortisation of the carrying value of the capitalised forward order book and 
customer relationships is charged to the income statement over an estimated useful life determined by either the expected due dates for future 
income in the case of forward order books or the expected duration of customer relationships. Other intangible assets are amortised over an 
expected life of two to ten years. The carrying values of intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually or when there is an 
indication that they may be impaired. 
 
i) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are shown at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value of each asset, on a straight-line basis over its 
expected useful life as follows (except for long leasehold interests which are written off against the remaining period of the lease):
Motor vehicles – three years
Computers – four years
Fixtures and equipment – four years
j) Investments
Investments in associates and joint ventures where the Group has significant influence but not control are accounted for under the equity 
method of accounting. Investments are carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post acquisition changes in the Group’s share in the net assets of 
associates and joint ventures, less any impairment in value.  The income statement reflects the Group’s share of the results of the operations of 
associates and joint ventures.
Investments in associates and joint ventures together with any other unlisted investments where the Group has no significant influence are booked 
at cost less any impairment in value.
Investments in the Company are shown at cost less impairment.
k) Impairment
The carrying amount of the Group’s assets, other than financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 and deferred tax assets, are reviewed each 
balance sheet date to determine whether there is an indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the assets’ recoverable amount is 
estimated. The recoverable amount is determined based on value in use calculations, which require the use of estimates. An impairment loss is 
recognised in the income statement whenever the carrying amount of the assets exceeds its recoverable amount.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the assets with the exception of goodwill and other intangibles is 
increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount. This cannot exceed the carrying amount prior to the impairment charge. An impairment 
recognised in the income statement in respect of goodwill and other intangibles is not subsequently reversed. 28    Braemar Seascope Group plc  Annual Report 2007
Notes to the accounts
for the year ended 28 February 2007
l) Derivative financial instruments and hedging 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value at each balance sheet date. Recognition of the 
resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if it is, the nature of the item being hedged. 
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement. The Group 
designates derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting as a cash flow hedge where there is a high probability of the forecast transactions arising. 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of these derivatives is recognised in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is 
recognised immediately in the income statement. Amounts accumulated in equity are dealt with in the income statement at the same time as the 
gains or losses on the hedged items. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gains or losses that were reported 
in equity are immediately transferred to the income statement. 
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged 
forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the 
above policy when the transaction occurs. If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss 
recognised in equity is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts, which are traded in active markets, is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. 
m) Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
n) Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised and carried at the lower of their original value and recoverable amount. Impairment is made where there 
is evidence that the balances will not be recovered in full.
 
o) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and short-term deposits included in the balance sheet comprise cash in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three 
months or less.
Cash and cash equivalents included in the cash flow statement includes cash and short-term deposits, net of bank overdrafts.
p) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or otherwise) as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow 
of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the 
obligation. If material, the provisions are discounted using an appropriate current pre-tax interest rate.
q) Share-based payments
The fair value at the date of grant of share-based remuneration, principally share options, is calculated using a binomial pricing model and charged 
to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award. The charge to the income statement takes account of the 
estimated number of shares that will vest. All share-based remuneration is equity settled. The balance sheet entry is included in reserves. Shares 
issued in respect of the deferred bonus plan are valued at the market value on the date the shares are purchased.
The Company reflects the fair value of the share-based payments as an investment in its subsidiaries.
The Group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions IFRS 2 “Share-based Payments” in respect of equity settled awards and has applied 
IFRS2 only to equity settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested before 1 March 2005. 
r) Commissions payable
Commissions payable to clients are recognised in trade creditors due within one year on the earlier of the date of invoicing or the date of receipt of cash.
s) Pension scheme arrangements
The Group operates several defined contribution pension schemes. The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Company in an 
independently administered fund. The pension cost charge represents contributions payable by the Company to the fund.
t) Leasing
A finance lease is a lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset. Assets acquired under finance leases are 
recorded in the balance sheet as property, plant and equipment at their fair value and depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives 
and their lease terms. Obligations under such agreements are included in liabilities net of the finance charge allocated to future periods. All other 
leases are operating leases, and the rental of these is charged to the income statement as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Operating lease income is recognised in the income statement as it is earned.
u) Segmental analysis
The Group’s primary segmental analysis is based on its five business segments: Shipbroking; Ship agency, forwarding and logistics; Technical 
shipping support; Environmental services; and Bunker trading. This is consistent with the way the Group manages itself and with the format of the 
Group’s internal financial reporting. 
The secondary analysis is presented according to the geographic markets comprising UK and Australia and the rest of the world. The Group’s 
geographical segments are determined by the location of the Group’s assets and operations.
Costs are allocated between segments on an actual basis. Braemar Seascope Group plc  Annual Report 2007     29
v) Dividends
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which the dividends 
are approved by the Company’s shareholders.
w) New standards and interpretations not applied
During the year, the IASB and IFRIC have issued standards and interpretations for accounting periods beginning on or after the effective dates 
detailed in the table below. In all instances the effective date is after the beginning of the current reporting period.

9.  Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares 
outstanding during the year, excluding 331,495 ordinary shares held by the employee share trust (2006: 321,495) which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive ordinary 
shares. The Group has one class of potential dilutive ordinary shares being those granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the 
average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the year.

During the year ended 28 February 2006 the company acquired Geo A Morrisons & Co (Leith) Limited with a net asset fair value of £84,000 for  
an estimated consideration of £435,000 (cash paid £254,000, with a deferred consideration of £181,000), resulting in goodwill on acquisition 
of £351,000. During the year ending 28 February 2007 the post-acquisition criteria relating to the deferred consideration have been completed 
and the total consideration has been reduced by £119,000. In addition, the fair value adjustment of £61,000 relating to the deferred tax on the 
capitalised customer relations and forward order book is not required. Accordingly goodwill arising on the acquisition of Geo A Morrisons & Co 
(Leith) Limited has been reduced to £171,000.
Similarly, the group acquired Planetwide Group Limited with a net asset fair value of £311,000 for an estimated total consideration of £788,000 
which included deferred consideration of £350,000. Following completion of the post-performance criteria the total consideration has been 
increased to £938,000 and the resulting goodwill has increased from £477,000 as at 28 February 2006 to £627,000 as at 28 February 2007. Braemar Seascope Group plc  Annual Report 2007     35
11.  Goodwill continued
Details of the acquisitions which took place during the year ended 28 February 2007 can be found in note 31.
All goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units. The allocation of goodwill to cash-generating units is as follows:
    2007 2006 
        £’000 £’000
Braemar Seascope Limited       17,399 17,399
Braemar Seascope Pty Limited       3,099 4,049
Wavespec Limited       204 204
Geo A Morrisons & Co (Leith) Limited       171 351
Planetwide Group Limited       627 477
Gorman Cory Limited    27 –
DV Howells Limited    365 –
Braemar Container Shipping & Chartering Limited    714 –
        22,606 22,480
These cash generating units represent the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
The Group assesses the carrying value of goodwill with reference to recoverable amounts which are measured based on value in use. The forecast 
cash flows were based on the approved annual budget for the next financial year and management projections for the following four years which 
are based on estimated growth rates for revenue and costs plus a terminal value after the five-year projections. The growth rates used for revenue 
and costs were specific for each cash-generating unit and range from 2% to 3.5%. The terminal value is derived as a function of the discount rate 
and the growth rate after the fifth year. Management believes the forecast cash flows are achievable. Post-tax cash flows were discounted using an 
after tax discount rate of 7.2% for UK cash-generating units, being the Group’s weighted average cost of capital. Overseas forecast post-tax cash 
flows were discounted at 9.5%. Where an impairment has been identified a pre-tax rate has been applied to pre-tax forecast cash flows.
During the year ended 28 February 2007, an impairment charge of £950,000 in respect of Braemar Seascope Pty Limited was charged to the  
income statement. The impairment resulted from the activities of the Australian company performing below the expectations at acquisition.  
The recoverable amount for the cash generating unit was measured based on a value in use calculation. A pre-tax discount rate of 12.6% was 
used in the value in use calculation. The major sensitivities and their effect on the overall value are: growth in income, where a change of 1% adds 
approximately £750,000 to the value and increase in costs where a 1% change reduces the valuation by £550,000 and a 1% increase in the discount 
rate reduces the valuation by approximately £300,000.
The Company has no goodwill.

In arriving at a valuation of customer relationships the Group has estimated attrition rates for non-contractual customer relationships and a 
discount rate of 7.2% has been applied to these amounts. During the year ended 28 February 2007, the Group capitalised the value of the customer 
relationships following the acquisition of the 50% interest in Braemar Container Shipping and Chartering Limited (£442,000) and DV Howells 
Limited (£180,000). Amortisation of these assets is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over ten and five years respectively. 
A further £282,000 has been capitalised for the forward order book for Braemar Container Shipping and Chartering Limited. This is charged to the 
income statement over a period of five years.  36    Braemar Seascope Group plc  Annual Report 2007

12.  Other intangible assets continued

straight-line basis over five years. A further £42,000 has been capitalised for the forward order book for Geo A Morrisons & Co (Leith) Limited. This 
was fully amortised by 28 February 2006.

Braemar Container Shipping & Chartering Limited was a joint venture until 1 September 2006 when the Company became a wholly-owned 
subsidiary (see note 31).
The Group acquired 41% of Gorman Cory Limited on 1 March 2006 ( see note 31). From acquisition, the Group has the power to govern the 
financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities and therefore has effective control. The Group has therefore 
accounted for this entity as a subsidiary.

Braemar Container Shipping & Chartering Limited was a joint venture until 1 September 2006 when the Group purchased the remaining 50% of the 
ordinary share capital (see note 31).
The share capital of Braemar Quincannon Pte Limited is owned by the Company. All other joint ventures are indirectly owned by the Group.
All joint venture companies prepare their statutory accounts as at 28 February with the exception of Braemar Seascope India (Private) Limited  
(31 March) and Braemar Quincannon Pte Limited (31 December).
In relation to the Group’s interest in joint ventures, the assets, liabilities, income and expenses are shown below:

Braemar Container Shipping & Chartering Limited has not been included in the balance sheet information as at 28 February 2007 as it was 
accounted for as a subsidiary.
The joint ventures have no significant contingent liabilities to which the Group is exposed.  Braemar Seascope Group plc  Annual Report 2007     39
14.  Investments continued
c) Unlisted investments
The Group’s unlisted shares principally include 1,200 (20%) ordinary £1 shares in London Tankers Brokers Panel and 7,500 (25%) ordinary £1 
shares London Ship Valuation Panel. These have been treated as investments and not equity accounted as the Company does not have significant 
influence as all investors in these companies have equivalent proportional influence. Subsequent to the year end the Company reduced its interest 
in London Tankers Brokers Panel to 16.7% following the sale of 200 shares for consideration of £200,000.
The unlisted investments are shown at cost since the potential market for the shares is restricted and therefore their fair value cannot be  
measured reliably.
15.  Other receivables
Other receivables of £81,000 (2006: £58,000) comprises of non-interest bearing loans to 16 (2006: 18) employees of Braemar Seascope Limited 
repayable over three years. 
16.  Inventories
Inventories of £70,000 carried on the balance sheet at 28 February 2007 comprise raw materials.

Prepayments and accrued income   1,767 1,235 –   –
    21,750 17,717 8,137 4,979
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Group’s customer base being large and unrelated.  Due to this, 
the Directors believe there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of normal provisions for doubtful receivables, estimated by the 
Group’s management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
Included in the total trade receivables balance is £10.0 million (2006: £10.0 million) denominated in US dollars.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade receivables approximate their fair value.
18.  Derivative and other financial instruments
a) Currency risk
The Group’s currency risk exposure arises as a result of the majority of its earnings being denominated in US dollars while the majority of its 
costs are denominated in pounds sterling. The Group manages the exposure to currency variations by spot and forward currency sales and other 
derivative currency contracts. 
At 28 February 2007 the Group had entered into forward contracts in the ordinary course of business for the sale of US dollars amounting to  
US$6.0 million (28 February 2006: US $14.5 million), expected to mature between April 2007 and May 2007.
During the year ended 28 February 2007, the Group also had the right to sell US$1.1 million for Australian $s at a rate of US$0.78=AU$1, in each  
of the months March 2007 through to July 2007.
In addition at 28 February 2006, the Group had entered into a variable forward window agreement to sell US$12.0 million in US$ 1.0 million 
tranches between 31 March 2005 and 2 March 2006.
The fair value/carrying value of the derivative financial instruments of the Group is as follows:
      2007    2006
    Book value Fair value Book value Fair value 
Financial instruments   £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000

Liabilities   – – (52) (52)
           
Currency options   
Assets / (liabilities)   10 10 (47) (47)
The net fair value of forward currency contracts that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges amounts to a £17,000 asset (2006: £40,000 
liability) which has been deferred in equity.
Amounts of £40,000 (2006: £1.4 million charge) have been credited to the income statement in respect of forward contracts which have matured 
during the period. 
Amounts of £47,000 (2006: £62,000 charge) have been credited to the income statement in respect of currency options that have matured during 
the year.  40    Braemar Seascope Group plc  Annual Report 2007
Notes to the accounts
for the year ended 28 February 2007
18.  Derivative and other financial instruments continued
Changes in the fair value of currency options amounting to £10,000 have been credited to the income statement in the year (2006: £122,000 charge).
The fair value of financial instruments is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
b) Interest rate risk
The Group minimises its exposure to interest rate risk by pooling sterling cash balances across the Group (see note 20).
The following table sets out the carrying amount, by maturity, of the Group’s financial instruments which are exposed to interest rate risk.
     2007 2006

Short term borrowings (see note 20)    (1,507)  (2,073)
     (1,507)  (2,021)
Cash balances are held on overnight deposits at floating rates depending on the prevailing market rates for the amount of funds deposited.
The other financial instruments of the Group are non-interest bearing.
c) Banking Facilities
The Group has an overdraft facility for £3.0 million (2006: multi-option facility of £4.0 million). At 28 February 2007 none of the facility had been 
drawn (2006: £nil). The Group operates a pooled banking facility for all sterling current account balances across the Group and has the legal right  
of offset. The Company and its subsidiaries have provided cross guarantees and fixed and floating rate charges over their assets to secure the 
above overdraft facility.
d) Credit risk
There are no significant concentrations within the Group or Company (see note 20 for details of bank offset arrangement).
19.  Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash held by the Group (2007: £14.6 million; 2006: £13.5 million) and Company (2007: £nil ; 2006: £52,000). 
Cash balances are held on overnight deposits at floating rates depending on the prevailing market rates for the amount of future funds deposited. 
The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value.
20.  Short-term borrowings
     2007  2006
Company     £’000  £’000
Short-term borrowings       1,507  2,073
The Group has no short-term borrowings.
Short-term borrowings comprise the net bank overdraft facility repayable on demand or within 12 months. The Group operates a pooled banking 
facility for all sterling current account balances across the Group and has the legal right of offset. The Company’s short-term borrowings reflect the 
Company’s contribution to the pooling arrangement. The bank overdraft bears interest based on LIBOR. 
The Directors consider the carrying amount approximates the fair value of these liabilities. Braemar Seascope Group plc  Annual Report 2007     41
21.  Trade and other payables
    Group  Company
    2007 2006 2007 2006

Other accruals and deferred income   11,495 11,046 –   –  
    29,011 25,490 538 698
Included within deferred consideration is £738,000 being an estimate of the future consideration payable to acquire the remaining shares in 
Gorman Cory Limited. Half of this amount is payable after more than one year (note 31c).
The average credit period taken for trade payables is 26 days (2006: 22 days). The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade payables 
approximates their fair value.
22.  Finance leases
The future minimum lease payments under finance leases, together with the present value of minimum lease payments are as follows: 
    Present value of 
   Minimum lease payments   minimum lease payments
    2007 2006 2007 2006
Group  £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000
Within one year    –  11  –  11
The weighted average lease term at 26 February 2006 was six months. Interest rates were fixed at the contract date. The Group’s obligations under 
finance leases are secured by the lessors’ charges over the leased assets. The fair value of the Group’s leased obligations approximates their 
carrying value.

24.  Share capital continued
Share options granted in 2002 under the 1997 Executive Scheme are subject to a performance condition that the growth in the Company’s  
average adjusted earnings per share over a period of no less than three financial years must exceed the growth in the retail price index (RPI) over 
the corresponding period by no less than 3% per annum compounded. If the performance condition is not satisfied at this point, re-testing of the 
performance condition is permitted in subsequent financial years until the option lapses. The options granted in 2003 and 2004 retain the same 
performance criteria, with no re-testing. The base measurement period for the remaining options will be the average of the earnings per share (as 
published in the Group’s annual report and accounts) for the three financial years immediately preceding the grant of the relevant option. Exercise 
of an option is subject to continued employment. 
Options are valued using a binomial pricing model. The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows:

ii. Deferred bonus plan
During 2005 the Company put in place a Deferred Bonus Plan (“the Plan”) whereby part of the annual performance-related bonus is delivered in 
shares, on a discretionary basis, to staff including Executive Directors. Under the Plan the shares are held in an employee trust for three years after 
which the employee beneficiary will become absolutely entitled to the shares provided they remain in employment.  Shares are valued at the share 
price at the date of grant. As at 28 February 2007 259,750 shares had been granted to employees (2006: 152,250). 20,000 shares have lapsed 
during the year.
The total charge for the year relating to all employee share-based payment plans was £309,000 (2006: £244,000), all of which related to equity-
settled share-based payment transactions (see note 26).  44    Braemar Seascope Group plc  Annual Report 2007

million from the vendors which was paid to the Inland Revenue in order to prevent interest accruing. Such funds would become repayable to the 
vendors in the event that the appeal is successful. £0.6 million (2006: £0.6 million) remains outstanding pending the appeal result. The Company 
does not expect to incur any cost in respect of this assessment or these contingent liabilities.
The Chief Executive and a Director are Braemar Shipbrokers vendors and are therefore party to the transactions referred to above.  
Key management compensation is disclosed in note 4c. There are no other transactions with key management.
During the year the Company entered into the following transactions with subsidiaries and joint ventures:

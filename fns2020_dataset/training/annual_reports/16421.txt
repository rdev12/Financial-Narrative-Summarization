Business description
United Utilities Group PLC is the UK’s largest listed water business. 
The group owns and manages the regulated water and wastewater 
network in the North West of England, through its subsidiary United
Utilities Water PLC (UUW), which is responsible for the vast majority of
the group’s assets and profit. The group also applies its utility skills to 
manage and operate other utility infrastructure. 
United Utilities reports through three business segments:
● Regulated activities;
● Non-regulated activities; and
● All other segments.
REGULATED ACTIVITIES
Key facts
100 water treatment works
Over 42,000 kilometres of water pipes
57,000 hectares of catchment land
575 wastewater treatment works
Over 43,000 kilometres of sewers
Serving a population of seven million people
Water and wastewater operations
UUW holds licences to provide water and wastewater services to a 
population of approximately seven million people in the North West
of England.
Almost 2,000 million litres of water is supplied every day to
approximately 3.2 million homes and businesses. Water is collected
from catchment land and other sources and stored in reservoirs before 
being treated and then delivered via a network of pipes to homes and 
industry. A large proportion of the water supplied flows freely by
gravity and does not need to be pumped.
Wastewater is collected using a network of sewers and treated
before being returned safely to the environment. A by-product of the 
treatment of wastewater is sewage sludge, which is treated further to 
produce an end product suitable for recycling. 
UUW’s water and wastewater service currently costs households
approximately £1 per day on average. Over the next five years, the
average annual household bill will fall by £9 in real terms. The group
believes this represents excellent value for money, providing customers
with high quality drinking water to meet all their daily needs and for
environmentally responsible wastewater collection and treatment.
Since privatisation in 1990:
● Water quality in the North West has improved from 99.6 per cent to
99.9 per cent;
● Compliance with bathing water standards across the North West
has risen from just over 30 per cent to more than 90 per cent;
● Leakage from the network has halved, supported by ongoing
investment in replacing ageing water pipes; and
● UUW has invested more than £4,000 for every household in the
North West, some £750 above the national average.
In the 2005–10 period, UUW invested more than £3 billion to improve
the water and wastewater infrastructure and the environment across 
the North West. Further developments in the regulatory regime are
expected to take effect in the next few years, in particular as a result
of European Union environmental initiatives (including the Water
Framework Directive and the revised Drinking Water Directive).
Consistent with the group’s approach to longer-term planning, UUW’s
water resources management plan, published in September 2009, 
considers the water supply/demand balance in the North West of
England, including the potential impacts of climate change out 
to 2035. 
UUW’s strategic direction statement, which was updated in April 2010, 
sets out the company’s plans for the new price review period (2010–15) 
in a longer-term context. The key elements identified in the strategic
direction statement are:
● Responsible stewardship of water and wastewater networks;
● Listening to customers and other stakeholders;
● Ensuring water resources are more sustainable and resilient;
● An integrated approach to drainage to reduce the threat of flooding;
● Reducing significantly the carbon impact of activities; and
● Bills to rise, on average, no faster than incomes.

NON-REGULATED ACTIVITIES
As well as owning and managing the substantial water and wastewater 
network in the North West of England, United Utilities also applies its
utility skills through outsourced utility contracts and investments.
As part of its strategy of focusing on core activities, United Utilities 
disposed of its investments in Northern Gas Networks and Manila 
Water during the second half of 2009/10, crystallising approximately
£132 million for the group. In May 2010, the group also agreed the 
disposal of its Australian business for approximately £135 million. 
United Utilities is continuing to evaluate the expressions of interest it 
has received for its remaining non-regulated businesses.

Regulatory environment
Environmental regulation is the responsibility of the Secretary of State 
for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs together with the Environment 
Agency, the Drinking Water Inspectorate and Natural England.
Economic regulation is the responsibility of an independent body, 
Ofwat, which sets price limits every five years for the water sector 
in England and Wales. Price cap regulation in the UK is performance 
based and companies are incentivised to be efficient in terms of their 
operating costs, capital programmes and financing. Regulated revenue 
is set by reference to inflation as measured by the retail prices index 
(RPI) plus an adjustment factor known as ‘K’ . 
On 26 November 2009 Ofwat published its final determination of price 
limits for the period 1 April 2010 to 31 March 2015. UUW’s profile of 
price limits for the five years is set out below. 
Y ear 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15
K factor -4.3% -0.2% +0.6% +1.0% +1.2%
Ofwat’s final determination of price limits for UUW was based upon: 
● a £3.6 billion capital investment programme (2007/08 prices);
● 12 per cent, or approximately £900 million, real growth in the 
regulatory capital value (RCV) over the five years;
● an average annual underlying operating efficiency of 1.2 per cent for 
the water service and 2.4 per cent for the wastewater service; and
● a return on capital of 4.5 per cent (post-tax, real).
The RCV is the capital base on which water companies earn a return. 
It is increased by capital expenditure and inflation, and reduced by 
depreciation and clawback of past efficiencies.

Chairman’s statement
Overview
This has been a very significant year for United Utilities. After much careful consideration the company accepted 
Ofwat’s price limits for the next five years. The challenge of meeting those price limits meant taking some difficult 
decisions as we strive to ensure the company is operating as efficiently as possible. As a consequence, the company 
has been able to affirm its dividend policy through to 2015, providing clarity for customers and investors. At the 
same time, the next five years will see substantial investment in our region that will benefit our customers, the 
economy and the environment.
Financial performance and dividend
On behalf of the board I am pleased to report a sound underlying financial performance for the year ended 31 March 
2010, despite a challenging economic climate. The board is proposing a final dividend for the year ended 31 March 
2010 of 23.13 pence per ordinary share in line with our policy. Together with the interim dividend of 11.17 pence per ordinary share, the total 
ordinary dividend relating to the year is 34.30 pence. The final dividend is expected to be paid to shareholders on 2 August 2010.
Operational performance
United Utilities has continued to make progress in the area of operational performance and our customers tell us that satisfaction levels have 
improved further, but there is still more to do to achieve the group’s ambition of world class performance. Our employees are integral in delivering 
high levels of service and I would like to thank them for their dedication and continued support. Record levels of rainfall last November contributed to 
serious flooding in our region, especially in my home county of Cumbria. I would like to commend the large number of our people who worked extremely 
hard to serve customers in exceptionally difficult conditions. 
Corporate governance
We remain committed to adopting the highest standards of corporate governance and this underpins our approach to doing business. We 
endeavour to operate in an environmentally sustainable and socially responsible manner. We listen to the views of all our stakeholders and this 
helps shape the manner in which we do business. Our efforts to help resolve the issue of site area charging have borne fruit and we are pleased 
that the UK Government has legislated to allow companies to introduce concessionary schemes for voluntary and community groups to assist 
them in paying their surface water drainage bills. We strive for an exemplary health and safety record and our processes in this area continue to be 
enhanced. It is important that we carry out our operations efficiently and place the welfare of employees very high on our agenda. Whilst we do not 
get everything right, I was delighted to accept, on behalf of all our employees, the award of Business in the Community’s Company of the Y ear for 
2009 in recognition of the group’s overall impact on society.
Board changes
We say farewell and thank you to Andrew Pinder, who steps down from the board in July after nine years, and Tim Weller, who is leaving to join 
Cable&Wireless Worldwide, after serving as chief financial officer over the past four years. We wish Andrew and Tim all the best in the future.
Looking forward
I believe that with the group’s consistent focus on its utility skills, we are well positioned to meet the challenges of the new five-year regulatory 
period and beyond. I hope our shareholders, employees and customers will continue to share in United Utilities’ success.
Dr John McAdam

BUSINESS REVIEW
05
In this important year, which has seen the company make further progress against its strategic objectives and agree 
price limits for the next five years with the regulator, we have delivered a sound underlying financial performance in 
both our regulated and non-regulated activities. The group continues to benefit from a strong financing position and 
has headroom to cover its projected financing needs through to the spring of 2012. 
In order to meet the requirements of the water price review, we need to retain a robust and sustainable capital 
structure. At the same time, we are very mindful of the importance of income to our shareholders. In view of this, the 
board intends to pay a dividend of 30 pence per share for the 2010/11 financial year and thereafter continue with 
our policy of targeting dividend growth of RPI plus two per cent per annum through to 2015. 
We aim to provide an attractive return, coupled with the continuation of the target to deliver real dividend growth, 
whilst retaining a robust and sustainable financial profile for the group. We believe the actions we have taken strike the right balance.
Strategy
United Utilities has a consistent strategy of focusing on its core activities. During 2009/10 we continued to concentrate on the same four key 
areas that underpin our commitment to delivering value for our shareholders and serving our customers: 
● Improving operational performance; 
● Delivering our regulatory contract; 
● The 2009 water price review; and 
● Our non-regulated activities. 
Improving operational performance
We have maintained our focus on operational performance and made good progress during the year. We have consistently highlighted a number 
of performance indicators against which our stakeholders can assess our progress. These include: relative efficiency; security of water supply 
(leakage); serious pollution incidents; and overall customer satisfaction in response to enquiries.
In terms of relative efficiency, the company has a continuing focus on cost efficiency and is implementing a range of cost control measures, as we 
aim to lower the cost to serve our customers whilst maintaining and improving levels of service.
We are pleased to report that overall customer satisfaction is at its highest level for many years and that we met our regulatory leakage target 
for the fourth consecutive year. This was achieved despite exceptionally difficult winter weather conditions and highlights the commitment of our 
employees. We have also halved the number of serious pollution incidents over the last few years. Although we have made good progress, we know 
that there is more to do and are focused on delivering further improvements.
Delivering our regulatory contract
We have completed the 2005–10 regulated water and wastewater contract in the North West of England. Over the five-year period we invested 
over £3 billion in our infrastructure, which allows us to maintain and improve the service we provide to our customers and to meet tough 
environmental standards. However, there is no time to sit back and we have already embarked on delivering the next five-year regulatory contract.
The 2009 water price review
2009/10 was an important year for the water sector in England and Wales as the economic regulator, Ofwat, set price limits for the five years from 
1 April 2010 to 31 March 2015. We considered the contents carefully before deciding that, on balance, it was in shareholders’ and customers’ best 
interests to accept the regulator’s proposals. 
There is no doubt this is a challenging price review. However, we are well prepared to meet the requirements of the review given the detailed plans 
that we have already started to implement.
Non-regulated activities
Consistent with our strategy of focusing on our core activities, we completed the disposals of our holdings in Northern Gas Networks and Manila 
Water Company for a combined price of £132 million. We have also agreed to sell our Australian business for approximately £135 million, 
increasing the total value from non-regulated disposals to approximately £267 million. We are continuing to evaluate the expressions of interest 
we have received for our remaining non-regulated businesses.

Chief executive officer’s statement continued
Our employees
Last November, we dealt with record levels of rain and the flooding in Cumbria that occurred as a result. I witnessed the huge operational 
challenge it caused and I would again like to thank our people across the business for their superb response, often in very difficult conditions. 
This commitment from our staff was evident throughout the year, particularly in January, during the exceptional wintry conditions.
United Utilities has been set new efficiency targets as part of the regulator’s price limit proposals and we have had to make some difficult 
decisions with regard to the internal structure of the group. As a result, approximately 500 people left the group during the 2009/10 year.
A committed workforce is central to delivering our objectives for the next five years and beyond and we continue to communicate regularly and 
openly with our workforce, affirming the core values of our business: passion, trust, team and commitment.
Our environment
Embedded within the group’s strategic objectives is the goal to operate in a more sustainable manner. With long life assets we believe it is essential 
to take a long-term view of our operations. We recently updated our strategic direction statement which considers the needs of our region out to 
2035 and takes account of the recent final determination of prices by Ofwat. We have factored into our business plan ways in which we can adapt 
to climate change, whilst ensuring the continuity of water supplies for our customers. 
In September 2009, we published our water resources management plan. This aims to identify the best strategy to balance supply reliability, 
whilst protecting the environment and having due regard for the affordability of bills. It focuses on how we adapt to meet the challenge of climate 
change, ensuring the abstraction of water in our region is sustainable given the increasing drought risk. We will continue to look at ways of reducing 
demand for water to help alleviate the impact of climate change. 
Our customers
We are aware of the impact on our household customers of reduced economic activity and higher unemployment and have increased the funding 
of our charitable trust by two-thirds to £5 million per year. Our water and wastewater services currently cost households approximately £1 per 
day on average. Over the next five years, the average annual household bill will fall by £9 in real terms. We believe this represents excellent value 
for money, providing our customers with high quality drinking water to meet all their daily needs and for environmentally responsible wastewater 
collection and treatment. 
Outlook
Based on Ofwat’s final determination, prices to UUW’s customers across the 2010–15 regulatory period will decrease in real terms by an annual 
average of 0.4 per cent  with a 4.3 per cent real decrease in 2010/11. We are implementing a range of detailed efficiency and performance 
improvement initiatives and believe we can deliver outperformance in respect of the new regulatory contract. Our early capital investment 
planning should facilitate a smooth transition into the 2010–15 period and we expect capital expenditure to continue at high levels in 2010/11. 
Overall, we are well positioned for the next five years.

Financial performance
United Utilities has delivered a sound set of financial results for the 
year ended 31 March 2010. Revenue from continuing operations 
rose by £12 million to £2,439 million. Underlying operating profit 
increased by three per cent to £756 million. Underlying profit 
before tax decreased by six per cent to £500 million, principally 
due to an increase in the underlying cost of net borrowings. 
The regulated business has delivered a modest increase in underlying 
operating profit, which is up three per cent at £701 million. This result 
primarily reflects the price increase allowed by Ofwat coupled with 
tight cost control, offset as expected by reduced water demand and 
ongoing cost pressures in areas such as power and bad debts, alongside 
an expected increase in depreciation. The price increase supports the 
high levels of essential investment in UUW’s assets, which helps the 
business meet strict environmental standards and deliver an improved 
service for its customers.
Capital expenditure in the regulated water and wastewater business 
amounted to £620 million during the year, including infrastructure 
renewals expenditure. This level of spend is consistent with the 
planned investment profile for the final year of the 2005–10 capital 
expenditure programme. 
In the second half of the year, United Utilities completed the disposals 
of its holdings in Northern Gas Networks and Manila Water Company 
for a combined price of £132 million. The dividends from these 
investments amounted to £2 million in 2009/10 and £12 million in 
2008/09. Adjusting for these dividends would show a year-on-year 
increase in underlying non-regulated operating profit of £7 million. 
Earlier this month, the group also agreed to sell its Australian business 
for a total of approximately £135 million. United Utilities intends to 
retain the proceeds from these disposals within the group. The group 
is continuing to evaluate the expressions of interest it has received for 
its remaining non-regulated businesses.

Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010

The group has sought to adopt a more sustainable approach to the 
delivery of pension provision and has amended the terms of its defined 
benefit pension schemes. This reduces future funding and deficit risk 
as well as future service cost, thereby enabling the company to retain 
defined benefit pension schemes for existing members. Following 
consultation, the changes to the rules of the pension scheme were 
supported by the company’s trade unions. The reduction in service 
cost for 2010/11 is expected to be approximately £7 million, although 
the lower risk investment strategy is likely to reduce investment 
income and result in a lower net benefit at the profit before tax level. 
The amendments have also resulted in a reduction of £92 million to 
the group’s pension deficit, which is required to be accounted for as 
a credit to operating profit in the group’s income statement. Overall, 
the group’s net pension deficit at the year end has decreased by £87 
million, compared with the position at 30 September 2009, reflecting 
the aforementioned changes to the pension schemes and the routine 
actuarial assessment of movements in assets and liabilities.
The group benefits from headroom to cover its projected financing 
needs through to the spring of 2012. During the year, United Utilities 
enhanced its liquidity through the issuance of £220 million of new 
bonds and £150 million of term extensions to existing committed bank 
facilities. This provides the group with good flexibility in terms of when 
and how it raises further debt finance. 
Investment income and finance expense
Finance expense of £384 million was £113 million higher than the 
prior year. This expense included £136 million of net fair value losses 
on debt and derivative instruments, compared with £24 million of net 
fair value losses in 2008/09. The impact of changes in credit spreads 
on debt accounted for at fair value through profit or loss can result in 
significant volatility and this is the principal reason for the large net 
fair value movement in the year. In addition, the volatility in financing 
expense reflects the fact that, in order to provide a hedge of the 
interest cost implicit in the regulatory period, the group fixes interest 
rates for the duration of each five-year review period for a substantial 
proportion of its debt using interest rate swaps. International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IAS 39) limit the use of hedge accounting for 
these commercial hedges, thereby increasing the potential volatility 
of the income statement. However, this volatility in fair values has 
no cashflow impact. A reduction in returns on the group’s pension 
schemes’ assets in 2009/10, compared with the prior year, has also 
contributed to the increase in finance expense in the year.
Investment income was £14 million, compared with £71 million in 
the prior year, principally reflecting a reduction in cash, following the 
return of approximately £1.5 billion to shareholders in the previous 
financial year, and lower returns on cash deposits. 
The underlying cost of net borrowings for continuing operations of 
£236 million was £39 million higher than in 2008/09. This reflects 
higher average net debt in 2009/10 and an increase in the group’s 
average net borrowing rate from around 4.7 per cent to 4.9 per cent. 
Average net debt was lower in 2008/09, primarily due to the group 
holding approximately £1.1 billion of cash proceeds from the sale of 
United Utilities Electricity (UUE) prior to the return of approximately 
£1.5 billion to shareholders in August 2008.

Leakage
As custodians of water supplies for the North West of England, United 
Utilities is responsible for managing leakage effectively.
Sometimes nature makes this more challenging, as was seen in the winter 
of 2009/10, with freezing weather followed by a big thaw, making burst 
pipes inevitable.
The company took action immediately with more call handlers, operational 
teams responding to leaks in record time and by asking members of the 
public to report leaks with the ‘Y ou spot it, we’ll stop it’ campaign.
Despite the coldest winter for years and record increases in the number of 
leaks and bursts impacting the water network, the company still achieved 
its leakage target for 2009/10.

Performance
Profit before taxation
Underlying profit before taxation was £500 million, six per cent lower 
than 2008/09, principally reflecting an increase in interest expense 
as a result of higher average net debt, following the return of £1.5 
billion to shareholders in August 2008, an increase in the underlying 
cost of net borrowings, a reduction in investment income and lower 
expected returns on pension assets. This underlying measure adjusts 
for the impact of one-off items, fair value movements in respect of 
debt and derivative instruments and the short-term interest benefit in 
the previous year associated with the cash proceeds from the sale of 
UUE, prior to the £1.5 billion return to shareholders. Reported profit 
before taxation decreased by 10 per cent to £474 million principally 
as a result of an increase in finance expense and lower investment 
income, partly offset by the £92 million one-off credit associated with 
the changes to the group’s pension schemes and a £37 million profit on 
disposal of investments.
Taxation
During the year the group received a cash tax inflow of £51 million, 
following agreement with UK tax authorities of prior years’ tax returns. 
After taking account of this repayment, the net position for 2009/10 
was a small cash outflow of £1 million. 
The current tax charge was £22 million and the current tax effective 
rate was five per cent, compared with 26 per cent in the prior year. 
The current tax charge included a £48 million credit in relation to the 
agreement with the tax authorities of prior years’ tax returns. 
In the prior year, the group recognised a one-off deferred tax charge 
of £206 million relating to the abolition of industrial buildings 
allowances with a cash impact expected to be spread over a period 
of approximately 20 years. This one-off item resulted in a significant 
increase in the effective tax rate for the prior year. 
The group has recognised a net deferred tax charge of £49 million 
compared with a deferred tax charge in the prior year of £210 million. 
This included a £7 million credit in relation to the agreement with the 
tax authorities of prior years’ tax returns. 
An overall tax charge of £71 million has been recognised for the year 
ended 31 March 2010. Excluding the impact of prior years’ adjustments 
and the abolition of industrial buildings allowances, the total tax charge 
relating to continuing operations would be £125 million or 26 per cent 
compared with a £148 million charge or 28 per cent in the prior year.   
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share relating to continuing operations increased from 
26.5 pence to 59.2 pence. In 2008/09, there was a one-off deferred tax 
charge of £206 million relating to the abolition of industrial buildings 
allowances (equivalent to 30.3 pence per share). In 2009/10, there was a 
one-off credit of £55 million relating to the agreement of prior years’ tax 
returns (equivalent to 8.0 pence per share).
Dividend per share
The board has proposed a final dividend of 23.13 pence per ordinary 
share in respect of the year ended 31 March 2010. This is an increase 
of 5.0 per cent, in line with the group’s dividend policy of targeting a 
real growth rate of RPI plus 2.0 per cent. The inflationary increase of 
3.0 per cent is based on the RPI element included within the allowed 
regulated price increase for UUW for the 2009/10 financial year (i.e. 
the movement in RPI between November 2007 and November 2008).
The final dividend is expected to be paid on 2 August 2010 to 
shareholders on the register at the close of business on 18 June 2010. 
The ex-dividend date is 16 June 2010.
As outlined on 21 January 2010, following detailed analysis and 
assessment of the final determination, the board intends to pay a 
dividend per share of 30.0 pence for the 2010/11 financial year. 
Thereafter, the intention is to continue to target a dividend per share 
growth rate of RPI plus 2 per cent per annum through to 2015.
Cashflow 
Cash generated for the year ended 31 March 2010 was £1,016 million, 
compared with £911 million in the prior year. The group’s net capital 
expenditure was £573 million (including the purchase of intangible 
assets and proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment), 
principally in the regulated water and wastewater investment 
programmes. This excludes infrastructure renewals expenditure 
which is treated as an operating cost under International Financial 
Reporting Standards. 
Net debt including derivatives at 31 March 2010 was £4,906 million, 
compared with £4,895 million at 31 March 2009. Expenditure on the 
regulatory capital investment programmes and payments of dividends and 
interest, were broadly offset by the proceeds from the disposals of the 
group’s holdings in Northern Gas Networks and Manila Water Company, 
operational cashflows and the aforementioned cash tax receipt.

United Utilities Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010

Long-term borrowings are structured or hedged to match assets 
and earnings, which are largely in sterling, indexed to UK retail price 
inflation and subject to regulatory price reviews every five years. 
Very long-term sterling inflation index-linked debt is the group’s 
preferred form of funding as this provides a natural hedge to assets 
and earnings. At 31 March 2010, approximately 42 per cent of the 
group’s net debt was in index-linked form, representing around
27 per cent of UUW’s regulatory capital value, with an average real 
interest rate of 1.8 per cent. The long-term nature of this funding also 
provides a good match to the group’s long-life infrastructure assets 
and is a key contributor to the group’s average term debt maturity 
profile which is in excess of 25 years. 
Where nominal debt is raised in a currency other than sterling and/or 
with a fixed interest rate, to manage exposure to long-term interest 
rates, the debt is generally swapped to create a floating rate sterling 
liability for the term of the liability. To manage exposure to medium-
term interest rates, the group fixes interest costs for a substantial 
proportion of the group’s debt for the duration of each price control 
period at around the time of that price control determination. The 
group does not undertake any speculative trading activity.
The group enters into joint ventures with consortium partners. The 
financial and legal structure of joint ventures is designed to limit the 
group’s exposure to the extent of the equity investment and loans 
provided by the group, with no further recourse should the joint venture 
default. All joint venture arrangements have been incorporated into the 
group’s results on a proportionate consolidation basis.
Debt financing and interest rate management
Gearing (measured as group net debt divided by UUW’s regulatory 
capital value) decreased to 64 per cent at 31 March 2010, compared 
with 66 per cent at 31 March 2009. Adjusting for the group’s non-
recourse joint venture debt of £234 million, gearing was 61 per cent. 
At the year end, United Utilities Water PLC had long-term credit 
ratings of A3/BBB+ and United Utilities PLC had long-term credit 
ratings of Baa1/BBB– from Moody’s Investors Services and Standard 
& Poor’s Ratings Services respectively. Shortly after UUW accepted 
Ofwat’s final determination on 21 January 2010, Moody’s reaffirmed 
its credit ratings of A3 for United Utilities Water PLC and Baa1 for 
United Utilities PLC, both with stable outlook. However, as expected, 
Standard & Poor’s downgraded United Utilities Water PLC to BBB+ 
from A– and United Utilities PLC to BBB– from BBB+, both with stable 
outlook, reflecting differing methodologies particularly with regard to 
the treatment of infrastructure renewals expenditure. 
Cash and short-term deposits at 31 March 2010 amounted to 
£302 million. During the year, the group’s financing headroom 
position was enhanced through the issuance of an additional 
£100 million, 5.75 per cent bond maturing in March 2022; an additional 
£50 million, 6.125 per cent bond maturing in December 2015; and 
a new £70 million, 2.40 per cent plus RPI index-linked bond maturing 
in July 2039. United Utilities has headroom to cover its projected 
financing needs through to the spring of 2012.
The group has access to the international debt capital markets through 
its €7 billion medium-term note programme which provides for the 
periodic issuance by United Utilities PLC and United Utilities Water 
PLC of debt instruments on terms and conditions determined at the 
time the instruments are issued. The programme does not represent 
a funding commitment, with funding dependent upon the successful 
issue of the debt securities.

BUSINESS REVIEW

Performance
Liquidity
Short-term liquidity requirements are met from the group’s normal 
operating cashflow and its short-term bank deposits. Further liquidity 
is provided by committed but undrawn credit facilities. This liquidity 
supports the group’s €2 billion euro-commercial paper programme.
In line with the board’s treasury policy, United Utilities aims to maintain 
a healthy headroom position. Available headroom at 31 March 2010 
was £1,100 million based on cash, short-term deposits and medium-
term committed bank facilities, net of short-term debt. This headroom 
is sufficient to cover the group’s projected financing needs through to 
the spring of 2012.
United Utilities believes that it operates a prudent approach to 
managing banking counterparty risk. Counterparty risk, in relation to 
both cash deposits and derivatives, is controlled through the use of 
counterparty credit limits. United Utilities’ cash is held in the form 
of short-term (generally no longer than three months) money market 
deposits with either prime commercial banks or with triple A rated 
money market funds. As at 31 March 2010, no cash deposits were held 
in money market funds.
United Utilities operates a bilateral, rather than a syndicated, approach 
to its core relationship banking facilities. This approach spreads 
maturities more evenly over a longer time period, thereby reducing 
refinancing risk and providing the benefit of several renewal points 
rather than a large single refinancing requirement. 
Pensions
The group has sought to adopt a more sustainable approach to the 
delivery of pension provision and has amended the terms of its defined 
benefit pension schemes. The measures taken include a cap on the 
increase in pensionable earnings, an increase in the normal retirement 
age, an increase in employee contribution rates, an adjustment to the 
accrual rates and a rebalancing of the pensions investment strategy. 
This reduces both the future service cost and the future funding risk to 
the company, thereby enabling the company to retain defined benefit 
pension schemes for existing members. The changes to the scheme 
rules were supported by the company’s trade unions. The reduction in 
service cost for 2010/11 is expected to be approximately
£7 million, although the lower risk investment strategy is likely to 
reduce investment income and result in a lower net benefit at the profit 
before tax level. These amendments have also resulted in a reduction 
of £92 million to the group’s pension deficit, which is required to be 
accounted for as a credit to operating profit in the group’s income 
statement. 
Overall, the group’s net pension deficit at the year end has decreased 
by £87 million, compared with the position at 30 September 2009, 
reflecting the aforementioned changes to the pension schemes and the 
routine actuarial assessment of movements in assets and liabilities. 
As a result of changes in market conditions over the 12 months, the 
group’s net pension obligations increased during the year from
£213 million at 31 March 2009 to £271 million at 31 March 2010. 
Further detail is provided in note 20 (‘Retirement benefit obligations’) 
of these financial statements. The group will continue to evaluate its 
pensions investment strategy to de-risk further its pension provision.

Performance
REGULATED ACTIVITIES
Financial highlights
Revenue from regulated activities increased by three per cent to 
£1,541 million, principally as a result of an allowed price increase 
of 6.0 per cent (including inflation of 3.0 per cent), partially offset, 
as expected and indicated previously, by reduced water demand 
reflecting the challenging economic climate. The regulated price 
increase supports significant investment in UUW’s infrastructure which 
provides vital water and wastewater services to customers.
Underlying operating profit for the year increased by three per cent, 
primarily reflecting the revenue increase coupled with the impact of 
tight cost control measures, offset by higher depreciation, bad debts 
and power costs. The increase in depreciation reflects the recent 
high levels of capital spend, in line with the planned profile of the 
investment programme. Reported operating profit was significantly 
higher than the prior year, reflecting a one-off credit of £77 million in 
respect of the group’s revised pension provision and partly offset by 
restructuring costs of approximately £16 million. 
As outlined previously, the business had entered into forward 
contracts for the majority of its power requirements for 2009/10. As 
a result, unit power costs in 2009/10 were approximately 10 per cent 
higher than in 2008/09 and the power expense has increased by around 
£6 million. The business has also entered into forward contracts for 
the majority of its power requirements for 2010/11 and 2011/12 and 
unit power costs are expected to be in the order of 20 per cent lower 
than in 2009/10. Bad debt expense is broadly in line with the prior 
year at approximately 3.5 per cent of regulated revenue. This reflects 
the impact of the continuing tough economic environment on cash 
collection rates.
Capital investment in the year, including £114 million of infrastructure 
renewals expenditure, was £620 million. This level of spend was in line 
with the planned capital investment profile for the final year of UUW’s 
2005–10 regulatory programme. 
Operational performance
Operational performance is a key area of focus and UUW is targeting an 
upper quartile position among UK water companies on key operational 
measures in the medium-term. The regulated business continues to 
upgrade its infrastructure, replacing 134 kilometres of water mains 
during the year. UUW continues to supply high quality drinking water with 
a mean zonal compliance water quality performance for the year of 99.94 
per cent, which compares with 99.92 per cent for the previous year. UUW 
is making good progress against its key performance indicators:
●  Relative efficiency — UUW has narrowed the operational efficiency 
gaps to the most efficient water and wastewater companies 
since 2005. This is reflected in Ofwat’s most recent (2008/09) 
assessment of United Utilities as band B for the water service 
and band C for the wastewater service and represents a one band 
improvement for both services over this period. UUW expects at 
least to sustain these bandings in Ofwat’s 2009/10 assessment.
●  Security of water supply — UUW met its economic level of leakage 
rolling target for the fourth consecutive year in 2009/10, despite 
extreme winter weather conditions, reflecting strong management 
focus and the commitment of the workforce. 
 
●  Pollution — The business has now met or outperformed its medium-
term target of a 50 per cent reduction in major pollution incidents 
in each of the last four years. One water and seven wastewater 
Category 1&2 incidents were recorded in 2009, compared with the 
base position of two water and 21 wastewater incidents in 2005. 
●  Sewer flooding — UUW continues to remove properties from
the sewer flooding register. In 2009, an independent review 
of UUW’s sewer flooding recording and reporting process was 
undertaken, which was submitted to Ofwat for consideration. The 
independent reviewer concluded that the processes are generally 
fit for purpose with some scope for streamlining and further 
improvement. UUW agreed to implement changes required by Ofwat 
as a result of this review and has reassessed its sewer flooding 
registers. The number of properties on the register in 2009/10 
is expected to be 1,028 (for properties at risk of experiencing at 
least one sewer flooding incident in ten years), which compares 
with a reassessed number for 2005/06 of 1,091 properties, a net 
reduction of 63 properties over the four-year period. The company 
has plans in place to reduce the number of incidents due to sewer 
flooding (other causes) and to offer mitigation measures for all 
properties on the register.
●  Overall customer satisfaction — Significant progress has been 
achieved and overall customer satisfaction in response to enquiries 
is now at its highest recorded levels, with a satisfaction rating of 
82 per cent for the 12 months to 31 March 2010. UUW achieved its 
target of 85 per cent for March 2010, the highest score attained 
for an individual month. These satisfaction levels are based on a 
comprehensive independent survey conducted on behalf of UUW 
each month. Customer satisfaction has improved from less than 
50 per cent in 2005 to consistently over 80 per cent during the 
second half of 2009/10. The business remains focused on achieving 
further improvements.

Performance continued
Although UUW has delivered real progress, the business recognises 
that there is more to do. As indicated previously, sewer flooding 
incidents, together with environmental underperformance at 
Fleetwood wastewater treatment works, negatively impacted the 
2008/09 overall performance assessment (OPA) score. 
UUW has a capital investment programme designed to improve 
performance at its Fleetwood works, which is scheduled to be 
completed later this year on time and on budget. The business has 
introduced an enhanced monitoring system across the company’s 
wastewater treatment works to help improve performance in respect 
of meeting consent standards at its works. With regard to sewer 
flooding, the business has identified those areas of its sewer network 
which are high risk with the potential to have a major flooding impact 
and has commenced a programme of work to help mitigate these risks. 
Improving the company’s response to customer contacts is another key 
area of focus, in particular billing enquiries. The business has introduced 
new working practices to help improve performance and early progress 
is encouraging. The process of monitoring regulatory targets has been 
enhanced and managers now have better information and the flexibility 
to reallocate resources to help meet these targets. The more technical 
work has also been brought back in-house, giving the business greater 
control to resolve issues and help meet its targets. 
The business expects an improved OPA score for 2009/10, with 
an increase in points in the areas of wastewater treatment works 
compliance, company contact score and unplanned interruptions. The 
actions being taken will have a positive impact on UUW’s performance 
as measured by Ofwat’s new service incentive mechanism, which is 
replacing OPA and is due to be introduced in 2010/11. 
2009 water price review
On 26 November 2009, Ofwat published its final determination of 
price limits for the 2010–15 period, which sees customers benefit 
from lower prices and higher levels of capital investment. After careful 
consideration, UUW accepted these proposals and the new price limits 
took effect from 1 April 2010. Ofwat’s final determination of price 
limits for UUW was based upon:
●  a £3.6 billion capital investment programme (2007/08 prices);
●  real growth of 12 per cent, or approximately £900 million, in the 
regulatory capital value over the five-year period;
●  an average annual underlying operating efficiency of 1.2 per cent 
for the water service and 2.4 per cent for the wastewater service;
●  a return on capital of 4.5 per cent (post-tax, real); and
●  an average annual real price decrease of 0.4 per cent across the 
five-year period, with a real price decrease of 4.3 per cent in the 
first year.
 
United Utilities had indicated previously that there was potential for 
additional investment in respect of the North East Irish Sea, which 
was dependent upon a European court case decision involving the UK 
government. A ruling by the European Court of Justice on 10 December 
2009 concluded that United Utilities will not be required to undertake 
this additional investment. 
Efficiency initiatives
UUW is well prepared for the 2010–15 price review period. Over the 
last year, United Utilities has undertaken a comprehensive review of 
the business, challenging working practices across the group, and is 
implementing detailed plans to improve performance and reduce its 
cost base.
Operating efficiency
During 2009/10, United Utilities reduced the number of people 
working in the group by the equivalent of around 500 full time 
employees (includes United Utilities staff and agency staff). 
Approximately 350 of the 500 worked in or supported the regulated 
business, equivalent to around seven per cent of that workforce. This 
provides an immediate contribution to the achievement of efficiency 
targets set by Ofwat.
Customer service is a key area of focus, as this forms part of Ofwat’s 
relative efficiency analysis and will also contribute to the regulator’s 
new service incentive mechanism assessment. UUW aims to reduce 
its cost to serve significantly, whilst continuing to improve the 
customer experience. The business has reduced its annual cost to 
serve from £23 per customer to £19 per customer over the last two 
years and is implementing plans to deliver further reductions, all 
while customer satisfaction has improved markedly. The company has 
amended staff incentive mechanisms to help get things right first time, 
with the aim of reducing unnecessary customer calls. Performance 
measurement is now based on first time resolution, rather than 
average call handling time. United Utilities’ customer online self-serve 
system is being enhanced to make it more comprehensive and user 
friendly, with the aim of reducing by a third the need for customers to 
contact the company’s call centre. UUW is focused on improving its 
debt collection rates and is planning to utilise more local authority 
collection agreements. The company is also enhancing systems to 
improve its customer segmentation analysis and to obtain better data 
on customers who have moved address, coupled with a more proactive 
debt follow-up strategy.
United Utilities is reviewing and streamlining its processes as it aims 
to become a leaner, more efficient company. The group is focused 
on operating with fewer, simpler and more consistent processes. For 
example, UUW is halving the number of steps from metering to cash 
collection. The group is rationalising its IT infrastructure, providing 
greater automation and visibility of workflow. Managers now have 
ownership of all steps in a process to help enhance performance. 
Individuals also have greater visibility and understanding of how their 
performance influences the efficiency of the entire process.

Performance
The group will continue to focus on delivering benefits from its existing 
efficiency initiatives, such as its workforce management system which 
is a key element in improving the efficiency of frontline staff, utilising 
remote operational site management and optimisation of chemical and 
power usage, improving efficiency of operational pumps, developing 
combined heat and power assets, which recycle energy generated 
from wastewater treatment processes, and improving supply chain 
management to deliver further procurement economies. A number 
of these schemes are also key elements of United Utilities’ plan to 
mitigate its carbon emissions. In 2009, UUW was awarded funding from 
Defra to convert biogas, a by-product of the sludge treatment process, 
into bio-methane for vehicle fuel. There is potential in the future to 
export biogas into the national gas distribution network.
Capital delivery
United Utilities has a robust commercial capital delivery framework 
in place for the 2010–15 period. Contractor partners have been 
appointed and the company has signed new supplier contracts, which 
will deliver significant savings and help improve efficiency. Incentive 
mechanisms are closely linked to the UUW business plan and pain/gain 
incentives are assessed on a project basis, rather than a cumulative 
basis, providing more clarity on performance. A partial fee retention 
mechanism is also in place to help drive on-time project delivery. In 
addition, UUW has flexibility in respect of the level of competitive 
tendering it may use in the award of future work during the five-year 
regulatory period.
United Utilities undertook detailed advanced planning which ensured 
smooth transition into the 2010–15 period and leveraged recent 
economic conditions to deliver procurement efficiency benefits. 
UUW expects capital investment, including infrastructure renewals 
expenditure, in 2010/11 to be substantial as the company aims for a 
smoother capital delivery profile across the five-year period compared 
with 2005–10. UUW has a strong focus on asset serviceability and also 
expects to bring forward the delivery of certain outputs.
Financial
United Utilities has approximately £2 billion of long dated, index-linked 
debt at an average cost of 1.8 per cent real. This compares with Ofwat’s 
cost of debt assumption of 3.6 per cent real and secures financing 
outperformance for the next five years. In line with its policy, the group 
has also fixed the interest rates on a significant proportion of the 
remainder of its existing debt portfolio, for the 2010–15 regulatory 
period, at an average nominal rate in the range 5.0 per cent to 5.5 per 
cent (inclusive of credit spread). This provides more clarity on UUW’s 
ability to outperform the final determination. Taken together with the 
group’s index-linked debt, this equates to approximately £300 million 
of financing outperformance over the five years, based on an RPI 
inflation rate of 2.5 per cent per annum. In addition, the group requires 
little refinancing during the 2010–15 period. 
The changes to the defined benefit pension schemes have significantly 
reduced the company’s pension deficit, reduced the future service 
cost and reduced future funding and deficit risk, thereby placing the 
company’s pension provision on a much more sustainable footing.
West East Link pipeline
Construction began in spring 2009 on a £125 million pipeline that will carry 
water from Prescot in Merseyside to Bury in Greater Manchester. It will take 
two years to complete and when finished will improve United Utilities’ ability 
to transport water around the North West, securing the water supply for 
future generations.
In the last financial year, 13.5km of the 55km pipe was laid and 16 tunnels were 
constructed, including those underneath the M6 and M61 motorways and the 
west coast main line railway.

Performance continued
NON-REGULATED ACTIVITIES
Financial highlights 
Non-regulated revenue was marginally lower at £890 million, reflecting 
the impact of difficult conditions in the UK property market on the 
group’s utility connections business and, as expected, a reduction in 
contribution from the group’s UK outsourcing contracts in the final 
year of the 2005–10 regulatory period. Reported operating profit was 
£63 million, in line with the prior year. This reflects a one-off credit of 
£9 million in relation to the group’s revised pension provision, partly 
offset by restructuring costs of approximately £5 million. The prior 
year profit numbers have been restated in accordance with IFRIC 12, as 
explained in note 32 of the financial statements.
During the second half of the year, United Utilities disposed of its 
investment in Northern Gas Networks Holdings Limited (NGN) for 
approximately £86 million and sold its economic interest in Manila 
Water Company (MWC) for approximately £46 million. The intention is 
to retain these proceeds within the group. As a result of the disposals, 
dividends from these investments, which are included in operating 
profit, were materially lower in 2009/10, at £2 million, compared 
with £12 million received in 2008/09. Adjusting for the impact of 
these disposals and the aforementioned one-off items would show an 
increase in non-regulated underlying operating profit growth of 
£7 million, for the year ended 31 March 2010, reflecting tight cost 
control in the business. 
Business update
United Utilities applies its utility skills from its regulated activities 
through outsourced utility contracts and investments. In June 2009, 
United Utilities, via the 4D consortium, won a new capital delivery 
contract with Southern Water to manage the design and build of a 
new wastewater treatment works in the Brighton and Hove area. 
The contract is underway and construction is expected to take 
approximately three years, followed by the potential for a two-year 
contract to operate and maintain the new plant. In addition, the 4D 
consortium has responsibility for managing part of Southern Water’s 
regulatory capital investment programme through to 2015.
The contract with Scottish Water, via Scottish Water Solutions Limited 
in which United Utilities is a major partner, came to a natural end in 
March 2010. Following the outcome of the recent water price review, 
Welsh Water announced in February 2010 that it intended to take 
operations and maintenance services in-house and therefore the 
contract with United Utilities has not been renewed for the 2010–15 
regulatory period. 
Following the sales of its holdings in NGN and MWC, United Utilities 
received several expressions of interest for its non-regulated 
activities. In May 2010, the group agreed the disposal of its Australian 
business for approximately £135 million, comprising £106 million 
in cash and £29 million in net debt assumed by the purchaser. The 
transaction is subject to a number of consents and regulatory 
approvals and financial close is expected in the second half of 2010. 
The group is continuing to evaluate the expressions of interest it has 
received for its remaining non-regulated businesses.
ALL OTHER SEGMENTS
As expected, the group’s other activities, which include central costs, 
delivered an underlying operating loss during the year of £4 million, 
compared with an underlying operating loss of £6 million in 2008/09. 
As indicated previously, the difficult conditions in the UK property 
market have affected the performance of United Utilities Property 
Services, the group’s property sales and management business. 
The reported operating loss for other activities was £7 million. This 
reflects restructuring costs of approximately £10 million, partly 
offset by a one-off credit of £7 million in respect of the group’s revised 
pension provision.

Performance/Corporate responsibility
Corporate responsibility
In 2009/10, United Utilities was recognised as Business in the 
Community’s Company of the Y ear, having achieved the highest 
platinum plus ranking in that organisation’s Corporate Responsibility 
(CR) Index. In addition, the group led the water sector in the Dow Jones 
Sustainability Index. 
Achieving this recognition is a result of the company including CR 
factors as a strategic consideration in its decision-making over the last 
10 years, recognising the importance of building trust and reputation 
with all its stakeholders. 
The group’s CR policy sets out its commitment to environmental, 
social and economic improvements. This is communicated in a way that 
enables all employees to recognise how their roles and responsibilities 
contribute to maintaining and improving sustainability performance. 
The group uses the Dow Jones Sustainability Index as a measurement 
tool to ensure a deeper and more strategic response to its most 
significant and material social, economic and environmental issues. 
It helps to embed the principles of sustainability and CR into corporate 
strategy and everyday business practice. 
Natural resource protection and environmental enhancement 
The group is committed to protecting and enhancing natural habitats 
and biodiversity as part of the way it manages operational sites 
and landholdings. The group is extending its flagship Sustainable 
Catchment Management Programme (SCaMP), building on 
recognised successes over the last five years. Integral to this is the 
ongoing partnership with the Royal Society for the Protection of 
Birds, reflecting the importance the group attaches to developing 
relationships with key organisations. The group continues to play an 
active role in the North West Biodiversity Forum and has signed up to 
the United Nations International Y ear of Biodiversity network in 
the UK. 
Sustainable consumption and production
Last year, the group set a new waste target, demonstrating its 
commitment to help ensure a sustainable future for the North West by 
diverting more than 95 per cent of its waste from landfill by 2015. This 
target will help offset additional costs from increases in landfill tax. 
The group is planning a pilot project to produce a nutrient-rich compost 
by combining household green waste with wastewater treatment 
process waste that would normally go to landfill. 
Climate change and energy
This year, the group updated its carbon strategy to take account of its 
2010–15 five-year investment programme and to bring its targets and 
aspirations into line with revised carbon accounting rules. A major part 
of its carbon strategy is generating renewable energy from sludge and 
other sources. Last year the group generated over 107 GWh. 
Current best available technology means the water quality investment 
programme will often be energy intensive, increasing the group’s 
overall carbon footprint. The company has secured Ofwat’s approval to 
invest £15 million in a mitigation programme to reverse that increase. 
The group is looking at further environmental benefits from using 
biogas, extracted from wastewater sludge. The gas is currently used 
in combined heat and power engines but the group is now building a 
plant to clean the biogas to a standard that can be used in vehicles or, 
potentially, put into the gas grid. This will be the first such plant at a UK 
wastewater treatment works.
Community engagement
Last year the group invested approximately £2.3 million in the 
communities in which it operates, including cash, time and in-
kind contributions. It continued to support employees involved 
in community activity by linking volunteering activity to personal 
development and supporting them through community grants and 
matched funding. This investment includes a number of community 
partnerships such as United Futures, a partnership with Groundwork 
to deliver bespoke community projects that support core business 
objectives. The group has also continued its support of WaterAid 
by promoting the charity to its customers and organising staff-led 
fundraising events.
For many years, United Utilities has provided education services to 
schools on subjects ranging from the water cycle to climate change. In 
light of the 2009 price review, the group took the difficult decision to 
end classroom-based education services from April 2010. The business 
will continue to promote specific campaigns such as reservoir safety 
and education materials will be available on its website. 
Customer service
The group is committed to improving its service to its customers 
and meeting their needs. The group recognises that in the current 
economic climate some customers may be experiencing financial 
difficulty and struggling to pay their water bills. The group is currently 
trialling a support tariff in specific areas to help those customers who 
are typically in debt with their water charges. Ofwat has approved 
a two-year trial, which consists of new pricing bands based upon an 
independent assessment of customers’ ability to pay.
United Utilities offers a wide range of payment options to help 
customers. One of the easiest ways to pay is by Direct Debit and last 
year nearly 40,000 Direct Debit mandates were set up. The group also 
offers a facility for customers to pay bills online; in the last year over 
200,000 online payments were made.
Developing talent
The company regards its workforce as a key asset and invests in each 
employee by identifying future skills and knowledge requirements, 
matching need with opportunity. The group measures and targets the 
extent to which training contributes to business success and looks 
for opportunities to retrain and redeploy employees when skill and 
knowledge requirements change. In addition, the company has 142 
apprentices following accredited training frameworks in the business.

Employees
United Utilities recognises that its business is only as strong as its 
employees and their collective commitment to achieving business 
goals. In light of this, the group aims to create a rewarding place to 
work, with a focus on health and safety, providing employees with 
a work-life balance and the chance to make a contribution to the 
communities in which they live and work.
Health and safety
In 2009/10 United Utilities further consolidated the health and safety 
management framework throughout the business. During the year the 
group appointed a director of health, safety, risk and security to drive 
further improvements and to lead the integration of these key risk 
areas in the business.
The reported accident incidence rate per 100,000 employees (injuries 
causing an absence of greater than one day) increased from 778 to 
801. The marginal rise in ‘lost time’ accidents was partly as a result 
of the extreme winter weather in December and January. Although 
the rate is below the industry sector rate published by the Health and 
Safety Executive, the group has plans to halve this number during the 
next five years. The reported accident incidence rate per 100,000 
employees for the group’s contractors is 1,247. 
United Utilities received a number of Royal Society for the Prevention 
of Accidents (ROSPA) awards for occupational health and safety 
in both the regulated water and non-regulated utility outsourcing 
businesses. The annual ROSPA awards recognise the significant 
improvements made during the last 12 months in establishing effective 
safety management systems and improving accident performance. 
Parts of the non-regulated business have followed the lead of the 
regulated business by gaining accreditation to the OHSAS 18001 H&S 
Management Standard.
The health of the group’s employees is vital. United Utilities offers 
a number of employee benefits related to health including lifestyle 
health assessments, health surveillance and counselling services. The 
group appointed a new occupational health provider during the year to 
help improve these services and believes that its wellbeing programme 
supports the current Health and Safety Executive strategy.
Employee engagement
The group places a strong emphasis on increasing employees’ 
engagement. This is measured annually and then acted upon to improve 
how employees feel about United Utilities and strengthen their 
understanding of its direction. Improving engagement is a key personal 
objective for leaders. In terms of its engagement index, although 
the company is scoring above the UK average in six of the 13 key 
categories, overall engagement fell by nine per cent. Targeted action 
plans will be put in place to make improvements in key areas.
Workplace environment
Team and personal objectives are linked to the group’s vision, 
strategy and company objectives, allowing employees to recognise 
their contribution towards achieving business goals. Monthly 
performance updates, briefings and team talks enable employees to 
hear and discuss how the business is performing. A talent and skills 
development programme helps create a flexible and skilled workforce, 
which is critical to the group’s ability to deliver improved services. 
The group’s policies on maternity, paternity, adoption and annual leave 
go beyond its legal obligations as an employer and play an important 
part in encouraging motivation and building loyalty to the company.  
The business principles make it clear that United Utilities seeks to 
act with integrity and fairness and observe legal requirements. Any 
employee with concerns that the company may not be adhering to 
these principles is encouraged to speak up via their manager or by 
calling a special telephone number in confidence. Key policies, which 
employees need to be aware of, are available on the intranet and 
promoted through new employee induction sessions. Managers benefit 
from an advice and guidance service which seeks to ensure they 
manage their employees in line with the correct procedures.
The company is committed to fulfilling its obligations in accordance 
with the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and best practice. As 
an equal opportunities employer, equal consideration is given to 
applicants with disabilities in the employment criteria. The business 
will modify equipment and practices wherever it is safe and practical to 
do so. Evidence of this is reflected in the retention of the ‘double tick’ 
positive disabled people award. 
More than 92 per cent of employees are members of company pension 
schemes, which include defined benefit (now closed to new members) 
and defined contribution schemes. United Utilities also operates an 
open flexible benefits scheme, allowing employees to choose benefits 
which suit their personal needs through salary sacrifice. 
United Utilities and its trade unions work together under an employee 
relations framework to ensure positive working relationships. 
Throughout 2009/10, that approach was used to positive effect in 
terms of consultation around the pay review and changes made to the 
defined benefit pension scheme.
In February 2009, United Utilities brought a number of outsourced 
activities back in-house. The full impact of this is reflected in the higher 
average headcount for 2009/10.

Employees/Principal risks and uncertainties
The group faces a variety of risks and uncertainties, both 
foreseeable and unforeseeable, which, if they materialise, could 
adversely affect its reputation, profitability or financial position, 
its share price or the pricing and liquidity of its debt securities. The 
principal risks and uncertainties are summarised here.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The group maintains an internal control framework (see figure below) that assesses, throughout the year, the nature and magnitude of internal and 
external risks to the achievement of business goals (see also the corporate governance section of this report). The board assesses the group’s appetite 
and tolerance to risk and clear risk tolerance boundaries are set. Managers are required to employ both proactive and reactive mitigation measures in 
a prioritised manner to reduce exposures and ensure ongoing resilience should a risk materialise. The executive management team regularly reviews 
significant risks. The audit committee regularly reviews the framework’s effectiveness and the group’s compliance with it.

Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010

RISK
The regulated business requires significant capital expenditure, 
particularly in relation to new and replacement plant and equipment for 
water and wastewater networks and treatment facilities. Historically, 
the group has financed this capital expenditure from operating 
cashflow and from external debt and equity financing. There can be no 
assurance that operating cashflows will not decline or that external 
debt financing and other sources of capital will be available, at 
similar cost to that assumed by Ofwat, in order to meet these capital 
expenditure requirements. Delivery of capital investment programmes 
could also be affected by a number of factors including adverse 
legacy effects of earlier capital investments (such as increased 
maintenance or enhancement costs) or amounts funded in regulatory 
capital investment programmes proving insufficient to meet the actual 
amount required. This may affect the group’s ability to meet regulatory 
and other environmental performance standards, which may result in 
fines imposed by UUW’s regulators of an amount of up to 10 per cent of 
regulated business turnover or other sanctions.
MITIGATION
In order to minimise the likelihood of funding shortfalls, capital 
investment programmes are regularly monitored to identify the risk of 
time, cost and quality variances from plans and budgets and to identify, 
where possible, any appropriate opportunities for outperformance. 
 CAPITAL INVESTMENT PROGRAMMES
 SERVICE INCENTIVE MECHANISM AND SERVICEABILITY ASSESSMENT
RISK
For the 2010-15 period, Ofwat has introduced a new comparative 
incentive mechanism to reward or penalise water companies’ service 
performance, replacing the overall performance assessment (OPA). The 
service incentive mechanism (SIM) compares companies’ performance 
in terms of the number of ‘unwanted’ contacts received from customers 
and how well they deal with those contacts. Depending upon UUW’s 
relative performance under the SIM it could receive a revenue penalty 
or reward when price limits are next reset in 2014.
The group is required to maintain the serviceability of its water 
and wastewater assets, ensuring they continue to deliver a level 
of service and performance at least as good as in the past. Where 
serviceability falls below required reference levels of performance 
Ofwat may impose a penalty in revenue at the next price-setting. Or, if 
performance were to decline, the group may incur additional operating 
or capital expenditure to restore performance.
MITIGATION
In preparation for the change, systems and processes are being 
developed and enhanced, where necessary, to allow the company to 
report accurately on the volume of ‘unwanted’ contacts it receives. 
The company’s focus is on ensuring right first time service delivery 
to its customers, thus avoiding the need for ‘unwanted’ contacts. 
Where ‘unwanted’ contacts do arise, then there is a clear focus on 
identifying the root causes. These actions are intended to ensure that 
the company’s performance under the SIM is optimised and thereby 
mitigating the risk of a penalty at the next price-setting. 
The various indicators of performance are closely and routinely 
monitored by management. The company’s capital investment 
programme is targeted to seek to maintain stable serviceability of 
the company’s water and wastewater assets. Similarly, operational 
practice is intended to ensure stable serviceability. Where adverse 
trends develop and there is a risk of serviceability deviating from 
stable, then corrective action can be taken.

Business review
Principal risks and uncertainties
RISK
In 2008, the government announced its intention to transfer sewers 
and pumping stations currently owned by private individuals and 
businesses to sewerage undertakers. The precise date and nature of 
the transfer is yet to be determined but could occur as soon as 2011. 
No allowance has been made in price limits for the costs associated 
with the transfer. Therefore, any costs incurred will represent an 
unbudgeted increase in operating and capital expenditure. 
MITIGATION
Although there are costs associated with the transfer, as long as they 
are incurred efficiently they are expected to be largely recoverable 
when price limits are next reset, either at an interim determination 
or the next periodic review, but there can be no guarantee of full cost 
recovery at this stage. 
 THE ADOPTION OF PRIVATE SEWERS
RISK
In recent years, the global banking crisis and economic downturn have 
impacted the bank lending environment, as well as the debt and equity 
capital markets. This has resulted in the cost of capital increasing and 
has made the arranging of finance and issuance of new equity and debt 
capital more expensive and difficult to secure. 
A compounding challenge arises from the relationship between the 
regulatory capital value (RCV) of the regulated business and the Retail 
Prices Index (RPI). The RCV is adjusted annually for inflation so, if 
RPI decreases, the RCV would be adjusted downward to reflect this. 
This may lead to pressure on gearing (and other key financial ratios), 
credit ratings of the regulated business (and the group as a whole), 
and increase the cost or limit the availability of credit. In the extreme, 
the group may be required to increase its equity base by either 
reducing its dividend payments or raising new equity capital. The global 
economic downturn continues to present difficult trading and financing 
conditions for customers, contractors and suppliers of materials
and/or services to the group.
MITIGATION
The group monitors closely its liquidity headroom within the 
parameters approved by the board, the impact of trends in inflation or 
deflation on its capital position as well as the potential impact of wider 
changes in the credit markets. Where possible, the group has sought 
to issue debt linked to RPI to minimise the extent of its exposure to 
deflationary (or low inflationary) conditions. The group also monitors 
the financial position of its key contractors and suppliers and seeks to 
use its procurement processes to ensure that alternative suppliers can 
be sourced quickly and, where possible, on similar terms.
RISK
The group participates in a number of pension arrangements, 
predominantly in the UK. The principal schemes are defined benefit 
schemes, although these have been closed to new employees since 
October 2006. The assets of these schemes are held in trust funds 
independent of group finances, with the funds being well diversified 
and professionally managed. The group’s current schemes had 
a combined IAS 19 deficit of £271 million as at 31 March 2010, 
compared with a deficit of £213 million as at 31 March 2009 and a 
deficit of £359 million as at 30 September 2009.
MITIGATION
Increases to pension fund deficits may result in an increased liability 
for the group, the size of the liability depending upon the extent to 
which additional deficits are recoverable through the regulatory price 
determination process. In the 2009 water price review, Ofwat took 
account of broadly 50 per cent of the pension deficit shown in UUW’s 
final business plan for the regulated business when setting its overall 
price controls. In response to the size of its ongoing pension risks and 
pension costs the group has recently been consulting on a series of 
changes for employees in its defined benefit schemes. These changes, 
which came into force on 31 March 2010, will result in reduced costs 
and risks, including deficit, associated with defined benefit liabilities in 
future. In conjunction with the trustees, the group continues to monitor 
the investment strategy for the pension schemes, including the group’s 
exposure to investment risks.

RISK
The group is subject to various laws and regulations in the UK and 
internationally. Regulatory authorities may, from time to time, make 
enquiries of companies within their jurisdiction regarding compliance 
with regulations governing their operations. In addition to regulatory 
compliance proceedings, the group could become involved in a 
range of third party proceedings relating to, for example: land use, 
environmental protection and water quality. Amongst others, these 
may include civil actions by third parties for infringement of rights or 
nuisance claims relating to odour or other matters. Furthermore, the 
impact of future changes in laws or regulations or the introduction 
of new laws or regulations that affect the business cannot always be 
predicted and, from time to time, interpretation of existing laws or 
regulations may also change or the approach to their enforcement may 
become more rigorous. If the group fails to comply with applicable law 
or regulations, in particular in relation to its water and wastewater 
licences, or has not successfully undertaken corrective action, 
regulatory action could be taken that could include the imposition of a 
financial penalty (of up to 10 per cent of relevant regulated turnover) 
or the imposition of an enforcement order requiring the group to 
incur additional capital or operating expenditure to remedy its non-
compliance. In the most extreme cases, non-compliance may lead to 
revocation of a licence or the appointment of a special administrator. 
MITIGATION
The group endeavours to comply with all legal requirements in 
accordance with its business principles and robust processes are 
in place to seek to mitigate against non-compliance. The group 
continually monitors legislative and regulatory developments and, 
where appropriate, participates in consultations to seek to influence 
their outcome, either directly or through industry trade associations 
for wider issues. The group seeks appropriate funding for any 
additional compliance costs in the regulated business as part of the 
price determination process.
 FAILURE TO COMPL Y WITH APPLICABLE LAW OR REGULATIONS
 INCREASED COMPETITION IN THE WATER AND WASTEWATER INDUSTRY
RISK
The Cave review of competition and innovation in water markets 
was published in April 2009 and in September 2009 the government 
consulted on legislation to implement a number of the review’s 
proposals. If its recommendations are implemented, this could 
eventually expand the competitive market allowing retail competition 
to all non-household customers. Ofwat and the Environment Agency 
are considering the introduction of reforms to the regulation of water 
abstraction licences that would allow trading of licences. Ofwat is 
also examining the scope for ‘upstream’ competition in treated water 
supply. 
Ofwat has taken steps to introduce competition into the water supply 
market through inset appointments and the water licensing supply 
regime. Prior to 2007 (with one exception), inset appointees had all 
been granted to existing regulated companies. Since 2007, Ofwat has 
granted more inset appointments, one of which is within UUW’s region. 
Further inset appointments may be made in the future, resulting in 
increased competition.
MITIGATION
The group has been fully engaged in the government and Ofwat 
consultations on the Cave review and other aspects of competition. 
A relatively small proportion of the group’s profits derive from 
the retailing of water and wastewater services to non-household 
customers. However, United Utilities recognises that reforms to the 
pricing rules that govern access to the group’s water network and 
greater upstream competition could put at risk a greater proportion 
of the group’s profits. If competition is expanded, there would also be 
opportunities for the group to participate in a wider market in England 
and Wales.

BUSINESS REVIEW

Business review
Principal risks and uncertainties
RISK
The group controls and operates utility networks and maintains the 
associated assets with the objective of providing a continuous service. 
In exceptional circumstances, a significant interruption of service 
provision or catastrophic damage could occur resulting in: significant 
loss of life; and/or environmental damage; and/or economic and 
social disruption. Such circumstances might arise, for example, from 
electricity, gas or water shortages; the failure of an asset or an element 
of a network or supporting plant and equipment; human error; an 
individual’s malicious intervention; or unavoidable resource shortfalls. 
The group could be fined for breaches of statutory obligations or held 
liable to third parties, or be required to provide an alternative water 
supply of equivalent quality, which could increase costs. The group is 
also dependent upon the ability to access, utilise and communicate 
remotely via electronic software applications mounted upon corporate 
information technology hardware and communicating through internal 
and external networks. The ownership, maintenance and recovery of 
such applications, hardware and networks are not wholly under the 
group’s control.
MITIGATION
The group operates long-standing, well tested and appropriately 
resourced incident response and escalation procedures. The processes 
continue to be refined, alongside related risk management and 
business continuity procedures. These recognise that possible events 
can have varying causes, impacts and likelihoods. While the group 
seeks to ensure that it has appropriate processes in place, there can 
be no certainty that such measures will be effective in preventing or, 
when necessary, managing large-scale incidents to the satisfaction 
of customers, regulators, government and the wider stakeholder 
community. The group also maintains insurance cover in relation to 
losses and liabilities likely to be associated with such significant risks, 
although potential liabilities arising from a catastrophic event could 
exceed the maximum level of insurance cover that can be obtained 
cost-effectively. The licence of the regulated business also contains a 
‘shipwreck’ clause that, if applicable, may offer a degree of recourse to 
Ofwat in the event of a catastrophic incident.
 EVENTS, SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS, SYSTEMS FAILURES, WATER SHORTAGES OR CONTAMINATION OF WATER SUPPLIES
RISK
Outside the regulated business, the group provides services relating 
to the operation and management of assets for other utility clients 
in the UK and overseas. These services include the maintenance 
and operation of utility networks, the design and construction of 
new assets, the design and construction of new connections to the 
relevant network and the provision of ancillary services. The delivery 
of contracts, both existing and future, will be achieved by exploiting 
the group’s core infrastructure management skills and may also 
require capital expenditure. The overstretching of such skills could 
lead to a loss of customers or the inability to meet contractual 
commitments, or to the incurrence of penalties. 
MITIGATION
The costs and risks associated with these new projects are subject 
to internal reviews before approval is given to commit to them. 
The group aims to comply with its contractual commitments or 
operating performance targets and any requirements to maintain 
service continuity or achieve specified operating efficiencies in 
relation to those clients. Within the non-regulated business, the 
focus is on deploying the group’s core skills on an asset-light basis, 
whilst continually monitoring contract performance, together with 
programme and project management.
 RISKS IN THE GROUP’S NON-REGULATED BUSINESS

RISK
NOSS Consortium (NOSS) (of which North West Water International 
Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of United Utilities Group PLC, 
is a member and the sole remaining active participant) is party 
to arbitration proceedings in Thailand in relation to a design and 
construction contract dated 1 November 1993 between NOSS 
and the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) to build a 
wastewater treatment plant and network in central Bangkok. Following 
disagreements with the engineer (Dorsch Consult) and disputes with 
the BMA, NOSS terminated the contract with the BMA and served 
a notice of arbitration. NOSS has total claims against the BMA of 
approximately six billion baht. The BMA has counterclaimed for 
approximately three billion baht; however, based upon the facts and 
matters currently known, the counterclaim appears to lack substance. 
Although there have been some delays in the arbitral process, the 
arbitration now appears set to proceed.
In February 2009, the group was served with notice of a multiparty 
‘class action’ in Argentina into which United Utilities International 
Limited (UUIL) was enjoined in 2007. The class action is related to the 
issuance and payment default of a US$230 million bond by Inversora 
Eléctrica de Buenos Aires S.A. (IEBA), an Argentine project company 
set up to purchase one of the Argentine electricity distribution 
networks, which was privatised in 1997. UUIL had a 45 per cent 
shareholding in IEBA which it sold in 2005. The class action is being 
pursued against various parties, including the original direct and 
indirect shareholders of IEBA, the banks which advised IEBA and the 
rating agencies of the bonds. The bonds, which were issued in 1997, 
were defaulted in March 2002 and IEBA entered an insolvency process 
in 2003. The claim is for a non-quantified amount of unspecified 
damages, and purports to be pursued on behalf of unidentified 
consumer bondholders in IEBA. UUIL has filed a defence to the action 
and will vigorously resist the proceedings, given the robust defences 
that UUIL has been advised that it has on procedural and substantive 
grounds.
In March 2010, Manchester Ship Canal Company (MSCC), owners of 
the Manchester Ship Canal (the ‘canal’), issued proceedings, seeking, 
amongst other relief, damages alleging trespass against UUW in 
respect of UUW’s discharges of water and treated effluent into the 
canal. The respective legal rights of MSCC and UUW relating to the 
discharges are unclear. Accordingly, the relevant legal principles need 
to be tested through court process. UUW will be filing a defence and 
counterclaim in support of its believed entitlement to make discharges 
into the canal without charge and MSCC’s claim will be vigorously 
defended thereafter.
MITIGATION
The group faces the general risk of litigation in connection with its 
businesses. In most cases, liability for litigation is difficult to assess or 
quantify; recovery may be sought for very large and/or indeterminate 
amounts and the existence and magnitude of liability may remain 
unknown for substantial periods of time. The group robustly defends 
litigation where appropriate and seeks to minimise its exposure to such 
claims by early identification of risks and compliance with its legal and 
other obligations. Based upon the facts and matters currently known 
and the provisions carried in the group’s consolidated statement of 
financial position, the directors are of the opinion that the possibility 
of the disputes referred to in this risk section having a material 
adverse effect on the group’s financial position is remote.

United Utilities Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010
Directors’ report - statutory information
The directors present their report and the audited financial statements 
of United Utilities Group PLC (the company) and its subsidiaries 
(together referred to as the group) for the year ended 31 March 2010.
Principal activities and business review
The company is a public limited company registered in England and 
Wales. Its registered office address is at Haweswater House, Lingley 
Mere Business Park, Lingley Green Avenue, Great Sankey, Warrington, 
WA5 3LP .
The company is the holding company of a group which owns and operates 
water and wastewater assets and also manages infrastructure for other 
businesses, predominantly within the United Kingdom.
The business review (pages 1 to 24), which includes the chairman’s and 
chief executive officer’s statements and the financial performance 
section (pages 7 to 16), provides a balanced analysis of the development 
and performance of the group’s business during the financial year, and 
the position of the group’s business at the year end, and forms part of 
this directors’ report. A summary of performance can be found on the 
inside front cover.  A summary of the principal risks and uncertainties can 
be found on pages 19 to 24. An indication of likely future developments 
of the group can be found on page 6. The company’s principal subsidiary 
undertakings, and the associated companies and joint ventures in which 
the group participates, are listed in note 14 to the consolidated financial 
statements.
Dividends
The directors are recommending a final dividend of 23.13 pence per 
ordinary share for the year ended 31 March 2010, which, together with 
the interim dividend of 11.17 pence, gives a total dividend for the year 
of 34.30 pence per ordinary share (the interim and final dividends paid 
in respect of the 2008/09 financial year were 10.64 pence and 22.03 
pence per ordinary share respectively).  
Subject to approval by shareholders at the annual general meeting, 
the final dividend will be paid on 2 August 2010 to shareholders on 
the register at the close of business on 18 June 2010.  United Utilities 
Employee Share Trust Limited has waived its rights to dividends, 
including dividends paid in respect of the year ended 31 March 2010 
and future dividends, in respect of the 41,418 ordinary shares held by 
it as at 20 May 2010.
Directors
The names of the current directors and summary biographical details 
of those who served during the financial year ended 31 March 2010 are 
given on pages 26 and 27.
During the year, there were no changes to the membership of the 
board although, as announced on 10 December 2009, Tim Weller, chief 
financial officer, will step down from the board and leave the company 
on 21 May 2010 and Andrew Pinder, non-executive director, will retire 
from the board at the annual general meeting on 23 July 2010.
The articles of association provide that a director must retire at the 
third annual general meeting following his or her last appointment or 
reappointment by shareholders. For the annual general meetings held in 
2009 and 2010, the articles included transitional provisions in relation 
to the retirement of directors by rotation. Charlie Cornish, Catherine Bell 
and Nick Salmon are retiring and offering themselves for reappointment 
at the 2010 annual general meeting.
Details of the board’s policies and procedures regarding the 
appointment of directors are included in the corporate governance 
report on pages 32 to 41. Details of the interests in the company’s 
shares held by the directors and persons connected with them are set 
out in the directors’ remuneration report on pages 42 to 52.
Corporate governance statement
Further details of the company’s compliance with the Combined 
Code on Corporate Governance as published by the Financial 
Reporting Council in June 2008 (the code) are given on pages 32 to 
41. The statement includes a description of the main features of the 
group’s internal control and risk management systems in relation 
to the financial reporting process and forms part of this directors’ 
report.  A copy of the code, published in June 2008 as applicable 
to the company for the year ended 31 March 2010, can be found at 
the Financial Reporting Council’s website frc.org.uk. Copies of the 
matters reserved to the board and the terms of reference for each of 
the main board committees can be found on the company’s website at

the consideration given by the directors to the factors relevant to the 
adoption of the going concern basis.

Directors’ report - statutory information
The annual general meeting
The annual general meeting of the company will be held on 23 July 2010 
at The Midland Hotel, Peter Street, Manchester, M2 3NQ.
Full details of the resolutions to be proposed to shareholders, and 
explanatory notes in respect of these resolutions, can be found in 
the notice of annual general meeting. A copy can be found on the 
company’s website.
At the annual general meeting, resolutions will be proposed, amongst 
other matters; to receive the annual report and financial statements; to 
approve the directors’ remuneration report; to declare a final dividend; 
and to reappoint Deloitte LLP as auditors.
In addition, resolutions will be proposed: to approve the directors’ 
general authority to allot shares; to grant the authority to issue shares 
without first applying statutory rights of pre-emption; to authorise the 
company to make market purchases of its own shares; to authorise the 
making of limited political donations by the company and its subsidiaries; 
to update the company’s articles of association to reflect requirements 
of the Companies Act 2006; and to enable the company to continue to 
hold general meetings on not less than 14 clear days’ notice.
Share capital, transfers of shares and voting rights
At 31 March 2010, the authorised share capital of the company was 
£1,580,050,000 divided into 1,000,000,000 ordinary shares of five 
pence each, 626,043,820 B shares of 170 pence each, 273,956,180 
deferred shares of 170 pence each and 50,000 non-voting redeemable 
preference shares of £1 each, and the issued share capital of the 
company was £499,802,308 divided into 681,536,032 ordinary shares 
of five pence each and 273,956,180 deferred shares of 170 pence 
each. Details of the share capital and movements in the issued share 
capital are shown in note 25 to the financial statements on page 107. 
The ordinary shares represented 71.3 per cent and the deferred shares 
represented 28.7 per cent respectively of the total issued share capital 
as at 31 March 2010.
All ordinary shares have the same rights, including the rights to one 
vote at a general meeting, to an equal proportion of any dividend 
declared and payable, and to an equal amount of any surplus assets 
which are distributed in the event of a winding-up.
The deferred shares convey no right to income, no right to vote and no 
appreciable right to participate in any surplus capital in the event of a 
winding-up. The rights attaching to shares in the company are provided 
by the articles of association, which may be amended or replaced by 
means of a special resolution of the company in general meeting. The 
company renews annually its power to issue and buy back shares at its 
annual general meeting and such resolutions will be proposed at the 
2010 annual general meeting. The directors’ powers are conferred on 
them by UK legislation and by the company’s articles. At the annual 
general meeting of the company on 24 July 2009, the directors were 
authorised to issue relevant securities up to an aggregate nominal 
amount of £11,358,093 and were empowered to allot equity securities 
for cash on a non pre-emptive basis to an aggregate nominal amount of 
£1,703,714.
Electronic and paper proxy appointment and voting instructions must 
be received by the company’s registrars not less than 48 hours before 
a general meeting and when calculating this period, the directors can 
decide not to take account of any part of a day that is not a working day.
There are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares in the 
company, nor any limitations on the holding of shares in the company, 
save (i) where the company has exercised its right to suspend their 
voting rights or to prohibit their transfer following the omission of 
their holder or any person interested in them to provide the company 
with information requested by it in accordance with Part 22 of the 
Companies Act 2006; or (ii) where their holder is precluded from 
exercising voting rights by the Financial Services Authority’s Listing 
Rules or the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers.
There are no arrangements known to the company by which financial 
rights carried by any shares in the company are held by a person other 
than the holder of the shares, nor are there known to the company 
any arrangements between holders of securities that may result in 
restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights. All issued 
shares are fully paid.
Major interests in shares
At 20 May 2010, the directors had been notified of the following 
interests in the company’s issued ordinary share capital in accordance 
with the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the Financial Services 
Authority:
 % of issued Direct or indirect
Shareholder share capital nature of holding
BlackRock Inc 5.13 indirect 
Pictet Asset Management S.A. 4.995 indirect  
AXA S.A. 4.933 direct and indirect
Tradewinds Global Investors, LLC 4.12 indirect
Legal & General Group PLC 3.97 indirect 
Purchase of own shares 
At the annual general meeting of the company held on 24 July 2009, 
shareholders authorised the company to purchase, in the market, 
up to 68,148,563 of its own ordinary shares of five pence each. No 
shares were purchased pursuant to that authority during the year. Such 
authority from shareholders is normally sought annually. Authorisation 
will be sought from shareholders of the company at the 2010 annual 
general meeting to grant authority to purchase up to 68,153,603 of 
its own ordinary shares of five pence each, such authority to expire at 
the conclusion of the company’s annual general meeting in 2011 or, if 
earlier, on 22 October 2011.

Directors’ report - statutory information continued
Change of control
The trustee of the United Utilities Employee Share Trust, which 
administers the performance share plans, matching share plans and 
deferred share award scheme, has the ability to exercise voting rights 
at its discretion which relate to shares which it holds under the trust 
deed constituting the trust. In the event of a takeover offer which 
could lead to a change of control of the company, the trustee must 
consult with the company before accepting the offer or voting in 
favour of the offer. Subject to that requirement, the trustee may take 
into account a prescribed list of interests and considerations prior to 
making a decision in relation to the offer, including the interests of 
the beneficiaries under the trust. In the event of a change of control, 
the participants in the share incentive plan would be able to direct the 
trustees how to act on their behalf.
Directors’ indemnities and insurance
The company has in place contractual entitlements for directors of 
the company and of its subsidiaries to claim indemnification by the 
company in respect of certain liabilities which might be incurred by 
them in the course of their duties as directors.
These arrangements, which constitute qualifying third party indemnity 
provision and qualifying pension scheme indemnity provision, have been 
established in compliance with the relevant provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006. They include provision for the company to fund the costs 
incurred by directors in defending certain claims against them in relation 
to their duties as directors of the company or its subsidiaries.
The company also maintains an appropriate level of directors’ and 
officers’ liability insurance.
Political and charitable donations
United Utilities does not support any political party and does not 
make what are commonly regarded as donations to any political 
party or other political organisations. However, the wide definition 
of donations in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 
2000 covers activities which form part of the necessary relationship 
between the group and political stakeholders. This includes promoting 
United Utilities’ activities at any of the main political parties’ annual 
conferences when they are held in the North West region. In 2009/10, 
the Conservative Party held its annual conference in Manchester, as did 
the Labour Party the previous year. The group incurred expenditure of 
£19,155 (2009: £27,702) as part of this process. At the 2009 annual 
general meeting, an authority was taken to cover such expenditure. A 
similar resolution will be put to the shareholders at the 2010 annual 
general meeting to authorise the company and its subsidiaries to make 
such expenditure.
Charitable donations by the group in the year amounted to £5,247,202 
(2009: £4,262,520) in support of charitable causes in the local 
communities in which it operates and those of interest to its employees. 
Employees
The company’s policies on employee consultation and on equal 
opportunities for disabled employees are contained within the 
employees section of the business review on page 18. The board 
encourages employees to own shares in the company. Details of 
employee share schemes can be found in the remuneration report on 
page 52.
Environmental, social and community matters
Details of the company’s approach to corporate responsibility, relating 
to the environment and social and community issues, can be found in 
the corporate responsibility section on page 17.
Essential contractual relationships
Certain suppliers to the group contribute key goods or services, the 
loss of which could cause disruption to the group’s services. However, 
none are so vital that their loss would affect the viability of the group 
as a whole; nor is the business of the group overly dependent upon any 
one individual customer.
Policy on payment of creditors
The group’s policy is in line with the CBI Code of Prompt Payment 
(copies are available from the CBI, Centre Point, 103 New Oxford 
Street, London, WC1A 1DU). Payment terms are specific to the type 
of contract and the relevant commercial arrangements, and are agreed 
with suppliers in advance. The group makes every effort to comply 
with the payment terms as agreed with its suppliers subject to there 
being no dispute with the invoices received. As at 31 March 2010, the 
average credit period taken for trade purchases was 34 days for the 
group (2009: 34 days). The company has no trade and other payables 
due to external creditors.
Approach to technology development
The company is committed to using innovative, cost-effective and 
practical solutions for providing high quality services. It recognises 
the importance of ensuring that it focuses properly its investment 
in the development of technology, that it has the right skills to apply 
technology to achieve sustainable competitive advantage and that it 
continues to be alert to emerging technological opportunities.
Financial instruments
The risk management objectives and policies of the company in relation 
to the use of financial instruments can be found in note 19 to the 
financial statements.

Fixed assets
The group holds significant land assets; however, the vast majority of 
these are water catchment assets which are an integral and essential 
part of the operation of the group’s regulated business. The nature of 
these assets, which are primarily moorland areas and which could not 
be sold by the group, means that it is impractical to obtain meaningful 
market values for the land. Other land owned by the group, the majority 
of which relates to operational sites, does not have a market value 
materially different from historic cost.
Events occurring after the reporting period
Details of events after the reporting period are included in note 31 to 
the consolidated financial statements on page 112.
Information given to the auditors
Each of the persons who is a director at the date of approval of this 
report confirms that:
(1) so far as he or she is aware, there is no relevant audit information of 
which the company’s auditors are unaware; and
(2) he or she has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have taken as 
a director in order to make himself/herself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the company’s auditors are 
aware of that information. This confirmation is given, and should 
be interpreted, in accordance with the provisions of s418 of the 
Companies Act 2006.
Reappointment of auditors
The board is proposing that shareholders reappoint Deloitte LLP as 
auditors at the forthcoming annual general meeting and authorise the 
directors to fix the auditors’ remuneration.
Approved by the board on 20 May 2010 and signed on its behalf by:
Tom Keevil

Corporate governance
The Combined Code
This corporate governance statement forms part of and should be read 
in conjunction with the directors’ report set out on pages 28 to 31.
United Utilities Group PLC (the company) is subject to the Combined 
Code on Corporate Governance (the code) which was published by the 
Financial Reporting Council in June 2008.
During the financial year ended 31 March 2010, the company complied 
fully with the provisions of Section 1 of the code.
This report (which incorporates a report from the audit committee, see 
pages 38 to 40), together with the remuneration report on pages 42 
to 52, gives details of how the main principles of the code have been 
applied during the year.
The board of directors
The names of the current directors who served during the year, and their 
biographical details, are set out on pages 26 and 27. As is apparent 
from that information, the board membership has an appropriate 
range of commercial, engineering, financial, industrial and regulatory 
expertise to provide effective stewardship to the company. T en board 
meetings are scheduled each year and the board will meet more or less 
frequently as required. During the year nine meetings were held (2009: 
nine). Additionally, the board held a number of telephone conferences to 
consider, amongst other matters, the price review associated with the 
final determination issued by Ofwat on 26 November 2009. The following 
table shows the attendance of each of the directors at meetings of the 
board and the principal board committees, which are subject to code 
requirements, during the year. The figures in brackets show the maximum 
number of meetings which the directors could have attended.

Summary of approach to governance
The board members are fully aware of their responsibilities, both 
individually and collectively, to promote the long-term success of 
the company. The board is responsible for devising the strategy of 
the group and has responsibility for the internal control systems 
operated across the group, allowing assessment and management 
of the key issues and risks impacting the business. During the year, 
the board specifically considered the company’s strategy and long-
term business plan during board meetings. The board has a formal 
schedule of matters reserved to it, which ensures that it takes all 
major strategy, policy and investment decisions affecting the group. 
Accordingly, the board sets the company’s overall strategic direction, 
reviews management performance and assesses whether the company 
has the necessary financial and human resources in place to meet its 
objectives. It also reviews the company’s business planning, approach 
to risk management and development of policies. The remuneration 
committee (whose report is set out on pages 42 to 52) is principally 
responsible for  the directors’ and senior managers’ remuneration.
“We remain committed to adopting the highest standards of corporate governance and this 
underpins our approach to doing business. We endeavour to operate in an environmentally 
sustainable and socially responsible manner. We listen to the views of all our stakeholders and 
this helps shape the manner in which we do business. ” 
Dr John McAdam, chairman

GOVERNANCE
Governance
Corporate governance
The board is responsible for promoting the long-term success of the 
company and ensuring that the principal goal of the company is to 
create shareholder value, while having regard to other stakeholder 
interests. The board takes responsibility for setting the company’s 
values and standards. Accordingly, the long-term interests of 
shareholders, together with consideration of the wider interests 
of stakeholders represented by employees, customers, suppliers, 
the community and the environment, are factored into the group’s 
management processes. Appropriate consideration is also given, 
within the company’s control and risk assessment processes, to social, 
environmental and ethical issues.
The steps taken to achieve these goals are communicated to 
shareholders and other interested parties through dedicated 
communication and investor relations departments, the company’s 
website and to employees via the intranet and through formal and 
informal briefings and newsletters. Through its vision, core values, 
formal policies and the ‘business principles’ statement, which sets 
out what the company expects from employees in the conduct of the 
company’s business, the board seeks to engender a culture where 
business ethics, integrity and fairness are values that all employees 
endorse and apply in their everyday conduct.
The board has established a governance framework which encourages 
all directors to bring to bear independent judgement on issues of 
strategy, performance and resources, including key appointments 
and standards of conduct. Directors have a right to ensure that any 
unresolved concerns they have about the running of the company or a 
proposed action are recorded in the board minutes. In addition, upon 
resignation, a non-executive director is asked to provide a written 
statement addressed to the chairman should he or she have any 
concerns about the running of the company, and any such statement 
would then be circulated to the board.
The group’s governance structure also seeks to ensure that decisions 
are made at an appropriate level by employees with the knowledge and 
skills to do so.
The directors of subsidiary operating companies (most notably United 
Utilities Water PLC) are legally responsible for those business entities 
and their associated regulatory obligations. Additionally, they are 
tasked with the delivery of the targets set within the budgets approved 
by the board and for the implementation of strategy and policy across 
their businesses.
The board’s view is that it is appropriate, from a development perspective, 
for executive directors or senior managers to become non-executive 
directors of other companies, provided that any such appointment 
does not impact upon their obligations to the company or upon the 
performance of their duties. T o this end, there is an embargo upon such 
individuals accepting more than one non-executive directorship of a FTSE 
100 company or the chairmanship of such a company.
Principal committees of the board (summary)
The board has formally delegated specific responsibilities to certain 
committees, including the following: approvals; audit (see page 38); 
community investment; nomination (see page 34); remuneration 
(see page 42); and treasury. All board committees are provided with 
sufficient resources to undertake their duties, have authority to seek 
independent advice, if appropriate, and are supported by the company’s 
secretariat. In addition to the board committees featured in the code, 
the board has delegated certain of its powers and functions to the 
committees described in the following three paragraphs.
Approvals committee
This considers and approves expenditure and investment proposals 
within limits determined by the board. Its members are the executive 
directors and the company secretary.
Community investment committee 
This has responsibility for developing and overseeing the corporate 
responsibility strategy of the company and for approving its charitable 
donations. Its members are certain board directors and such executive 
leadership team members as may be appointed by the board from 
time to time. Two employee representatives are also invited to attend 
meetings and participate in its assessment of items of business. During 
the year ended 31 March 2010, its chairman was Tim Weller, with Dr 
Catherine Bell and Gaynor Kenyon, communications director, being its 
other members. 
Treasury committee 
This considers and approves borrowing, leasing, bond and other 
banking facilities within limits set by the board. It is chaired by Paul 
Heiden and its other members are the chief financial officer and the 
treasurer. The treasury committee has delegated some of its powers, 
subject to certain limits, to the chief financial officer and the treasurer.
Executive leadership teams 
During the year the responsibilities of the senior management were 
aligned more closely with the regulated and non-regulated business 
units. To that end, the chief executive officer formed an executive 
committee consisting of Tim Weller, chief financial officer; Charlie 
Cornish, managing director Utility Solutions; and Alison Clarke, human 
resources director, with Tom Keevil acting as the secretary. It provided 
a regular forum for discussing group-wide operational and strategic 
issues impacting the business. Beneath that committee, a United 
Utilities Water executive leadership team was formed consisting 
of Philip Green as chairman; Martin Bradbury, chief information 
officer; Alison Clarke; Steven Fraser, operations director; Tom Keevil, 
company secretary and general counsel; Gaynor Kenyon; Tim Weller; 
and Matthew Wright, asset management and delivery director. Charlie 
Cornish also formed a senior management team to oversee the 
management of the non-regulated business.

Corporate governance continued
Chairman and chief executive
The positions of chairman and chief executive are separate 
appointments and the board has agreed clearly defined responsibilities 
for these roles. It has also adopted a set of guiding principles to 
govern the working relationship between them. The chairman is 
primarily responsible for the working of the board, ensuring that the 
non-executive directors are fully engaged in their roles and that they 
provide an effective contribution to the operation of the board and the 
promotion of the success of the company. In essence, the responsibility 
of the chief executive officer is to manage the group’s business and to 
implement board strategy and policy.
Board balance and independence
The board aims to maintain a balance of executive and non-executive 
directors and, at the date of approval of this statement, comprises 
the non-executive chairman, three executive directors and five 
non-executive directors. All five of the non-executive directors are 
determined by the board to be independent in accordance with the 
code and free from any business or other relationship which could 
compromise their independent judgement. The chairman (following 
appointment to that role) is not deemed to be independent under the 
code in view of his unique role in corporate governance, although Dr 
John McAdam was deemed to be independent at the time of his initial 
appointment to the board. 
Senior independent director
Nick Salmon is the senior independent director and is available to 
shareholders if they have concerns that dialogue with management 
representatives has failed to resolve. The terms of reference for the 
senior independent director are available on the company’s website. 
They include the authority to call a meeting of the non-executive 
directors if, in his opinion, it is necessary; the convening of a meeting 
of the non-executive directors without the chairman present at least 
annually to appraise the chairman’s performance; and to be available if 
required to attend meetings with major shareholders to listen to their 
views, in order to assist the process of the company having a balanced 
understanding of their issues and concerns.
Conflicts of interest
Since 1 October 2008, directors have been under a statutory duty to 
avoid any situation in which they have, or can have, a direct or indirect 
interest which conflicts or possibly may conflict with the interests of the 
company. The duty is not infringed where a conflict situation has been 
authorised in advance by the unconflicted directors or the shareholders 
of the company or where the situation cannot reasonably be regarded 
as likely to give rise to a conflict of interest. For a public company, the 
unconflicted directors can only authorise conflict situations if permitted 
to do so by the company’s articles of association. The company’s 
articles of association contain provisions which permit the unconflicted 
directors to authorise conflict situations and procedures have been 
put in place for the disclosure of any conflicts by the directors to the 
board and for the consideration and, if appropriate, authorisation of 
such conflicts. The procedures permit any authorisation to be subject to 
any terms and/or conditions that the unconflicted directors think fit. In 
October 2009, each board member (together with the directors of the 
principal operating subsidiary) completed, as part of the annual review 
process, a comprehensive questionnaire to establish if any director 
had a conflict of interest under the Companies Act 2006. The results 
were then assessed by the chairman and the board, which concluded 
that no director had a conflict that required authorisation. Moving 
forward, directors will continue to be required to notify the chairman 
and/or company secretary if they believe that a conflict might arise. 
This would then be referred to the board. Any potential issue of 
conflict relating to prospective directors would be addressed by the 
nomination committee, with a recommendation to the board.
The nomination committee and appointments to the board
The nomination committee meets at least once each year and 
otherwise as required. Its primary role is to make recommendations to 
the board on the composition, balance and membership of the board 
and refreshment of the board’s principal committees. The nomination 
committee’s terms of reference are available to shareholders on 
request and are also available on the company’s website.
The nomination committee evaluates the balance of skills, knowledge 
and experience on the board and, in the light of such evaluation, 
prepares descriptions of the roles and capabilities required for a 
particular appointment and makes recommendations to the board 
from time to time on its composition. It may use executive search 
consultants to assist it when considering board member succession. 
The committee is chaired by the chairman of the company (except when 
succession issues surrounding that position are being considered). Its 
other members are the non-executive directors and the chief executive. 
As such, the substantial majority of the members are non-executive 
directors determined by the board to be independent in accordance 
with the code.
During the financial year ended 31 March 2010, amongst other 
matters, the nomination committee met three times to consider the 
appointment of Tim Weller’s successor to the role of chief financial 
officer, the composition of the principal board committees and 
the succession planning arrangements for the senior executive 
management population and non-executive directors. Egon Zehnder, 
an executive search consultant, was appointed to assist the committee 
in its search to fill the vacancy of chief financial officer created by Tim 
Weller’s departure.
The letters of appointment of the non-executive directors (which 
comply with the code) are made available for inspection at the 
company’s registered office during business hours and before the 
annual general meeting and are published on the company’s website. 
They make it clear that no compensation is payable for loss of office 
and expressly set out the time commitment expected from non-
executive directors. Non-executive directors are required to disclose 
to the company any significant commitments that might impede the

performance of their duties to the company prior to appointment and 
to consult the chairman before accepting any positions that might 
impact upon their availability to perform their duties or give rise to a 
potential conflict of interest.
Details of the executive directors’ service contracts and the basis of 
their appointments are set out in the directors’ remuneration report.
Reappointment of directors
The board appoints all new directors, after assessing the 
recommendation of the nomination committee and following an 
appropriate recruitment process. Following initial appointment, a 
new director is required to retire and seek appointment at the next 
annual general meeting. The company’s articles of association require 
all directors to retire and seek reappointment at least every three 
years, and include additional provisions which require one-third of the 
directors to retire at each annual general meeting (including those 
who are proposed for reappointment at an annual general meeting 
and those who are not). Biographical details of directors being 
submitted for appointment or reappointment are set out in the notes 
accompanying the relevant notice of meeting.
Non-executive directors are appointed for specified terms, subject 
to reappointment under the company’s articles of association and to 
Companies Act provisions relating to the removal of directors. The 
board explains to shareholders, in the explanatory notes accompanying 
the resolutions, why it believes that the relevant directors should 
be reappointed. Charlie Cornish, Catherine Bell and Nick Salmon are 
retiring and offering themselves for reappointment at the annual 
general meeting in July. The chairman will confirm to shareholders when 
proposing reappointment, following formal performance evaluation, the 
unanimous support by the board for their reappointment. In particular, 
the board considers that each of Charlie Cornish, Catherine Bell and Nick 
Salmon continue to be effective in their respective executive and non-
executive roles and that they demonstrate the necessary commitment to 
their roles, along with their active participation in board and committee 
meetings coupled with the individual knowledge and experience 
that they bring to the company from their respective regulatory and 
commercial backgrounds. Any term beyond six years for a non-executive 
director will be subject to particularly rigorous review, and will take into 
account the need for progressive refreshing of the board. Any non-
executive director serving for longer than nine years will be subject to 
annual reappointment.
Information, support and advice
The chairman is responsible for ensuring that directors receive 
comprehensive information on a regular basis to enable them to 
perform their duties properly, supported by the company secretary. 
Board papers are generally distributed five days in advance of 
scheduled board meetings to enable directors to obtain a thorough 
understanding of the matters to be discussed, and seek clarification, 
if required. As part of the preparation process for board meetings, the 
chairman has implemented a programme of informal briefings with the 
non-executive directors and chief executive the evening before the 
scheduled board meetings.
All directors have access to the advice and services of the company 
secretary and his team, who are responsible to the board for ensuring 
that board procedures are complied with. The appointment and 
removal of the company secretary are matters reserved to the board.
The board has adopted a protocol under which directors have access, 
through the company secretary, to independent professional advice 
at the company’s expense where they judge it necessary to discharge 
their responsibilities as directors. The company also maintains an 
appropriate level of directors’ and officers’ insurance.
Induction and training
New directors receive appropriate induction on joining the board, 
typically including meeting with members of the senior management 
team and visits to operational sites. Directors are provided with 
details of seminars and training courses relevant to their role and are 
encouraged to attend those that meet their development needs. During 
2009/10 guidance was provided to the whole board on topics such as 
the Walker Report and the Financial Reporting Council consultation 
associated with proposed changes to the code. Given the complex 
nature of the regulated environment in which the company’s water 
and wastewater businesses operate, the board receives regular 
presentations on regulation changes and the impact on the business. 
Major shareholders are also invited to meet with new non-executive 
directors and shareholders will have the opportunity to meet directors 
at the annual general meeting in July.
Performance evaluation
During the year, the board conducted an evaluation of its own 
performance and that of its committees and individual directors. The 
process involved the completion by each director of a confidential 
questionnaire in a form consistent with previous years and which was 
modelled on the ‘Chairman’s Guide to the Board Performance Review’ 
published by the Chairman’s Forum. Each director was required to 
score the board’s performance (and that of the principal committees) 
on approximately 40 topics, including: contribution to strategy; risk 
management; financial and operational reporting; matters reserved for 
the board; communication; company and board advisers; relations with 
the group’s regulators and investors; and board procedures. 
The company secretary analysed the completed questionnaires and 
summarised the findings in a report for the chairman, which highlighted 
and prioritised the key areas of feedback and provided a comparison 
with the previous year’s evaluation. The chairman subsequently 
conducted one-to-one discussions with each of the board members 
based upon the summary report about the board’s performance and 
their own as directors, after which he reported back to the whole 
board on the evaluation process. The responses to the questionnaires 
demonstrated a high degree of consistency and the evaluation 
process affirmed the board’s confidence in the group’s system of 
17680UNITEDUT FRONT.indd   35 17680UNITEDUT FRONT.indd   35 28/05/2010   13:13 28/05/2010   13:13 17680 12/05/2010 Proof 9

Corporate governance continued
corporate governance. Arising from the 2009/10 exercise, the board 
has concluded that an enhanced focus should be placed on succession 
planning for board members and key personnel. The members of the 
audit, nomination and remuneration committees, together with the 
managers and advisers who attend those committees, completed 
separate confidential questionnaires upon the effectiveness of the 
principal committees. Similarly, the chairs of those committees 
undertake evaluation based upon the feedback that is received. 
As part of good governance, the chairman holds meetings with the non-
executive directors without the executive directors present. In turn, led 
by the senior independent director, the non-executive directors meet 
without the chairman present at least annually to appraise the chairman’s 
performance. The chief executive officer conducts annual appraisals with 
executive directors and the other members of his senior management 
team and has one-to-one discussions about their performance with them, 
as does the chairman with the chief executive officer.
Internal controls
The board has overall responsibility for the company’s system of risk 
management and internal controls and for reviewing its effectiveness. 
The schedule of written matters reserved to the board ensures that the 
directors are responsible for the control of, amongst other matters, all 
significant strategic, financial and organisational risks.
An overview of some of the principal risks surrounding the company 
is contained in the business review section on pages 19 to 24. 
To manage these and other commercial and operational risks the 
company has an established risk management programme that 
assists management in identifying, assessing and mitigating business, 
financial, operational and compliance risks on a continual basis. The 
board views management of risk as integral to good business practice. 
The programme is designed to support management’s decision-making, 
improve the reliability of business performance, and assist in the 
preparation of the company’s consolidated accounts. The board is 
supported by the dedicated team of internal risk specialists who report 
to the director of health, safety, risk and security, who in turn reports 
directly to the audit committee and the chief executive officer.
The board delegates to executive management the responsibility 
for designing, operating and monitoring both the system and the 
maintenance of effective internal control in each of the group’s 
businesses. The system of internal control is based upon an ongoing 
process of identifying, evaluating and managing key risks and includes 
the risk management processes referred to above. The system of 
internal control was in place throughout the year and up to the date 
of approval of the Annual Report and Financial Statements. The 
effectiveness of this system has been reviewed regularly throughout 
the year, and up to the date of the approval of the Annual Report 
and Financial Statements, by the company’s management teams. 
The system of internal control was periodically reviewed by the 
audit committee and the board and it accords with the guidance in 
the Turnbull Report and the Internal Control Revised Guidance for 
Directors published by the Financial Reporting Council in October 
2005. The system is also refined, as necessary, in response to 
changes in the company’s business and the associated risks. Joint 
venture arrangements with other companies and participations via 
shareholdings in other businesses are outside the group’s own formal 
control procedures. However, the group’s exposure to them is assessed 
by line management (in most cases through representation on the 
boards of those statutory entities).
Control systems
The main components of the group’s internal control framework are 
summarised below. Their foundation is in the considerable value that 
the group places, throughout its activities, on seeking to ensure that 
employees are of the highest quality and integrity. Formal control 
is exercised through a management structure which includes clear 
lines of responsibility and documented delegations of authority from 
the board. The systems of internal control include a series of group 
policies, operating and procedural manuals and processes, with which 
all relevant employees are expected to comply. Processes underpinning 
the financial reporting systems are managed and monitored by line 
and functional management through regular reporting. Separately, 
the effectiveness of these internal controls is reviewed by an internal 
audit function, which reports its results to the company’s senior 
management teams and directly to the audit committee. The work of 
the internal auditors is focused on the areas of perceived greatest risk 
to the company as determined by internal risk assessments, senior 
management and the audit committee.
Function of controls
The system of internal control (the control system) is designed to 
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives. It can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material errors, losses, fraud or breaches of laws and 
regulations. The key features of the control system include:
● a control environment with clearly defined organisation structures, 
operating within a framework of policies and procedures, covering 
every aspect of the business;
● comprehensive business planning, risk assessment and financial 
reporting procedures, including the annual preparation of detailed 
operational budgets for the following year and projections for 
subsequent years;
● established procedures, set out in an internal control manual, for 
planning, approving and monitoring major capital expenditure, 
major projects and the development of new business which includes 
short and long-term budgets, risk evaluation, detailed appraisal and 
review procedures, defined authority levels and post-investment 
performance reviews;
● a monthly board review of financial and non-financial performance to 
assess progress towards objectives;

● monthly meetings, prior to each board meeting, of the senior 
management teams, where the executive directors, and other senior 
executives responsible for running the group’s businesses, amongst 
other matters, review performance and explore strategic and 
operational issues which are of group-wide importance;
● centralised treasury operations operating within defined limits and 
subject to regular reporting requirements and internal audit reviews;
● an internal audit function which provides independent scrutiny of 
internal control systems and risk management procedures;
● regular monitoring of risks and control systems throughout the year 
by the operating businesses, supported by the use of risks and issues 
databases;
● a monthly rolling review of group-wide risks and mitigating actions 
and controls by the senior management teams. Arising from such 
reviews, plans are developed to enhance internal control and risk 
management;
● a self-certification process whereby the operating businesses are 
required to confirm annually that the system of internal control is 
operating effectively;
● an annual risk assessment exercise involving self-assessment by 
management of all major business risks in terms of impact, likelihood 
and control strength;
● health and safety performance reviews carried out by in-house 
health and safety professionals in addition to the normal health 
and safety risk assessment and management processes carried out 
within each of the operating businesses; and 
● data consolidated into the group’s financial statements is reconciled 
to the underlying financial systems. A review of the consolidated 
data is undertaken by management to ensure that the true position 
and results of the group are reflected, through compliance with 
approved accounting policies and the appropriate accounting for 
non-routine transactions.
Annual review of risk management and internal control systems
In addition to the regular reports received by the audit committee and 
the board on internal controls, key risks and periodic reviews, the board 
conducts an analysis of the company’s risk appetite and tolerance 
profile to assess whether it is appropriate and an annual review of the 
effectiveness of the risk management and internal control systems 
in operation during the year and up to the date of the approval of the 
Annual Report and Financial Statements. Through operational reports 
from management, the board reviews controls designed to mitigate 
risks. The board, through the audit committee, also assesses the review 
that is conducted by internal audit. Management of all the business 
divisions of the group are required to complete and sign off control 
self-assessment questionnaires that confirm that the key internal 
controls are in place and are operating effectively. Where weaknesses 
have been identified, plans and timetables for putting them right 
are also reported. Internal audit monitors and selectively checks the 
results of this exercise, ensuring that the representations made are 
consistent with the results of the internal audit function’s work during 
the year. The results of this exercise are summarised for the audit 
committee and the board. 
In the event that any significant control failings occurred or losses 
were incurred during any year as a result of the failure of internal 
controls, an analysis would be reported to the audit committee and the 
board. A plan would also be implemented to take the necessary action 
to remedy any significant weaknesses. In the year ended 31 March 
2010, there were no such losses and the board was satisfied with:
● the changes since the last annual assessment in the nature and 
extent of significant risks identified by management;
● the company’s ability to respond to changes in its business and the 
external environment to the extent that such changes are events 
that management can materially influence;
● the scope and quality of management’s ongoing monitoring of risks 
and of the system of internal control, and where applicable, the work 
of its internal audit function and other providers of assurance;
● the extent and frequency of communication of the results of the 
monitoring to the board (or board committee(s)) which enables it 
to build up a cumulative assessment of the state of controls in the 
company and the effectiveness with which risk is being managed; and
● the company’s external reporting processes.
Financial reporting and going concern
When releasing the annual and half-yearly financial reports and interim 
management statements the directors aim to present a balanced and 
understandable assessment of the group’s position and prospects. 
These statements are posted on the company’s website at the same 
time as they are released to the London Stock Exchange. To encourage 
effective communication, individuals with an email address can 
register free of charge to receive an email alert upon the posting of 
each new release.
The company’s business activities, together with factors (including 
principal risks and uncertainties) likely to affect its future performance 
and financial position, are described in the business review. The 
directors have a reasonable expectation that the company has 
adequate resources available to it to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future and have therefore continued to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. This 
approach, taking into account the relatively stable and regulated 
nature of the business, is based, amongst other matters, upon a review 
of the group’s budget for 2010/11, the group’s proposed five-year 
business plan and investment programme, together with a review of 
the cash and committed borrowing facilities available to the group 
(discussed in further detail in the liquidity section on page 11 and the 
debt financing and interest rate management section on page 10). That 
review gives details of the company’s headroom as at 31 March 2010.
The board also took into account potential contingent liabilities 
and other risk factors as interpreted by the guidance given in ‘Going 
Concern and Financial Reporting: Guidance for Directors of Listed 
Companies registered in the United Kingdom’ , published in November 
1994 and the guidance published in November 2008 ‘An update for 
Directors of Listed Companies: Going Concern and Liquidity Risk’ by 
the Financial Reporting Council.

Report of the audit committee
Paul Heiden, chairman
Members
The audit committee’s members are Paul Heiden 
(chairman), Dr Catherine Bell and David Jones. 
The board is satisfied that Paul Heiden has recent 
and relevant financial experience and that all 
members have extensive commercial experience and are independent 
within the meaning of the code. The qualifications of the members 
of the audit committee are given on pages 26 and 27. Appointments 
to the committee are made by the board, on the recommendation of 
the nomination committee in consultation with the audit committee 
chairman. Appointments are initially for a period of up to three years, 
extendable by no more than two additional three-year periods, so long 
as committee members continue to be deemed to be independent. The 
terms of reference of the audit committee are available to shareholders 
on request and are also available on the company’s website.
Attendees at meetings
The chairman, chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the 
group and other senior management attend committee meetings by 
invitation of the committee. Representatives of the group’s external 
auditors, the head of audit and the director of health, safety, risk and 
security also attend meetings by invitation. During the year ended 
31 March 2010, representatives of the external and internal auditors 
attended all audit committee meetings, had direct access to the 
committee during the meetings and time was also set aside for them 
to have private discussions with the committee, in the absence 
of management.
Audit committee compliance with the code
The audit committee’s terms of reference comply with the code and 
were revised during the year to reflect the guidance published by the 
Financial Reporting Council in October 2008. 
During the year ended 31 March 2010, the formal calendar of matters 
considered by the committee embraced, amongst other matters, the 
code and disclosure and transparency rules requirements to:
● monitor the statutory audit of the annual and consolidated accounts;
● monitor the integrity of the financial statements of the company, 
and any formal announcements relating to the company’s financial 
performance, including reviewing significant financial reporting 
judgements and any disclosures contained in them;
● review the company’s internal financial controls and its 
internal control and risk management systems and to make 
recommendations to the board;
● monitor and review the effectiveness of the company’s internal audit 
function;
● make recommendations to the board, for it to put to the 
shareholders for their approval in general meeting, in relation to 
the appointment, reappointment and if necessary removal of the 
external auditors and to approve the remuneration and terms of 
engagement of the external auditors;
● review and monitor the external auditors’ independence and 
objectivity and the effectiveness of the audit process, taking into 
consideration relevant UK professional and regulatory requirements; 
and
● review the company’s policy on the engagement of the external 
auditors to supply non-audit services. In doing so, account is taken 
of relevant ethical guidance regarding the provision of non-audit 
services by the external auditors and pre–approval practices. In 
this context, the committee will report to the board any matters in 
respect of which it considers that action or improvement is needed 
and makes recommendations as to the steps to be taken.
Audit committee activities
An overview of the work undertaken by the audit committee during the 
year ended 31 March 2010 is described within the following sections 
of this report. 
The audit committee met five times during the financial year ended 
31 March 2010. It has a formal policy, endorsed by the board, to 
keep under review the independence and objectivity of the external 
auditors. The audit committee determined that it was satisfied that 
the independence of the external auditors had been maintained, having 
taken into account the external auditors’ written representations and 
the committee’s own enquiries. These were facilitated by a private 
meeting with the external auditors without executive management 
being present. The independence policy sets out certain disclosure 
requirements by the external auditors to the audit committee, 
including restrictions on mutual hiring of personnel, rules for rotation 
of audit partners and procedures for the approval of non-audit services 
provided by the external auditors. The audit committee has monitored 
the application of the policy both during the year ended 31 March 2010 
and up to the date of this report.
The audit committee reviewed the external auditors’ audit scope, plans 
and materiality levels and the resources proposed to execute the plans. 
Having done so, the committee approved the terms of engagement and 
the audit fees. The committee also reviewed the findings of the external 
auditors and their management letters on internal financial controls.
The audit committee also assessed the qualifications, expertise 
and resources and independence of the external auditors and the 
effectiveness of the audit process. Through an embedded regular audit 
effectiveness review, the audit committee has continued to keep the 
performance of the company’s auditors and audit effectiveness under 
review. Mindful of the costs associated with the company’s compliance 
requirements, the audit committee continues to seek the most cost-
effective approach to compliance and external audit generally.

The policy relating to the provision of non-audit services by the 
external auditors specifies the types of work from which the external 
auditors are excluded; for which the external auditors can be engaged 
without referral to the audit committee; and for which a case-by-case 
decision is required. The ratio of non-audit fees to audit fees was 
monitored by the committee throughout the year ended 31 March 
2010. The audit committee is satisfied that this policy in respect of 
the provision of non-audit services was applied during the year ended 
31 March 2010 and up to the date of this report.
Fees
As summarised above, the committee has established policies and 
procedures to pre-approve the engagement of the auditors to provide 
any audit or non-audit services and keep the nature and extent of 
non-audit services under review. All audit and audit related services 
proposed to be provided by Deloitte LLP are pre-approved by the 
audit committee and reviewed annually. The provision of audit related 
services is generally highly correlated with the role of independent 
auditors. Such services include assurance on non-statutory 
information, assurance work carried out in connection with reporting 
to a statutory regulator, analysis and interpretation of accounting 
principles, support for debt issues and similar transactions and other 
services that have a bearing on the group’s financial statements on 
which the external auditors provide their opinion.
Non-audit services are allowed under the procurement of an audit and 
non-audit services policy, where they do not affect the independence 
of the external auditors, but do require the pre-approval of the audit 
committee prior to the engagement. Specific approval may be delegated 
to a designated member of the audit committee, with such approvals 
to be reported at the next audit committee meeting. In granting such 
approval, the designated member of the audit committee is required to 
consider the cumulative proportion of fees paid for such work compared 
with the statutory audit fees. In the financial year ended 31 March 2010, 
all such services were approved by the audit committee.
The company also maintains a list of prohibited services that cannot be 
provided by the group’s auditors as they are considered by statute or in 
the group’s opinion to be incompatible with the role of the independent 
auditors.
The fees paid or payable to the auditors in the year ended 31 March 
2010 and the preceding year were as follows:
   2010 2009
Y ear ended 31 March   £m £m
Statutory audit of the financial statements 0.4 0.4
Other fees to the auditors: 
Local statutory audits for subsidiaries  0.4 0.3
Other audit related   – 0.1
Regulatory reporting   0.2 0.4
Due diligence and transaction support  5.5 1.2
   6.5 2.4
Note: 
Included in the above statutory audit fee for the period ended 31 March 2010 is £35,000 in 
relation to the company, (period ended 31 March 2009: £50,000).
The committee is always mindful of the ratio of audit and non-audit 
fees and best practice in deciding any appointments for advisory 
work. For the year ended 31 March 2010, the substantial majority 
of non-audit related fees relate to the services provided by Deloitte 
LLP (‘Deloitte’) in its advisory capacity in relation to the provision 
of due diligence services to the company to support the potential 
disposal of certain non-regulated businesses. In deciding to appoint 
Deloitte to assist with the process, the committee was cognisant of 
the impact that doing so would have on the ratio of audit to non-audit 
fees. Nevertheless, given Deloitte’s knowledge of the complex group 
structure and the inter-company accounting, it concluded on balance 
that it was appropriate to authorise Deloitte’s appointment, as in doing 
so it provided the most effective and efficient way of obtaining the 
advisory services required, thereby promoting shareholders’ interests. 
It therefore recommended Deloitte’s appointment to the board, which 
was unanimously endorsed.
Having undertaken a review of the nature of the particular 
circumstances surrounding Deloitte’s selection to assist with the 
potential disposal of certain non-regulated businesses during 2009/10 
and the amount of non-audit related work, the audit committee has 
satisfied itself that the services undertaken during the financial year 
ended 31 March 2010 did not prejudice the auditors’ independence.
Evaluation of the external auditors
In appropriate circumstances the audit committee is empowered to 
dismiss the external auditors and appoint another suitably qualified 
auditor in its place. The reappointment of the external auditors is 
submitted for annual approval by the shareholders at the annual 
general meeting.

Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010
Corporate governance continued
To assess the effectiveness of the external auditors, the audit 
committee reviewed:
● the auditors’ independence and objectivity;
● fulfilment of the 2009/10 audit plan;
● the robustness and perceptiveness of the auditors in its handling of 
key accounting and audit judgements; and
● the content of the external auditors’ reporting on internal controls.
As part of the decision to recommend the reappointment of Deloitte LLP 
at the forthcoming annual general meeting, the audit committee took into 
account the tenure of the auditors and considered whether there should 
be a tender process for the 2010/11 audit. There are no contractual 
obligations restricting the company’s choice of external auditors.
Having assessed these factors and the significant restructure that the 
company has experienced during the 2009/10 financial year, the audit 
committee recommended to the board that a resolution proposing 
the reappointment of Deloitte LLP as external auditors be put to 
shareholders at the 2010 annual general meeting. 
Other activities
The audit committee met prior to the board meetings at which the 
annual and half-yearly financial reports were approved. The committee 
reviewed significant accounting policies, financial reporting issues and 
judgements and, in conducting this review, considered reports from 
management, the external auditors and internal audit.
At all of its meetings, the committee reviewed and considered reports 
from the head of audit and, at three of its meetings, the director of 
health, safety, risk and security. Those reports included the status of 
the company’s risk management systems, findings from the internal 
audit function concerning internal controls and reports on the status of 
the correction of any weaknesses in internal controls identified by the 
internal or external auditors.
The audit committee also reviewed and approved the remit, 
organisation, plans and resources of the company’s internal audit 
function and carried out a review of the effectiveness of that function.
Disclosure policy
The committee’s objective is to ensure that arrangements are in place 
for the proportionate and independent investigation of matters raised 
in confidence and for appropriate follow-up action. Accordingly, the 
audit committee reviews, at least annually, the arrangements by 
which employees may, in confidence, raise concerns about possible 
improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other matters. 
Historically, a confidential voicemail box was provided for employees 
to report any concerns anonymously. During 2009/10, the disclosure 
arrangements were enhanced with the appointment of an independent 
service provider, whom employees can contact at any time.
Significant holdings of securities
Information can be found in the directors’ report at page 29.
Communication with shareholders
The company produces an electronic report for shareholders and 
other interested parties, which provides information on its key 
social and environmental impacts and performance during the year. 
Together with the annual and the half-yearly financial reports, and 
interim management statements, these form the principal means of 
communications with shareholders. A substantial amount of company 
information is available via its website: unitedutilities.com.
A programme of regular investor meetings and presentations takes 
place throughout the year, both in the UK and overseas. During the 
year, the board met or offered to meet with 108 different funds, 
representing 44 per cent of the company’s issued share capital. Such 
briefings, together with regular announcements of significant events 
affecting the group and frequent updates on current trading, are part 
of a dedicated investor relations programme undertaken to keep 
the company’s equity and debt investors informed of developments 
affecting the group. The board regards this programme as an important 
contribution to seek continually to improve investors’ awareness of the 
business and for the board to maintain an understanding of investors’ 
priorities. Board members also receive regular updates in their board 
papers about investor relations and reports from sector analysts. 
Additionally, the board commissions Makinson Cowell to produce an 
annual survey of shareholders, the results of which are reviewed by the 
board. Non-executive directors also have the opportunity to attend 
meetings with major shareholders at either party’s request.

Constructive use of the annual general meeting
The notice calling the annual general meeting and related papers are sent 
to shareholders at least 20 working days before the meeting. All directors 
normally attend annual general meetings, where presentations are made 
on the progress and performance of the business prior to the formal 
business of the meeting.
Additionally, the board encourages shareholders to participate in meetings 
through question and answer sessions with individual directors or, where 
appropriate, the chairman of the relevant committee. To that end, the 
chairmen of the audit, nomination and remuneration committees will always 
endeavour to answer questions relevant to the work of those committees.
Voting on all resolutions takes place by means of a poll which ensures that 
all shareholders’ votes are taken into account, whether lodged in person 
at the meeting, or by proxy. The poll vote is scrutinised by the company’s 
share registrars and the results are released to the London Stock 
Exchange and posted on the company’s website on the next business day. 
Separate resolutions are proposed on each substantially separate issue. 
For each resolution, proxy appointment forms provide shareholders with 
the option to direct their proxy to vote either for or against the resolution 
or to withhold their vote. The proxy form and any announcement of the 
results of a vote will make it clear that a ‘vote withheld’ is not a vote in law 
and will not be counted in the calculation of the proportion of votes for 
and against the resolution.
Takeover directive
Information on the impact on the company as required by the Takeover 
Directive is given in the directors’ report (see page 29) and forms part of 
this corporate governance statement.
The corporate governance statement and report of the audit committee 
were approved by the board on 20 May 2010.

Directors’ remuneration report
The remuneration committee 
David Jones, chairman
I am pleased to provide the directors’ 
remuneration report for the year ended 31 March 
2010, which sets out the information required 
by the Companies Act 2006, Schedule 8 of the 
Large and Medium sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 and the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Services Authority. This report is unaudited except where 
stated. An ordinary resolution to approve this report will be put to the 
annual general meeting on 23 July 2010.
Approach to reward
The company’s remuneration arrangements are designed so that the 
overall level of remuneration including salary, benefits, short and 
long-term incentive opportunities are competitive in comparison to 
other companies that the company may need to recruit from, provide 
an effective retention mechanism and have an appropriate balance 
between fixed and variable reward. Annual and long-term incentive 
remuneration arrangements are designed in a way that reflects a 
balance of measures including financial performance, operational 
performance, customer service, employee engagement and corporate 
responsibility. Executives are incentivised to achieve stretching results 
which are delivered with an acceptable level of risk. Executives are also 
encouraged to accumulate personal holdings in United Utilities Group 
shares, thereby ensuring that their interests are fully aligned with 
shareholders.
Aggregate remuneration 
During the financial year, the aggregate remuneration paid to all 
directors was £4.240 million (2009: £3.230 million). This includes 
salaries, benefits in kind (excluding pensions), annual bonuses earned 
and accrued in the year ended 31 March 2010 but paid after the year 
end and the value of long-term incentives paid in the period ended 
31 March 2010. 
The remuneration committee 
The remuneration committee makes recommendations to the board on 
the company’s framework of executive remuneration and its aggregate 
cost to the company. It approves, on the board’s behalf, the general 
recruitment terms, remuneration, benefits, employment conditions 
and severance terms for senior executive management. In particular, 
it determines the specific recruitment terms, remuneration, benefits, 
employment conditions, pension rights, compensation payments and 
severance terms for the executive board directors and the most senior 
executives in the company. 
The committee’s members are comprised solely of independent non-
executive directors. During 2009/10 the members of the committee 
were David Jones, Andrew Pinder and Nick Salmon. The committee’s 
members have no personal financial interest in the company, other than 
as shareholders and the fees paid to them as non-executive directors. 
The committee’s terms of reference are available to shareholders on 
request from the company secretary and are on the company’s website: 
unitedutilities.com.
The committee has appointed the independent consultants Hewitt 
New Bridge Street to advise it on executive remuneration. They also 
advise the company on the remuneration of a limited number of senior 
executive managers whose specific terms of employment do not fall 
within the remit of the remuneration committee. This is to ensure 
consistency in the application of the board’s policies on executive 
remuneration and the general terms of employment approved by the 
remuneration committee. Mercer Limited is the appointed adviser to 
the committee on pensions matters. Mercer Limited is also the actuary 
to one of the company’s pension schemes (United Utilities Pension 
Scheme) and advises the company on matters relating to its operation. 
Eversheds LLP has been appointed to provide legal advice on the 
operation of the company’s share incentive and share option plans and 
also provides general legal advice to the company. 
Remuneration committee meetings are also attended by the chairman 
of the company (Dr John McAdam), the chief executive officer 
(Philip Green), the human resources director (Alison Clarke) and the 
reward director (Brendan Fahey to 31 March 2010 and Sean Duxbury 
from 1 April 2010) who are consulted on proposals relating to the 
remuneration of the senior executive directors and senior executives 
(other than in respect of their own remuneration). The committee can 
and does seek advice or information directly from other employees 
where the committee feels that such additional contributions will 
assist the committee in its decision-making. The company secretary 
(Tom Keevil) acts as secretary to the committee which met five times in 
the year ended 31 March 2010. 
Policy statement on executive directors’ remuneration
The board’s policy for executive directors’ and senior executives’ 
remuneration for this year and subsequent years is to:
● pay a basic salary which compares with other companies of 
comparable size and complexity; 
● use short and long-term incentives to encourage executives to 
outperform key targets, thereby linking their rewards to the long-
term interests of shareholders and other stakeholders; 
● encourage executives to hold shares in the company; and 
● reward executives fairly and responsibly for their contribution to 
the company’s short and long-term performance and avoid paying 
more than is appropriate.
In deciding the executive directors’ total remuneration package and 
the individual elements of it, the remuneration committee considers 
both the performance of the individual and the company, as well as 
the range of pay in similar companies. The company aims to pay within 
a range of the mid-market rate over time but may pay higher salaries 
and total remuneration for outperforming individuals (or to attract or 
retain executives of the right calibre) and where the company itself 
outperforms. Account is also taken of a range of other factors, including 
the general increases in base salaries taking place within the company.

Directors’ remuneration report
Fixed rewards include basic salary, a car allowance or company car and 
fuel for private mileage, life, medical and permanent health insurance 
and pension benefits. Variable rewards take the form of an annual bonus 
where executives are incentivised to receive a proportion of their bonus 
in shares which are matched by a corresponding performance-related 
award from the company (the matching share award plan, or ‘MSAP’) 
and a long-term incentive plan (the performance share plan, or ‘PSP’). 
The rewards are designed to establish a clear link between pay and 
performance by encouraging outperformance in both the short and long-
term. They are based upon business and individual performance, linking 
executives’ rewards directly to the interests of shareholders and other 
stakeholders. Annual bonus and long-term awards are non-pensionable. 
The committee aims to achieve an appropriate balance between 
fixed and variable rewards. It recognises that the company operates 
in both a regulated and non-regulated environment and therefore 
needs to ensure that the structure of executive remuneration reflects 
the practices of the markets in which its executives operate and 
stakeholder expectations of how the company should be run. The 
committee reviews its policy in the light of emerging best practice. 
The company operates a defined contribution pension scheme which 
newly appointed directors (and senior executives) can join. Further 
details of pension benefits provided for executive directors are 
provided on page 45 of this report.
The committee reviewed the remuneration structure for 2010/11 and 
other than updating the key operational measures for the incentive 
arrangements, has decided not to make any changes for this year.
The chart (above right) sets out the summary of the composition of 
reward and shows that at maximum performance the proportion of an 
executive’s total face value remuneration that is ‘at risk’ is 69 per cent.
Notes:
•  The shading represents the value of each element of the reward package relative to base 
pay (base pay = 100). 
•  Pension refers to the defined contribution benefit provided with a company contribution of 
25 per cent of basic pay. 
•  The maximum values apply only where maximum annual bonus is achieved and the PSP and 
MSAP have paid out fully. 
•  The values for the PSP and MSAP assume a dividend reinvestment value of four per cent a 
year for each of the three years of the performance period and, in the case of the MSAP , that 
a director has invested to the maximum extent allowed with a maximum company match of 
70 per cent of base salary.
Executive directors’ shareholdings
Executive directors are encouraged to build up and retain a target 
shareholding equal to the value of their basic salary, normally within 
five years of appointment. This significant level of commitment further 
aligns the interests of the executives with the long-term interests 
of shareholders. The company prefers a flexible approach to the 
accumulation of a shareholding, which takes account of individual 
circumstances, and has decided not to require executives to retain 
a proportion of shares that vest under its incentive plans. Executive 
shareholdings are reviewed annually and progress towards achieving 
targets is discussed with each executive director.

Base salaries
The remuneration committee reviews salaries each year taking account 
of both company and personal performance and the level of pay in 
similar and, where possible, comparable companies. There were no 
salary increases for executive directors in 2009/10 and the next 
review date will be 1 September 2010. The annual salaries of executive 
directors during the year are shown in the table below.

Annual bonus
The annual bonus plan is designed to motivate and reward executives 
for the achievement of a range of measures that represent a balance 
of stakeholder interests. Performance measures established by the 
committee are designed to be stretching while recognising the nature 
and risk profile of the business. Financial performance represents one-
half of the total maximum opportunity. One-quarter of the maximum 
award for each financial measure is payable for reaching a threshold 
target, half for reaching an intermediate result and the maximum for 
achieving a demanding stretch target. Operational objectives reflect 
targets for that year which are central to enhancing operational 
performance, management of the capital programme, customer 
service, employee engagement, health and safety and corporate social 
responsibility. Personal objectives reflect the individual targets and 
personal performance that an individual achieves during the year based 
upon role-specific key objectives.
The maximum bonus opportunity for 2009/10 was 130 per cent of 
salary and this will be unchanged for 2010/11.
Executives are encouraged to elect to take a significant part of their 
bonus in the form of company shares through the MSAP , thereby 
further aligning their interests with the long-term interests of 
shareholders. Participation in the plan is voluntary and for 2009/10, 
executives who were invited to and applied to join were able to elect 
to receive up to  61 per cent of their bonus award in the form of United 
Utilities shares.
There is a corresponding match from the company whereby the first 
20 per cent of bonus elected to be taken in the form of shares has a 
one-for-one match by the company. The remaining 41 per cent of bonus 
elected to be taken in the form of shares attracts a company match of 
0.81 for 1, thus giving an overall maximum match by the company equal 
to 70 per cent of base salary (assuming the maximum bonus applies).
Future MSAP awards will be made on a basis that encourages 
executives to receive a significant proportion of annual bonus in shares; 
the maximum matching share award will be limited to 
70 per cent of salary and in order to participate fully the executive will 
be required to elect to receive the majority of bonus earned (up to
61 per cent) in shares. The matching shares are released after three 
years subject to the achievement of performance conditions. Details 
of the performance conditions and further information on the terms of 
the matching share awards are described in the section that relates to 
long-term incentives.

The maximum bonus opportunity for 2010/11 remains unchanged. 
Whilst the committee has updated the financial and operational 
performance measures for 2010/11, it has ensured the balance 
between financial, operational and personal performance measures 
is unchanged, as per table 4 below. Additional financial measures 
relating to cashflow and operational cost control have been selected to 
reflect the increased focus on these financial issues. In addition, seven 
operational measures (relating to customer satisfaction, employee 
engagement, capital efficiencies, capital outputs, serviceability, health 
and safety and corporate responsibility) have been selected, these 
being the key performance indicators for United Utilities’ operational 
performance in 2010/11.

Pensions
All executive directors were members of the defined contribution 
section of the company’s pension scheme during the year. The plan is 
operated on a salary sacrifice arrangement whereby a salary reduction 
applies in return for a corresponding increase in company pension 
contributions. The salary reduction rate for Philip Green is equivalent 
to three per cent of basic salary and the rate for Charlie Cornish and 
Tim Weller is seven per cent. The company’s contribution rate prior to 
including the executive’s salary reduction rate is 25 per cent for Charlie 
Cornish and Tim Weller. The contribution rate for Philip Green is 
six per cent of basic salary to the pension scheme and an additional 
19 per cent to his private pension plan. The normal pension age is 65. 
During the year ended 31 March 2010, the company paid contributions 
totalling £412,000 (2009: £401,492) in respect of pension 
contributions for the current executive directors. This represents 
payments for Philip Green totalling £199,500 (2009: £194,292), for 
Charlie Cornish £96,500 (2009: £93,999) and for Tim Weller £116,000 
(2009: £113,201). These figures exclude the contributions relating to 
the individual salary reductions.
Other benefits
Directors are paid a car allowance of £14,000 a year or are entitled 
to have the use of a company car, are reimbursed the cost of fuel 
for business and private use, and are provided with medical, life and 
permanent health insurance. 
Long-term incentives
The company currently operates a PSP and an MSAP to provide long-
term incentives. 
The performance conditions for long-term incentive awards comprise 
two measures: total shareholder return; and key operational 
performance measures. The weighting of each measure in respect of 
each of the two plans and for each year is shown in table 7.
Total shareholder return (TSR): represents share price growth and
reinvested dividends compared with a comparator group of companies. 
Grants made from 2007/08 onwards are based upon a performance 
condition which measures the company’s comparative TSR performance 
against a TSR index (index) rather than a comparator group ranking. 
Using an index allows for a meaningful comparison of performance to 
be made and a smoother sliding scale of vesting of awards. The index 
is constructed by assessing the TSR performance of the companies 
in the index, with its influence on the index being weighted according 
to their relevance and size. When a company is acquired or taken 
over their performance is reflected in the calculation of the index’s 
performance up until the point that a public announcement is made. Any 
new company that joined the index would be treated in a comparable 
pro rata manner.
None of the award would vest if United Utilities’ performance 
fell below the index; 25 per cent of the award would vest for a 
performance equal to the index; and 100 per cent of the award would 
vest for outperforming the index by 12 per cent over the three-year 
performance period. The 12 per cent margin of outperformance 
reflects, over the long-term, the average spread between the median 
and upper quartile TSRs of the constituents of the comparator 
group over a three-year period. This margin was determined based 
upon analysis of historical TSR performance of United Utilities 
and the constituents of the index over preceding three-year rolling 
periods and represents in the committee’s view a demanding level 
of outperformance that is at least as demanding as upper quartile 
performance on the previously used comparator group basis. Vesting 
would be on a sliding scale for performance between these points. Any 
vesting of awards would also be subject to the remuneration committee 
being satisfied that the company’s recorded TSR performance was 
consistent with underlying business performance. 
The composition and weighting of the index for awards made during 
2009/10 is shown in table 5.

National Grid    25%
Northumbrian Water    75%
Pennon Group    75%
Scottish & Southern Energy    25%

The companies and weightings shown above are the same as for 
2007/08 and 2008/09, with the exception that Kelda PLC was a 
constituent of the index with a weighting of 100 per cent until it 
announced that it had received a takeover bid on 22 November 2007.

Operational performance measures: the TSR performance measure is 
complemented by a range of operational performance targets in the 
categories of quality and environment, finance and efficiency, customer 
service and people. These operational performance measures were chosen 
to reflect a balance of targets, achievement of which would demonstrate 
sustained and improving company performance over a three-year period 
in areas that would, if achieved, clearly support an increase in shareholder 
value, as well as being within areas that were clearly within management’s 
accountability. The vesting scale shown for achievement of these 
measures is demanding. Failure to meet one of the targets in any area 
results in only 50 per cent vesting for that particular area. 
i) Performance share plan
Executive directors and members of the executive leadership team 
participate in the performance share plan. Awards are granted at 
the discretion of the plan’s trustee on the recommendation of the 
remuneration committee. Each year, participants may be awarded a 
right to acquire a maximum number of shares worth up to a percentage 
of their annual salary at the date of the award, at no cost to them. The 
number of shares awarded is based upon the market price of a share 
at the date of grant. The plan’s rules provide for a maximum award of 
100 per cent of annual salary, which may be increased above this level 
in circumstances which the committee considers to be exceptional, 
although to date grants have not exceeded 100 per cent of salary. 
Awards during 2009/10 were 70 per cent of salary for executive 
directors and 50 per cent of salary for other members of the executive 
leadership team. The same level of awards is planned for 2010/11. 
The proportion of the award that will vest and become exercisable 
depends upon the company’s performance against specified targets 
over a performance period. This period is not less than three years, 
beginning at the start of the financial year during which the award 
is made. There is no re-testing and awards lapse if the performance 
criteria are not met. Participants normally have three months from the 
date when the award vests to exercise their right to acquire shares. 
There is no automatic waiving of performance conditions if there is a 
change of control, capital reconstruction or winding-up of the company. 
The extent (if any) to which awards will vest and any modifications 
of performance conditions are at the trustee’s discretion, with the 
consent of the remuneration committee. 
When a participant’s employment terminates during a performance 
period and the reason falls within the ‘good leaver’ provisions of the 
plan, the vesting of an award is at the trustee’s discretion. If discretion 
is exercised, the maximum number of shares in an award is pro rated to 
service in the performance period and vesting is subject to satisfying 
the performance conditions (modified, if appropriate). Except in the 
case of the death of a participant, there is normally no early vesting 
of awards. Awards lapse where terminations during the performance 
period do not satisfy the good leaver provisions.

National Grid; Centrica; Scottish & Southern Energy; Pennon; Northumbrian Water; Severn 
Trent, Balfour Beatty; International Power; and BT. The performance condition in respect of 
2006/07 was not met and all awards made lapsed with no value during the year.

during the year include the total number of additional interests granted as a result of notional dividends being reinvested.
All awards are increased by the notional reinvestment of dividends paid over the course of the retention or performance period.
During the period 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2010 the market price of a share ranged from 432 pence to 567 pence.

ii) Matching share award plan
Details of the basis for MSAP awards are provided under the section relating to annual bonus. A proportion of annual bonus received in shares 
results in a corresponding matching award from the company. An executive must retain his shares for the three-year holding period in order to 
receive the matching award and in addition matching shares are only released if performance criteria are met. One-half of each matching share 
award is subject to an index performance condition on the same basis as applies to the PSP and one-half relates to operational performance 
targets on the same basis as the PSP .

United Utilities Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010
Directors’ remuneration report continued
Contracts of service and compensation for termination
The company’s policy is that the executive directors normally have 
one-year notice periods. The company may offer a longer notice period 
if it considers that necessary to recruit a new director. If it offers an 
initial notice period of more than one year, it will reduce that to a rolling 
one-year notice period after the initial period has expired. At 31 March 
2010, all executive directors had one-year notice periods. Service 
contracts are with, and all remuneration and benefits are provided by, 
United Utilities PLC. 
Contracts terminate automatically upon the director reaching age 65 
unless the company agrees that a director may continue to work after 
attaining that age. No special arrangements apply if there is a change 
of control. 
Service contracts do not provide explicitly for termination payments 
(other than for holidays due but not taken), liquidated damages 
or payments in lieu of notice. If a contract is to be terminated, the 
remuneration committee will, in each circumstance, determine 
the compensation that will be paid, normally by reference to fixed 
elements of remuneration and the notice period. There is no automatic 
entitlement to payments under the annual bonus or performance share 
plan. Any annual bonus payment is at the discretion of the company. 
Performance share plan vesting is at the discretion of the trustees 
based upon a recommendation from the remuneration committee and 
an award will not normally vest unless the termination is for a ‘good 
leaver’ reason such as retirement or because of ill health, or there are 
other special circumstances. Payments are then pro rated and subject 
to the performance conditions on which awards were granted (or 
modified, if appropriate) being satisfied.
The committee will apply such mitigation to any contractual obligations 
as it considers is fair and reasonable. It will take into account the best 
practice provisions of the combined code and will take legal advice 
on the company’s liability to pay compensation. The company’s policy 
is to take a robust line on reducing compensation, and it may phase 
payments to reflect a departing employee’s obligation to mitigate loss.
Details of directors’ contracts as at 31 March 2010 are set out in 
table 13.

Non-executive directorships
The company recognises that its executive directors may be invited to 
become non-executive directors of companies outside the company 
and exposure to such non-executive duties can broaden experience 
and knowledge, which will be to the benefit of the company. Subject to 
board approval (which will not be given if the proposed appointment 
is with a competing company, would otherwise lead to a material 
conflict of interest or could have a detrimental effect on a director’s 
performance), executive directors are allowed to accept one non-
executive directorship and to retain the fee. Philip Green was a non-
executive director of Lloyds Banking Group plc until 23 October 2009 
and received £81,440 in fees in the nine months to 23 October 2009. 
Tim Weller is a non-executive director of the Carbon Trust and received 
£21,000 in fees for the year to 31 March 2010.
Performance graph
The performance graph compares the company’s annual TSR 
performance (reflecting B shares issued to shareholders and the share 
consolidation) for the past five years against the FTSE 100 index. This 
index was chosen as it is the most appropriate broad equity market 
index. This comparison also supplements the information on the 
company’s TSR performance relative to the comparator groups in the 
MSAP and PSP .

This graph shows the value, by 31 March 2010, of £100 invested in United Utilities on 
31 March 2005 compared with the value of £100 invested in the FTSE 100 index. The other 
points plotted are the values at intervening financial year ends.
Non-executive directors (including the chairman)
A committee of the board decides the remuneration of all of the 
non-executive directors other than the chairman. Its members are the 
chairman (Dr John McAdam) and the executive directors: Philip Green, 
Charlie Cornish and Tim Weller (until 21 May 2010). The remuneration 
committee (details of which are set out earlier in this report) 
determines the remuneration of the chairman.
The company’s policy is to pay annual fees that reflect the 
responsibilities placed upon the non-executive directors. Fees are 
reviewed each year when account is taken of the level of fees paid in 
companies of similar size and complexity. There are separate annual 
fees for the chairman and the other non-executive directors.

Directors’ remuneration report
Additional fees are paid to the chairmen of the audit and remuneration 
committees and to the senior independent non-executive director. Non-
executive directors do not participate in any annual bonus or incentive 
plans, pension schemes, healthcare arrangements, the company’s long-
term incentive plans or employee share schemes. The company repays 
the reasonable expenses that non-executive directors incur in carrying 
out their duties as directors. 
Non-executive directors’ fees were not increased during 2009/10. The 
base annual fee is £54,000 a year (2009: £54,000). The chairman of 
the audit committee receives an additional annual fee of £12,500. The 
chairman of the remuneration committee and the senior independent 
non-executive director both receive an additional annual fee of 
£10,000. The chairman’s fee was £250,000 and was not increased in 
the year. The next review of non-executive directors’ fees will be in 
September 2010.
Non-executive directors’ remuneration for the year ended 31 March 
2010 is set out in table 14.

Note: 
At the annual general meeting on 25 July 2008 Sir Richard Evans and Norman Broadhurst did

Terms of appointment
Non-executive directors’ appointments are for an initial period of 
three years. They are subject to reappointment at the first annual 
general meeting after their initial appointment and at an annual 
general meeting at least every three years thereafter (if they are to 
be reappointed). After nine years in office, a non-executive director 
is required to seek reappointment each year at the annual general 
meeting. They have letters of appointment, as opposed to contracts of 
service. In the event of early termination, for whatever reason, they are 
not entitled to receive compensation for loss of office. 
The non-executive directors’ letters of appointment can be inspected 
at the company’s registered office and on the company’s website, 
unitedutilities.com. The letters set out the expected time commitment 
and non-executives agree to devote sufficient time to meet what is 
expected of them. Table 15 summarises the terms of appointment for 
each non-executive director.
Note that the terms of appointment for all non-executive directors are 
based on nil compensation for early termination and a nil notice period 
requirement.

Employee share schemes
The board believes that share ownership is an effective way of 
strengthening employees’ involvement in the development of the business 
and bringing together their interests and those of shareholders. It offers 
employees the opportunity to build up a shareholding in the company. 
The main all-employee scheme is the HM Revenue & Customs approved 
share incentive plan, ‘ShareBuy’ . This is a flexible way for employees to 
acquire shares in the company by buying ‘partnership’ shares up to the 
lower of £1,500 or 10 per cent of taxable pay each year. The funds are 
deducted from pre-tax pay and passed to an independent trustee who 
makes a monthly purchase of shares at full market price. Employees can 
reinvest the dividends on partnership shares to buy more shares under 
the plan. The company gives one free share for every five partnership 
shares bought, which need to be held in trust for a five-year term in 
order to retain the maximum tax advantages. 
A limited number of senior managers participate in a deferred share 
award scheme to facilitate the award of annual performance awards in 
the form of shares. Shares awarded are released after a waiting period 
of three years from the date the award is determined, provided that 
the individual remains employed within the company with no additional 
performance conditions. Shares are forfeited in the event that an 
individual voluntarily leaves the company during the waiting period. 
Newly issued or treasury shares may not be used to satisfy awards 
under this plan. According to the rules of the plan, executive directors 
are not eligible to participate in this scheme.

Directors’ remuneration report/Statement of directors’ responsibilities
Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for 
each financial year. Under that law the directors are required to prepare 
the group financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union (EU) and 
Article 4 of the International Accounting Standard (IAS) Regulation and 
have also chosen to prepare the parent company financial statements 
under IFRSs as adopted by the EU. Under company law the directors 
must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the 
profit or loss of the company for that period. In preparing these financial 
statements, IAS 1 requires that directors:
● Properly select and apply accounting policies;
● Present information, including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; 
● Provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on 
the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and
● Make an assessment of the company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of 
the company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
● the financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of the company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
● the management report, which is incorporated into the directors’ 
report, includes a fair review of the development and performance of 
the business and the position of the company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Independent auditors’ report to the members
of United Utilities Group PLC
We have audited the financial statements of United Utilities
Group PLC for the year ended 31 March 2010 which comprise the 
consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income, the consolidated and company statements 
of financial position, the consolidated and company statements 
of changes in equity, the consolidated and company statements of 
cashflows, the accounting policies and the related notes 1 to 32. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and as regards 
the parent company financial statements, as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the company and the company’s members, as a body, for our 
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, 
the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of 
significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall
presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
● the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the
group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 March 2010 and 
of the group’s profit for the year then ended;
● the group financial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
● the parent company financial statements have been properly
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006; and
● the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
● the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; 
and
● the information given in the directors’ report for the financial year
for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with 
the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in 
our opinion:
● adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
● the parent company financial statements and the part of the
directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
● certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are
not made; or
● we have not received all the information and explanations we require
for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
● the directors’ statement contained within the corporate governance
report in relation to going concern; and
● the part of the corporate governance statement relating to the
company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the June 2008 
Combined Code specified for our review.

United Utilities Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010
Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these 
financial statements are set out below.
a) Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union (EU), including International Accounting Standards 
(IAS) and Interpretations issued by the International Financial 
Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC).
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost 
basis, except for the revaluation of financial instruments.
The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles (GAAP) under IFRS, requires 
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the 
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
and the amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods
presented. Although these estimates are based upon management’s
best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results
ultimately may differ from these estimates.
The adoption of the following standards and interpretations, at 1 April 
2009, has had no material impact on the group’s financial statements:
IFRIC 12  ‘Service Concession Arrangements’
The interpretation addresses accounting by private sector operators 
involved in the provision of public sector infrastructure assets and 
services. Relevant assets within its scope have been reclassified from 
property, plant and equipment to financial assets (where the operator 
has an unconditional right to receive a specified amount of cash or 
other financial asset over the life of the arrangement); or intangible
assets (where the operator’s future cashflows are not specified); 
or a combination of both (where the operator’s return is provided 
partially by a financial asset and partially by an intangible asset). Its 
application is retrospective and hence requires the restatement of the 
comparative information presented for the years ended 31 March 2009 
and 31 March 2008. Operating profit for the year ended 31 March 2009 
has been reduced by £5.7 million, broadly offset by a corresponding 
increase in investment income of £5.2 million (see note 32).
IAS 23 (Revised 2007) ‘Borrowing Costs’
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction 
or production of a qualifying asset have been capitalised as part of 
the cost of that asset. Qualifying assets include property, plant and 
equipment, inventories and intangible assets developed in projects
that take a significant period of time to complete. The standard has 
been adopted as a prospective change and borrowing costs have been 
capitalised on projects commencing from 1 April 2009. No changes 
have been made for borrowing costs incurred prior to this date that 
have been expensed. During the year ended 31 March 2010, borrowing 
costs of £0.5 million have been capitalised. 
IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements (September 2007)’
The application of this standard has resulted in the balance sheet and
cashflow statements being renamed the ‘statement of financial position’
and the ‘statement of cashflows’ respectively. The shareholders’ equity
note is presented as a primary statement and is renamed the ‘statement
of changes in equity’.The statement of recognised income and expense is
also presented as a primary statement and is renamed the ‘consolidated
statement of comprehensive income’.Taxation on each item within the
consolidated statement of comprehensive income is shown separately.
‘Improvements to IFRSs (2008)’
The amendments to IAS 1 clarify the classification of derivative
financial instruments as current or non-current. Previously the group
has categorised as current all derivative financial instruments classified
as ‘held for trading’ under IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition
and Measurement’ . As a result of these amendments, ‘held for trading’
derivatives have now been categorised between current and non-current,
based upon the contractual maturity date or, where applicable, the
contractual early termination date (see note 32).
IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payments (June 2009)’
The amendment to IFRS 2 is effective for periods commencing on or 
after 1 January 2010, was endorsed by the EU on 23 March 2010, and 
has been adopted early in these financial statements. 
IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure – amendments’
The amendments to the standard require additional disclosures in 
respect of the financial instruments measured at fair value, based upon 
the nature of the inputs used in making such measurements (see note 
19). The amendment to the standard does not require comparatives in 
the first year of adoption.
IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’
The application of this standard requires disclosure of information 
about the group’s operating segments on the same basis as that used 
for internal reporting, and replaces the requirement to determine the 
primary (business) and secondary (geographical) reporting segments. 
The group determined that its operating segments were the same as 
the business segments previously identified under IAS 14 ‘Segment 
Reporting’ , except that the ‘other activities’ segment has been renamed
‘all other segments’ . Additional disclosures about each of these 
segments are provided in note 2.
As a result of the adoption of these standards, the group has presented 
a restated statement of financial position for each of the years ended 
31 March 2009 and 31 March 2008, together with notes for the 
relevant restated comparatives.
The consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 March 2009 
has been re-presented to better reflect the nature of restructuring and 
reorganisation costs.
New statutory holding company
The company was incorporated and registered in England and Wales
on 8 April 2008 under the Companies Act 1985 as a private company 
limited by shares with the name United Utilities Newco Limited and
registered number 6559020. The company changed its name and

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Financial Statements
Accounting policies
re-registered as a public company on 28 April 2008 under the name 
United Utilities Group PLC. On 28 July 2008, the new statutory holding 
company structure became effective by way of a share exchange
between the shareholders of United Utilities PLC (the previous holding 
company) and United Utilities Group PLC (the new holding company).
This was accounted for as a reverse acquisition in the consolidated
financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2009. The legal 
subsidiary, United Utilities PLC, was treated as the acquirer and the 
legal parent company, United Utilities Group PLC, was treated as the 
subsidiary. The transaction was, in substance, an acquisition of the 
assets of United Utilities Group PLC by United Utilities PLC.
As a consequence of applying reverse acquisition accounting, the
consolidated results of United Utilities Group PLC (‘the group’) for the 
year ended 31 March 2009 comprised the results of United Utilities
PLC for the year ended 31 March 2009 consolidated with those of 
United Utilities Group PLC from 28 July 2008. At 31 March 2008 for 
the statement of financial position, the comparative figures for the 
group are those of the group headed by United Utilities PLC.
Going concern
The directors have set out factors considered on concluding the 
appropriateness of the going concern basis of presentation in the 
financial reporting and going concern section of the corporate 
governance report.
Operating profit
Operating profit is stated after charging operating expenses but before 
investment income and finance expense.
b) Basis of consolidation
The group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of 
the company and entities controlled by the company (its subsidiaries), 
made up to 31 March each year, and incorporate the results of its share 
of jointly controlled entities using proportionate consolidation.
The results of subsidiaries and joint ventures acquired or disposed of 
during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from 
the date control is obtained or until the date that control ceases, as 
appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of 
subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used under the relevant 
local GAAP into line with those used by the group.
Subsidiaries
Control is achieved where the company has the power to govern
the financial and operating policies, generally accompanied by a 
shareholding of more than one-half of the voting rights of an investee 
entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In the parent company accounts, investments are held at cost less 
provision for impairment.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities 
of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of 
acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values
of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. 
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the 
identifiable net assets acquired is credited to the income statement in 
the period of acquisition. All intra-group transactions, balances, income 
and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Associates
An associate is an entity over which the group, either directly
or indirectly, is in a position to exercise significant influence by
participating in, but not controlling, the financial and operating policies of
the entity. Associates are accounted for using the equity method. Losses
of an associate in excess of the group’s interest in the associate are not
recognised, except to the extent that the group has incurred obligations
in respect of the associate. Unrealised profits and losses recognised by
the group on transactions with an associate are eliminated to the extent
of the group’s interest in the associate concerned.
Joint ventures
Joint ventures are entities in which the group holds an interest on a
long-term basis and which are jointly controlled with one or more parties
under a contractual arrangement. The group’s share of joint venture
income, expenses, assets, liabilities and cashflows are included in the
consolidated financial statements on a proportionate consolidation basis
using the same accounting methods as adopted for subsidiaries.
c) Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets (and disposal groups comprising assets held 
for sale and the associated liabilities) classified as held for sale are 
measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs
to sell.
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) are classified as held for sale if
their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather
than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when
the sale is highly probable and the asset (or disposal group) is available
for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be
committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition
as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
d) Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation is recognised as an asset. Following
initial recognition, goodwill is subject to impairment reviews, at least
annually, and measured at initial value less accumulated impairment
losses. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income
statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary, or jointly controlled entity, the attributable 
amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the gain or loss 
on disposal.

Accounting policies
continued
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has 
not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent 
profit or loss on disposal.
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets are measured initially at cost and are amortised 
on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The carrying
amount is reduced by any provision for impairment where necessary.
On a business combination, as well as recording separable intangible 
assets already recognised in the statement of financial position of the 
acquired entity at their fair value, identifiable intangible assets that 
arise from contractual or other legal rights are also included in the 
acquisition statement of financial position at fair value.
Internal expenditure is capitalised as internally generated intangibles 
only if it meets the criteria of IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’ .
Amortisation periods for categories of intangible assets are:
● Computer software 3 to 10 years;
● Other intangible assets 2 to 20 years; and
● Service concessions 20 to 30 years (see note r).
e) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment comprises infrastructure assets (water 
mains, sewers, impounding and pumped raw water storage reservoirs,
dams, sludge pipelines and sea outfalls) and other assets (including 
properties and overground plant and equipment).
Water and wastewater infrastructure assets
Infrastructure assets comprise a network of water and wastewater 
systems. Expenditure on the infrastructure assets, including 
borrowing costs where applicable, relating to increases in capacity or 
enhancements of the network is treated as additions. Amounts incurred 
in maintaining the operating capability of the network in accordance 
with defined standards of service are expensed in the year in which 
the expenditure is incurred. Infrastructure assets are depreciated by
writing off their deemed cost, less the estimated residual value, evenly
over their useful lives, which range from 15 to 300 years.
Employee costs incurred in implementing the capital schemes of the
group are capitalised within infrastructure assets.
Other assets
All other property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less 
accumulated depreciation.
Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to 
the acquisition of the items, including relevant borrowing costs, where 
applicable, for qualifying assets. Subsequent costs are included in 
the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as 
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits 
associated with the item will flow to the group and the cost of the item 
can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance costs are 
charged to the income statement during the financial period in which 
they are incurred.
Freehold land and assets in the course of construction are not 
depreciated. Other assets are depreciated by writing off their cost, 
less their estimated residual value, evenly over their estimated useful
lives, based upon management’s judgement and experience, which are 
principally as follows:
● Buildings 10 to 60 years;
● Operational assets 5 to 80 years; and
● Fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment 3 to 40 years.
Depreciation methods, residual values and useful lives are reassessed 
annually and, if necessary, changes are accounted for prospectively.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is 
determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
f) Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
Intangible assets with definite useful lives and property, plant and 
equipment are reviewed for impairment at each reporting date to
determine whether there is any indication that those assets may 
have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the 
recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine
the extent of the impairment loss, if any. Where the asset does not 
generate cashflows that are independent from other assets, the group 
estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which
the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell,
and value in use. Value in use represents the net present value of
expected future cashflows, discounted on a pre-tax basis, using a rate
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money
and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future 
cashflows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash generating unit) is
estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of 
the asset (or cash generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses in respect of non-current assets are recognised in 
the income statement within operating costs.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the reversal is
recognised in the income statement and the carrying amount of the 
asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount,
but not so as to exceed the carrying amount that would have been
determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years.
g) Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised and derecognised
on the group’s statement of financial position on the trade date when the
group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Financial Statements
Accounting policies
Cash and short-term deposits
Cash and short-term deposits include cash at bank and in hand, 
deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments which are 
readily convertible into known amounts of cash, have a maturity of 
three months or less from the date of acquisition and which are subject 
to an insignificant risk of change in value. In the consolidated statement  
of cashflows and related notes, cash and cash equivalents include cash 
and short-term deposits, net of bank overdrafts.
Financial investments
Investments (other than interests in associates, subsidiaries, joint 
ventures and fixed deposits) are initially measured at fair value,
including transaction costs. Investments classified as available for 
sale in accordance with IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition 
and Measurement’ are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair 
value. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised
directly in equity, until the security is disposed of or is determined 
to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously 
recognised in equity is included in the net profit or loss for the period. 
Investments classified as loans and receivables in accordance with 
IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ are
measured at amortised cost.
Service concession financial assets
See note r.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are initially measured at fair value, and are
subsequently measured at amortised cost, less any impairment for
irrecoverable amounts. Estimated irrecoverable amounts are based upon
historical experience of the receivables balance.
Trade payables
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently
measured at amortised cost.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to 
the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the 
assets of the group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the group are recorded at the proceeds 
received, net of direct issue costs.
Borrowings
Bonds, bank loans and overdrafts are usually recorded at the proceeds
received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including premiums 
payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are 
accounted for on an amortised cost basis to the income statement 
using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying 
amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the 
period in which they arise. In some cases, borrowings are designated at 
fair value through profit or loss, or in a fair value hedge.
Financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss
Borrowings are designated at fair value through profit or loss at 
inception where the complexity of the related swaps means that they
are disallowed from being allocated in a hedge relationship despite
there being significant fair value offset between the hedged item and 
the derivative. The otherwise inconsistent accounting treatment that 
would have resulted allows the group to satisfy the criteria for this
designation. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 
are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in 
profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognised incorporates any interest 
paid on the financial liability. The treatment of financial liabilities 
designated at fair value through profit or loss is consistent with the 
group’s documented risk management strategy.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
Interest rate swap agreements are used to manage interest rate 
exposure, while the group enters into cross-currency swaps to manage
its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The group does
not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
All financial derivatives are recognised in the statement of financial 
position at fair value. Changes in the fair value of all derivative financial 
instruments are recognised in the income statement within finance 
expense as they arise, except for derivatives that are designated as,
and effective in terms of, cashflow hedging relationships, in which case 
the gains and losses are deferred in equity.
Fair value hedges
For an effective hedge of an exposure to changes in the fair value, the
hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risk 
being hedged with the corresponding entry in the income statement. 
Gains or losses from remeasuring the derivative are recognised in the 
income statement.
Where changes in the fair value of a derivative differ from changes in 
the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risks being hedged, 
the hedge ineffectiveness is recorded in the income statement within 
finance expense.
Hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when the hedging 
instrument is sold, terminated or exercised, where the hedge
relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting in 
accordance with IAS 39, or where the hedge designation is revoked. The
cumulative fair value adjustment on the hedged instrument is frozen 
at the date of ineffectiveness, or the date the designation is revoked
and is amortised to the income statement based upon a recalculated 
effective interest rate through to maturity.
Cashflow hedges
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are 
designated and effective as hedges of future cashflows are recognised 
directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately 
in the income statement. 
17680UNITEDUT BACK.indd   65 17680UNITEDUT BACK.indd   65 28/05/2010   13:12 28/05/2010   13:12 17680 24/04/2010 Proof 5

Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010
Accounting policies
continued
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument is sold, 
terminated or exercised, where the hedge relationship no longer meets
the criteria for hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39, or where 
the hedge designation is revoked. At that time, any cumulative gain
or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in 
equity until the forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is 
no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised 
in equity is transferred to net profit or loss for the period.
Net investment hedges
Exchange differences arising from the translation of net investments
in foreign operations are recognised directly in equity. Gains and 
losses on those hedging instruments (which include foreign currency 
forward contracts) designated as hedges of net investments in foreign 
operations are recognised in equity to the extent that the hedging 
relationships are effective. These amounts are included in foreign 
exchange adjustments within the statement of comprehensive income.
Gains and losses relating to hedge ineffectiveness are recognised 
immediately in the income statement for the period. Gains and losses 
accumulated in the exchange reserve are included in the income
statement when the foreign operations are disposed of.
h) Foreign currency translation
Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rates
applicable on the dates of the transactions. At each reporting date, 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
translated into sterling at the relevant rates of exchange applicable
on that date. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included 
in net profit or loss for the period. Exchange differences arising on 
investments in equity instruments classified as available for sale are 
included in the gains or losses arising from changes in fair value which 
are recognised directly in equity.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the
group enters into forward contracts, options and other derivative
instruments (see derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting 
in note g).
Group companies
On consolidation, the statements of financial position of overseas
subsidiaries and joint ventures (none of which has the currency of a 
hyperinflationary economy) are translated into sterling at exchange
rates applicable at each reporting date. The income statements are
translated into sterling using the average rate unless exchange rates
fluctuate significantly in which case the exchange rate at the date the
transaction occurred is used. Exchange differences resulting from
the translation of such statements of financial position at rates ruling 
at the beginning and end of the period, together with the differences 
between income statements translated at average rates and rates
ruling at the period end, are dealt with as movements on the group’s
cumulative exchange reserve, a separate component of equity. Such
translation differences are recognised as income or expense in the
period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a 
foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity 
and translated at the closing rate. The group has elected to treat 
goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions before the 
date of implementation of IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ (1 April 
1999) as sterling denominated assets and liabilities.
i) Borrowing costs and finance income
Except as noted below, all borrowing costs and finance income are
recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are 
accrued.
Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or
issue of a financial asset or financial liability are included in the initial 
fair value of that instrument.
Where borrowing costs are attributable to the acquisition, construction 
or production of a qualifying asset, such costs are capitalised as part of 
the specific asset.
j) Long-term contract accounting
Where the outcome of a long-term contract can be estimated reliably, 
revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of
completion of the contract activity at each reporting date, as measured 
by the proportion that contract costs incurred for work performed to
date bear to the estimated total contract costs. Variations in contract
work, claims and incentive payments are included to the extent that
they have been agreed with the customer.
Where the outcome of a long-term contract cannot be estimated 
reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs
incurred that it is probable will be recoverable. Contract costs are
recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract
revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
k) Taxation
The taxation expense represents the sum of current taxation and 
deferred taxation.
Current taxation
Current taxation, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is based 
upon the taxable profit for the period and is provided at amounts 
expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have
been enacted or substantively enacted at each reporting date.
Taxable profit differs from the net profit as reported in the income
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are
taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that
are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable
on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used 
17680UNITEDUT BACK.indd   66 17680UNITEDUT BACK.indd   66 28/05/2010   13:12 28/05/2010   13:12 17680 24/04/2010 Proof 5

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Financial Statements
Accounting policies
in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred taxation liabilities 
are provided, using the liability method, on all taxable temporary 
differences at each reporting date. Such assets and liabilities are not 
recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from 
the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other 
assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable 
profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred taxation liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary 
differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint 
ventures, except where the group is able to control the reversal of the
temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred taxation is measured at the average tax rates that are expected
to apply in the periods in which the temporary timing differences are
expected to reverse based upon tax rates and laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted at each reporting date.
The carrying amount of deferred taxation assets is reviewed at each
reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the 
asset to be recovered.
Deferred taxation is charged or credited in the income statement, 
except when it relates to items charged or credited to equity, in which
case the deferred taxation is also dealt with in equity.
l) Employee benefits
Retirement benefit obligations
The group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes, 
which are independent of the group’s finances, for the majority of 
its employees. Actuarial valuations of the schemes are carried out
as determined by the pension scheme trustees using the projected 
unit credit method at intervals of not more than three years, the 
rates of contribution payable and the pension cost being determined
on the advice of the actuaries, having regard to the results of these 
valuations. In any intervening years, the actuaries review the continuing 
appropriateness of the contribution rates.
Defined benefit assets are measured at fair value while liabilities are 
measured at present value. The difference between the two amounts 
is recognised as a surplus or obligation in the statement of financial 
position.
The cost of providing pension benefits to employees relating to the
current year’s service is included within the income statement within 
employee costs. The difference between the expected return on
scheme assets and interest on scheme liabilities is included within the 
income statement within investment income or finance expense.
All actuarial gains and losses, excluding curtailment gains and losses,
are recognised outside the income statement in retained earnings and 
presented in the statement of comprehensive income.
In addition, the group also operates defined contribution pension 
schemes. Payments are charged as employee costs as they fall due. The
group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have
been paid.
Share-based compensation arrangements
The group operates equity-settled, share-based compensation plans. 
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 ‘Share-based 
Payments’ has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 
7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 April 2004.
The group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain 
employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair
value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date 
is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based upon
estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest. Fair 
value is based upon both simulation and binomial models, according 
to the relevant measures of performance. The group has the option to 
settle some of these equity-settled share-based payments on a net 
basis in cash.
At each reporting date, the group revises its estimate of the number of 
options that are expected to become exercisable with the impact of any
revision being recognised in the income statement, and a corresponding
adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period. The proceeds
received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited 
to share capital (nominal value) and share premium when the options 
are exercised.
m) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an
outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the 
amount can be reliably estimated.
Expenditure that relates to an existing condition caused by past
operations that does not contribute to current or future earnings is
expensed. Liabilities for environmental remediation and decommissioning
costs are recognised, and capitalised in accordance with IAS 37 as
appropriate, when there is a legal or constructive obligation, environmental
assessments indicate that clean-up is probable, and the associated costs
can be reliably estimated.
n) Revenue recognition
Revenue represents the fair value of the income receivable in the
ordinary course of business for goods and services provided. Where
relevant, this includes an estimate of the sales value of units supplied
to customers between the date of the last meter reading and the period
end, exclusive of value added tax and foreign sales tax.
The group recognises revenue generally at the time of delivery and
when collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. 
Should the group consider that the criteria for revenue recognition are
not met for a transaction, revenue recognition would be delayed until
such time as the transaction becomes fully earned or collectability 
17680UNITEDUT BACK.indd   67 17680UNITEDUT BACK.indd   67 28/05/2010   13:12 28/05/2010   13:12 17680 24/04/2010 Proof 5

is reasonably assured. Payments received in advance of revenue
recognition are recorded as deferred income.
o) Grants and contributions
Grants and contributions receivable in respect of property, plant and
equipment are treated as deferred income, which is credited to the 
income statement over the estimated economic lives of the related
assets.
p) Leases
Leases are classified according to the substance of the transaction. A 
lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership
to the lessee is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are 
classified as operating leases.
Operating leases
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
q) Inventories
Inventories are stated at cost less any provision necessary to recognise 
damage and obsolescence. Finished goods and goods for resale are 
stated at the lower of cost (comprising, where applicable, direct
materials, direct labour costs and appropriate overheads incurred
in bringing them to their present location and condition) and net 
realisable value.
Properties held for resale are included at the lower of cost and net
realisable value. Cost includes the cost of acquiring and developing the
sites, including borrowing costs where applicable.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all 
estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, 
selling and distribution. 
r) Service concessions
IFRIC 12 addresses accounting by private sector operators 
involved in the provision of public sector infrastructure assets and 
services. Relevant assets within its scope are classified as financial 
assets (where the operator has an unconditional right to receive a 
specified amount of cash or other financial asset over the life of
the arrangement); or intangible assets (where the operator’s future 
cashflows are not specified); or a combination of both (where the 
operator’s return is provided partially by a financial asset and partially 
by an intangible asset).
The group has service concession arrangements in Scotland, 
Australia and Bulgaria, where it has been engaged to finance, design, 
construct and operate water and wastewater assets on behalf of local 
government authorities or other utility providers for periods of 20 to
30 years. At the end of the contracts, the constructed assets will be 
transferred to the grantors of the respective service concessions at
market price or written down asset value, depending upon the contract.
The group bears demand risk on revenues arising from its service
concession arrangements in Scotland and Bulgaria. In accordance 
with IFRIC 12, the related assets have therefore been classified as 
intangible assets (see note 13). The service concession arrangements 
in Australia have a mix of revenue streams; some are fixed, while others
vary depending upon demand levels. The related assets have therefore
been classified as financial asset loan receivables or intangible assets 
as appropriate (see notes 16 and 13).
s) Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation
uncertainty
In the process of applying its accounting policies, the group is required 
to make certain estimates, judgements and assumptions that it 
believes are reasonable based upon the information available. These
estimates and assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities 
at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of revenues
and expenses recognised during the reporting periods presented.
On an ongoing basis, the group evaluates its estimates using historical
experience, consultation with experts and other methods considered
reasonable in the particular circumstances. Actual results may differ
significantly from the estimates, the effect of which is recognised in the
period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.
The following paragraphs detail the estimates and judgements the 
group believes to have the most significant impact on the annual results
under IFRS.
Carrying value of property, plant and equipment
The estimated useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment 
(PPE) are based upon management’s judgement and experience. When 
management identifies that actual useful lives differ materially from 
the estimates used to calculate depreciation, that charge is adjusted 
prospectively. Due to the significance of PPE investment to the group, 
variations between actual and estimated useful lives could impact 
operating results both positively and negatively, although historically 
few changes to estimated useful lives have been required.
The group is required to evaluate the carrying values of PPE for 
impairment whenever circumstances indicate, in management’s
judgement, that the carrying value of such assets may not be 
recoverable. An impairment review requires management to make
subjective judgements concerning the cashflows, growth rates and 
discount rates of the cash generating units under review.
Revenue recognition
The group recognises revenue generally at the time of delivery and
when collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. When 
the group considers that the criteria for revenue recognition are not
met for a transaction, revenue recognition is delayed until such time
as the transaction becomes fully earned or collectability is reasonably 
assured. Payments received in advance of revenue recognition are
recorded as deferred income.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Financial Statements
Accounting policies
United Utilities Water PLC raises bills in accordance with its
entitlement to receive revenue in line with the limits established by the
periodic regulatory price review processes. For water and wastewater 
customers with water meters, the receivable billed is dependent 
upon the volume supplied including the sales value of an estimate of 
the units supplied between the date of the last meter reading and 
the billing date. Meters are read on a cyclical basis and the group 
recognises revenue for unbilled amounts based upon estimated usage
from the last billing through to each reporting date. The estimated 
usage is based upon historical data, judgement and assumptions; 
actual results could differ from these estimates, which would result in 
operating revenues being adjusted in the period that the revision to the
estimates is determined. For customers who do not have a meter, the 
receivable billed is dependent upon the rateable value of the property, 
as assessed by an independent rating officer.
For the group’s other businesses, revenue is recognised in line with
activity and performance, normally using amounts specified in 
contractual obligations and when recoverability is reasonably assured.
In general:
● variable revenues, for example, revenues dependent upon customer
volumes in the period, are recognised only when those variable
activities are performed;
● performance incentives are recognised in revenue only to the extent
that it is probable that the related economic benefits will flow to the 
group; and
● revenue invoiced or received in advance of performance is
recognised as deferred income. When performance occurs, the 
deferred income is released and reported as revenue.
A breakdown of revenues by segment is contained in note 2 to the
financial statements.
Provision for doubtful receivables
At each reporting date, the company and each of its subsidiaries evaluate
the recoverability of trade receivables and record provisions for doubtful
receivables based upon experience. These provisions are based upon,
amongst other things, customer category and consideration of actual
collection history. The actual level of receivables collected may differ from
the estimated levels of recovery, which could impact operating results
positively or negatively.
Accounting for provisions and contingencies
The group is subject to a number of claims incidental to the normal 
conduct of its business, relating to and including commercial, 
contractual and employment matters, which are handled and defended 
in the ordinary course of business. The group routinely assesses the 
likelihood of any adverse judgements or outcomes to these matters 
as well as ranges of probable and reasonably estimated losses. 
Reasonable estimates involve judgements made by management after 
considering information including notifications, settlements, estimates 
performed by independent parties and legal counsel, available facts, 
identification of other potentially responsible parties and their ability 
to contribute, and prior experience. A provision is recognised when it 
is probable that an obligation exists for which a reliable estimate can 
be made after careful analysis of the individual matter. The required
provision may change in the future due to new developments and as
additional information becomes available. Matters that either are 
possible obligations or do not meet the recognition criteria for a 
provision are disclosed in note 30, unless the possibility of transferring 
economic benefits is remote.
Retirement benefits
The group operates a number of defined benefit schemes, two of 
which have a defined contribution section, which are independent of 
the group’s finances. Actuarial valuations of the schemes are carried 
out as determined by the trustees at intervals of not more than three 
years. The pension cost under IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ is assessed
in accordance with the advice of a firm of actuaries based upon the 
latest actuarial valuation and assumptions determined by the actuary. 
The assumptions are based upon information supplied to the actuary 
by the company, supplemented by discussions between the actuary and
management. The assumptions are disclosed in note 20. Profit before 
taxation and net assets are affected by the actuarial assumptions used. 
These assumptions include investment returns on the schemes’ assets, 
discount rates, pay growth and increases to pensions in payment 
and deferred pensions and may differ from actual results due to 
changing market and economic conditions and longer or shorter lives of 
participants.
Derivatives and borrowings
The group’s default treatment is for borrowings to be carried at 
amortised cost, whilst derivatives are recognised separately in the 
statement of financial position at fair value with movements in those
fair values recognised in the income statement. This has the potential
to introduce considerable volatility to both the income statement and 
statement of financial position.
Therefore, where feasible, the group has taken advantage of the 
various provisions under IAS 39 to designate borrowings at fair value 
through the income statement or equity to reduce this volatility and 
better represent the economic hedges that exist between the group’s
borrowings and related derivative contracts.
In order to apply hedge accounting, it must be demonstrated that 
the derivative has been, and will continue to be, an effective hedge 
of the hedged risk within the debt item. Changes in the fair value of 
all derivatives are recognised in the income statement, except for
derivatives that are designated as, and effective in terms of, cashflow
hedging relationships, in which case the gains and losses are deferred 
in equity. The group applies the fair value through profit or loss option 
where the complexity of the swaps means that they are disallowed
from being accounted for in a hedge relationship despite there 
being significant fair value offset between the hedged item and the 
derivative itself. This area is considered to be of significance due to the 
magnitude of the group’s level of borrowings.

United Utilities Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010
Accounting policies
continued
Designated borrowings and derivatives recorded at fair value are valued
using a discounted cashflow valuation model. This model calculates the
zero coupon curves for the applicable currency as at each reporting date
and uses these to determine future floating cashflows. Future fixed and
floating cashflows are discounted using discount factors derived from
the same zero coupon curves adjusted for credit risk where appropriate.
Cashflows denominated in foreign currencies are converted into sterling
at the spot exchange rate at each reporting date.
The valuation of debt designated as being within a fair value hedged 
relationship is calculated based upon the risk being hedged in line 
with IAS 39. The group looks to hedge cashflows which represents 
its floating rate exposure, and it is this portion which is used in the 
valuation model.
The valuation of debt designated at fair value through the profit or loss 
incorporates an assumed credit spread in the discount factor. Credit 
spreads are determined based upon indicative pricing data.
Taxation
Assessing the outcome of uncertain tax positions requires judgements 
to be made regarding the result of negotiations with, and enquiries 
from, tax authorities in a number of jurisdictions.

International Financial Reporting Standards
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the 
following relevant standards and interpretations were in issue but not 
yet effective. The directors anticipate that the group will adopt these
standards and interpretations on their effective dates.
The directors anticipate that the adoption of the following standards 
and interpretations may have a material impact on the group’s financial 
statements:
● IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations – revised standard’ , issued in January
2008, is effective for periods commencing on or after 1 July 2009 
and was endorsed by the EU on 12 June 2009. This will have a 
material impact on the group’s financial statements only if it enters 
into any relevant transactions in the future;  and
● IFRIC 18 ‘Transfers of Assets from Customers’ , issued in January
2009, is effective for transfers from customers received on or 
after 1 July 2009, for periods commencing on or after 31 October 
2009 and was endorsed by the EU on 27 November 2009. This
interpretation will therefore be adopted by the group in the year 
ending 31 March 2011. The adoption of IFRIC 18 is expected to 
change the group’s policy for the valuation of assets transferred 
from customers and may lead to an increase in revenue, the value of
assets capitalised and future depreciation costs.
The directors anticipate that the adoption of the following standards 
and interpretations will have no material impact on the group’s financial 
statements:

No revenue was derived from exchanges of goods or services during the year ended 31 March 2010 (2009: £nil).
2 SEGMENT REPORTING
The group’s revenue predominantly arises from the provision of services.
The group is organised into two principal operating divisions for management purposes, being regulated and non-regulated activities. These 
divisions form the basis on which the operating segment information, presented in accordance with IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ , is reported. 
The comparative figures for the year ended 31 March 2009 have been restated in accordance with IFRS 8.
The regulated activities segment is as previously reported and includes the regulated results of United Utilities Water PLC.
The non-regulated activities segment is as previously reported and includes the group’s utility outsourcing contracts in the United Kingdom 
and overseas.
The ‘all other segments’ category was previously reported as the group’s other activities segment. This category includes the results of United Utilities
Property Services Limited (formerly United Utilities Property Solutions Limited), United Utilities Group PLC and other group holding companies.
The disclosure correlates with the information provided to the United Utilities Group PLC board of directors (the ‘board’) for the purposes of 
assessing performance and allocating resources. The board reviews revenue, underlying operating profit and operating profit by segment, but
assets and liabilities are reviewed at a consolidated level. Investment income and finance expense, and taxation are managed on a group basis and
are not allocated to operating segments.
Trading between segments is carried out on an arm’s length basis and transactions are priced accordingly. External market prices are used where 
available; where not available, margins generated are compared to those generated from external sales and adjusted where necessary.

 Fair value losses on debt and derivative instruments includes foreign exchange gains of £44.1 million (2009: £352.0 million losses), excluding those on instruments measured at fair value
through profit or loss. These gains/losses are largely offset by fair value losses/gains on derivatives.
(2)
 Includes £48.2 million losses (2009: £76.6 million gains) on the valuation of debt reported at fair value through profit or loss due to changes in credit spread assumptions.
(3)
 Includes fair value movements in relation to joint venture swaps and other economic hedge derivatives relating to debt held at amortised cost.
(4)
 Includes £22.2 million (2009: £8.3 million) interest on swaps and debt under fair value option.
Interest payable for the year ended 31 March 2010 is stated net of £0.5 million borrowing costs capitalised in the cost of qualifying assets within 
property, plant and equipment during the year. This has been calculated by applying a capitalisation rate of 3.3 per cent to expenditure on such
assets as prescribed by IAS 23 (Revised 2007) ‘Borrowing Costs’ , which has been applied prospectively from 1 April 2009 (see accounting policies).

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing profit for the financial year attributable to equity holders of the company by 681.5 million, being 
the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year (2009: 681.4 million). Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing profit for 
the financial year attributable to equity holders of the company by 682.0 million, being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the
year including dilutive shares (2009: 682.3 million).
To enable a meaningful comparison and in compliance with IAS 33 ‘Earnings per Share’ , the weighted average number of shares for the prior year 
has been based upon the 681,381,233 new ordinary shares in United Utilities Group PLC issued on 28 July 2008.
The difference between the weighted average number of shares used in the basic and the diluted earnings per share calculations represents those
ordinary shares deemed to have been issued for no consideration on the conversion of all potential dilutive ordinary shares in accordance with
IAS 33 ‘Earnings per Share’ .
The weighted average number of shares can be reconciled to the weighted average number of shares including dilutive shares as follows:
2010 2009

Average number of ordinary shares – basic 681.5 681.4
Average number of potentially dilutive ordinary shares under option 0.5 1.2

The shares in subsidiary undertakings balance at 1 April 2009 of £6,326.8 million represented the company’s investment in United Utilities PLC, 
acquired on 28 July 2008. The value of the investment on acquisition was based upon the closing share price of United Utilities PLC on 25 July 
2008. In addition, the company also acquired one deferred A share in United Utilities PLC on 23 July 2008 for £1.00.
The investment of £6,326.8 million in United Utilities PLC has been tested for impairment during the year following the acceptance of Ofwat’s final 
determination by the group’s principal operating company, United Utilities Water PLC (UUW). The final determination for 2010–15 sets the returns 
on investment allowed by the regulator for this period.
The valuation of United Utilities PLC for the purposes of the impairment test was based upon a ‘fair value less costs to sell’ approach, which 
incorporated the regulatory capital value (RCV) for UUW as at March 2010 plus a valuation for the non-regulated businesses. An impairment of 
£726.8 million has been taken against this investment, reducing the value of the company’s investment in United Utilities PLC to £5,600.0 million, 
resulting in a net investment, after taking account of intercompany balances, of £4,146.2 million.

The above analysis in respect of gross trade receivables reconciles to net trade receivables by deduction of the allowance for doubtful receivables 
of £206.6 million (2009: £192.8 million, 2008: £171.7 million).
The group manages its regulated bad debt risk by providing against gross trade receivables. This allowance is calculated by reference to customer 
categories rather than on the age profile of gross debtor balances. It is therefore not possible to age the allowance for doubtful receivables.

and 31 March 2008.
The group’s average credit period taken on sales is 33 days (2009: 31 days, 2008: 33 days).

 19 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
Risk management 
All of the group’s activities involve analysis, management and, in some cases, acceptance of risk or a combination of risks. The most important 
types of financial risk are credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk and capital risk. Market risk includes interest rate, foreign exchange and
inflation risks.
The group’s risk management policies are designed to identify and analyse these risks, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor 
the risks and limits continually by means of reliable and up-to-date systems. The group modifies and enhances its risk management policies and 
systems to reflect changes in markets and products. The board formulates the high level group risk management policy. The treasury committee is 
responsible for monitoring the implementation of the policy. The board has approved all of the classes of financial instruments used by the group. 
The group’s treasury function, which is authorised to conduct the day-to-day treasury activities of the group, reports annually to the board and 
quarterly to the treasury committee.
The group’s exposure to risk and its objectives, policies and processes for managing risk and the methods used for measuring risk have not 
materially changed since the prior year.
Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk that financial loss arises from the failure of a customer or counterparty to meet its obligations under a contract. It arises 
principally from trade finance (the supply of services to the public and other businesses) and treasury activities (the investment of essential 
liquidity). The group has policies and procedures to control and monitor credit risk. The group does not believe it is exposed to any material 
concentrations of credit risk.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The group looks to manage its risk from trade finance through the effective management of customer relationships. The Water Industry Act 1991 
(as amended by the Water Industry Act 1999) prohibits the disconnection of a water supply for non-payment and the limiting of a supply with the 
intention of enforcing payment for certain premises including domestic dwellings. However, allowance is made by the water regulator in the price 
limits at each price review for a proportion of debt deemed to be irrecoverable. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are 
limited due to the group’s customer base consisting of a large number of unrelated households and businesses. Due to this, the directors believe 
there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful receivables (see note 16).
The counterparties in respect of treasury activities consist of financial institutions and other bodies considered to have good credit ratings. 
Although the group is potentially exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by counterparties, such credit risk is measured and 
controlled through regular review of the credit ratings assigned to the counterparties by credit rating agencies, and by limiting the total amount of 
exposure to any one party. Management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations, and there has not been any such failure 
during the year, or in the preceding year.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the statement of financial position. At 
31 March, the maximum exposure to credit risk for the group and the company was as follows:

    1,213.5 1,610.2 2,618.6 65.6 66.4
Cash and short-term deposits and trade and other receivables are measured at amortised cost. Derivative financial instruments are measured at 
fair value.
The credit exposure on derivatives is disclosed gross of any collateral received from the respective counterparties. As at 31 March 2010 the group 
held £53.3 million (2009: £84.1 million) as collateral in relation to swap contracts.
 Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the group will not have sufficient funds to meet the obligations or commitments arising from its business operations 
and its financial liabilities. The group manages the liquidity profile of its assets, liabilities and commitments so that cashflows are appropriately 
balanced and all funding obligations are met when due. The board approves a liquidity framework within which the business operates. Performance 
against this framework is actively monitored and reported monthly.
At 31 March the headroom was as follows:
       2010 2009

       1,100.0 934.8
Short-term deposits mature within three months. Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand.
Short-term debt includes £53.3 million (2009: £84.1 million) collateral liability pledged in relation to a particular swap contract.
Medium-term committed bank facilities excludes £100.0 million (2009: £335.0 million) of facilities expiring within one year.

Notes:
(1)
  Forecast future cashflows are calculated, where applicable, utilising forward interest rates based upon the interest environment at year end and are, therefore, susceptible to changes in market 
conditions. For index-linked debt it has been assumed that RPI will be 2.65 per cent over the life of each bond.
(2)
  The carrying value of debt is calculated following various methods in accordance with IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ and, therefore, this adjustment reconciles 
the undiscounted forecast future cashflows to the carrying value of debt in the statement of financial position.
The company has a total liability of £1,507.4 million (2009: £1,502.2 million), which is payable within one year.
Market risk 
Market risk is the risk that movements in market rates, including foreign exchange rates, interest rates and inflation will affect the group’s results. 
The management of market risk is undertaken within risk limits approved by the board.
The group borrows in the major global debt markets in a range of currencies at fixed and floating rates of interest, using derivatives, where 
appropriate, to generate the desired effective currency profile and interest basis. 
The group uses a variety of financial instruments, including derivatives, when raising finance for its operations in order to manage any exposure 
arising from funding activity.
Interest rate risk
The group’s fixed rate borrowings are exposed to a risk of change in their fair value due to changes in interest rates. The group’s floating rate 
borrowings are exposed to a risk of change in cashflows due to changes in interest rates. The group uses interest rate swap contracts to hedge 
these exposures. Investments in equity securities and short-term receivables and payables are not exposed to interest rate risk.
The group’s policy is to structure debt in a way that best matches its underlying assets and cashflows. The regulated business earns an economic 
return on its regulatory capital value (RCV) asset, comprising a real return through revenues, determined by the real cost of capital fixed by the 
regulator for each five-year regulatory pricing period, and an inflation return as an uplift to its RCV .
The preferred form of debt, therefore, is sterling index-linked debt which incurs fixed interest, in real terms, and forms a natural hedge of 
regulatory assets and cashflows.
Where conventional long-term debt is raised in a fixed-rate form, to manage exposure to long-term interest rates, the debt is generally swapped at 
inception to create a floating rate liability for the term of the liability through the use of interest rate swaps.
To manage the exposure to medium-term interest rates, the group fixes interest costs for a substantial proportion of the group’s debt for the 
duration of each five-year regulatory pricing period at around the time of that price control determination.

Sensitivity analysis
As required by IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ , the sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis of the amount of net debt and the 
interest rate hedge positions in place as at 31 March 2010 and 31 March 2009, respectively. As a result, this analysis relates to the position at the 
reporting date and is not indicative of the years then ended, as these factors would have varied throughout the year.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the interest sensitivity analysis:
● all fair value hedge relationships, including associated swaps classified as held for trading, are fully effective and therefore there is no 
sensitivity in the statement of financial position to interest rates with regard to these designated debt and swaps instruments;
● all borrowings designated at fair value through profit or loss are effectively hedged by associated swaps and therefore there is no sensitivity 
in the statement of financial position to interest rates (excluding the effect of accrued interest) with regard to the associated debt and swap 
instruments;
● the main sensitivity in the statement of financial position to interest rates (excluding the effect of accrued interest) is in relation to the 
regulatory swaps which swap the majority of the floating rate exposure to fixed rate for the five-year regulatory period;
● the sensitivity of net finance expense to movements in interest rates is calculated on net floating rate exposures on debt and derivatives; and on 
deposits. The floating leg of a swap or any floating rate debt is treated as not having any interest rate already set; therefore, a change in interest 
rates will have a full 12-month impact on interest;
● the standard requires that a change in the relevant risk variable be applied to the risk exposures in existence at the reporting date; therefore, 
deposits at the reporting date are taken and any debt or swaps maturing during the year are disregarded;
● index-linked debt is carried at amortised cost and therefore the statement of financial position is not exposed to movements in interest rates. 
It is assumed that inflation is held constant;
● the analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of pensions and other post-retirement obligations;
● management has assessed 100bp as a reasonably possible movement in UK interest rates; and
● all other factors are held constant.

The exposure largely relates to the fair value exposure on the group’s fixed rate financing. Management assesses the net interest exposure and 
determines whether to mitigate this risk further by entering into financial futures contracts. At 31 March 2010 and 31 March 2009, the group had 
no financial futures contracts in place.

Currency risk
The group’s assets are principally sterling denominated; however, the group has access to various international debt capital markets and raises 
foreign currency denominated debt. Where debt is denominated in a currency which is not sterling, the group’s policy is generally to swap the 
foreign currency denominated cashflows into sterling through the use of foreign currency swaps. As a result, for the majority of foreign currency 
denominated borrowings, the group has no material exposure to movements in exchange rates.
The company has no material exposure to currency risk.
Inflation risk
The group’s index-linked borrowings and interest liabilities are exposed to a risk of change in carrying value due to changes in the UK!RPI. This form 
of liability is a good match for the group’s regulated assets, which are also linked to RPI due to the revenue price cap imposed by the regulator. This 
price cap is linked to RPI and limits management’s ability to change prices. By matching liabilities to assets, index-linked debt hedges the exposure 
to changes in RPI and delivers a cashflow benefit, as compensation for the inflation risk is provided through adjustment to the principal rather than 
in cash. 
The carrying value of index-linked debt held by the group is as follows:
       2010 2009
       £m £m
Index-linked debt      2,062.7 1,962.2

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The analysis assumes a one per cent change in RPI having a corresponding one per cent impact on this position over a 12-month period. It should be 
noted, however, that there is a time lag by which current RPI changes impact on the profit and loss and the analysis does not incorporate this factor. 
The portfolio of index-linked debt is either calculated on a three or eight-month lag basis. Therefore, at the reporting date the index-linked interest 
and principal adjustments impacting the income statement are fixed and based upon either the previous three or eight-month RPI.
The company has no material exposure to inflation risk.
Capital risk management 
The group’s objective when managing capital is to maintain a capital structure that enables its primary subsidiary, United Utilities Water PLC, to 
retain a credit rating of A3 from Moody’s Investors Services, which the group believes best mirrors the Water Services Regulation Authority’s 
(Ofwat) assumptions in relation to capital structure. The strategy of targeting a credit rating of A3 has been consistently maintained since 2007.
One of Ofwat’s primary duties is to ensure that water companies are able to finance their functions, in particular by securing a reasonable return on 
their capital. Therefore, mirroring Ofwat’s assumptions for credit ratings (and hence capital structure) should safeguard the group’s ability to earn 
a reasonable return on its capital, securing access to finance at a reasonable cost and enabling the group to continue as a going concern in order to 
provide returns for shareholders and credit investors, and benefits for other stakeholders.
In order to maintain a credit rating of A3 the group needs to manage its capital structure with reference to the ratings methodology and measures used 
by the relevant rating agencies. The ratings methodology is normally based upon a number of key ratios (such as regulatory capital value (RCV) gearing 
and adjusted interest cover) and threshold levels as updated and published from time to time by the rating agencies.
Further detail on the precise measures and methodologies used to assess water companies’ credit ratings can be found in the methodology papers 
published by the rating agencies.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In order to determine the fair values in the previous table, all borrowings and derivatives are valued using a discounted cashflow valuation model as 
described within the accounting policies on pages 69 to 70. In determining fair values, assumptions are made with regard to credit spreads based 
upon indicative pricing data.
In respect of the total change during the year in the fair value of financial liabilities designated as at fair value through profit or loss for continuing 
operations of £7.9 million loss (2009: £56.6 million loss), £48.2 million loss (2009: £76.6 million gain) is attributable to changes in credit risk. 
The cumulative impact of changes in credit spread was £59.0 million profit (2009: £107.2 million profit). The difference between the carrying 
amount and the amount contracted to settle on maturity was a carrying amount increase of £63.4 million (2009: a carrying amount increase of 
£55.5 million).

● Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
● Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset 
or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
● Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based 
upon observable market data (unobservable).

20 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS
Defined benefit schemes
The group participates in a number of pension schemes principally in the United Kingdom. The three major schemes are funded defined benefit 
schemes – the United Utilities Pension Scheme (UUPS), the United Utilities Group PLC section of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme (ESPS) 
and the Northern Gas Networks Pension Scheme (NGNPS), all of which are closed to new employees. The assets of these schemes are held in trust 
funds independent of the group’s finances.
The last actuarial valuation of UUPS was carried out as at 30 September 2008, ESPS was carried out as at 31 March 2008 and NGNPS was 
carried out as at 31 December 2008. These valuations have been updated to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ in 
order to assess the position at 31 March 2010 by projecting forward from the dates of the respective valuations, and have been performed by an 
independent actuary, Mercer Limited.
On 31 March 2005, the group made lump sum payments of £216.0 million and £103.5 million to UUPS and ESPS respectively. The payments 
were in lieu of the estimated company contributions that were expected to have been payable for defined benefit members over the five years 
from 1 April 2005. Whilst some company contributions to UUPS and ESPS resumed in respect of the defined benefit members during 2008/09, 
significant elements of the company contribution holiday following the lump sum payments continued during the year ended 31 March 2010. The 
group made total contributions of £44.1 million (2009: £45.4 million) to its pension schemes for the year ended 31 March 2010. The group also 
operates a series of unfunded, unregistered retirement benefit schemes. The cost of the unfunded, unregistered retirement benefit schemes is 
included in the total pension cost, on a basis consistent with IAS 19 and the assumptions set out below.
The group also continues to pay contributions in respect of NGNPS, the defined contribution members and insurance premiums. Other payments 
will be made by the group in accordance with the funding agreements between the trustees and the group. Overall, the group expects to contribute 
around £106.5  million to its defined benefit schemes in the year ending 31 March 2011.
The total defined benefit pension income for the year was £23.1 million (2009: £33.0 million expense), including pension income credited to 
operating profit of £46.3 million (2009: £39.8 million expense), which reflects curtailment gains arising on amendment of pension obligations of 
£92.3 million (2009: £nil). A pension obligation of £271.3 million is included in the statement of financial position at 31 March 2010 (2009: £213.1 
million). Information about the pension arrangements for executive directors is contained in the directors’ remuneration report.
The credit of £92.3 million offsetting the pension expense for the year ended 31 March 2010 has arisen as a result of the amendment of pensions 
obligations (see pensions information in the business review on page 11). These include the introduction of a restriction on the rate of increase in 
pensionable pay for defined benefit members of the UUPS and the ESPS. This restriction took effect on 31 March 2010. Changes to the benefits 
accruing after 31 March 2010 for the defined benefit members of the UUPS have also been implemented. The impact of these changes will be 
reflected in the current service cost element of the pension expense for 2010/11.

Studies in the last five years have shown faster rates of life expectancy improvement than had previously been expected. Studies have also 
illustrated that mortality rates vary significantly according to the demographics of the schemes’ members. These factors have been taken into 
account in the calculation of the defined benefit obligations of the group.
At 31 March, the fair value of the schemes’ assets and liabilities recognised in the statement of financial position were as follows:

Present value of defined benefit obligations     (2,182.2)  (1,696.9)
Net retirement benefit obligations     (271.3)  (213.1)
To develop the expected long-term rate of return on asset assumptions, the group considered the current level of expected returns on risk free 
investments, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations 
for future returns of each asset class. The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based upon the actual asset allocation to 
develop the expected long-term rate of return on asset assumptions for the portfolio. The group’s actual return on schemes’ assets was a gain of 
£459.3 million (2009: £372.1 million loss).

At 31 March 2010, gross pension liabilities in respect of retirement benefit obligations for NGNPS were £233.5 million (2009: £171.7 million). 
Gross pension assets in respect of NGNPS at 31 March 2010 were £225.8 million (2009: £169.7 million). The group recorded a related deferred 
tax asset at 31 March 2010 of £2.2 million (2009: £0.6 million). The directors consider that the group should apply defined benefit accounting in 
respect of the scheme. However, the group does not have the responsibility to fund the net pension deficit and has reflected this by the recognition 
of an available for sale financial asset within investments of £5.5 million at 31 March 2010 (2009: £1.4 million).
Defined contribution pension costs
The schemes also include a defined contribution section which constitutes around two per cent of the total asset value.
During the year, the group made £9.9 million (2009: £7.0 million) of contributions to defined contribution schemes, which are included in arriving at 
operating profit from continuing operations.
Various companies in the United Kingdom electricity industry participate in the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme (ESPS), which is an industry-
wide defined benefit scheme. The United Utilities Electricity Services Limited (UUES) section of the Electricity North West (ENW) Group of the 
scheme was created in December 2007 to accommodate the transfer of employees from ENW (formerly United Utilities Electricity Limited) to 
UUES. At that date, the UUES section of the scheme was fully funded. The group makes cash contributions over the period of the Asset Services 
Agreement (ASA) between UUES and ENW, which are fully recoverable from ENW under the terms of the ASA. There is no obligation brought 
forward, or carried forward, for which the group is responsible. However, as the group is the employer, it is required to disclose the gross pension 
liabilities and assets associated with the scheme.
At 31 March 2010, gross pension liabilities in respect of retirement benefit obligations for the UUES section of the ESPS were £224.6 million 
(2009:!£157.3 million). Gross pension assets in respect of the UUES section of the ESPS, at 31 March 2010, were £214.1 million (2009: 
£149.4!million). £12.0 million of cash contributions have been made to the UUES section of the ESPS during the year ended 31 March 2010 (2009: 
£13.6 million), these costs being charged to operating profit as defined contribution pension costs. Therefore, in total, the group incurred defined 
contribution pension costs of £21.9 million (2009: £20.6 million) (see note 3).
The company does not participate in any of the group’s pension schemes.

 24 SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY CONTINUED
On 24 July 2008, the High Court (the ‘Court’) approved the scheme of arrangement (the ‘Scheme’) of United Utilities PLC to establish a new listed 
company, United Utilities Group PLC, as the holding company of United Utilities PLC. United Utilities PLC shareholders received 17 United 
Utilities Group PLC ordinary shares for every 22 United Utilities PLC shares, together with one United Utilities Group PLC B share of 170.0 pence 
for each United Utilities PLC share.
On 30 July 2008, the Court approved the reduction of the capital of United Utilities Group PLC, whereby the nominal value of each ordinary share 
was reduced from 500.0 pence to five pence.
In addition, a merger reserve was created in the company statement of financial position of United Utilities Group PLC upon the Scheme becoming 
effective, which, in order to create further distributable reserves in United Utilities Group PLC, was capitalised into A shares, which were cancelled 
as part of the reduction of capital of United Utilities Group PLC.
The reduction of capital became effective on 31 July 2008. The effect of the Scheme of arrangement and the subsequent reduction in capital 
increased the distributable reserves of United Utilities Group PLC by £4.8 billion which enabled the return of £1,499.0 million capital to take place 
and will allow future dividends.
The merger reserve arises on consolidation and represents the capital adjustment to reserves required to effect the reverse acquisition, being the 
difference between the existing share capital and share premium of United Utilities PLC at the date of the reverse acquisition and the share capital, 
including B shares, of United Utilities Group PLC following the reduction of capital of United Utilities Group PLC. The increase in the merger reserve 
during the year ended 31 March 2010 is due to the redemption of the remaining £16.7 million of B shares in April 2009 (see note 18).

50,400 ordinary shares were allotted during the year ended 31 March 2010 (2009: 104,399 ordinary shares) for the exercise of options in 
accordance with the rules of the employee ShareSave scheme and the executive share option scheme for a total consideration of £0.2 million 
(2009: £0.7 million).
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the company has not presented its own income statement. The amount of group (loss)/
profit for the financial year dealt with in the company’s income statement is £522.9 million loss (2009: £133.0 million profit) after accounting for 
dividends received from subsidiary undertakings of £231.2 million (2009: £172.5 million).
The increase in the capital redemption reserve during the year ended 31 March 2010 is due to the redemption of the remaining £16.7 million of B shares 
in April 2009 (see note 18).

In respect of the group’s commitment to significant property leases, there are no contingent rentals payable, or restrictions on dividends, debt or 
further leasing imposed by these lease arrangements. The group has the right to renew such leases and escalation of rents is via rent reviews over 
a minimum five-year period.
The company had no operating lease commitments at 31 March 2010 or 31 March 2009.
27 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
On 28 July 2008, a new statutory holding company structure became effective by way of a share exchange between the shareholders of United 
Utilities PLC and United Utilities Group PLC and the listed parent company became United Utilities Group PLC (UUG) (see note 24). At that time all 
existing share option schemes and previous awards made by the United Utilities PLC schemes were transferred to the new listed parent company. 
From this point, all awards made by the group’s schemes are in UUG shares.
The company operates several share option schemes. Options are exercisable at a price equal to the average quoted market price of the company’s 
shares on the date of grant. Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the group through resignation or dismissal before the options vest.
Cash-settled and equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the date of 
grant of equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based upon the group’s estimate of 
shares that will eventually vest.

27 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED
Fair value is measured by use of both simulation and binomial models according to the relevant measures of performance. The models include 
adjustments, based upon management’s best estimate, for the effects of exercise restrictions, behavioural considerations and expected dividend 
payments. The option life is derived from the models based upon these assumptions and other assumptions identified below.
The total expense included within operating profit from continuing operations in respect of equity-settled share-based payments was £2.4 
million (2009: £1.9 million) and £nil (2009: £nil) in respect of cash-settled share-based payments, plus £0.3 million accrual of national insurance 
contributions (2009: £0.2 million).
The United Utilities Employee Share Trust was established by a trust deed executed on 21 August 1996. The Trustees hold the trust fund for the benefit 
of the beneficiaries (being employees or former employees of the group’s companies and their relatives) to the extent determined by the rules of the 
share schemes. As at 31 March 2010, the Trust held 41,418 (2009: 41,418) shares on trust and these shares will be used to satisfy awards payable 
under the group’s performance share plan. All dividends payable on the shares during the current and prior years were waived.
Further details of the different types of share-based payments are as follows:
Continuing operations
Company share option scheme 1999
The company share option scheme 1999 is for senior executives (excluding, with effect from the introduction of the group’s long-term incentive 
plan, executive directors and other executives participating in that plan and its successor, the performance share plan).
Options under the company share option scheme 1999 are exercisable in a period beginning no earlier than three years (five years for discounted 
options under the former executive share option scheme, which are no longer granted) and ending no later than 10 years from the date of grant.
Employee ShareSave scheme
The employee ShareSave scheme was available to all eligible employees and was based on Save As Y ou Earn (SA YE) savings contracts with options 
exercisable within a six-month period from the conclusion of a three or five-year period as appropriate from the date of grant. Under the terms and 
conditions of this scheme, for every month (up to no more than six months) an employee fails to contribute the agreed monthly amount determined 
under the rules of the scheme, the last date exercisable will be delayed by one month. The latest grant under the ShareSave scheme was made in the 
year ended 31 March 2004. No further grants have been made under this scheme.
Performance share plan
The performance share plan (PSP) is for senior executives of the group. Options under the PSP are exercisable no earlier than three years from the 
31 March preceding the date of grant and have an exercise period of three months. PSP awards granted prior to 31 March 2008 are subject to a total 
shareholder return (TSR) performance condition (a market-based measure of performance). PSP awards granted during the year ended 31 March 
2009 onwards are 50 per cent subject to a TSR performance condition (a market-based measure of performance); the remaining 50 per cent of the 
awards are subject to operational performance conditions.
Matching share award plan
The matching share award plan (MSAP) is for senior executives of the group. Options under this scheme are exercisable no earlier than three 
years from the 31 March preceding the date of grant and have an exercise period of three months. MSAP awards are 50 per cent subject to a TSR 
performance condition (a market-based measure of performance); the remaining 50 per cent of the award is subject to operational performance 
conditions.
Deferred share plan
The deferred share plan (DSP) is for the employees at the level below senior executive. An annual award in deferred group shares is made on the 
basis of a maximum of 30 per cent of salary, apportioned according to the extent of the employee’s achievement of the annual cash incentive plan 
maximum for the financial year. A limited number of employees at the next level below senior executive may also be nominated to receive a one-off 
award of a fixed number of deferred group shares in recognition of exceptional performance during the year. Shares are released after a three-year 
holding period and are conditional on continued employment with the group during this time. These options may, at the group’s discretion, be settled 
in cash. DSP awards grant employees free shares with no performance conditions which are entitled to dividend equivalents, therefore the fair value 
of the award is equal to the market price of the share at the grant date (2010 weighted average fair value at date of award: £5.41, 2009: £4.90) .

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Cash-settled share-based payments
The group issued, to certain employees, share appreciation rights (SARs) that require the group to pay the intrinsic value of the SARs to the 
employee at the date of exercise. At 31 March 2010, the group has recorded liabilities of £nil (2009: £nil) in respect of SARs.
The fair value of the SARs is determined using the Black-Scholes pricing model using the assumptions detailed below. The group recorded a total 
charge of £nil (2009: £nil) during the year in respect of SARs. At 31 March 2010, the total intrinsic value of the vested SARs was £nil (2009: £nil).
Other share-based payment plan
The main all-employee scheme is the HM Revenue & Customs approved share incentive plan, ‘ShareBuy’ . This is a flexible way for employees to 
acquire shares in the company by buying ‘partnership’ shares up to the lower of £1,500 or 10 per cent of taxable pay each year. The funds are 
deducted from pre-tax pay and passed to an independent trustee who makes a monthly purchase of shares at full market price. Employees can 
reinvest the dividends on partnership shares to buy more shares under the plan. The group gives one free share for every five partnership shares 
bought. The shares need to be held in trust for a five-year term in order to retain the maximum tax advantages.
The following tables show the inputs to the model used to calculate the fair value of equity-settled share options granted during the years ended 
31 March 2010 and 31 March 2009 respectively.

The weighted average exercise price of share options in the matching share award plan, performance share plan and deferred share plan was £nil 
for the year ended 31 March 2010 (2009: £nil).
None of the share options identified above as outstanding at 31 March 2010 had vested at that date.
For the purpose of IFRS 2, expiry of performance share plan awards is measured with reference to the achievement of the performance conditions 
within the vesting conditions at the reporting date, not the end of the notional vesting period of three years from grant date. Therefore options 
with performance conditions measured at the end of a reporting period are treated as expired if their performance conditions are not achieved at 
the reporting date.

Warning to shareholders
Please be very wary of any unsolicited contact about your 
investments or offers of free company reports. It may be from an 
overseas ‘broker’ who could sell you worthless or high risk shares.

to receive payment under the Financial Services Compensation 
Scheme. Further information and a list of unauthorised firms that 
have targeted UK investors is available from the Financial Services

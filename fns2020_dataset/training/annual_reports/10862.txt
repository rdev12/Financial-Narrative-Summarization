Statutory result excluding profit or loss on the sale  
of business, exceptional profit or loss on sale of non-
current assets and charges for goodwill impairment, 
intangible asset amortisation, exceptional items and 
tax relief thereon, for continuing operations. The Board 
believes that the normalised result gives a better 
indication of the underlying performance of the Group. 
Operating margin: the ratio of normalised operating 
profit to revenue for continuing businesses.

  Overview
Chairman’s letter
Dear shareholder, 
I am delighted to report that, in 201 1, National Express 
has delivered another successful year of business 
turnaround and improvement. 
I am delighted to report that in 201 1 
National Express has delivered another 
successful year of business turnaround 
and improvement. We have now 
completed the process of recreating a 
high quality business, building on the 
foundations that we put in place in 2010 
and delivering both improved profitability 
and strong revenue growth. National 
Express is now the best performing private 
provider of mass transportation in many  
of the markets in which it operates. 
201 1 has been a record year for Group 
statutory profit before tax and amortisation. 
Back in 2009, when I joined as Chairman, 
the Group was struggling for its business 
survival. However, we reduced our debt, 
resolved the losses in our East Coast rail 
franchise, maintained our independence 
and, with strong shareholder support, put 
in place an appropriate capital structure. 
Since his arrival in February 2010, Dean 
Finch has created a new leadership team 
which has turned the business around, 
delivering effective operational control, 
driving out excess cost and helping to 
refinance the Group’s debt. 201 1 has 
seen further margin improvement, organic 
growth supported by acquisition, and the 
identification of future growth opportunities. 
2012 is likely to present difficult economic 
challenges but we have created a platform 
from which to grow, both organically and 
through acquisition, highlighted by our 
decision to acquire Petermann Partners 
Inc, which is due to complete during the 
first half of the year.
With our turnaround complete, we are 
now implementing the next stage of our 
strategy: to continue to improve margin in 
our existing businesses; to take advantage 
of the growth opportunities in our current 
markets; and to identify and develop 
exciting new market potential. It will be 
delivered by a management team that  
has proven credentials in every area of  
our operations and we will strengthen the 
team further to ensure that we have the 
skills to deliver each aspect of our strategy. 
Our vision for the Group is to put our 
customers first, to a level that will clearly 
differentiate National Express in the mass 
transport market.
During the first half of 201 1, the Board 
took steps to further enhance its skills 
and experience, particularly recognising 
the Group’s future growth plans for North 
America and Continental Europe. I was 
very pleased to welcome Chris Muntwyler, 
Joaquín Ayuso and Lee Sander to the 
Board, each with credentials in our target 
markets. Since their appointment,  
they have given valuable insight into  
these growth areas, as well as helping  
to manage the risks and opportunities  
in our existing markets. 
In recognition of the Group’s sound 
financial footing and improved earnings, 
we restored the dividend last year with 
a final payment for 2010 of 6 pence 
per share. We set out a policy that the 
Board considers both sustainable and 
progressive in this prolonged period of 
economic uncertainty – we will aim for our 
dividend to be at least two times covered 
by non-rail earnings and fully funded by our 
free cash flow, across the medium term. 
At the same time, we reiterated our debt 
policy, to target a gearing ratio of between 
two and two and a half times earnings 
before interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation (EBITDA). 
We remain committed to these core 
policies, which provide shareholders with 
a suitable balance of long-term growing 
returns whilst retaining sufficient resource 
in the Group to explore opportunities to 
grow shareholder value. Following  
payment of our interim 201 1 dividend  
of 3 pence per share in September, I am 
pleased to announce a recommended final 
dividend for 201 1 of 6.5 pence per share, 
an increase of 8.3%, taking the full year 
payment to 9.5 pence per share. This will 
be paid from the 20.3 pence of non-rail 
earnings per share (EPS) delivered in 201 1 
and the £84.4 million of free cash flow we 
generated in the year, both of which we 
expect to grow in future years.
During 201 1, our employees have 
continued to play a major part in the 
implementation of our strategy, adopting 
our vision and values, with particular 
focus on improvements to customer 
service and in the promotion of a culture 
of safety across the Group. On behalf of 
the Board, I would like to thank them for 
the commitment and enthusiasm that they 
have shown, as we move into the next 
phase of our development.

2 Business review
Group Chief Executive
Overview of 2011
In 201 1 we completed our Business 
Recovery programme. We delivered:
•	 record statutory Group profit before  
tax and amortisation of £180.2 million 
(2010: £97.3m);
•	 three-fold increase in statutory profit 
before tax, up £89.2 million year-on-year 
to £129.4 million;
•	 revenue and profit growth in  
every division;
•	 record profits in our UK Coach business;
•	 industry leading operating margins in 
Spain, North America, UK Coach and 
Rail – North America achieved 10% 
margin; Group margin has almost 
doubled since 2009; and
•	 end of year contract order book revenue 
of £3.7 billion in existing concessions 
and tendered contracts.
Strong increase in profit
Group revenue increased by over 5% 
to £2.2 billion, despite the backdrop of 
difficult economic conditions and austerity 
measures. Normalised operating profit 
increased by 10.3% to £225.2 million 
(2010: £204.2m) and we achieved a record 
statutory Group profit before tax and 
amortisation, delivering no exceptional 
charges in 201 1. Statutory profit before tax 
rose more than three-fold to £129.4 million 
(2010: £40.2m). 
Secure financial platform
Our basic earnings per share (EPS) 
increased 14.4% to 27 .0 pence (2010: 
23.6p) and we have increased our full year 
proposed dividend to 9.5 pence (2010: 
6.0p); this is an 8.3% increase in the final 
dividend. We generated over £80 million 
in free cash flow in 201 1, supporting 
the reintroduction of the dividend and 
investment in organic growth to drive 
future profitability. We maintained a strong 
financial platform, with over £500 million of 
undrawn committed facilities and cash at 
the end of 201 1, a secure funding structure 
of primarily non-bank debt maturing 
between 2014 and 2020, and a debt 
gearing ratio below two times EBITDA.
Successfully managing austerity 
During 201 1 we dealt effectively with 
the challenges of economic austerity. In 
Spain we saw little impact on our public 
concessions. We saw some extension 
of receivable balances during the year 
and have managed them closely. In 
North America we met the challenge 
of reduced state funding by delivering 
more outsourced conversion contracts 
to school board customers. We are less 
exposed to UK Government funding than 
many of our peers. Our UK and Spanish 
coach businesses benefited by delivering 
excellent value for money services to  
cash-strapped customers. Economic 
austerity continues to drive as many 
opportunities for public passenger 
transport as it does challenges.
Core strengths in place to drive 
shareholder value
National Express is now well positioned 
to capitalise on new value enhancing 
opportunities. The executive management 
team is well established and the Group 
has been restored to its position as a 
leading international operator of public 
transportation. 
We are now focused on the following core 
initiatives to drive our progress:
•	 delivering operational excellence, 
with consistent service performance and 
ongoing cost efficiency improvements;
•	 securing organic growth from our 
existing portfolio of businesses; and 
•	 developing new contract 
opportunities in targeted businesses 
and geographies.
I believe our portfolio of 
businesses and track 
record of success mean 
we are also well placed 
to target emerging 
growth opportunities.
Dean Finch
In just two years National Express has moved from 
reporting losses to the record profits we have announced 
for 201 1. We carried more passengers than in 2010 and are 
now the best performing operator in many of our markets. 
Building on our operational success over 
the last two years, with four of our divisions 
delivering industry leading margins, there 
are still many opportunities to further 
reduce costs and improve efficiencies. 
Our existing diversified portfolio of bus and 
coach businesses has excellent growth 
potential and we are well on the way to 
replacing earnings from the East Anglia 
rail franchise. Organically we will grow 
through new products, better marketing 
and improved service delivery. At the same 
time we are investing in new business 
opportunities – such as the acquisition 
of the Petermann school bus business in 
North America. The Group is also investing 
in commercial development teams to 
target exciting US and European markets.
Delivering our strategy in 2011
Last February I set out the first phase 
of our strategy, which was to complete 
the rebuilding of National Express and to 
establish a foundation for profitable and 
sustainable long-term growth. In 201 1,  
I believe we have achieved this – not only 
have all five Group businesses reported 
3
Business review  
Group Chief Executive Business review
Group Chief Executive continued
increased profits, with four at industry 
leading margins, but all have achieved 
profitable revenue growth. 
Achieving margin improvement
Over the last two years we have delivered 
significant improvement in every business. 
UK Bus and North America have both 
nearly doubled profit since 2009 and have 
increased operating margins over the  
two years – UK Bus achieved a margin  
of 12.4% in 201 1 and North America 
10.0%. In 201 1 UK Coach delivered  
a record profit and a 13.5% margin. UK  
Rail margin rose from 5.3% to 6.3% –  
a very strong performance in this high 
revenue, low capital business. Spain’s 
margin has remained stable, at an industry 
leading 16.4%.
This has been achieved through a clear 
focus on operational performance 
and delivering an efficient cost base. 
With new management teams in North 
America, UK Bus and UK Coach, as well 
as new leadership in UK Rail, we have 
delivered cost efficiency savings, removed 
unprofitable mileage, secured global 
procurement savings and ensured that 
capacity has adapted to meet demand. 
In North America alone, as promised, 
we have delivered US$40 million of cost 
savings over two years.
Delivering organic growth
We have complemented margin 
improvement by increasing organic  
growth. Every division has grown revenue 
in 201 1, either in line with or outperforming 
industry peers. With overall Group 
revenue up 5% year-on-year, UK Bus saw 
passenger revenue up 3%, UK Coach 
grew passenger revenue on the core 
National Express network by 5%, Spain 
grew passenger revenue by 6% and  
North America revenue was 8% higher. 
Fares have been rebalanced – in UK 
Bus, the average passenger yield has 
been improved, yet our West Midlands 
fares remain amongst the lowest for 
comparable conurbations, offering 
excellent value-for-money. UK Coach 
eliminated heavily discounted promotional 
fares in favour of everyday value pricing. 
In its regulated business, ALSA adapted 
fares and services to market conditions. 
Overall, we continue to deliver great value 
to our customers and are focused on 
driving greater volume growth with some 
customers switching from other high cost 
modes of transport, such as rail.
We have seen passenger volume growth in 
response to service improvements in both 
the UK Bus and Coach operations. More 
effective marketing strategies have targeted 
student travel in bus, coach and rail, 
together with commuter travel in coach. 
We are investing heavily in new fleet, having 
spent £132 million across the Group in 
201 1. In UK Bus we will have introduced 
over 250 new buses onto the network 
over a 12-month period, along with 160 
new vehicles introduced to our third-party 
operated UK Coach fleet in 201 1, and 300 
new vehicles in Spain. In North America  
we added over 600 new school buses 
in 201 1 and cascaded over 900 existing 
buses across the fleet, driving better  
capital efficiency. 
Securing targeted expansion
During 201 1 we have begun to secure 
targeted expansion, adding revenue  
across the Group through contract wins 
and bolt-on acquisitions. This leverages  
the Group’s strong market positions  
and proven expertise in winning new 
contracts, to deliver sustainable revenue 
and profit growth. 
The Group has an existing ‘order book’ 
of £3.7 billion in its contract businesses, 
across North American school bus, Spain, 
and UK Rail. This represents over three 
years of contracted and concession-based 
revenues for the Group: six years in Spain, 
two years in North America and one year in 
rail franchising. Delivering a 98% retention 
rate in existing school bus contracts, 
North America also secured 1,000 
new routes in 201 1. The conversion of 
contracts to outsourcing is an increasingly 
important part of North America’s growth, 
reflecting lower capital requirements and 
opportunities to tailor a specific service 
package to the new customer. In 201 1 
we secured ten conversion contracts 
and integrated the Vogel business in 
New Jersey, a bolt-on acquisition that 
consolidated our position and efficiencies 
in the local market.
In Spain, ALSA won the tender to operate 
the Madrid City Tour service and added  
a further concession in Agadir. Two  
small acquisitions were made, creating  
a foothold in a new territory, Navarre, and 
adding a further concession in the south  
of Spain. Contracts and opportunities  
such as these provide profitable revenue 
growth to complement and enhance the 
core transport operations at ALSA.

ALSA
Carlos Chiesa works as a painter 
and coachbuilder in ALSA’s 
central depot in Madrid. Both 
jobs can pose health hazards. 
Ever since he joined ALSA in 1991, 
Carlos has been aware of the 
importance of safety in his daily 
routine, and has always made 
sure that he uses the proper 
safety equipment. As a result  
he has never had an accident.
4 Growth through larger scale acquisition is 
also considered against specific criteria –  
in the same or similar modes of transport, 
in overlapping geographies, where scale 
gives immediate synergies and only 
where clear financial criteria will be met. 
In September 201 1 we announced the 
acquisition of Petermann, a school bus 
business in the United States that met 
these criteria. With a strong reputation 
for customer service, a very experienced 
management team, annual revenue 
of around US$150 million and annual 
operating profit of US$13.5 million, 
Petermann is a high quality business. 
Strong synergies will complement the 
geographic coverage it adds to our 
Durham bus operation, whilst adding 
a contract in our targeted para-transit 
market. The acquisition is expected to 
complete during the first half of the year.
Looking forward –  
key investment areas
Our vision, set out at the start of 201 1, is  
to earn the lifetime loyalty of our customers 
by consistently delivering frequent, high 
performing public transport services 
which offer excellent value. During the last 
12 months, we have strengthened our core 
values to deliver this vision. In addition  
to improving the social, environmental  
and economic conditions of the 
communities in which we operate, these 
values will deliver three differentiating 
areas for National Express – safety 
leadership, customer service and people 
development, particularly in commercial 
development expertise.
Safety
More than anything else, we value the 
safety of our customers and employees. 
Last year we launched our Driving Out 
Harm programme across the Group, a 
comprehensive five year plan to upgrade 
our entire safety management approach. 
We have adopted 12 global safety 
standards, including setting enhanced 
requirements for vehicle safety; all senior 
managers have completed formal safety 
training, and comprehensive driver 
safety management has retrained poorly 
performing drivers and implemented 
defensive driving techniques. With 
significant improvement in our Marrakesh 
operation, and UK Bus and Coach leading 
the industry in low accident rates, we are 
targeting a 70% reduction in lost time 
injuries and a 50% reduction in vehicle 
accidents over five years.
Customers
We place customers at the heart of 
our business and our goal is to be the 
customer service leader in the mass 
transport sector. With a new Group 
Customer Service Director in place, we  
are investing in our front line station staff, 
our contact centres and our drivers. In 
2012 we have launched ‘Master Drivers’ ,  
a programme embedding advanced 
driving skills. These factors will help 
differentiate National Express in delivering 
our customer experience. 
People
Our employees are core to enabling 
National Express to consistently deliver 
high performing services of which we 
can be proud. With a highly experienced 
Executive team established in 2010, this 
year saw the introduction of global HR 
standards, talent development and a new 
performance management scheme with 
clearer accountabilities, responsibilities and 
pay for performance. We are significantly 
strengthening employee engagement, 
education and capability development, 
and innovation. We are investing to drive 
our commercial business development 
capability – in rail, where we have 
assembled a small team of experienced 
industry experts to secure new profitable 
franchises; in North America, where we 
will drive new transit opportunities; and in 
Continental Europe, in selected bus and 
coach markets.
Developing mass transport markets
We believe public transport has a positive 
future. Social, environmental and economic 
trends will mean its core strengths 
will increasingly become competitive 
advantages. We believe public transport  
is distinguished by four crucial Cs:
•	 cost: at a time when household  
budgets are increasingly pressured,  
the value offered by public transport  
is increasingly attractive;
•	 convenience: in addition to its 
traditional strengths, the ability to 
work on the move – increasingly using 
smartphone and similar technology 
– builds on the convenience public 
transport offers;
•	 congestion: congestion will continue 
to pose a challenge to policymakers 
and the public for years to come, 
strengthening the case for investment  
in public transport; and
Our vision 
To earn the lifetime 
loyalty of our customers  
by consistently 
delivering frequent, 
high performing public 
transport services which 
offer excellent value 
Our values 
Safety
More than anything else, 
we value the safety of our 
customers, employees and the 
public generally.
Customers 
We will place customers at 
the heart of our business. 
Nobody will try harder for our 
customers than we do. 
People 
Enabling all our people to  
reach their full potential and to 
give their best as individuals 
and in teams.
Community 
We will advance the social, 
environmental and economic 
conditions in the communities 
where we operate.

•	 carbon: public transport already has a 
significant carbon advantage over private 
and air transport, with the adoption of 
new technologies further reducing its 
carbon footprint.
Strength of the National  
Express portfolio 
National Express is now well positioned for 
the future, as a distinctive mass transport 
contractor. Its combination of geographic 
presence and passenger transportation 
expertise will deliver long-term, sustainable 
growth in markets with good potential.  
Our portfolio of perpetuity owned 
businesses – UK Bus and Coach –  
and strong contract operations – North 
America, Spain and UK Rail – provides 
an excellent platform for future value 
generation. This platform reflects:
•	 the strength of our core existing bus 
and coach businesses – a unique, 
geographically diversified group with  
a balanced requirement for capital;
•	 demonstrable resilience in business 
performance despite the economic 
challenges – significantly less  
uncertainty in Spain proven by results 
in both businesses, growth in North 
America and plans in place to mitigate 
UK austerity;
•	 flexibility to adjust to stretched public  
and consumer budgets, whilst providing 
a core public service;
•	 rail opportunities, with limited downside 
in existing profits and cash flows 
compared with peers;
•	 a stable financial structure – substantial, 
long-term, committed debt funding, 
primarily sourced from non-bank markets;
•	 substantial ‘self-help’ opportunities 
to drive further margin improvement, 
including in UK Bus and North America;
•	 market leading positions offering good 
organic growth potential; and
•	 significant market opportunities 
– mandated Continental Europe 
deregulation; US development into 
transit and para-transit, leveraging 
existing strong capabilities and 
management experience.
Next steps in delivering the strategy
The next phase of the Group’s strategy will 
see implementation of the following steps:
•	 delivering operational excellence in our 
existing businesses, to drive continued 
margin progress;
•	 securing organic growth opportunities 
in existing businesses; and
•	 developing new contract opportunities  
in targeted markets.
Delivering operational excellence  
in our existing businesses
We will continue to focus on opportunities 
to enhance margins and profitability in 
the four core bus and coach divisions. 
Leveraging our international portfolio 
and scale, procurement savings, worth 
over £12 million year-on-year in 201 1, 
will continue to bring benefits. In UK 
Bus we are targeting to further increase 
margin, through improved costs, depot 
improvements and growth. In North 
American school bus, already the industry 
leader in margin, further improvements 
will be delivered through improved 
maintenance schemes and the use of 
technology; GPS is already delivering 
better control of wage and fuel costs. 
Spain and UK Coach are focused on 
minimising the impact on 2012 margins of 
concession renewal and subsidy reduction 
respectively. Each business will continue to 
deliver cost savings and productivity gains, 
while keeping networks optimised. 
Securing organic growth opportunities 
Organic growth is a key target for each 
business. Austerity will continue to drive 
value services such as bus and coach.  
In North America, the school bus business 
presents significant opportunities to 
maintain our recent rate of winning market 
share, converting outsource tenders and 
selective market consolidation. The school 
bus market of 530,000 vehicles remains 
little over one third outsourced and there 
are 4,000 participants in the market,  
few of whom have the resources to 
compete nationally.
ALSA will continue to explore domestic 
market opportunities in concession and 
contract bids, together with selected 
consolidation opportunities. Morocco 
remains an exciting market as other major 
cities look to modernise their urban bus 
operations, following ALSA’s success in 
Marrakesh and Agadir. UK Coach will 
continue to exploit the growth potential

ticket pricing.
We are also investing in technology that will 
make it easier for our customers to access 
our services and so increase travel. The 
UK Coach business now has real-time 
fleet location data which is being used to 
improve customer information and vehicle 
routing. UK Bus is trialling smart card 
technology across its fleet to improve  
ease of customer use. 
Developing new contract opportunities 
in targeted markets
The Group is building strong commercial 
development teams to develop a small 
number of target markets. The Group has 
identified selected markets in Europe and 
North America representing £60 billion of 
annual addressable revenue. The majority 
of those opportunities are in the contract 
transport market, where the Group can 
utilise and further develop its contract 
bidding and concession management 
capabilities. We will focus on new markets 
in North America and deregulating markets 
in Continental Europe:
•	 in North America we now have 
access to profitable additional markets, 
including transit and para-transit. This is 
a US$5 billion market, with low capital 
requirements complementary to the 
contract expertise we have in school 
bus. The senior citizen population in the 
US is expected to double by 2040, with 
disabled ridership also increasing. With 
the Petermann acquisition, our plans 
are well developed to target a greater 
presence in this market;
•	 in Continental Europe we are well 
placed to meet the needs of a market 
deregulating under EU rules. As Europe’s 
leading scheduled coach operator, 
we will seek to leverage our proven 
skills and capability, along with the 
National Express, ALSA and Eurolines 
brands. We will also explore bus and 
rail opportunities that meet our rigorous 
investment criteria; and
•	 in Rail we retain our expertise and 
knowledge alongside our industry-
leading c2c franchise, winner of 
‘Suburban and Metro Operator’ for the 
last two years. Franchises have attractive 
characteristics, providing a stable cash 
flow and strong capital return, as long 
as the risk is acceptable. We have 
assembled a team of experienced rail 
professionals to lead our work. We have 
already secured four star accreditation 
under the European Foundation 
for Quality Management (EFQM) 
assessment for c2c. We are seeking to 
pre-qualify in the current round of UK rail 
franchise tenders, with around £6 billion 
of revenue to be tendered over the next 
four years.
Outlook for 2012
We operate in markets that combine 
to offer long-term growth, strong cash 
generation and scope to generate good 
returns for shareholders through dividends, 
capital return and reinvestment for growth. 
Our core business of international bus  
and coach services is robust, sustainable 
and defensible. 
A discounted travel scheme alongside the 
introduction of new services in UK Coach, 
investment to stimulate passenger growth 
in UK Bus, and the integration of targeted 
acquisition opportunities are all expected 
to drive profitability. This will help to mitigate 
the reduction in concession income in 
UK Coach and a lower rail profit, following 
the handover of the East Anglia franchise. 
ALSA has an excellent track record of 
contract retention and is well positioned 
to renew upcoming intercity concessions 
over the next 18 months, and to develop 
new opportunities in both Spain and 
Morocco. In North America we expect 
economic constraints to continue to lead 
school boards towards outsourcing, whilst 
the integration of the Petermann acquisition  
will drive profit growth and synergies. 
Finally, future participation in UK Rail  
may offer additional upside opportunity  
for the Group.
Following a strong end to 201 1, we expect 
passenger revenue to continue to grow 
in each of our bus and coach divisions. 
In 2012, as austerity measures, fuel and 
fare increases make passenger travel by 
other modes relatively more expensive, 
National Express provides attractive, value 
for money alternatives. We believe that 
our portfolio of businesses will provide 
sustainable earnings growth, continued 
cash generation and exciting opportunities 
for growth in selected markets in the 
medium term.

Business model
ALSA is the largest private operator of buses 
and coaches in Spain where public transport 
is seen as an essential public service. Its 
markets are regulated and supported by 
long-term concession agreements provided 
in exchange for public service obligations. 
Concessions are operated exclusively, with 
competition at point of tender. Concessions 
typically run for 10 to 15 years. ALSA ’s 
portfolio provides a balance between:
•	 long distance coach operations, which 
receive no subsidy and take revenue risk 
in return for flexibility over the number 
of services operated and a regulated 
maximum fare; 
•	 regional coach operations which may 
be subsidised by the autonomous 
governments; and 
•	 urban bus operations operated under 
programme contracts with city councils 
and transport consortia. 
Day-to-day competition is primarily 
intermodal; ie rail, low cost airlines  
and the car.
The Group’s operations are carried out by 
our subsidiaries, Durham School Services 
(US) and Stock Transportation (Canada). 
We are the second largest private operator. 
The outsourced (private operator) market 
is only around one third of the total, with 
the remainder being insourced; that is, 
owned and run by the school boards 
themselves. Contracts typically run for 
five years and contract retention is high. 
Once secured, contracts have very low 
revenue risk over the contract life. Scale is 
beneficial – economies can be achieved 
through procurement, centralisation of 
administration and business development. 
Access to capital is key; most new 
contracts require investment in new buses 
and asset utilisation is low, due to the part 
time usage of these specialised vehicles.
National Express West Midlands is the 
market leader in the largest single urban 
network in the UK deregulated market. The 
deregulated model allows for total flexibility 
in both fares and service. The business 
has a high regional market share, with 
strong competition from multiple operators 
on specific routes. Modal competition 
is principally from private cars. Revenue 
and profitability are driven by the scale 
of operations delivering frequent, reliable 
and affordable services across a broad 
network, utilising a high quality fleet. 
‘National Express’ is the national coach 
network operator in the UK, offering 
great value and accessible travel to all. It 
operates the only scheduled national UK 
coach network and the largest in Europe, 
running 500 coaches a day serving over 
1,000 domestic destinations. Built on a 
flexible, outsourced business model, where 
third party providers supply 80% of the 
coaches and responsibility for sales lies 
with the company. With 70% unprompted 
brand recognition, the business benefits 
from its integrated network and scale, 
offering breadth and interconnectivity, 
where competitors offer only point-to-point 
services with limited infrastructure.
National Express has a strong operational 
skills base in UK rail, one of the only 
privatised systems in Europe. The UK rail 
industry comprises franchises awarded 
on an exclusive operation basis to private 
operators. Prices are predominantly 
regulated and costs are substantially fixed 
around track access, rolling stock and 
franchise payments. The Group ran two 
franchises in 201 1, operating as National 
Express East Anglia and c2c, running until 
February 2012 and May 2013 respectively.

Divisional KPIs
We measure our progress against our strategy and goals 
using the following KPIs:
* Local currency.
** Regular passenger services.
12 201 1 was another successful year for 
ALSA, delivering both revenue and profit 
growth. The excellent value offered by our 
urban bus and intercity coach services 
continues to meet the growing needs 
of customers, providing a high quality 
transport service with fares that suit the 
domestic economic conditions. Long-
term concessions, ALSA’s market-leading 
position and a flexible cost base provide 
both a resilient platform and opportunities 
for expansion. Reflecting our confidence  
in the future, we continue to invest in  
fleet renewal and growth in both Spain  
and Morocco.
Overall revenue growth for the division in 
local currency was 3.7%, (4.9% in Sterling 
terms), delivering €635.4 million (2010: 
€612.7m) in total revenue. 3.5% more 
kilometres were operated than in 2010 as 
ALSA increased supply to meet passenger 
demand. Growth remained consistent 
throughout the year, supported by the  
new Agadir contract in Morocco.
Operating profit increased by 3.4% to 
€103.9 million (2010: €100.5m). Operating 
margin was maintained at 16.4%. Growth 
and efficiency in the transport business, 
including a strong performance in 
Morocco, event services and international, 
offset reduced profitability in the peripheral 
non-transport businesses (primarily the 
fuel distribution and motorway service 
businesses, which represent only 8%  
of ALSA’s total revenue).

Business review 
Spain Business review
Spain continued
Cash management continued to be 
strong. A planned increase in working 
capital reflected repayment of deferred 
social security. In addition, in light of public 
funding issues, ALSA has also managed 
outstanding receivables balances carefully 
to ensure timely collection. A key part of 
our business is the provision of contracts 
with various public bodies, primarily urban 
bus operations where we do not take 
demand risk in the operation of routes.  
At the end of 201 1, ALSA’s receivable 
balance from public bodies was €57 .5 
million (2010: €44.6m). This increase 
primarily related to a single customer, with 
which a new legally enforceable payment 
plan was agreed in December 201 1. In 
addition, the national governing party has 
confirmed that all public debts will be paid, 
with the state now providing credit funding 
to public bodies.
Delivering organic growth
The ALSA business provides a stable 
platform of long-term contracts and 
concessions, together with opportunities 
for growth within both Spain and 
Morocco. Both intercity coach and urban 
bus operations delivered revenue and 
passenger growth in 201 1. Revenue 
growth of 6% in intercity services 
reflected gains in both scheduled and 
tourist services, driven by an increase in 
passenger numbers of 1% and increased 
regulated prices. A strong summer period, 
reflecting increased domestic vacationing, 
was followed by continued robust growth 
through the remainder of the year. Growth 
was strong across all geographic areas, 
with particularly strong trends on Madrid 
routes and in Northern Spain. 
The intercity coach business is becoming 
the preferred option for passengers in the 
current economic climate, where public 
subsidies to state-owned rail operators 
have decreased and where airline activity 
on competing routes has reduced. 
Consequently, ALSA has continued its 
investment in new coaches ahead of 
concession renewal later in 2012 and 2013, 
with an average coach fleet age of three 
years on the core network. The business 
is also adding more high quality ‘Supra’ 
services, with better yields, and is investing 
in web-based and mobile technology to 
attract new customers to the network.
The urban bus business grew strongly in 
201 1, driven by expansion in Morocco, 
with a full year benefit from the Agadir 
contract, which started in September 
2010. Moroccan annual revenue now 
exceeds €25 million and further growth 
is planned. Urban kilometres operated in 
Spain remained steady in 201 1. Bus travel 
remains fundamental to mobility in Spanish 
cities and ALSA is well positioned in its 
concessional contracts.

Since 2007, Iván Gozalo has 
worked as a bus driver in the 
Madrid suburb of Torrejón 
de Ardoz. He is good with 
passengers and he knows that 
the addition of new hybrid buses 
to the fleet will improve Torrejón’s 
environment. He thinks this is 
good for the community, good for 
the city and it’s good for Iván too, 
because that is where he lives.

ALSA
No two customers are the same, 
especially on the Madrid City Tour 
bus where Adela Lupascu is a 
stewardess. “Every day I get to meet 
people from all over the world who 
are visiting Spain.” They all have 
different needs, Adela says, but 
making sure they are comfortable 
– and satisfied – is what her job is 
about. “And that is what I enjoy.”
ALSA continues to adjust costs and 
improve operational efficiencies to offset 
inflation. The coach operation is highly 
flexible and increases in demand were  
met in 201 1 by increasing contracting  
with partner operators, allowing resources 
to be optimised. 
Securing targeted expansion
New contracts and bolt on acquisitions 
also contributed towards divisional growth. 
In September, ALSA started operating the 
Madrid City Tour sightseeing bus contract, 
replacing the Madrid Barajas airport 
contract. Other bolt-on additions included 
an extension of the Agadir concession, 
an investment that allows the business 
to reinforce its position in Navarre and 
the Basque country, and an additional 
concession in Southern Spain.
Outlook for the future
Future prospects for the ALSA coach and 
bus operations remain robust as the value 
and quality in the nature of the services 
we provide are well positioned for times of 
economic uncertainty. We are focused on 
revenue growth, contract retention and new 
opportunities, including in Morocco. 
We are targeting growth in the intercity 
business, on existing routes and through 
new tourist services. Coach performance 
is expected to benefit from increased 
occupancy at current fares, arising from 
reduced capacity in low cost airlines on 
overlapping routes and ongoing reduction 
of public funding in rail. We will continue 
to work closely with our urban customers 
to adapt to changing bus needs whilst 
retaining the economic value of our 
contracts. ALSA has the proven capability 
to manage change and new opportunities.
ALSA is focused on securing its concession 
renewals. With a forward revenue order 
book of €3. 1 billion, during 2012 currently 
operated intercity concessions representing 
9% of annual revenue are due for tender, 
alongside other operators’ concessions. 
The framework for national tenders was 
agreed by the Ministry of Transport in 201 1, 
favouring operators who have delivered an 
excellent performance and compliance with 
concession conditions. 
Additional opportunities for growth, utilising 
ALSA’s expertise, scale and reputation, 
will be developed. Morocco will remain 
a focus, with potential for additional city 
contracts, and ALSA will seek to continue 
to build on recent success in tourist 
and new intercity services. In February 
2012, ALSA and Iberia launched an 
integrated ‘Bus & Fly’ programme to 
create intermodal transport from five cities 
connecting through Madrid, a first for the 
international travel industry. Leveraging the 
Group’s international experience, ALSA 
will also support the UK in expanding 
coach operations as markets open across 
Continental Europe, including building on 
the existing successful Eurolines operation.

David Duke 
CEO National Express Corporation:
The North American school bus contract market 
represents an attractive opportunity. Further margin 
improvement remains a continued focus, but the 
exciting challenge is delivering value-enhancing 
growth. I base our approach on the ABC of the industry 
– Acquisitions, Bidding and Conversion – whilst 
ensuring that we remain proactive and responsive  
to our customers and employees.

16 16 Market overview
In 201 1, the North American operations 
delivered strong revenue growth and 
achieved a 10% operating margin. The 
Business Recovery programme was 
completed, with annualised savings of 
US$40 million delivered over the last two 
years. The division is now the industry 
leader in delivering profitability and growth 
in school bus, and is well placed to secure 
further revenue and margin growth. It 
is established as a platform for further 
consolidation in the school bus market – 
with its lower risk, highly contracted  
nature – and expansion into adjacent 
capital-light markets.
Revenue in local currency grew by 8% 
to US$772.2 million (2010: US$712. 1m). 
This was driven by annualisation of bid 
wins in the successful 2010/1 1 season, 
supplemented by further success in the 
201 1/12 season, improved charter income 
and the bolt-on acquisition of Vogel in New 
Jersey, which was acquired at the end 
of 2010. The North American business 
secured both new conversion contracts, 
from school board customers outsourcing 
for the first time, and share shift wins 
of contracts in the already-outsourced 
market, which added over 700 buses  
for the 2010/1 1 school year. Growth from  
new conversion contracts won in 201 1  
was approximately twice that of our 
biggest competitor.
Operating profit increased significantly, by 
35%, to US$76.9 million (2010: US$57 . 1m). 
Operating margin has improved to 10.0%, 
an increase from 8.0% in 2010 and 5.7% in 
2009. This rapid turnaround was executed 
by a new management team through 
growth, cost reduction and investment 
in customer-facing personnel to ensure 
that local delivery and relationships have 
been enhanced. This margin makes the 
operation best-in-class in the industry.
Revenue for North America was £481.0 million 
(2010: £459.8m) and normalised operating profit was 
£47 .9 million (2010: £36.9m). In local currency, revenue 
was US$772.2 million (2010: US$712. 1m) and normalised 
operating profit was US$76.9 million (2010: US$57 . 1m).

Achieving margin improvement
The margin improvement has resulted from 
decisive action to reduce overhead and 
back office costs. In 201 1, an annualised 
saving of US$15 million was delivered, 
completing the target of US$40 million over 
two years. Key savings in 201 1 included 
streamlining of administration through 
greater efficiency in use of our Oracle 
systems investment, reduced maintenance 
costs through better planning and warranty 
work, and facility/procurement savings. 
Operator wage costs were maintained 
in line with the prior year improvement. 
Towards the end of the year, the initial 
benefits of equipping every bus in the 
fleet with GPS began to be realised; 
lower fuel consumption, optimised route 
scheduling and improved invoicing benefits 
are all targeted. This will help drive further 
improvements in margin. 
Alongside the improved operating margin, 
we also made significant progress in 
improving the division’s operating profit 
return on net tangible assets to 16.0% 
(2010: 13. 1%) in what is a traditionally 
capital intensive business. This 
improvement was achieved by working 
with customers to cascade existing buses 
both to new contracts and to replace 
end-of-life vehicles, whilst evaluating 
possible fleet life extension. During 201 1, 
over 900 buses were cascaded within 
the fleet. Additionally, the spare bus 
ratio continued to improve, to 12.2% 
(2010: 18.4%). Overall, this programme 
is estimated to have reduced capital 
investment in 201 1 by US$66 million.
Delivering organic growth
Excellent revenue growth in 201 1 was 
achieved through our ‘ABC’ plan: 
•	 acquisition included a 200 bus ‘bolt-
on’ in New Jersey, leveraging existing 
depot scale and synergy (completed 
31 December 2010);
•	 bids secured over 400 new routes  
from competitors through better service 
and pricing; and
•	 conversions saw over 600 new routes 
outsourced to us by 10 school boards 
for the first time. New conversion 
opportunities are a key target for us as 
we grow our school bus business. 
Our expanded business development 
team has developed a compelling case 
based upon a superior service offering  
and successful mobilisation model which 
offers customers significant cost savings, 
often including the removal of the need  
for upfront capital investment.
Overall we added over 600 new buses 
to our routes for the 201 1/12 school year, 
whilst protecting margins and achieving 
an industry-leading 98% retention rate on 
existing contracts. In addition, our initiative 
to drive higher margin charter revenues 
was successful, delivering a 30% increase 
in this revenue in 201 1, with scope for 
further increases in the future.

Kathy appreciates the benefits of 
the Zonar system. The pre-trip and 
tracking information it provides 
not only helps reduce costs to 
the customer, but also helps our 
supervisors to know where our 
buses are and how fast they are 
going. This means they can tell 
parents when their bus is due. If 
a bus breaks down in service, our 
technician can log into it and check 
the diagnostics on the bus before 
going to the scene. The system 
also identifies trends in defects, 
improving our reliability.

Growth from new 
conversion contracts 
won in 2011 was 
approximately twice 
that of our biggest 
competitor.
Securing targeted expansion
The North America mass transport market 
offers considerable scope for expansion. 
In September 201 1 we announced the 
acquisition of Petermann Partners Inc., 
for US$200 million, consolidating our 
number two position in the school bus 
market. In its fiscal year ending 30 June 
201 1, Petermann generated revenue of 
US$149.9 million, EBITDA of US$29.3 
million and operating profit of US$13.5 
million. We are in advanced discussions 
with regulators regarding competition 
approval and we expect to be in a position 
to close this transaction in the first half 
of 2012. Petermann has an excellent 
portfolio of customers and an experienced 
management team, adding new 
geographic reach to National Express  
to deliver further growth from a quality 
earnings base. The acquisition is expected 
to be earnings enhancing in its first full year, 
with annual synergies of US$7 million by 
the second year. 
The Petermann acquisition provides 
entry into the para-transit and transit 
markets in North America through an 
existing contract presence. This market 
provides free and subsidised transport to 
senior citizens and disabled people and 
is estimated to be worth US$5 billion per 
annum. Rapid growth in these eligible 
populations, coupled with low capital 
investment requirements and extensive 
previous experience of the market by our 
management, makes this an attractive 
opportunity to leverage our existing 
capabilities in North America. 
Outlook for the future
With a forward revenue order book of 
US$1.3 billion and improved capital 
disciplines evident in the school bus 
market, we will continue selectively to 
target market share addition and a strong 
pipeline of conversion opportunities, 
whilst achieving high contract retention. 
We expect funding pressures on school 
boards to continue to drive the conversion 
market, reflected in the growing number 
of conversion contracts we have won in 
the last three years: one in 2009, three in 
2010 and ten in 201 1. The business will 
focus on improving contract management 
and operational efficiency, driving further 
improvements in margin and capital return. 
We also expect to expand our presence 
in the para-transit market over the coming 
years, building a second leg to our 
successful North American operation.

20 UK Bus delivered its second successful 
year of margin recovery, moving ahead 
of industry average margin performance. 
Revenue growth was robust, with a return 
to passenger growth in the final weeks 
of 201 1. With its focus on operational 
control, improved marketing, new services 
and investment for customers, UK Bus 
delivered a 15% increase in profit year-on-
year and is well placed to continue  
to grow returns as an efficient, effective  
bus operator.
Total revenue for the UK Bus business 
grew by 2.2% to £263.5 million from £257 .8 
million in 2010. Like-for-like passenger 
revenue at constant mileage grew 6%, 
driven by a strong increase in passenger 
revenue of 4.3%, above the industry 
average. This was achieved despite the 
West Midlands economy remaining weak. 
Concession income for senior citizen travel 
was slightly lower year-on-year, as austerity 
measures impacted public funding.

Commercial revenue 4%
Mileage reduction 2%

Operating profit increased to £32.7 
million (2010: £28.3m). Operating margin 
increased by 140 basis points to 12.4% for 
the division, with the core West Midlands 
bus operations achieving over 13% 
operating margin. Our Dundee operation 
also increased its margin and there was 
further good progress at the Midland Metro 
tram service, which was profitable in the 
year, having broken even for the first time 
in 2010.

UK Bus continued
Delivering organic growth
Growth of over 4% in commercial revenue 
was driven by an 1 1% rise in passenger 
yield as fares were restructured. National 
Express continues to offer some of the 
most competitive fares of the major 
UK conurbations. Passenger volumes 
decreased by 7%, partly reflecting an 
overall mileage reduction of 2%. We 
have targeted reductions in some off-
peak services, but increased services to 
meet additional demand elsewhere; for 
example, re-timetabling on the inner circle 
in Birmingham has driven 15% passenger 
growth year on year, along with a 50% 
reduction in waiting times. Revenue 
protection teams have successfully 
supported revenue uplift and we will be 
doubling the size of that team in 2012. 
Encouragingly, the last few weeks of 201 1 
showed overall passenger journey growth. 
We increased our investment in promoting 
the benefits of bus travel in the West 
Midlands and Dundee. We are rolling 
out 250 new vehicles across a 12 month 
period, which is expected to boost 
ridership. 18 green hybrid buses were 
introduced onto core city centre routes 
in Birmingham in December, with early 
favourable customer feedback. Anti-social 
behaviour is being targeted through new 
cleaning, anti-window etching and revenue 
protection measures. An increase in 
targeted marketing campaigns included a 
‘Love Your Bus’ promotion, partnerships 
with local schools and colleges to 
promote student travelcards, ‘grandkids 
for a quid’ and new short hop £1 fares in 
Birmingham and Coventry city centres. 
Smarter marketing is raising awareness 
and increased demand is being generated 
through online and telesales teams, 
including providing free tickets to home 
movers and discounted family tickets. 
We are embedding operational excellence 
across the UK Bus business. The focus 
is to deliver an efficient, on-time bus 
operation at lowest cost to passengers. 
We have introduced improvements to 
our ongoing driver training programme, 
with industry-leading accreditation and 
partnerships based at our in-house 
college in Walsall. This is improving driving 
standards and customer service. Our 
engineering operations have adopted ‘lean’ 
principles, which have reduced off-road 
time and increased fleet reliability.

“Talking to Year 6 (10-11 year-olds) 
is particularly important – giving 
them reassurance before they start 
travelling to secondary school by 
bus. We explain what they need to 
do to keep safe and that they should 
trust the driver to help them.” 
Achieving margin improvement
Supporting revenue growth initiatives, 201 1 
saw completion of our two-year turnaround 
programme, driving margin recovery to 
above current industry average levels. 
Cost efficiencies were delivered across 
engineering, procurement and the 
overhead cost base. We are leveraging 
the Group’s procurement scale, with 
£1.5 million of savings delivered in 
UK Bus in 201 1. On-board telemetry 
monitors driving style and is improving 
fuel consumption. In addition, in 201 1 
our Driving Out Harm safety programme 
combined with telemetry and CCTV video 
to reduce insurance claims by £1.9 million.
Following publication of the Competition 
Commission’s final report into the bus 
industry in December 201 1, we do not 
anticipate any significant impacts on our 
business but will look at bus contract 
opportunities to access further growth.
Outlook for the future
Whilst the turnaround of the UK Bus 
business is complete, improving 
operational excellence is an ongoing 
programme. In 2012 we will continue to 
focus on driving revenue growth and cost 
efficiency. This will partially mitigate the 
withdrawal by the UK Government of £5 
million of annual fuel duty rebate from April. 
Thereafter, we will seek to improve the 
margin towards industry leading levels. 
Alongside new vehicles, we are also 
investing in on-bus technology. Smartcard 
readers have been installed across our 
entire fleet which will be used to make bus 
travel easier for all passengers and grow 
revenue through more targeted marketing. 
We aim to have 100% of our buses 
equipped with real-time service information 
in 2012. We are investing in advanced 
driver accreditation alongside customer 
service development, to make National 
Express the preferred operator for  
our passengers. 
With its focus on 
operational control, 
improved marketing, new 
services and investment 
for customers, UK Bus 
delivered a 15% increase 
in profit year-on-year.

* Core network.
24 In 201 1 the UK Coach business reported 
a record profit, with its new management 
team re-establishing the National Express 
coach service as the pre-eminent value 
leader in long distance travel. These 
strong results were delivered through an 
overhaul of the core network and with a 
focus on delivering great customer service, 
implementing network investments in 
160 new coaches, a 24/7 contact centre 
and the new Coachway station at Milton 
Keynes. The brand continues to see further 
opportunity in austerity, meeting the needs 
of cash-strapped consumers against a 
background of increasing rail fares.
Underlying revenue in the core National 
Express network grew by over 5%. Overall 
UK Coach revenue increased 3.5% to 
£259. 1 million (2010: £250.3m). Core 
network yield rose 4% as pricing shifted 
away from heavily discounted promotional 
fares to offering simple, consistent, 
everyday value. Revenue in each of the four 
National Express coach segments (Long 
haul, Short haul, Regional and Airports) 
grew during the year. 
Operating profit increased to £34.9 million, 
an increase of 9. 1% (2010: £32.0m). 
Operating margin was 13.5%, a 70 basis 
point increase (2010: 12.8%). This reflected 
both revenue growth and the flexibility of 
the business model, where 80% of coach 
service operation is outsourced, providing 
the opportunity to adjust to changes 
in demand. We continue to see strong 
interest from private operators to partner  
in our service delivery.

increased by 1% in 201 1, flexing supply to 
meet demand. Group-wide procurement 
initiatives added further savings, including 
leveraging our scale in fleet sourcing for 
partner operators which saw 160 new 
coaches introduced to the network. Use of 
technology continues to drive down cost; 
our fleet is equipped with both ‘Traffilog’ 
monitoring and real-time positioning 
systems. This is already being used to 
monitor driving style, route timings and 
scheduling: like-for-like fuel consumption 
was reduced by 3% in the year, passenger

underway to deliver up-to-the-minute 
schedule updates to customers via station 
information and mobile applications.

Delivering organic growth
Our growth strategy is focused on 
improving customer service and simplifying 
fares; this has already delivered growth 
in each of the core coach segments. The 
move away from heavily discounted fare 
promotions has improved overall yield and 
attracted passengers who value a stable, 
competitive fare available even on the day 
of travel. Overall passenger journeys in the 
core business increased by 1% in 201 1 
with airports and regional routes showing 
the highest rates of growth.
We have also expanded our network, 
adding services and frequencies to reflect 
improved passenger demand data by 
segment and route. New routes from 
London and the South Coast direct to 
Gatwick Airport, and also Ipswich to 
Heathrow Airport, proved popular. Added 
frequencies from Norwich, Glasgow 
and Cardiff to London have seen market 
growth. Recent additions have included 
new Liverpool/Manchester/Leeds services 
and we continue to see a growth in daily 
commuter traffic diverting from high-priced 
rail services.
Building on our investment, customer 
satisfaction rose to 84% (2010: 76%). 90% 
of our passengers would recommend the 
brand. Our contact centre is now open 24 
hours a day, selling tickets and supporting 
customers whenever they are travelling. 
An extensive programme of training and 
management tools will continue to improve 
the customer experience.
Both Eurolines and The Kings Ferry grew 
in 201 1. Eurolines added nearly 60,000 
passengers, with growth on the London/
Paris and Amsterdam routes, and the 
introduction of a Brussels service. Contract 
business fell year-on-year, following one-off 
work in 2010 for Airlinks and reduced rail 
replacement activity.

travel, which is generally under-penetrated. 
Eurolines highlights the opportunities 
offered by the value of international coach 
services in difficult economic times for 
consumers. Leveraging our position 
as Europe’s largest scheduled coach 
operator, we will seek to develop new 
opportunities in Europe and are investing  
in business development to deliver  
future growth.
Outlook for the future
We will continue to make underlying 
progress in the UK Coach business 
during 2012 but we face a significant 
headwind from the withdrawal from 
November 201 1 of the £15 million annual 
senior citizen concession. This will be 
partly mitigated through our new Senior 
Citizens Coach card. Continued network 
improvement, flexible pricing, leveraging 
of technology and improvements in our 
third-party operator partnerships to drive 
better customer service will help grow 
revenue and drive cost efficiency. The 
London Olympics will also present specific 
opportunities; for example, The Kings 
Ferry has secured the contract to provide 
transportation for the Metropolitan Police 
during the Games.
The outlook for longer term growth remains 
encouraging. We expect the coach 
business to benefit from above-inflation 
increases in rail fares and higher costs 
of private motoring. The division’s strong 
market position, iconic brand and value 
proposition make the business uniquely 
placed to grow in the medium term, in  
the UK and elsewhere. 
Our strategy is focused 
on improving customer 
service and simplifying 
fares. This has already 
delivered growth.

28 In 201 1 the UK Rail division reported 
strong revenue growth and a significant 
increase in profitability. As the leading 
rail operator in the sector, the divisional 
profit margin was 6.3% and operational 
performance exceptional – c2c is the UK’s 
top performing rail franchise with a record-
breaking annual punctuality figure of 
96.9%, in the year to 4 February 2012. With 
the handover of the East Anglia franchise 
successfully completed in February 2012, 
we are focused on delivering further 
improvements at c2c and establishing the 
future potential value that rail may offer in 
the next franchising round.
Revenue in UK Rail rose to £688.3 million 
in 201 1, an increase of 8.0% over the prior 
year (2010: £637 .5m). National Express 
East Anglia (NXEA) successfully extended 
its franchise from the Department for 
Transport (DfT) from October 201 1 to 
February 2012, whilst c2c secured a two 
year extension to May 2013 on a profit 
share basis. Strong revenue growth saw 
operating profit increase by 28% to £43.4 
million (2010: £33.8m). Operating margin 
increased by 100 basis points to 6.3% 
(2010: 5.3%).

UK Rail continued
Achieving margin improvement and 
delivering organic growth
With their exposure to the relatively robust 
economies of London and the South East, 
both franchises saw good passenger 
growth throughout the year of 5%. 
Extension of the London-based Oystercard 
system drove strong passenger growth, 
through ease-of-use, albeit at lower yield. 
Elsewhere, growth in suburban travel more 
than offset weak volumes on the Stansted 
Express service, which reflected reduced 
volume in low-cost air travel.
NXEA successfully completed 
implementation of its £185 million DfT-
funded capacity upgrade programme. 
Adding 1 1,000 peak-time seats into 
Liverpool Street and delivering 30  
new 379 Electrostar trains to the network 
on time and on budget, the business 
received all its project milestone  
payments, whilst significantly improving  
the customer experience. 
c2c successfully implemented a new 
timetable, providing additional stops at 
West Ham to provide greater transport 
connectivity. c2c has won or been 
shortlisted for eight awards in 201 1, 
underlining its industry-leading position.

Outlook for the future
Operation of the NXEA franchise came 
to an end on 5 February 2012, with the 
franchise successfully handed over to the 
new operator. As is usual for commuter-
orientated franchises, a cash outflow of 
approximately £80 million will occur in 
2012, primarily related to prepaid customer 
season ticket monies that are transferred  
to the new operator.
The business is focused on the continued 
successful operation of the c2c franchise 
and on securing future rail franchises if the 
terms of the new bidding process prove 
attractive for the Group over the long-term. 
c2c has recently announced an innovative 
alliance with Network Rail, which builds  
on its existing joint signalling and operating 
control partnership. The alliance will 
deliver cost savings to government and 
ultimately passengers through better 
planning and implementation of projects, 
better managed stations and further 
improvements in train punctuality. 
The Group has also invested in additional 
resource to evaluate, bid and operate 
future UK rail franchises. Retaining a core 
team of experienced rail experts, National 
Express has submitted pre-qualification 
bids for the future Essex Thameside (c2c), 
Great Western and Thameslink services. 
This has been supported by c2c recently 
being awarded four stars in the British 
Quality Foundation’s Recognised for 
Excellence (R4E) programme assessed 
against the European Foundation  
for Quality Management model. 
Whilst National Express has a successful 
platform for future value creation built 
on its four international bus and coach 
businesses, we believe that the potential 
earnings and cash generation from future 
rail franchises could be a valuable addition 
to our portfolio, whilst supporting access to  
other global rail opportunities. Participation 
will, however, depend on the potential 
returns and risks of the future franchises 
being acceptable.
c2c is the UK’s top 
performing rail franchise 
with a record-breaking 
annual punctuality figure 
of 96.9%.

Continued improvement
The Group has delivered a strong performance  
in 201 1, recording a record statutory profit before tax  
and amortisation of £180.2 million.
Four of our five divisions 
are now at industry-
leading margins, with 
scope for further progress 
through a relentless focus 
on operational efficiency, 
combined with delivering 
high margin organic 
growth. 
Revenue
Group revenue in 201 1 was £2,238.0 
million, an increase of 5.3% from £2, 125.9 
million in 2010. Revenue growth in every 
division was primarily driven by yield 
improvement, on a contractual/regulated 
basis as in North America, ALSA and UK 
Rail, and through fare pricing in UK Bus 
and UK Coach. 
Operating profit
Group normalised operating profit 
increased by over 10% to £225.2 million, 
from £204.2 million in 2010. 201 1 saw 
completion of the Group’s two-year 
turnaround programme. Over this period, 
cost reduction programmes have reduced 
overhead and back office costs, improved 
driver and engineering efficiencies, and 
delivered substantial savings by leveraging 
the Group’s global procurement scale. 
Group normalised operating margin 
increased in 201 1 by 50 basis points 
to 10. 1% (2010: 9.6%). Four of our five 
divisions are now at industry-leading 
margins, with scope for further progress 
through a relentless focus on operational 
efficiency, combined with delivering high 
margin organic growth. 
The principal areas that contributed to this 
increase in profitability were:
•	 profitable organic growth adding £39 
million, driven by yield and passenger 
journey growth and the addition of new 
contracts in North America and Spain; 
and
•	 cost reduction programmes focusing on: 
 – procurement savings of £12 million 
across the Group, including vehicle 
parts, telecoms and IT ;
 – insurance savings of £3 million, 
reflecting safety improvement led by 
the Driving Out Harm programme;  
and
 – targeted cost efficiencies savings of 
£21 million, mainly in overhead costs.

These benefits were partially offset by:
•	 investment in business development 
resource to expand into new businesses 
and markets, together with investment in 
talent and people development, together 
adding £3 million;
•	 project costs of £9 million (primarily 
settlement of a working time claim in the 
USA, professional and legal fees relating 
to the strategic and Board debate 
ahead of the 201 1 AGM, Competition 
Commission project costs and 
pre-acquisition costs);
•	 fuel costs rising by £1 million, with higher 
hedged prices;
•	 depreciation increasing by £6 million, 
reflecting increased investment in vehicles 
in North America and Spain; and
•	 general cost base inflation of 3% adding 
£43 million.
Normalised result
Net finance costs were £46.4 million 
(2010: £44.0m), the increase from the 
previous year reflecting a full year of higher 
fixed interest rates on the 2010 bonds. 
Profit before tax increased by 12% to 
£180.2 million (2010: £160.5m). 
The tax charge was £41.5 million (2010: 
£39.2m), an effective tax rate (ETR) of 
23.0% (2010: 24.4%). Profit for the year  
was £138.7 million (2010: £121.3m),  
giving a basic EPS increase of 14.4%  
to 27 .0 pence (2010: 23.6p). 
Dividends
EPS estimated on non-rail earnings only 
(that is, excluding the after-tax UK Rail profit 
and benefit to interest of rail season ticket 
monies) was 20.3 pence (2010: 17 .9p). 
With a paid interim dividend of 3 pence 
per share and a proposed final dividend 
of 6.5 pence, the total dividend for 201 1 of 
9.5 pence (2010: 6p) is covered 2. 1 times 
(2010: 3.0x) by non-rail earnings and 2.8 
times (2010: 3.9x) by total earnings. The 
proposed dividend record and payment 
dates are 27 April and 18 May respectively.
Statutory profit
Group statutory profit before tax increased 
threefold to £129.4 million (2010: £40.2m). 
The Group incurred no exceptional costs, 
maximising the benefit to shareholders 
of profit growth. This reflects significant 
progress delivered in 2010 to reduce  
or eliminate legacy risks, including resolution 
of outstanding UK tax issues with HMRC, 
termination of the Group’s onerous contract 
for Eurostar operations and reduced future 
exposure to UK pension schemes.
Intangible asset amortisation (relating 
principally to the value of the Group’s 
concessions and contracts in Spain and 
North America) reduced to £50.8 million 
(2010: £57 . 1m). Exceptional charges were 
£nil (2010: £63.2m). Statutory profit for the 
year was £102.6 million (2010: £62.3m). 
Diluted EPS was 19.8 pence (2010: 12.0p).
Cash management
National Express continues to focus 
on cash generation as a key driver of 
long-term shareholder value. With the 
Group turnaround now complete, cash 
application has been aligned to our 
strategic objectives – investment in organic 
growth, acquisitions and a sustainable 
dividend payout.

Operating cash flow
Group operating cash flow in 201 1 was 
£159.8 million (2010: £221.7m), reflecting 
reinvestment of higher profits in fleet 
renewal. Operating cash conversion  
in 201 1 was 71% (2010: 109%). 
An increase in working capital of £52.5 
million (2010: inflow £14.3m) was primarily 
driven by a £35 million increase in Spain. 
Of this, £18 million related to settlement of 
deferred social security, together with an 
increase in the receivables balance, due 
to revenue growth and slower payment, 
the latter principally from one public body, 
with whom a repayment schedule has 
been agreed. All receivables are closely 
managed and legally documented. 
The Spanish governing party recently 
confirmed that public body debts would 
be fully repaid. Ongoing pension deficit 
payments in the UK totalled £9.7 million.
Maintenance capital expenditure increased 
by £22.5 million to £1 10.2 million (2010: 
£87 .7m), 104% of depreciation (2010: 88%), 
with spend primarily in the North America, 
ALSA and UK Bus divisions in fleet and 
real-time information technology. This level 
of expenditure is planned to be sustained 
over the next few years as a key driver of 
passenger growth. The average age of the 
Group’s fleet reduced in 201 1 to 5.8 years 
(2010: 6. 1 years). 
Free cash flow
Free cash flow in 201 1 increased to £84.4 
million (2010: £83.7m). Exceptional cash 
payments reduced significantly in 201 1 with 
no in-year expense charge; cash payments 
of £22.0 million (2010: £86.7m) relate to final 
payments for exit from the East Coast rail 
franchise in 2009, redundancy and project 
costs provided in 2010, and the termination 
of an onerous contract between the Group 
and the Eurostar operator, LCR.
Net interest payments were £44.6 million 
(2010: £42.7m) and cash tax remained 
broadly unchanged at £8.4 million (2010: 
£8.6m), well below the Group’s ETR due  
to tax amortisation of acquisition goodwill 
in Spain and tax losses in North America.

34 National Express 
continues to focus on 
cash generation as a 
key driver of long-term 
shareholder value.
Net funds flow
A strong focus on cash generation allows 
the Group to allocate capital to growth, 
acquisition and dividends, whilst keeping 
debt levels within our gearing policy. A 
progressive dividend is well covered by 
non-rail earnings whilst future surplus 
capital will be invested in value-generating 
growth and acquisition projects, or 
returned to shareholders.
In 201 1, £35.6 million was invested in 
organic growth capital (2010: £33.9m) 
– £23 million in North America, to fund 
fleet investment in new share gain and 
conversion contracts, and £9 million in 
ALSA to fund growth in Morocco and  
the new Madrid Tour service.
The Group invested £7 .6 million (2010: 
£2.6m) in acquisitions in North American 
school bus and in Spain. It resumed 
dividend payments in 201 1. Group net 
funds flow in 201 1 was an outflow of 
£23.3 million (2010: inflow £47 .5m).
Group net debt at 31 December 201 1  
was £633.7 million (2010: £610.4m).
Capital allocation and returns
National Express has a portfolio of 
businesses that provide a blend of 
opportunities for sustainable growth, 
profitability and cash generation. The 
Group’s strategy is designed to use the 
funds at its disposal to make investment 
decisions that will result in long-term 
generation of shareholder value. The 
Group uses pre-tax return on capital 
employed (ROCE) as a core KPI to decide 
upon and measure the delivery of strategic 
new investment. Internal capital allocation 
decisions are made with a 12% pre-tax 
return on capital hurdle rate, based on an 
estimated post-tax weighted average cost 
of capital of 8%. In 201 1 Group ROCE 
increased to 14. 1% (2010: 13.2%), with 
strong incremental returns in Spain and 
North America, the latter supported by 
initiatives to improve fleet utilisation. The 
Group is targeting a 15% pre-tax return on 
capital in the medium term (subject to the 
proportion of rail business).
Treasury management
The Group has a strong funding platform. 
A combination of long-term maturity  
on bond and undrawn bank financing, 
strong liquidity and headroom capacity, 
together with a broad banking group,  
allow the Group to pursue its strategic 
goals effectively. 
Funding sources
Long-term funding for the Group is 
provided from non-bank, long maturity, 
term financing. Two Sterling-denominated 
public bonds – comprising a 6.25% 
£350 million bond maturing in 2017 and 
a 6.625% £225 million bond maturing in 
2020 – and long-term amortising finance 
leases of £129 million provide this capacity. 
In addition, the Group has a £500 million 
committed unsecured revolving bank 
facility, maturing in August 2014, which was 
undrawn at 31 December 201 1. The Group 
is investment grade rated (Moody’s Baa3, 
neutral outlook; Fitch BBB-, stable outlook). 
Covenant compliance
The Group maintains adequate headroom 
over its banking covenants, which continued 
to improve during the year, as follows:
•	 debt gearing ratio (net debt to EBITDA): 
1.9 times (2010: 2. 1x; covenant not to 
exceed 3.5x); and
•	 interest cover ratio (EBITDA to net 
interest): 7 .2 times (2010: 6.9x; covenant 
not to be less than 3.5x).
Interest rate and currency hedging
The acquisition of Petermann, when 
completed, will initially be funded by 
cash drawn down from the bank facility. 
Following this acquisition and the handover 
of the East Anglia rail franchise, the Board 
expects the Group to operate at the upper 
end of its target gearing ratio of 2.0 to 2.5 
times EBITDA over the next 18 months.

Financial review 
Continued improvement  Financial review
continued
The Group hedges its exposure to interest 
rate movements to maintain a balance 
between fixed and floating interest rates on 
borrowings. To achieve the desired fixed/
floating ratio, the Group has entered into 
a series of interest rate swaps that have 
the effect of converting fixed rate debt to 
floating rate debt. The net effect of these 
transactions was that, as at 31 December 
201 1, the proportion of Group net debt at 
floating rates was 16% (2010: 19%). 
As its debt is primarily denominated in 
Sterling, the Group uses foreign currency 
contracts to create synthetic debt positions 
to partially hedge the exposure of our 
Spanish and US EBITDA and assets. 
At 31 December 201 1 the principal 
resultant foreign currency debt exposures 
were €250 million and US$195 million. 
Further details of the Group’s treasury 
management policies are set out in  
the Accounts.
Fuel risk management
The Group consumes approximately 250 
million litres of fuel each year, mostly of 
Ultra Low Sulphur Diesel and gasoline, 
which represented a total cost (including 
delivery and taxes) to the Group in 201 1 
of £181 million (8% of Group revenue), 
at an average fuel cost of 40 pence per 
litre. The Group has adopted a forward 
fuel buying policy in order to secure a 
degree of certainty in its planning. Based 
on expected hedgable consumption, a 
proportion of this is fixed for the future. 
Currently, the Group is 100% fixed for 
2012 at an average price of 44 pence/litre 
(excluding delivery and tax) and 50% fixed 
for 2013 at an average price of 47 pence. 
The Group seeks to hedge a minimum of 
15 months demand across all exposed 
businesses. Where businesses have 
freedom to price services, this hedge 
provides sufficient protection to recover 
fuel price increases through the fare 
basket. In contract businesses, where  
price escalation may be restricted by 
a formula independent of fuel costs, 
extended cover, up to the life of the 
contract, may be taken, subject to 
availability and liquidity in the hedging 
market. The latter is rarely available beyond 
three years from the trading date. 
National Express has a 
portfolio of businesses 
that provide a blend 
of opportunities for 
sustainable growth, 
profitability and cash 
generation.
Pensions
The Group’s principal defined benefit 
pension schemes are all in the UK.  
At 31 December 201 1 these schemes 
had a combined deficit under IAS 19 of 
£1.8 million, an improvement from a deficit 
position of £10.4 million at 31 December 
2010. The National Express Group  
Staff Pension Plan (UK Coach plan)  
is now closed to all future accrual.  
A funding plan aimed at bringing the plan 
to self sufficiency over a six year period 
was agreed in 2010; National Express 
contributes £4.2 million per annum to 
this scheme. In 201 1 UK Bus agreed a 
£5.5 million annual deficit repayment plan 
with the trustees of the West Midlands 
Passenger Transport Authority Pension 
Fund (WM plan) to fund a £71 million 
scheme funding deficit. The plan remains 
open to accrual for existing active 
members only.
The IAS 19 valuations by division at 
31 December 201 1 were as follows:
•	 UK Bus (under the WM plan and the 
Tayside Transport Superannuation 
Fund): £16.8 million deficit (2010: 
£5.3m deficit);
•	 UK Coach plan: £18.6 million surplus 
(2010: £nil); and
•	 UK Rail: £2.2 million deficit (2010: 
£3.7m deficit). The Group’s rail business 
participates in the Railways Pension 
Scheme. This exposure transfers to 
an incoming operator in the event of a 
franchise termination, as has happened 
on the East Anglia franchise.

The Audit Committee: 
•	 has specific responsibility for reviewing 
the effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
control and risk management systems;
•	 is responsible for the identification, 
assessment and management of risk, 
including actions taken and processes 
adopted to do so;
•	 reviews and approves all financial 
information published by the Group; and
•	 reviews the internal audit programme, 
considers major findings of the internal 
audit investigations and reviews 
management’s financial reporting  
and risk management.
Risk review process
Each division, plus the Group function, is 
required to make a formal review of risks to 
their business objectives, assess the impact 
and likelihood of the risk occurring and put 
in place mitigating actions, processes and 
systems to manage the risk.
Risks
Identify risks to business objectives on  
a bottom up basis: risks are described  
and categorised into Operational, Strategic 
and Financial risks in order to help define 
their precise nature and potential impact  
on the business.
Assessment 
Assess and quantify the potential impact 
on business objectives and determine 
the likelihood of the risk occurring. This is 
done on a ‘before’ and ‘after’ basis, where 
the impact of management controls is 
assessed in relation to the probability  
and severity of a risk.
Management
Take mitigating actions and implement 
systems to manage the likelihood and 
impact of the risk. Identify an individual  
with responsibility for each risk.
Monitoring and control
Risks are considered on a monthly basis  
at divisional level and formally updated 
twice a year. Management is encouraged 
to review the risk registers from other 
divisions to identify common issues and 
potential solutions.
Each divisional register, including the 
Group function register, is consolidated  
into a Group risk register.
The Group Executive Committee reviews 
the Group Risk Register twice a year, 
followed by the Group Audit Committee. 
The Audit Committee reports in turn to the 
main Board. 
The internal audit function has 
responsibility for the monitoring of the risk 
management and internal control systems. 
Internal Audit report to management 
and the Audit Committee on the extent 
to which internal controls are adequately 
designed and implemented.

Risks and risk management Principal risks of 2011 
During 201 1, the Group focused on the following key areas of risk:
Risk Assessment Management Year on year 
change
Economic conditions  
and austerity
Difficult economic conditions currently 
exist in Europe and North America. 
Whilst some of the Group’s businesses 
have naturally defensive characteristics, 
some of the more discretionary parts of 
the business may be adversely affected 
by reduced economic activity.
Revenues in the Bus, Coach and 
Rail businesses in the UK and Spain 
may be affected by lower passenger 
demand; there is also some positive 
risk that the Group would benefit from 
the prospect of modal shift towards its 
forms of transport. In North America for 
example, school boards may reduce 
their transportation budgets, or look 
to shift provision to contractors like 
National Express. In Spain, the Group 
has continued to grow revenue and 
profit in conditions of sustained high 
unemployment and low GDP growth.
The Group seeks to mitigate these risks 
through proactive cost control, revenue 
management systems, the careful 
economic modelling of new and existing 
contracts, including sensitivities around 
expected growth rates, and through 
sharing risk with contracting parties.
Political and regulatory
The Group’s businesses are subject 
to numerous laws in the jurisdictions 
in which they operate, regulating the 
operation of concessions, safety 
procedures, equipment specifications, 
employment requirements, 
environmental procedures and  
other operating issues.
Changes in political and regulatory 
environments can have a significant 
impact on regulated public transport 
operators, from adding significant cost 
to changing the fundamental nature of 
a market. For example, changes in UK 
government policy will result in material 
decreases in subsidies paid in 2012  
for fuel and senior citizen discounts. 
Changes to the UK Rail franchising  
regime are also expected.
The risk is reduced by maintaining close 
relationships with key stakeholders and 
ensuring that the economic advantages 
of our business models are fully 
understood and considered.
Ongoing risks
The following risks are key ongoing risks within the business: 
Risk Assessment Management Year on year 
change
Fuel cost
All of the Group’s businesses are 
exposed to fuel costs – primarily Ultra 
Low Sulphur Diesel for buses and 
coaches. Fuel prices are subject to 
significant volatility due to economic, 
political and climate circumstances.
Fuel costs constitute approximately 9% 
of the Group’s costs and, consequently, 
to the extent that price increases cannot 
be passed on to customers, increases 
in fuel costs will affect profitability.
The Group seeks to mitigate risks of 
increases in fuel costs by entering 
into fuel swaps and forward purchase 
contracts in line with the Group’s 
hedging strategy discussed on page 36.
Insurance and claims
The Group’s policy is to self-insure  
a number of potential claims within  
its business.
There is a risk that a successful claim or 
series of successful claims may result in 
substantial higher charges to profit and 
cash outflow than expected.
Throughout the business a strong 
safety culture prevails, led by the Board 
Safety & Environmental Committee. 
Where claims arise, they are managed 
by experienced claims handlers and 
professional advice is obtained in 
order to evaluate and minimise costs 
to the Group. It has also reduced self-
insurance values and increased external 
market coverage.
Risks
Principal risks and uncertainties
Outlined below are risks that have the potential to affect the Group’s performance  
in a material way, which are monitored through the risk management processes.
38 Risk Assessment Management Year on year 
change
Credit risk
As contractual operations, the North 
American and Spanish businesses are 
exposed to the risk that customers are 
either late or unable to pay sums owed 
to the Group.
Payment terms and cash collections 
in North America are extremely good. 
In Spain, during 201 1 one principal 
urban council became slower to pay 
outstanding debts, prompted by issues 
related to local and federal elections, 
as well as financial constraints. The 
total days outstanding balance is not 
significantly higher than normal levels.
Receivables in each business are 
closely monitored, based on robust and 
thorough documentation; provisions 
are then made where appropriate on 
a prudent basis for a certain level of 
non-collection. This provision increased 
during the year to reflect the overall 
balance increase. Additional contractual 
terms for interest accrual and repayment 
of outstanding balances were agreed 
with the major debtors. We also 
anticipate the new federal government 
will provide credit funding to assist some 
degree of clearance of long term debt.
Currency
The Group’s exposure to overseas 
earnings through its Spanish and North 
American operations creates a risk  
that movement in exchange rates  
may adversely impact translation of 
profit and cash flows together with 
Group gearing.
The potential impact is limited to the 
translation of cash flows and balance 
sheet assets and liabilities. The Group 
currently pays interest on mainly Sterling 
denominated debt. During 201 1 currency 
fluctuations were relatively small.
The Group uses limited overseas debt 
and currency swaps to reduce the 
impact and mitigate the risk. In addition, 
Management has flexibility to adjust 
its Group capital allocation decisions 
to focus on its highly cash generative 
UK businesses. The Board has also 
considered options for the Group in 
the event of a break up of the Eurozone 
and policies are in place to minimise 
exposure to this possibility.
 
Risk Assessment Management Year on year 
change
Contractual
Much of the Group’s business is 
secured through winning contracts and 
concessions, particularly in its North 
American school bus business, in Spain 
and in UK Rail.
An inherent risk in contract bidding is 
that bid assumptions might prove to be 
incorrect. If the Group’s significant bid 
assumptions prove to be incorrect, this 
could have an adverse effect on results 
of the operations and the Group’s 
financial condition.
The Group seeks to mitigate the risk 
through careful economic modelling of 
new contracts, and by sharing revenue 
risk with the awarding body; for example 
with the DfT in UK Rail.

Corporate responsibility  
at National Express Group
40
National Express is fortunate as there is a 
coincidence of benefit in what we do. What is 
good for our customers is good for our business 
and good for society. We are a private sector 
company that provides public services. The 
better the services we provide, the more people 
use them, benefiting the environment and our 
economies as well as our shareholders.  Safety KPIs  
2011
Our Vision and Values are fundamental 
to who we are as a business and as an 
active corporate citizen. We know that a 
safe business is a better business, as it 
will be run more effectively than an unsafe 
one. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions 
makes sense – commercially as well as 
environmentally. Investing in people builds 
stability and loyalty. Customer service 
excellence is both right and helps grow  
our business. 
We have defined our values to focus on 
four areas: ensuring the safety of our 
customers, our employees and the public 
generally; trying harder than anyone else 
for our customers; enabling our people to 
reach their full potential and give their best; 
and advancing the social, environmental 
and economic conditions of the 
communities in which we operate.
Corporate responsibility for National 
Express is living these values. 
Safety
Nothing matters more than safety. It is  
our number one priority, and our ambition 
is to have the best safety record in the 
transport sector. 
In 2010 we developed a five-year, Group-
wide safety improvement programme 
called Driving Out Harm. The approach we 
are taking is rigorous and the standards 
we are setting are high – for example, the 
introduction of Alcolocks on our coaches. 
These breathalyser devices prevent the 
vehicle from starting until the driver has 
successfully passed a breath test. The  
limit we are using is exceptionally low – 
more than four times lower than the legal 
drink-driving limit – and, during 201 1,  
we completed more than 50,000 tests  
a month in UK Coach alone.
Driving Out Harm is a major culture change 
programme, and for any such initiative 
to succeed requires visible commitment 
from the top. Driving Out Harm is being 
led by our Chief Executive, and during 
201 1 the frequency of site safety visits 
by senior managers tripled from four a 
year to one a month. Furthermore, all line 
managers throughout the Group have 
now completed formal training designed to 
equip them to manage the improvements 
in our safety performance. 
At the end of the year our new safety 
management arrangements were 
independently reviewed by the leading 
safety consultancy company, Arthur D. 
Little. They found that the programme had 
‘achieved all that was expected so far’ and 
that ‘commitment to and strong leadership 
of safety is evident, and awareness of 
Driving Out Harm among the workforce  
is high.’
Overall performance against most of our 
key indicators was better in 201 1 than in 
2010 across all divisions and geographies. 
Particularly marked improvements were 
seen in the second half as the impact of 
the safety programme – still in its first year – 
began to be felt.
The programme is intended to deliver a 
50% improvement in safety performance 
in the five years to 2016. Each of our 
businesses has annual targets and safety 
plans which provide both short-term focus 
and a strategic mechanism for achieving 
our longer term goal.
Edward Dacey, driver 
National Express
At the start of every shift, and 
after every break, coach driver 
Edward Dacey blows in to his 
Alcolock system to enable him 
to start his coach. “The system 
gives me and my customers 
the assurance that I am safe to 
drive,” said Edward. The Alcolock 
system, which is centrally 
monitored, is now fitted to all 
National Express coaches and 
performs thousands of breath 
checks each day.

c2c Customers
Service is at the core of our business. The 
better the service we provide, the more 
likely people are to switch to us either from 
our competitors or from their cars. Our 
vision is to create real customer loyalty. We 
want people to travel with us as often as 
possible. Increasing customer satisfaction 
will increase our revenue.
So, by the end of 2014 we aim to be the 
customer service leader in the transport 
sector, as part of a longer term plan to be a 
provider of world-class service by the end 
of 2017.
While this is an ambitious target we are 
starting from a fairly high base. Recent 
research from the Institute of Customer 
Services indicates that National Express 
in the UK is already considered to be a 
top quartile service provider across all 
industries, with UK Coach second only  
to Virgin Atlantic in the transport sector.
Even world-class service is not rocket 
science. It is about delivering the basics well 
– but doing it every single time. It is about 
politeness as well as punctuality; making 
sure that toilets are clean; that our staff are 
knowledgeable and helpful; that they smile 
– and mean it. We aim to provide service 
of great consistency so that customers feel 
they are getting exceptional value for money 
when weighing the price that they pay with 
the experience that they have.
During 201 1 we put in place the tools to 
help deliver excellence. Group-wide service 
standards have been launched and action 
plans developed for staff at all levels of 
each of our businesses. We have begun 
a rolling audit programme at our coach 
stations, assessing behaviour as well as 
infrastructure. Progress against our KPIs 
will be reported to the Group Executive 
every month.
People
201 1 saw the launch of the Group’s vision 
for its people:
•	 enabling them to reach their full potential 
and to give their best as individuals and in 
teams; and
•	 behave towards each other with the  
same respect and dignity that we expect 
for ourselves.
We launched five standards and supporting 
programmes relating to recruitment, 
induction, performance and talent 
management and to workplace rights. 
These are designed to modernise the 
management culture of the Group and 
ensure that at every level of the organisation 
we get the right people in the right jobs 
doing the right things in the right ways. 
We conduct regular surveys of employee 
opinion to keep in touch with the views  
and feelings of our people.
As part of the talent management 
programme, each of our top 100 managers 
has been given an individual development 
plan, with over half of this cadre also receiving 
highly tailored one-to-one coaching.
Emergency and scheduled succession 
plans have been established for all of 
our senior positions. In addition we now 
have around 100 people – generally 
frontline managers – on our high potential 
programme as a means of growing our  
own senior managers of the future. 
During 201 1, we also developed a rigorous 
performance management process and a 
management blueprint which defined what 
we want managers to do – and not to do. 
The intention is to encourage a specific set 
of behaviours that, in turn, will improve levels 
of workforce engagement. 
In 2012 we will be extending our talent 
management training to include all managers, 
from frontline supervisors upwards.

driving training instructor  
National Express
Raj Bhutta is a driving training 
instructor for National Express in 
Walsall. Last April he swapped the 
West Midlands for Tanzania to work 
with the charity Transaid, training 
local bus drivers to be driving 
instructors. “Some Tanzanian bus 
drivers don’t even have a licence!” 
Raj says. “But the quality of our 
trainees was high and they really 
embraced our efforts. It was  
a fantastic experience.”
Across the Group, more 
than 100 community 
organisations and 
charities were 
supported, either 
through a donation  
or support in kind.
Community
Our 201 1 environmental performance is 
something we are proud of. 
Our new Birmingham coach station, for 
example, is the only one in the country to 
be accredited to the BREEAM Excellent 
standard. BREEAM is the world’s leading 
design and assessment method for 
sustainable building. We are aiming 
to achieve the same rating for all new 
developments, which will include two new 
bus garages and a coach garage in the 
next two years. Our intention is that these 
new developments will have zero net CO
2
 
emissions and will therefore be carbon 
neutral. This will be achieved by investment 
in energy efficiency measures including 
smart meters, building insulation, and 
on-site renewable energy regeneration. 
We are also working with the Chartered 
Institution of Building Services Engineers and 
Liverpool John Moores University to create 
a system for the rail industry to benchmark 
property efficiency and sustainability. No 
such system currently exists.
Investment in our c2c rail business has 
already seen us become the industry 
leader in energy efficiency and in waste 
recycling – and coaches are the greenest 
form of transport. We have medium-term 
targets for reducing our carbon emissions 
– and deliberately so. We believe medium-
term targets are more meaningful than 
targets set many years hence, and make 
us more accountable. During 201 1 we 
installed voltage optimisation equipment at 
all of our bus garages, which has resulted 
in a saving of 1 million kWh or 19% of the 
electricity used at these sites, and almost 
550 tonnes of CO
2
 a year. 
Gas consumption has fallen even more 
steeply. Installing automated gas control 
systems at our bus garages saved almost 
2,200 tonnes of CO
2
 and cut gas usage  
by 55%. We are now looking to roll this  
out to our coach and rail operations.
As well as emitting significantly less carbon 
than other modes of transport, our buses, 
coaches and trains significantly reduce 
congestion – and its economic cost. 
For example, a third of all commuters in 
Birmingham travel on National Express 
operated buses. If they were to drive 
instead, that would add a traffic jam 
equivalent to the distance between 
Birmingham and Moscow. 
National Express is an international 
business, and takes its community 
responsibilities seriously wherever it 
operates. Across the Group, more than 
100 community organisations and charities 
were supported, either through a donation 
or support in kind. A total of £228,000  
was donated to charities during the year.
In Morocco, for example, we are 
supporting a UNICEF project which 
focuses on improving the care offered  
to mothers and newborn children with  
the aim of reducing neonatal mortality.
In the USA, 14 of our school bus fleets 
have achieved Green School Bus Fleet 
Certification from the National School 
Transportation Association. This is the only 
programme of its kind to recognise school 
transportation companies for providing 
environmentally responsible transportation 
through the use of new technologies.
Throughout our North American 
operations we launched an Adopt-a-
School programme in 201 1. This has seen 
our employees volunteering to help schools 
in their communities from New York to 
New Mexico, California to South Carolina, 
and Oklahoma to Ontario. 
The range of activities varies greatly, from 
collecting food, clothing and toys for 
needy families to taking part in reading 
programmes. But they are all based on 
finding ways to build strong relationships 
with our communities and our customers.
In the UK, our Employee Charity Panel 
continues to encourage staff to get 
involved in the community, with a total  
of £20,000 donated during the year.
Overall, we made real progress across  
our community agenda during 201 1,  
and have the structures in place to do  
even better in 2012.

Corporate responsibility at National Express Governance
Chairman’s overview
 Dear shareholder 
201 1 was another successful year for National Express 
and another year during which we saw an ever increasing 
focus on standards of corporate governance. The Board 
as a whole recognises that good governance results in  
a good business and goes further than simply following  
a series of rules. At National Express we seek to  
make good governance an integral part of our  
business philosophy. 
In the following section of this report we 
have sought to give a clear description  
of our Board and committee structure  
and the processes that support it which 
are at the heart of good governance.  
I have asked my colleagues who chair 
our various Board committees to highlight 
for you some of the work that has been 
undertaken by the Committees during the 
year. Their reviews follow later in this report. 
In this letter I would like to deal with some 
issues that I mentioned in my letter to you 
last year.
Refreshment of the Board
During 201 1 we have continued and 
accelerated the process of Board 
refreshment. After carefully reviewing the 
appropriate balance of skills, expertise, 
experience and knowledge required by 
the Company we conducted a search, 
using two firms of independent search 
consultants, for two new Non-Executive 
Directors with international experience. 
Such was the quality of the candidates 
whom we encountered, we decided finally 
to appoint three new, independent Non-
Executives to the Board, Chris Muntwyler, 
Joaquín Ayuso and Lee Sander. These 
appointments have increased the diversity 
of the Board and enhanced both its 
continental European and North American 
experience. In June 201 1 Roger Devlin 
decided to step down as a Non-Executive 
Director and I would like to thank Roger 
for his tremendous contributions during 
his time on the Board. The arrival of three 
new Non-Executives has been a significant 
change which it is my duty to manage.  
The new Board has developed well and  
we will continue to monitor the balance 
of skills and experience on the Board to 
ensure that it meets the changing needs  
of the business.

Governance and our Board of Directors,

44 Diversity
On the more general issue of gender 
diversity, the Nomination Committee 
of the Board has reviewed the report 
of Lord Davies published in February 
201 1 on Board Room Diversity. National 
Express is determined to ensure that 
all people – regardless of background 
or gender – are well represented at all 
levels of our business. Not only is that the 
right thing to do, it is also good business 
practice. Therefore, while maintaining 
our existing policy of selecting the best 
available candidates for any position, 
National Express is content to set the 
aspirational target that by 2015, 30% of 
its Board will be women, in line with the 
recommendations of the Davies Report. 
Review of Board performance
During 201 1 the Board has conducted 
an externally facilitated review of its 
effectiveness which is reported on in more 
detail in the following sections of this report. 
For us, the use of an external facilitator has 
been a positive one. An externally facilitated 
evaluation is not an opportunity for the 
Company to be told by a third party what 
it should or should not be doing. Rather, it 
is more about providing a process through 
which Directors can speak candidly at 
length to our facilitator and in doing so 
analyse our performance over the past 
year. The facilitator presents his findings 
to the Board and it is then the Board’s 
collective responsibility to discuss this  
and agree any actions required to improve 
our effectiveness.
UK Corporate Governance Code
For the first time this year we will be 
reporting against the UK Corporate 
Governance Code that was brought  
into effect in May 2010.

Chris Muntwyler – on the road
Chris Muntwyler, Chairman of the 
Safety Committee for National 
Express, visited UK operations for 
three days as part of his induction 
programme. The programme 
is aimed at developing newly 
appointed Directors’ understanding 
of the business and markets, 
while simultaneously building 
relationships with Group employees 
and customers. Being on-site 
offered Chris an insight into the UK 
Bus business’s potential. Although 
identifying prospective areas for 
growth are welcome outcomes  
of the induction programme,  
Chris stresses “surrounding all  
of this activity is our drive to 
improve safety”.
At National Express 
we seek to make good 
governance an integral 
part of our business 
philosophy.

  The role of the Board
The Board leads and controls the Group 
within a sound governance framework.  
The Board is responsible for setting the 
Group’s strategic aims, its values and 
standards and ensuring the necessary 
financial and human resources are in place 
to achieve its goals. To help discharge its  
key responsibilities the Board has a defined 
list of key governance and business 
matters for which it is responsible, as 
summarised opposite.
In addition to the matters above, which 
form the core of the Board’s agenda the 
timeline on pages 52 to 53 shows the main 
items of business addressed by the Board 
during the year.
3
 The structure of the Board
The Board consists of a balance of 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors 
who collectively bring a strong and in-
depth mix of business skills and experience 
and considerable knowledge to assist 
with Board decisions. A summary of the 
members of the Board including the mix of 
skills and experience each Director brings 
to the Board is given on pages 46 to 47 
and full biographical details are included  
in the Notice of AGM.
The full terms of reference of  
the principal Committees are available  
on the Company’s website at  
nationalexpressgroup.com
48 5
 Independence
The Board considers all of the 
Non-Executives to be independent other 
than Jorge Cosmen and considered John 
Devaney to be independent prior to his 
appointment as Chairman. Jorge Cosmen 
is not considered to be independent by 
the Board due to his close links with the 
ALSA business and significant interests in 
the shares of the Company which are held 
through European Express Enterprises 
Limited. Despite his non-independence, 
the Board feels that it benefits greatly  
from Jorge Cosmen’s extensive local 
market knowledge and experience.  
Non-Executive Directors do not participate 
in any of the Company’s share option 
or bonus schemes and their service is 
non-pensionable.
6
 Principal committees of the Board
The principal committees established by 
the Board are the Audit Committee, the 
Remuneration Committee, the Nomination 
Committee and the Safety & Environment 
Committee. Each Committee has defined 
terms of reference and reports on its 
proceedings to the Board. In addition there 
is an Executive Committee with authority 
to approve routine matters of business 
and a Tax and Treasury Committee which 
reviews the Group’s tax planning, banking 
facilities and treasury reports. All of the 
Committees are authorised to obtain legal 
or other professional advice as necessary, 
to secure the attendance of external 
advisors at their meetings and to seek 
information required from any employee  
of the Company in order to perform  
their duties. The full terms of reference  
of the principal Committees are available 
on the Company’s website at  
nationalexpressgroup.com. 
The UK, Spain and North America 
Executives meet on a monthly basis  
and matters dealt with at these  
meetings are reported to the Group 
Executive Committee.
The members of each principal Committee 
and main duties are shown in each 
Committee report on pages 54 to 58. 
The table below sets out the number of 
meetings of the Board and its Committees 
during the year and individual attendance 
by the Board and Committee members 
at these meetings. During the year the 
Chairman met on several occasions with 
the Non-Executives without the Executive 
Directors present to allow informal 
discussions on a variety of issues.

 Executive Directors
The Executive Directors are responsible for 
the day-to-day management of the Group’s 
businesses, implementation of its strategy, 
policies and budgets and its financial 
performance. Executive management 
meetings, involving the Executive Directors 
and senior management from the divisions 
are held regularly to discuss current issues.
10
  Information and professional 
development
Reports from the Executive Directors, 
which include in-depth financial 
information, are circulated to Board 
members prior to every Board meeting. 
Senior management and advisers give 
presentations to the Board on significant 
matters during the year. 
Under the direction of the Chairman, the 
Company Secretary is responsible for 
ensuring Board procedures are followed 
and applicable rules and regulations are 
complied with and advises the Board on 
governance matters. All Directors have 
access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary and the appointment 
or removal of the Company Secretary is a 
matter for the Board as a whole. There is a 
procedure in place for any Director to take 
independent professional advice where 
considered necessary.
On appointment, Directors are offered 
training as appropriate and are thereafter 
encouraged to keep abreast of matters 
affecting their duties as a Director and to 
attend training courses relevant to their 
role. An induction process is in place for 
new Directors, the aims of which are to:

  The Chairman and the Group  
Chief Executive
The roles of Chairman and Group Chief 
Executive are held separately. The 
Chairman is responsible for leading the 
Board and ensuring its effectiveness. The 
Group Chief Executive is responsible for the 
leadership of the Group and implementation 
of the strategy and policies adopted by 
the Board. The division of responsibilities 
between the Chairman and Group Chief 
Executive is shown in the table below.
8
 Senior Independent Director
The Board appoints one of the 
Non-Executive Directors to act as Senior 
Independent Director and this role has 
been held by Tim Score since April 
2009. The role of the Senior Independent 
Director is to provide a sounding board 
for the Chairman and to serve as an 
intermediary for the other Directors where 
necessary. The Senior Independent 
Director is also available to address 
shareholders’ concerns if they have been 
unable to resolve these through normal 
channels or when such channels would be 
inappropriate. During the year the Senior 
Independent Director has discussed 
the performance of the Chairman with 
the Non-Executive Directors and has 
participated in meetings with significant 
institutional investors.
Seeing the front line 
by Sir Andrew Foster 
Non-Executive Directors spend 
masses of time reading Board 
papers and helping to develop 
strategy and challenge performance.
All valuable stuff, but it can be much 
helped by seeing the sharp end of 
service delivery. I visited our school 
yellow bus service centre in Chicago 
meeting drivers, mechanics, 
dispatchers, safety trainers and 
managers. Nothing beats chatting 
with the staff, understanding 
operational issues, safety concerns 
and how to link well with students 
and schools. There was tremendous 
spirit and motivation behind their 
work to renew their contract. 
After this, I spent a day with ten 
CEOs of School Boards, talking 
about how our student transport 
services could be improved. School 
Boards are squeezed financially 
and are seeking sustained service 
levels at lower cost. It was satisfying 
to explore joint ways we can work 
through tough economic times 
protecting safe service delivery.
The chance to meet front line staff, 
students and CEOs, adds to report 
understanding and demonstrates 
support both ways. A number of 
staff commented “It is good to 
know that there is real interest and 
understanding at board level”.
50 •	 build an understanding of the nature  
of the Company, its business and the 
markets in which it operates;
•	 establish a link with the Group’s 
employees; and
•	 build an understanding of the Group’s  
main relationships including 
stakeholders and customers.
For example, as part of Chris Muntwyler’s 
introduction to the Group, he spent three 
days visiting UK operations.
11
 Performance evaluation
Formal evaluation of the Board’s 
performance is periodically carried out. An 
internal evaluation was commenced in late 
2010 and completed in the first quarter of 
201 1. The Board review concluded that 
generally the Board was considered to be 
working very well. The Board felt that it was 
receiving high quality information to aid  
its decision-making both in terms of the 
Board papers and specialist information 
provided. Board Committees were also 
felt to be generally well-managed. The 
findings of the evaluation report resulted 
in a number of recommendations for 
improvement in the way the Board 
operates, examples of which are shown  
in the table below.
In late 201 1 the Board commenced an 
externally facilitated Board review process. 
Structured meetings were held with each 
Non-Executive Director and the Company 
Secretary and during the meetings the 
following areas were considered:
•	 balance of skills and experience;
•	 independence and knowledge  
of the Company;
•	 diversity including gender;
•	 how the Board works together as  
a unit; and
•	 other factors relevant to its effectiveness.
Following this, individual draft meeting 
reports were circulated for individual 
Directors to sign. A draft omnibus report 
was then prepared for discussion by 
the Chairman and Company Secretary 
prior to submission of a final report 
for debate at the Board. Action plans 
are being developed based on the 
outcome of the evaluation process and 
the recommendations and outcomes 
arising from the evaluation process will be 
reported on in next year’s Annual Report.
12
 Relations with shareholders
The Board recognises the importance of 
maintaining good communications with the 
Company’s shareholders to ensure mutual 
understanding of the Group’s strategy, 
objectives, governance and performance.
During the year shareholders are kept 
informed of the progress of the Group 
through regular corporate communications; 
the Preliminary announcement, the Notice 
of AGM, interim management statements 
and press releases regarding any other 
significant developments, as well as the 
dissemination of regulated information. 
Such communications are made available 
to the London Stock Exchange and 
simultaneously available on the Company’s 
website nationalexpressgroup.com.  
The Company’s website houses wide-
ranging information about the Group, 
including the Annual Report and Accounts, 
press releases, share price data and links 
to subsidiary company websites.
From time to time the Company invites 
research analysts and institutional investors 
to presentations and site visits that are 
designed to provide more understanding 
of the strengths and capabilities of its 
business operations and strategy. In 201 1 
the Company held an Analyst and Investor 
event in Madrid as well as hosting a visit to 
school bus operations in the USA.
The Company has introduced an electronic 
communications facility to enable 
shareholders to receive documentation 
such as the Annual Report and Accounts 
electronically and also to cast their votes 
by proxy electronically. The Company 
has also introduced an electronic proxy 
appointment service for CREST members.
13
 Institutional shareholders
The Chairman, Group Chief Executive 
and Group Finance Director have 
held a number of meetings with 
existing and prospective institutional 
shareholders during the year as well 
as given presentations following the full 
year and half-year results. They have 
also met and given presentations to 
research analysts and stockbrokers’ 
sales teams. The Company’s appointed 
brokers and investor relations advisors 
in turn have provided regular confidential 
feedback to the Company on the views 
of the major institutions. The Chairman, 
Senior Independent Director and other 
Areas for improvement Actions taken
•	 The 2012 schedule of Board meetings should be reviewed 
to ensure a more regular pattern and a closer link to the 
Company’s reporting and events calendar.
A review was undertaken and the schedule of meetings was 
adjusted as proposed.
•	 Additional Non-Executive Directors should be appointed to the 
Board to add North American and European experience and 
expertise and strengthen the breadth of skills and experience 
around the Board table.
Search consultants were briefed and a shortlist of candidates 
was drawn up. Three high-calibre candidates were identified 
and appointed as Non-Executive Directors to the Board: Chris 
Muntwyler (appointed 1 1 May 201 1), Joaquín Ayuso (appointed 
1 June 201 1) and Lee Sander (appointed 1 June 201 1).
•	 Board papers should be circulated at least four days prior  
to the meeting (two of which must be working days).
Board papers are now circulated according to the 
recommendation; electronic dissemination of Board papers  
is currently being trialled.
•	 Board members should not schedule other meetings on 
Board days to remove some pressure from the schedule and 
enable time to be allocated to Non-Executive Directors to meet 
on their own in advance of Board meetings.
Board members are scheduling their commitments according 
to the recommendation.

Non-Executive Directors are also given 
the opportunity to meet institutional 
shareholders and are available by contact 
through the normal channels. During 201 1 
the Chairman and Senior Independent 
Director have both met with major 
shareholders to discuss the governance 
and direction of the Company.
The Board is provided with regular updates 
on the views and issues raised by the 
Company’s investors. During the year the 
Board received external presentations 
from advisors on shareholder and market 
perception of the Group’s performance 
and strategy. Formal written responses 
are given to correspondence received 
from shareholders, as well as bilateral 
engagement through the Group Chief 
Executive, Group Finance Director and  
the Company’s investor relations function.

 Annual General Meeting
Notice of the AGM and related papers are 
sent to shareholders at least 20 working 
days before the meeting. Last year’s AGM 
included a presentation by the Group Chief 
Executive on the progress of the business 
and an opportunity for shareholders to ask 
questions. All our Directors were available 
formally to answer questions during the 
meeting and many circulated and talked to 
shareholders informally afterwards. Voting 
on the resolutions was conducted by poll. 
Some 85% of the shares in issue were 
voted and the resolutions were passed. 
The results are published on the Group’s 
website shortly after the meeting.
We look forward to welcoming 
shareholders to our 2012 AGM and 
updating them on the progress of the 
business this year.
The Board has a regular schedule of meetings and convenes additional meetings as 
required. Details of the number of meetings held and attendance at these meetings is  
on page 49. The average attendance rate of the members of the Board in 201 1 was 93%.

Audit Committee overview
Dear shareholder
2011 has seen the Company continue to build upon the progress made  
in 2010 as reflected in the results presented to you in this document. 
Given	the	length	of	time	since	the	role	of	external	auditor	had	been	put	out	to	
tender,	it	was	agreed	that	the	time	was	opportune	to	tender	the	position	early	
in	2011.	An	invitation	to	tender	was	issued	to	four	major	accounting	firms	and	
following	this	process	Deloitte	LLP	was	appointed	as	the	Company’s	auditor	on	
14 June	2011	following	the	resignation	of	Ernst	and	Young	LLP	on	10	June	2011.
The	Audit	Committee,	supported	by	senior	management,	conducted	a	rigorous	
tender	process	focussing	on	quality,	resources,	independence	and	value.	The	
tendering	firms	were	invited	to	put	forward	a	proposal	to	the	Audit	Committee,	
following	briefing	meetings	with	key	management	and	the	Audit	Committee	
Chairman.	Following	the	review	of	these	proposals	by	management	and	the	
Audit	Committee	Chairman	and	after	careful	consideration,	the	Audit	Committee	
concluded	that	the	proposal	from	Deloitte	LLP	was	the	best	overall	in	terms	of	
quality,	resources,	independence	and	value	and	would	better	meet	the	Group’s	
requirements	for	external	audit	services	going	forward.	
The	Audit	Committee	therefore	recommended	to	the	Board	that	Deloitte	LLP		
be	appointed	as	the	Group’s	external	auditor.
The	Committee	has	no	set	policy	on	the	tendering	frequency	of	their	external	
auditor	or	of	the	tenure	of	their	external	auditor	but	will	ensure	that	good	corporate	
governance	is	maintained	and	that	the	Committee	is	regularly	considering		
the	marketplace,	benchmarking	the	current	level	of	service	the	Company		
receives	along	with	the	fees	they	pay	and	the	value	being	delivered.	There	were		
no	contractual	obligations	that	acted	to	restrict	the	Committee’s	choice	of		
external	auditor.
I	would	like	to	take	this	opportunity	to	thank	Ernst	&	Young	for	their	many		
years	of	excellent	service	to	the	Company	and	to	welcome	Deloitte	as	the	
Company’s	auditor.
In	2011	the	Committee	dealt	with	its	usual	programme	of	business	as	well	as	a	
range	of	new	issues	such	as	the	Company’s	new	Anti‑Bribery	Policy,	envisaged		
in	my	letter	to	you	last	year,	to	ensure	compliance	with	the	Bribery	Act	2010.		
This	policy,	together	with	new	whistle	blowing	arrangements,	is	now	in	place		
and	compliance	with	the	policy	will	be	monitored	going	forward.	
For	the	first	time	in	a	number	of	years	there	has	been	a	change	to	the	membership	
of	the	Committee	following	Roger	Devlin’s	retirement	from	the	Board.	Chris	
Muntwyler	has	joined	the	Committee	bringing	it	back	to	full	strength	and	keeping		
it	in	compliance	with	the	UK	Corporate	Governance	Code.
Tim Score  
Audit Committee Chairman
29	February	2012
Main activities during the year
During	the	year	the	Committee	
considered	the	following:
•	oversight	of	the	tender	and		
selection	process	for	the	role		
of	external	auditor
•	review	of	compliance	with	the		
UK	Corporate	Governance	Code
•	review	and	update	of	the	
Committee’s	terms	of	reference
•	approval	of	the	Group’s		
Anti‑Bribery	Policy
•	review	of	the	Group	Risk	Register
•	review	of	UK	Data	Protection		
Act	Compliance
•	review	and	update	of	Policy		
on	Provision	of	Audit	and		
Non‑Audit	Services
•	consideration	of	the	results	of	
internal	audit	compliance	testing		
of	financial	controls	(Annual	Fitness	
Checks)	within	the	subsidiaries	
•	review	of	the	external	auditor’s	fees
•	review	of	financial	accounts	and	
accounting	policies
Tim Score
The Audit Committee is confident 
that the Group has a well-established 
governance structure with full control 
and direction over appropriate 
strategic, financial, operational  
and compliance issues.

Director (resigned 
28 June 201 1)
Sir Andrew Foster Non-Executive 
Director
Chris Muntwyler Non-Executive 
Director (appointed 
21 November 201 1)
The Role of the Audit Committee
The duties of the Committee are those 
delegated to it by its terms of reference, 
details of which are summarised below:
•	 oversees the process for selecting 
the external auditor, assesses the 
continuing independence of the external 
auditor and recommends approval of 
the audit fee to the Board;
•	 responsible for ensuring that provision 
of non-audit services does not impair  
the external auditor’s independence  
or objectivity;
•	 discusses with the external auditor the 
nature and scope of the audit and any 
issues or concerns arising from the  
audit process;
•	 reviews effectiveness of the 
Company’s internal control and risk 
management systems, including the 
internal audit programme and major 
findings identified from internal audit 
investigations and reviews; and
•	 reviews the half-year and annual 
financial statements including 
accounting judgements and policies.
The Committee met four times in 201 1. 
The Committee’s agenda reflects the 
duties delegated to it by its terms of 
reference. There are a number of standing 
items considered during the year such as 
consideration of the internal and external 
audit reports, review of the Annual Report 
and Accounts, review of the preliminary 
and half-year announcements, and review 
of the Corporate Governance Report.
At the invitation of the Committee, and 
as appropriate to the matters under 
discussion, meetings may be attended by 
the Executive Directors and internal and 
external auditors. Full minutes are kept by 
the Secretary of the matters considered 
and decisions taken by the Committee. 
Outside of the meeting process the 
Committee Chairman has regular contact 
with the Executive Directors, other 
Committee members and the auditors 
on a variety of topics.
Review of independence  
of external auditor
The Audit Committee assesses 
and reviews on a regular basis the 
independence of the external auditor. 
As part of their determination the 
Audit Committee considers a report 
by the external auditor on the firm’s 
independence which is required in order 
to carry out their professional duties and 
responsibilities as auditor. 
Policy on auditor providing  
non-audit work
The Committee has an approved policy  
on the provision of non-audit services by  
its auditor for the following types of service:
•	 services that are considered to have 
‘general pre-approval’ by the Audit 
Committee, by virtue of the approval  
of the policy;
•	 services that require ‘specific pre-
approval’ , on a case-by-case basis, 
before any work can commence; and
•	 services that cannot be supplied by the 
external auditor (‘prohibited services’).
The services that have general pre-
approval are tax, transaction investigation 
and advisory and corporate finance 
services. The fees for these services are 
pre-approved up to £50,000 for each non-
audit assignment undertaken and subject 
to an overall limit of 75% of the total fees 
paid to the external auditor. For services 
exceeding this limit specific pre-approval  
is required.
In deciding whether or not to grant 
approval for the provision of specific 
services by the external auditor, the Audit 
Committee includes in its consideration the 
following factors:
(i)  whether the external auditing firm is 
best placed to provide an effective and 
efficient service, given its familiarity with 
the Company’s processes, systems 
and people; and
(ii)  the level of non-audit fees paid to  
the external auditor in the year as  
a proportion of the annual external  
audit fee.
The majority of non-audit work undertaken 
by the external auditor during the year 
relates to advice in respect of tax advisory 
and other regulatory services. These 
items the Committee believes would be 
impractical and costly to provide through 
another party.

Nomination Committee overview
Dear shareholder
2011 has been a busy year for the Nomination Committee. In the early part  
of the year, as indicated in my letter to you last year, the Committee reviewed 
the existing balance of skills and experience on the Board and concluded 
that additional expertise of Continental European and North American 
markets would further strengthen the Board going forward. 
The	Committee	then	undertook	an	externally	facilitated	search	process	to	identify	
suitable	candidates.	I	am	pleased	to	report	to	you	that	the	search	was	successful	
in	identifying	three	exceptional	candidates	in	Joaquín	Ayuso,	Chris	Muntwyler	and	
Lee	Sander,	all	of	whom	we	have	now	appointed	as	independent	Non‑Executive	
Directors	of	your	Company.
The	Committee	has	also	undertaken	further	work	on	reviewing	the	succession	
plans	for	the	senior	executive	roles	within	the	Company’s	management	together	
with	the	development	plans	in	place	for	such	executives	to	seek	to	ensure	that,	
when	the	need	arises,	good	internal	candidates	are	available	to	compete	for	Board	
and	senior	management	positions.
We	have	also	considered	the	issue	of	diversity	this	year.	The	Committee	has	
recommended	to	the	Board	that	it	should	retain	its	existing	policy	of	seeking	to	find	
the	very	best	candidate	for	any	Board	level	position,	irrespective	of	the	gender	of	
that	candidate.	However,	the	Committee	recognises	that	diversity	at	Board	level	is	
a	positive	thing	and	so	the	Board	has	set	an	aspirational	target	that	by	2015,	30%	
of	its	members	will	be	women,	in	line	with	the	recommendations	of	the	Davies	
Report	published	in	early	2011.
In	2012	the	Committee	will	continue	to	assess	the	balance	of	skills,	experience,	
knowledge	and	expertise	of	the	Board	to	ensure	it	continues	to	meet	the	needs		
of	the	Company	going	forward.
John Devaney 
Nomination Committee Chairman
29	February	2012
The Role of the Nomination Committee
The key responsibilities of the Nomination 
Committee are summarised below:
•	 responsible for identifying and 
nominating, for the approval of 
the Board, candidates to fill Board 
vacancies as and when they arise;
•	 gives full consideration to succession 
planning, and keeps under review the 
leadership needs of the organisation, 
both Executive and Non-Executive;
•	 reviews the time required from a 
Non-Executive Director and uses 
performance evaluation to assess 
whether the Non-Executive Director  
is spending enough time on fulfilling 
their duties;
•	 leads the process for Board 
appointments and makes 
recommendations to the Board; and
•	 prepares a description of the role 
and requirements for any particular 
appointment based on its evaluation  
of the Board as a whole.
The terms and conditions of appointment 
of the Non-Executive Directors are available 
for inspection at the Company’s registered 
office during normal business hours and at 
the AGM of the Company and are available 
on the Company’s website. The Non-
Executive Directors disclose to the Board 
their other significant commitments. The 
procedures adopted by the Company in 
relation to Directors’ conflicts of interest  
are detailed on page 72.
External advisors are appointed when 
recruiting Board members; they use as 
a basis for their search a description of 
the role and capabilities required for a 
particular appointment proposed by the 
Nomination Committee.

Safety & Environment Committee overview
Dear shareholder
I have recently taken over the chair of the Safety & Environment Committee  
and would like to thank Miranda Curtis for overseeing the many initiatives  
that were commenced during her time as Chair of this Committee. 
Safety	is	important	in	any	business	but	it	is	particularly	so	in	this	Company.	
Seeking	to	ensure	the	safety	of	our	employees	and	customers	is	both	morally	
and	financially	correct.	It	is	for	this	reason	that	the	Board	has	a	special	committee	
dedicated	to	this	issue.	In	my	view	it	is	imperative	that	leadership	from	the	top	is	
shown	in	this	area	if	a	concern	for	safety	is	to	be	taken	seriously	within	a	business,	
and	I	would	like	to	commend	Dean	Finch	for	the	leadership	he	and	his	executive	
team	have	shown	in	keeping	this	issue	at	the	very	top	of	the	Company’s	agenda.
During	201 1	the	Committee	has	been	monitoring	the	progress	of	the	‘Driving	Out	
Harm’	programme	referred	to	by	Miranda	in	her	letter	to	you	last	year.	Excellent	
progress	has	been	made	in	many	areas	and	the	Committee	is	committed	to	ensuring	
that	this	progress	is	consolidated	and	built	upon.
The	Committee	has	once	again	this	year	been	paying	particular	attention	to	
the	Company’s	operations	in	Morocco	which,	in	some	regards,	present	the	
most	challenges	from	a	safety	perspective.	I	am	pleased	to	report	that	the	
recommendations	of	the	original	Arthur	D.	Little	(ADL)	review	referred	to	last	year	
have	now	been	fully	implemented	and	a	further	review	and	audit	undertaken	by	
ADL,	showed	significant	progress	made	by	the	management	team	in	improving	
driver	competence.
During	the	year	the	Committee	also	approved	a	new	environmental	policy	for	the	
Group	and	reviewed	plans	for	a	new	corporate	environmental	framework.
Chris Muntwyler 
Safety & Environment Committee Chairman

The Role of the Safety & Environment Committee
The key responsibilities of the Committee 
are summarised below:
•	 responsible for reviewing and 
challenging constructively the structure, 
content and operation of the safety 
management arrangements put  
in place by members of the  
executive management of the  
Group’s operating companies;
•	 reports periodically to the Board its 
observations on the safety management 
arrangements in place and reviews and 
makes recommendations to the Board 
on any specific safety management 
issues relating to the Group or any 
subsidiary company; and
•	 reviews and monitors the Company’s 
environmental performance and targets.

Remuneration Committee overview
Dear shareholder
This is my first letter to you as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, a role 
I took over when Roger Devlin left the Board during 201 1. I would like to thank 
Roger for his contribution during his time as Chair of the Committee.
As	in	previous	years	the	Committee	has	been	very	conscious	of	the	continuing	focus		
of	both	individual	and	institutional	investors	on	the	issue	of	executive	remuneration.	
I	and	my	fellow	Non‑Executive	Directors	on	the	Remuneration	Committee	are	very	
aware	of	the	continuing	need	to	ensure	the	Company’s	remuneration	policies	and	
practices	are	in	line	with	best	practice	whilst	at	the	same	time	ensuring	that	our	highly	
regarded	management	team	are	retained	and	rewarded	appropriately	for	the	delivery	
of	the	Company’s	strategic	objectives.
This	year	the	Committee	did	undertake	its	usual	review	of	remuneration	(including	
considering	the	results	of	an	independent	benchmarking	of	executive	salaries	
and	the	Non‑Executive	Chairman’s	fees).	However,	in	view	of	the	current	macro‑
economic	environment	in	which	we	are	operating	and	the	Company’s	determination	
to	control	costs,	all	Board	members,	both	executive	and	non‑executive,	have	
decided	to	freeze	their	current	salary	and	fee	levels	for	2012	notwithstanding	the	
potential	for	increases	noted	as	a	result	of	the	Committee’s	review	process.
The	Committee	considers	that	the	bonuses	awarded	to	the	Executive	Directors		
for	201 1	to	be	justified	given	the	Company’s	financial	performance	in	201 1.		
Bonuses	were	paid	at	100%	of	the	maximum	for	the	Chief	Executive	and	100%		
of	the	maximum	for	the	Finance	Director	with	these	bonuses	arising	as	a	result	of		
a	growth	in	normalised	profit	of	10%,	continuing	improvement	in	the	Group’s	margin	
and	the	substantial	progress	achieved	against	specific	key	strategic	objectives.
With	regard	to	future	remuneration	policy,	the	Committee	believes	that	the	long	term	
incentive	and	bonus	structures	agreed	for	2012	to	be	appropriate	and	as	such	will	
properly	incentivise	the	Executive	Directors	to	achieve	the	Company’s	mid‑	and		
short‑term	objectives.

Directors’ remuneration report
The Committee members and 
management attendees did not participate 
in any discussions directly relating to 
their own remuneration or performance 
during the year. This report sets out the 
policy for the financial year just ended, 
for the forthcoming year and, subject to 
ongoing review, for subsequent years. The 
report has been approved by the Board 
and the Remuneration Committee (the 
‘Committee’). Shareholders will be invited 
to approve the report at the 2012 AGM.
 Advisors to the Committee
The Committee has appointed 
independent remuneration consultants, 
New Bridge Street (NBS) to advise on all 
aspects of senior executive remuneration. 
NBS has no other connection with the 
Group other than in the provision of  
advice on executive and employee 
remuneration and nor does its ultimate 
parent, Aon Corporation.

  Remuneration of Non-Executive 
Directors 
The fees of the Non-Executive Directors 
are set by the Board as a whole and 
those of the Chairman are set by the 
Remuneration Committee in both 
cases following an annual review. The 
review takes account of fees paid for 
similar positions in the market, the time 
commitment required from the Director 
(estimated to be 100 days per year for the 
Chairman and 20 days per year for the 
other Non-Executive Directors) and any 
additional responsibilities undertaken, such 
as acting as Chairman to one of the Board 
Committees or fulfilling the role of Senior 
Independent Director. Non-Executive 
Directors are not eligible to receive pension 
entitlements or bonuses and may not 
participate in share option schemes.

In late 201 1 the Committee undertook its 
usual review of remuneration (including 
considering the results of an independent 
benchmarking of executive salaries and the 
Non-Executive Chairman’s fees). However, 
in view of the current macro-economic 
environment and the Company’s clear focus 
on cost control, all Board members, both 
Executive and Non-Executive, agreed to 
freeze their current salary and fee levels for 
201 2. This freeze takes place notwithstanding 
the potential for increases noted as a result 
of the Committee’s normal review process. 
In taking this decision, the Board noted the 
Group-wide salary increase budget which 
was set at 2% for 2012.
19
   Remuneration policy for  
Executive Directors
Remuneration policy is based on  
the following broad principles set  
by the Committee:
•	 to provide a competitive remuneration 
package to attract and retain quality 
individuals;
•	 to align remuneration to drive the overall 
objectives of the business;
•	 to align the interests of management 
with the interests of shareholders; and
•	 to provide the foundation for overall 
reward and remuneration beyond the 
specific roles falling within the direct 
remit of the Remuneration Committee.
The objective of this policy is aligned 
with the recommendation of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code on Directors’ 
remuneration. That is to provide a level 
of remuneration ‘to attract, retain and 
motivate Directors of the quality required 
to run the Company successfully, but 
avoid paying more than is necessary for 
this purpose. A significant proportion of 
Executive Directors’ remuneration should 
be structured so as to link rewards to 
corporate and individual performance.’
In implementing its policy, the Committee 
gives full consideration to the principles set 
out in the UK Corporate Governance Code 
with regard to Directors’ remuneration 
and due regard is given to the guidance 
issued by investor protection bodies and 
institutional investors more generally.
Remuneration policy is reviewed on an 
ongoing basis against the Committee’s 
broad principles and in light of emerging 
best practice in corporate governance. 
The Committee believes that it continues 
to take into account the principles of 
sound risk management when setting 
pay. A substantial proportion of the current 
remuneration packages of the executive 
directors is weighted towards long-term 
performance with annual bonus also the 
subject of part deferral into the Company’s 
shares. Clawback provisions also apply 
in the event of a mis-statement of the 
Company’s results and a broad range 
of financial and non-financial targets are 
included in our incentive programmes. 
Appropriate liaison takes place between 
the Remuneration and Audit Committees 
as part of an effective remuneration risk 
assessment process. In line with the 
Association of British Insurers’ (ABI’s) 
Guidelines on Responsible Investment 
Disclosure, the Committee ensures that 
the incentive structure for Executive 
Directors and senior management will not 
raise environmental, social or governance 
(ESG) risks by inadvertently motivating 
irresponsible behaviour. More generally, 
with regard to the overall remuneration 
structure, there is no restriction on the 
Committee which prevents it from taking 
into account corporate governance on 
ESG matters and it takes due account of 
issues of general operational risk when 
structuring incentives. The Committee 
takes due account of remuneration 
structures elsewhere in the Group when 
setting pay for the Executive Directors

Governance 
Directors’ remuneration report (for example, consideration is given to the 
overall salary increase budget and the 
incentive structures that operate across 
the Group). 
The Group operates a leadership and 
development programme which includes 
an appraisal system for Directors 
and senior management. In 201 1 
the appraisal system used balanced 
scorecards to assess performance 
against safety, customer, people and 
community objectives. The results 
of the annual appraisal system are 
taken into consideration when setting 
remuneration levels.

  Fixed versus variable remuneration
A substantial proportion of the Executive 
Directors’ pay is performance related. 
The charts below show the balance 
between fixed and performance related 
pay at target and maximum performance 
levels based on the elements of National 
Express’s remuneration package set out 
overleaf. Maximum performance assumes 
achievement of maximum bonus and full 
vesting of shares under the LTIP .

  Elements of remuneration
The components of the Executive Directors’ 
remuneration are summarised overleaf.
 (i) Basic salary
The salary of individual Executive Directors 
is reviewed at 1 January each year. 
Account is taken of the performance of the 
individual concerned, together with any 
change in responsibilities that may have 
occurred and the rates for similar roles in 
two comparator groups of companies. 
The comparator groups for the 201 1 
financial year were (i) a group of transport/
leisure sector companies and (ii) a group of 
companies from the FTSE Mid 250 drawn 
from across all sectors. The constituents 
of each group were selected to be broadly 
reflective of the size (market capitalisation 
and turnover) and complexity of National 
Express at the time of completing 
the review. For 2012 the comparator 
groups will be based on similar groups 
of transport/leisure and general sector 
companies drawn from the FTSE 250 
when considering pay increases for 2013. 
In setting the Executive Directors’ 
remuneration, due account is taken of the 
salary budget for the Group as a whole 
and the policy that is applied across all 
employees when setting individual 
  Fixed versus variable remuneration

salary levels. In line with this policy, the 
performance of each Executive Director is 
taken into account along with the results 
of comparative benchmarking. In light of 
these factors, and after taking into account 
broader economic conditions, salary levels 
are then set by the Committee. As noted 
earlier, the Board agreed that no increases 
in salary or fees levels would take place 
for 2012 given current macro-economic 
conditions and the Company’s clear focus 
on cost control. 
 (ii) Performance related bonus
The maximum potential bonus payable to 
Executive Directors in 201 1 was 125% of 
salary for Dean Finch and 1 12.5% of salary 
for Jez Maiden. A maximum of 60% of 
salary was payable based on achievement 
against a sliding scale of challenging 
normalised profit targets (the definition of 
normalised profit is set out in the Glossary 
on page 153) and a maximum of 40% of 
salary was payable based on non-financial 
targets that encompassed customer, 
operational excellence and people 
objectives. (To achieve standardisation 
of bonus structure across the Group 
the split between financial and non-
financial objectives was adjusted to 60% 
financial objectives and 40% non-financial 
objectives for the Executive Directors.)

The additional maximum of 25% of salary 
available to the Group Chief Executive 
and 12.5% of salary available to the Group 
Finance Director was payable based on 
achievement against a challenging sliding 
scale of margin improvement targets 
(the definition of margin is set out in the 
Glossary on page 153) which, along with 
normalised profit, reflect the key short-term 
financial objectives of the Group. 
In relation to the proportion of the bonus 
determined by performance against 
financial targets, Executive Directors 
receive 25% of the bonus upon achieving 
95% of budget, 50% of the bonus upon 
achieving budget and 100% upon 
achieving a stretch target which, for 201 1, 
was 1 10% of budget.
The targets set in relation to non-
financial performance are key strategic 
Group objectives that are tailored to the 
responsibilities of each individual Executive 
Director and, in aggregate, are considered 
to be similarly challenging to the range of 
financial targets set. In addition, no bonus 
in respect of non-financial performance 
is payable unless 95% of the Group’s 
normalised profit budget is achieved. It 
is a pre-condition to the award of any 
bonus that the Remuneration Committee 
has determined that there has been a 
material improvement in safety processes, 
procedures and outcomes during the year 
in the relevant business unit before any 
bonus is paid.
Bonuses are subject to a 25% deferral 
requirement into the Company’s shares 
for a period of one year. Deferred shares 
are awarded under the Executive Deferred 
Bonus Plan (EDBP). Receipt of the deferred 
shares is subject to continued service and 
the same ‘good leaver’ provisions and 
other terms as noted for the Long Term 
Incentive Plan below. The 201 1 bonus also 
included clawback provisions that require 
the deferred shares to be forfeited or repaid 
should it be necessary for the Company 
to restate materially its 201 1 results within 
a two year period following the deferred 
bonus being awarded. The proportion of 
the bonus that would be the subject to a 
clawback would depend on the extent to 
which the original bonus payment turned 
out to be false following the publication of 
corrected results. 
In terms of an overview of the 201 1 bonus 
plan and the extent to which targets were 
met, this is set out in the table overleaf.

Governance 
Directors’ remuneration report As described in the table below bonuses 
were payable at 125% of salary for the 
Group Chief Executive and 1 12.5% 
of salary for the Finance Director. In 
calculating these bonuses, the Committee 
considered the safety performance of the 
Company and concluded that a continued 
improvement in safety processes, 
procedures and outcomes during the year 
had been achieved.
Deferred bonuses awarded in 201 1 (based 
on performance to 31 December 2010) 
vested, subject to the terms of the award 
on 25 February 2012 as set out in the table 
on page 68.
For 2012 bonus payments will be based on 
a similar structure as detailed above. Any 
material changes to the Company’s annual 
bonus policy for 2012 from the policy 
described above would, as a minimum, 
be disclosed and explained in next year’s

 (iii) Pensions
Under the terms of their service 
agreements, Executive Directors are not 
entitled to become members of one of 
the Group pension schemes instead they 
receive payment of a fixed percentage  
of salary. Dean Finch receives a 35%  
salary supplement and Jez Maiden 
receives a 25% salary supplement in  
lieu of pension contributions. 
 (iv) Incentive scheme and share options 
 (a) Long-term incentive arrangements
The National Express Group Long Term 
Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) was approved 
by shareholders at the 2005 AGM and 
operates as the Company’s sole type of 
executive long-term incentive arrangement. 
The LTIP consists of annual awards of 
Performance and Matching shares.  
Details of the plan are provided below.
The Committee approved minor changes 
to the LTIP during the year to allow a 
proportion of future awards to be made as 
approved share options under a HMRC 
approved option plan structure. 
This change does not increase the gross 
benefit to the participant or the costs to  
the Company or shareholders.
 Performance shares
Executive Directors are eligible to receive 
a conditional award of shares up to an 
equivalent of 100% of basic salary.  
The vesting of the award is conditional  
on meeting the performance conditions  
set out below.
 Matching shares
Executive Directors are also eligible to 
receive awards of matching shares that are 
based on a personal investment in National 
Express Group PLC shares funded either 
through using an annual bonus award 
to purchase shares or through pledging 
of shares held not already allocated to 
the LTIP . Matching awards are made on 
the basis of up to two Matching shares 
being awarded (based on the pre-tax 
value of the investment) for each National 
Express share pledged or purchased. 
The maximum value of investment in any 
year is 30% of basic salary. Matching 
62 share awards are also conditional on the 
performance conditions set out below. 
If a participant ceases employment before 
vesting for a ‘compassionate’ reason (eg 
redundancy, retirement, death in service, 
sale of business out of the Company’s 
group) his/her awards will ordinarily vest. 
The extent of vesting will be determined 
by applying the relevant performance 
conditions to the date of cessation and 
scaling back the number of shares 
awarded on a pro rata basis (rounded up 
to the next complete six month period from 
the date of grant) unless the Committee 
determines that it would be inappropriate 
to apply a pro rata reduction. Awards  
lapse on cessation of employment for  
any other reason.
24
  LTIP performance conditions
There are normally two distinct 
performance conditions applying to 
awards of both Performance Shares  
and Matching Shares made. 
First, the performance condition attached 
to one-half of an award (Part ‘A’) is 
based on the Company’s normalised 
diluted earnings per share (EPS) growth 
performance in excess of inflation over 
a fixed three-year period (three financial 
years commencing with the financial year 
in which the award is made).

 1
 For 2009 TSR applies to 100% of the award. For 2010 and 2011 TSR applies to 50% of the award and EPS applies to 50% of the award.
The performance condition attached to the 
other half of an award (Part ‘B’) is based 
on the Company’s Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR) performance over the same 
fixed three-year period relative to the TSR 
performance of a bespoke comparator 
group of transport companies taken 
predominantly from the FTSE Industrial 
Transportation and FTSE Travel & Leisure 
sectors. The companies comprising the 
comparator group have been chosen on 
the basis of their comparability to National 
Express Group PLC (based on their  
size and scope of business operations). 
The Committee has retained the power 
in respect of this element of an award to 
apply an earnings underpin.
There is no ability to retest either 
performance condition. EPS and TSR have 
generally been chosen for the LTIP as the 
most appropriate measures of the Group’s 
long term performance, since EPS is an 
important growth measure considered 
within the Company and a driver of 
shareholder value and TSR improves 
shareholder alignment and is consistent 
with the Company objective of providing 
superior long-term returns to shareholders.
For awards granted in 201 1 the EPS 
performance conditions applying to Part A 
of the Awards and the TSR performance 
conditions applying to part B of the Awards 
are set out in the table below.
To determine vesting of LTIP awards, 
the Committee retains independent 
consultants to test the proportion of an 
award vesting under the relative TSR test 
and then reviews the conclusion of this 
analysis before shares formally vest. With 
regard to the EPS targets, vesting is based 
on the Company’s audited results with 
liaison, as required, between the Audit  
and Remuneration Committees. 
The table below sets out the percentage  
of each extant award that would have 
vested if the performance conditions  
had been tested at 31 December 201 1 
(without making any allowance for pro  
rata reduction for any period of less than 
three years).
63
Governance 
Directors’ remuneration report  Performance criteria
The Committee believes that budgeted 
profit and/or EPS growth as performance 
measures for the discretionary bonus 
scheme and long term incentives, in  
most normal circumstances, provide  
a transparent and accessible method 
of gauging the financial performance of 
the Company. The Company calculates 
performance against these performance 
measures by reference to the profit or 
earnings per share figures reported in 
the Company’s audited accounts, which 
the Company believes to be the most 
transparent and objective measure of the 
Company’s profit or EPS. The Committee 
also monitors the Group’s TSR against 
the FTSE All-Share Travel & Leisure Index 
as a broad measure of the Company’s 
performance. TSR measured against a 
more tailored group of comparators has 
been used by the Company as a primary 
performance measure for awards made 
to Executive Directors under the LTIP as 
outlined on page 67 .
It is currently intended that the 
performance targets that will apply to 
awards granted in 2012 will again be an 
equal blend of EPS and TSR. If it were 
considered appropriate to make any 
fundamental changes to the performance 
targets in 2012, it is anticipated that this 
would be accompanied by a consultation 
with major shareholders.

  Directors’ minimum shareholding
In order to align the interests of the 
Directors more closely with the 
shareholders, the Remuneration 
Committee has also determined that the 
Executive Directors should build up a share 
fund equal to at least one year’s current 
salary over a period of five years. 
The graphs below show a comparison 
of National Express Group PLC total 
cumulative shareholder return against that 
achieved by the FTSE All-Share Travel & 
Leisure Index and the FTSE 250 Index. 
These indices have been selected because 
the Company is a constituent of each index 
(with the former including many members 
of the LTIP TSR peer group) and the 
Committee, therefore, feels that these are 
the most appropriate indices to represent 
the Company’s relative performance. 
27
  Directors’ service contracts, notice 
periods and termination payments
 Executive Directors
The contract dates and notice periods for 
the Executive Directors are shown in the 
table on page 65.
The service contracts of both the Executive 
Directors, which are rolling contracts, 
contain a provision, exercisable at the 
option of the Company, to pay an amount 
on early termination of employment equal 
to one year’s salary or, in the case of Dean 
Finch, one year’s salary, salary supplement
26
 
in lieu of pension and car allowance.  
The Company will use the payment in 
lieu of notice provisions when the speed, 
certainty and protection of restrictive 
covenants afforded by such clauses  
are thought to be in the best interests  
of the Company and the circumstances 
surrounding the departure of the relevant 
Director justify their use. 
In any event the Committee’s policy is 
that payments to Directors on termination 
should reflect the circumstances that 
prevail at the time, also taking account, if 
applicable and appropriate, the Director’s 
duty to mitigate.
The Committee continuously reviews 
its policies on executive remuneration 
and severance in the best interests of 
shareholders. Guidance on best practice 
expectations is taken into account prior to 
agreeing directors’ contractual provisions. 
28
  Executive Directors’ external 
appointments
Under the terms of their service 
agreements, Board approval is required 
before any external appointment may be 
accepted by an Executive Director. The 
Executive Director is permitted to retain  
any fees paid for such services. Details  
of fees received by Executive Directors  
in 201 1 are shown below.
64 29
  Non-Executive Directors’ 
appointments
The Non-Executive Directors do not have 
service contracts with the Company but 
are appointed for an initial three-year term. 
Non-Executive Directors are typically 
expected to serve for two three-year 
terms, although their appointment can be 
terminated either by them or the Company 
on one month’s written notice. It is open to 
the Company to invite a Non-Executive to 
serve for a further period after the expiry 
of two three-year terms. All Directors are 
required to stand at least once every three 
years for re-appointment by shareholders. 
The original appointment dates of the 
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors  
are shown below.

  Conditional award of shares  
to Dean Finch
As disclosed in prior years, Dean Finch 
was granted a share award in relation 
to his appointment as Group Chief 
Executive under a one-off arrangement in 
accordance with Listing Rule 9.4.2 (2). 
The share award comprised two parts, 
an award of 28,023 shares (the ‘First 
Award’) and an award of 18,281 shares 
(the ‘Second Award’). Each award is 
structured as an award of forfeitable shares 
in compensation for forfeited remuneration 
in relation to joining the Company. The 
First Award vested on 1 April 201 1 and the 
Second Award will ordinarily vest on 1 April 
2012, subject to the terms of the award. 
At the time of vesting the relevant shares 
subject to the awards will cease to be 
subject to a risk of forfeiture.
  Conditional award of shares  
to Jez Maiden
As disclosed in prior years, Jez Maiden 
was granted a share award under a similar 
one-off arrangement to that described 
above for Dean Finch in respect of his 
appointment as Group Finance Director  
in 2008.
The award comprised three parts, an 
award over 21,07 4 shares (the ‘First Award’), 
an award over 21,075 shares (the ‘Second 
Award’) and an award over 28,666 shares 
(the ‘Third Award’). Each award was 
structured as a conditional right to free 
shares, the terms of which were set after 
taking account of Jez Maiden’s forfeited 
awards (which included performance  
and non-performance awards). The First 
and Second Awards have now vested. 
The Third Award, which was due to vest 
on 17 November 201 1, did not vest as the 
performance targets applicable, which 
were identical to those set for the 2008 
LTIP awards were not met. Details  
of the performance targets (a mix of 
earnings per share and shareholder return 
targets are set out in note 4 to the LTIP 
awards table on page 67 .

 The aggregate gain on the shares which were exercised in 2011 was £65,000.

  The extent of vesting of the Third Award was dependent on the satisfaction of performance targets assessed over a three year performance period. The performance targets 
applying to the Third Award were identical to those set for the 2008 LTIP awards, (a mix of earnings per share and shareholder return targets). At the end of the Performance 
Period, the TSR performance and the EPS performance had both been such as to cause 0% of the relevant part of the award to vest.

 Notes
 1
  Details of the performance conditions applicable to the 2011 awards are shown on page 63.
 2
  The TSR performance conditions applicable to the 2010 awards are the same as for the 2011 awards and the relevant maximum and minimum EPS figures are 28 pence  
and 23 pence.
 3
  EPS targets were not applicable to 2009 awards as the prevailing economic conditions made it difficult to set a robust range of EPS targets and the TSR performance 
condition (as described on page 63) was applied as the sole performance condition to 100% of the award. To ensure that the relative condition was supported by improved 
underlying financial performance, awards made in 2009 were also subject to an earnings underpin that applies to the extent that the TSR performance condition is met.
 4
  The TSR performance conditions applicable to the 2008 awards were the same as for the 2011 awards and the relevant maximum and minimum EPS figures were  
6% and 3% inflationary growth. Performance and Matching shares granted under the LTIP on 10 April 2008 expired on 10 April 2011. At the end of the performance period 
TSR performance and EPS performance had been such as to result in 0% of the relevant part of the award to vest.
 *  Market price at date of award restated to reflect the rights issue on 15 December 2009.

  Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) 
awards
Performance shares of 1 x salary are 
awarded to Executive Directors as nil cost 
options under the Long Term Incentive

awarded as nil cost options based on up 
to two Matching shares being awarded for 
each invested share (as described earlier) 
to a maximum of 1 20% of salary under the 
share matching element of the LTIP . Further 
details of the LTIP and the performance 
conditions that have applied to each award 
below are shown on page 63 and in the

Employment policies
The Group strives to meet its business 
objectives by motivating and encouraging 
its employees to be responsive to the 
needs of its customers and continually 
improve operational performance. The 
Group is committed to providing equality 
of opportunity to employees and potential 
employees. This applies to appropriate 
training, career development and 
promotion for all employees, regardless of 
physical ability, gender, sexual orientation, 
religion, age or ethnic origin. All businesses 
in the Group report diversity data.
Full and fair consideration is given to 
applications for employment received 
from disabled persons, according to their 
skills and capabilities. The services of 
any existing employee disabled during 
their period of employment are retained 
wherever possible.
Employee involvement
The Group encourages employee 
involvement in its affairs. Subsidiary 
companies produce a range of internal 
newsletters and circulars which keep 
employees abreast of developments. 
Senior management within the Group meet 
regularly to review strategic developments 
and management conferences are held 
at Group and business levels to bring our 
senior managers together to share ideas 
and develop policy. Dialogue takes place 
regularly with trade unions and other 
employee representatives on a wide range 
of issues. Employees are able to share 
in the Group’s results through various 
employee share schemes.
Governance
Directors’ report 69
Governance 
Directors’ report Employee views are also sought 
through regular employee satisfaction 
questionnaires, both within business units 
and across the Group. Following such 
surveys, results are shared with employees 
and action plans are put in place to deal 
with issues arising. The Group’s Innovation 
programme gives high priority to employee 
engagement as well as seeking the 
opinions of our customers.
The Group places considerable emphasis 
on the development of its employees 
through individual development plans. 
A scheme to focus on the identification  
and development of our high potential staff 
was launched in 2010. Succession plans 
are in place in each business and these  
are monitored by the Board.
Environmental policy
Information on the Group’s environmental 
initiatives can be found in the Corporate 
Responsibility Review on page 40  
and in the Corporate Responsibility 
section of the Company’s website, 
nationalexpressgroup.com, where you 
will find Corporate Responsibility reports, 
policies and other information.
Charitable and political contributions
Charitable donations made during the  
year totalled £228,000 (2010: £151,000).  
It is the Group’s policy not to make political 
donations and accordingly none were 
made in the year. However, the Company 
did attend party political conferences 
during the year for which total expenditure 
was £6,000 (2010: £14,000).
Creditors’ payment policy and 
practice
It is the Company’s policy to agree terms  
of payment prior to commencing trade  
with any supplier and to abide by those 
terms based on the timely submission  
of satisfactory invoices. 
Trade creditor days of the Company for the 
year ended 31 December 201 1 were 17 
days (2010: 23 days) based on the ratio  
of Company trade creditors at the end of 
the year to the amounts invoiced during  
the year by trade creditors.
Financial instruments
Details of the use by the Company and its 
subsidiaries of financial instruments and 
any related risk management objectives 
and policies (including hedging policy) and 
exposure (including price, credit, liquidity 
or cash flow risk) of the Company in 
connection with such financial instruments 
can be found in the Notes to the 
Consolidated Accounts on pages 81  
to 136 and are incorporated by reference 
into this report.
Major shareholdings
Disclosures of major shareholdings  
notified to the Company pursuant to 
DTR5 are shown on page 53 and these 
disclosures are incorporated by reference 
into this report.
Share capital and rights attaching  
to the Company’s shares
Under the Company’s Articles of 
Association, any share in the Company 
may be issued with such rights or 
restrictions, whether in regard to dividend, 
voting, return of capital or otherwise as 
the Company may from time to time by 
ordinary resolution determine (or, in the 
absence of any such determination, as  
the Directors may determine). 
At 31 December 201 1, the Company’s 
issued share capital consisted of a single 
class of ordinary shares with a nominal 
value of 5 pence. At a general meeting of 
the Company every member has one vote 
on a show of hands and on a poll one vote 
for each share held. The Notice of AGM 
accompanying this document, specifies 
deadlines for exercising voting rights either 
by proxy or by being present in person in 
relation to resolutions to be passed at a 
general meeting. Details of the authorised 
and issued share capital of the Company 
and details of shares issued during the year 
can be found in note 32 on page 124. 
As at 29 February 2012, the Company  
held a total of 1,668,688 ordinary 5 pence 
shares (nominal value £83,434) in treasury 
equal to 0.33% of the issued share capital.
No shareholder is, unless the Board 
decides otherwise, entitled to attend or 
vote either personally or by proxy at a 
general meeting or to exercise any other 
right conferred by being a shareholder if he 
or she or any person with an interest in his 
or her shares has been sent a notice under 
Section 793 of the Companies Act 2006 
(which confers upon public companies the 
power to require information with respect 
to interests in their voting shares) and he 
or she or any interested person failed to 
supply the Company with the information 
requested within 14 days after delivery of 
that notice. The Board may also decide 
that no dividend is payable in respect of 
those default shares and that no transfer 
of any default shares shall be registered. 
These restrictions end seven days after 
receipt by the Company of a notice of an 
approved transfer of the shares or all the 
information required by the relevant Section 
793 notice, whichever is earlier.
The Directors may refuse to register 
any transfer of any share which is not a 
fully-paid share, although such discretion 
may not be exercised in a way which the 
Financial Services Authority regards as 
preventing dealings in shares of that class 
from taking place on an open or proper 
basis. The Directors may likewise refuse 
any transfer of a share in favour of more 
than four persons jointly.
The Company is not aware of any other 
restrictions on the transfer of ordinary 
shares in the Company other than:
•	 certain restrictions that may from 
time to time be imposed by laws and 
regulations (for example, insider trading 
laws); and
•	 pursuant to the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Services Authority whereby 
certain employees of the Company 
require approval of the Company to  
deal in the Company’s shares.
The Company is not aware of any 
agreements between shareholders that 
may result in restrictions on the transfer  
of securities or voting rights.
Resolutions will be proposed at the 2012 
AGM to authorise the Directors to exercise 
all powers to allot shares, or grant rights  
for, or to convert any security into, shares, 
and approve a limited disapplication of 
statutory pre-emption rights. Details are set 
out in the Notice of AGM accompanying 
this document.
The Company was granted authority at the 
AGM in 201 1 to purchase its own shares 
up to an aggregate value of 10% of the 
issued nominal capital. The authority was 
not used during the year. The authority 
is renewed annually and approval will be 
sought at the AGM in 2012 for its renewal. 
Further details are set out in the Notice of 
AGM accompanying this document.
Governance
Directors’ report continued 70 Share schemes
The IFG Trust (Jersey) Limited, as Trustee 
of the National Express Group Employee 
Benefit Trust, as at 29 February 2012 held 
314,528 shares (0.06% of the share capital) 
of the Company for employee share 
schemes. Further details of the Company’s 
employee share schemes can be found in 
note 7 on page 95 and are incorporated  
by reference into this report. The Trustee 
may vote the shares held by the Trust at  
its discretion.
Articles of Association
Any amendments to the Company’s 
Articles of Association may be made in 
accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting (AGM) will  
be held at 2.00pm on 10 May 2012 at 
Kings Place, 90 York Way, London, 
N1 9AG. At the meeting, special resolutions 
will be proposed to authorise the Directors 
to issue shares without applying statutory 
pre-emption rights, to authorise the 
Company to make market purchases 
of its own shares and to authorise the 
calling of general meetings (other than 
Annual General Meetings) on 14 clear 
days’ notice. Full details are provided in 
the Notice of Meeting. If you would like 
to register any question you may have in 
advance of the AGM you can do so at 
agm@nationalexpress.com or you can 
write to the Company Secretary at National 
Express Group PLC, National Express 
House, Birmingham Coach Station, Mill 
Lane, Digbeth, Birmingham B5 6DD.
Powers of the Directors
Subject to its Articles of Association and 
relevant statutory law and to any direction 
that may be given by the Company in 
general meeting by special resolution, 
the business of the Company shall be 
managed by the Directors, who may 
exercise all powers of the Company which 
are not required to be exercised by the 
Company in general meeting.
Material contracts and change  
of control agreements
The Company is party to a number of 
banking agreements which allow for 
notification of change of control within 
five days of becoming aware of the event 
following which repayment of outstanding 
commitments is to be made within 
30 days.
Under the terms of the £1,000,000,000 
Euro Medium Term Note Programme 
under which the Company issued Medium 
Term Notes (MTNs) to various institutions 
on 13 January 2010, there is a change 
of control put option such that, upon a 
change of control event, any holder of any 
MTN may require the Company to redeem 
or purchase that MTN. 
The Group currently runs one DfT 
franchise: c2c. The National Express East 
Anglia franchise was transferred to Abellio 
Greater Anglia Limited on 6 February 2012. 
The rail franchise agreement with DfT 
contains termination rights for the benefit of 
DfT which would be triggered by a change 
of control in National Express Group PLC.
The Group’s rail franchisee, c2c, leases 
its rolling stock and its leases with 
Porterbrook Leasing Company Limited 
contain termination rights for the benefit 
of the lessor which would be triggered by 
a change of control in National Express 
Group PLC.
The Group’s North American business 
operates school bus services under 
contracts with school boards. Those 
contracts invariably contain a change of 
control clause for the benefit of the board 
which would be triggered by a change of 
control in National Express Group PLC. 
While no one single school bus contract 
could be considered significant in  
the context of the Group turnover,  
the impact on that turnover in the  
event that each school board exercised  
its termination right on a change of  
control would be significant.
Directors’ and employees’ service 
contracts
There are no agreements between the 
Company and its Directors or employees 
providing for compensation for loss of 
office or employment (whether through 
resignation, purported redundancy or 
otherwise) that occurs because of a 
takeover bid.
Auditor
Following a competitive tender process 
during the year, Ernst & Young LLP 
resigned as auditor of the Company 
on 10 June 201 1 and Deloitte LLP was 
appointed in their place on 14 June 201 1. 
Resolutions to re-appoint Deloitte LLP as 
auditor of the Company and to authorise 
the Directors to fix their remuneration will 
be proposed at the 2012 AGM.
Disclosure of information to auditor
The Directors confirm that, so far as 
they are aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s 
auditor is unaware and that each Director 
has taken all the steps that they ought  
to have taken as a Director in order to 
make themselves aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that  
the Company’s auditor is aware of  
that information.
Risks
A summary of the Company’s risk 
management framework and an overview 
of its principal risks are detailed on pages 
37 to 39 and are incorporated by reference 
into this report.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together 
with the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position 
are set out in the Business Review. The 
financial position of the Group, its cash 
flows, liquidity position and borrowing 
facilities are described in the Group Chief 
Executive’s review on pages 3 to 7 and 
the Financial Review on pages 32 to 37 . In 
addition, note 30 to the financial statements 
includes the Group’s objectives, policies 
and processes for managing its capital; 
its financial risk management objectives; 
details of its financial instruments and 
hedging activities; and its exposure to 
credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has a formalised process of 
budgeting, reporting and review, which 
provides information to the Directors  
which is used to ensure the adequacy  
of resources available for the Group  
to meet its business objectives.
The Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the 
Group have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for a 
period of at least 12 months from the date 
of signing the accounts. Accordingly they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting in preparing the annual 
financial statements.

  Statement of Compliance with  
the UK Corporate Governance Code 
In the opinion of the Directors, the 
Company has complied with the provisions 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
issued by the Financial Reporting  
Council in 2010 save in respect of the 
following provisions:
  B.2.1 The Composition of the 
Nomination Committee
Jorge Cosmen, who is a member of the 
Nomination Committee, is not considered 
to be independent. However, as Deputy 
Chairman and the representative of one  
of the Company’s largest shareholders,  
the Board considers Mr Cosmen should be 
a member of the Nomination Committee 
in order to be involved in the recruitment 
process for Board appointments.
  C.3.1 The Composition of the Audit 
Committee and D.2.1 The Composition 
of the Remuneration Committee
Following the resignation of Roger 
Devlin the Audit Committee and the 
Remuneration Committee consisted of two 
Non-Executive Directors for a short period 
until the appointment of Chris Muntwyler  
to the Audit Committee and Lee Sander  
to the Remuneration Committee in 
November 2011.
36
  Re-election of Directors
In accordance with the Company’s 
Articles of Association, and the principles 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
published by the Financial Reporting 
Council in 2010, Directors of the Company 
will offer themselves for re-election at this 
year’s AGM. Non-Executive Directors are 
appointed for specific terms, subject to re-
election. Non-Executive Directors will only 
be put forward for re-election if, following 
performance evaluation, the Board believes 
the Director’s performance continues to be 
effective and demonstrates commitment 
to the role. 
  Remuneration and service contracts 
of Directors
The Directors’ Remuneration Report, 
including details of remuneration policy  
and service contracts, is set out on  
pages 58 to 68.
37
  Directors’ conflicts of interest
The Board has a procedure in place to 
deal with a situation where a Director 
has a conflict of interest, as required by 
the Companies Act 2006. As part of 
this process, the members of the Board 
prepare a list of other positions held 
and all other conflict situations that may 
need authorising either in relation to the 
Director concerned or his/her connected 
persons. The Board considers each 
Director’s situation and decides whether to 
approve any conflict situations, taking into 
consideration what is in the best interests 
of the Company and whether the Director’s 
ability to act in accordance with his or her 
wider duties is affected. Each Director is 
required to notify the Company Secretary 
of any potential or actual conflict situations 
that will need authorising by the Board. 
Authorisations given by the Board are 
reviewed annually.
  Accountability and audit
Statements of the respective 
responsibilities of the Directors and 
auditors are set out on pages 7 4 and 75.
  Directors’ and Officers’ Liability 
Insurance
The Company purchases Directors’

  Internal control statement
 The Board’s responsibilities
The Board has overall responsibility for 
the Group’s system of internal control and 
for reviewing its effectiveness. The Board 
maintains full control and direction over 
appropriate strategic, financial, operational 
and compliance issues and has put in 
place an organisational structure with 
formally defined lines of responsibility, 
delegated authorities and clear operating 
processes. The systems that the Board 
has established are designed to safeguard 
both the shareholders’ investment and  
the assets of the Group, and are  
described as follows. 
72   Key elements of the control framework
Financial reporting process – 
management and specialists within the 
Finance Department are responsible for 
ensuring the appropriate maintenance of 
financial records and processes to ensure 
that all information is relevant, reliable and 
in accordance with the applicable laws 
and regulations, and distributed both 
internally and externally in a timely manner. 
A review of the consolidation and financial 
statements is completed by management 
to ensure that the financial position and 
results of the Group are appropriately 
reflected. All financial information published 
by the Group is subject to the approval  
of the Audit Committee.
Performance management – the 
performance of each division and 
operating company against its plan is 
closely monitored by a formal monthly 
reporting process and by the attendance 
of the relevant Executive Directors at 
monthly divisional executive meetings.
Annual fitness check process – internal 
audit undertake an annual review at each 
operating company to assess the integrity 
of the balance sheet and to check the 
effective operation of key financial reporting 
and information systems controls. The 
results of the reviews are presented to 
both divisional and Group finance with any 
required actions agreed with the relevant 
divisional Finance Director.
Strategic and financial planning –  
an annual budgeting and strategic planning 
process has been established whereby 
each division and constituent operating 
company assesses its competitive position 
and goals, taking account of the strategic 
risks faced. This strategy is translated into 
a financial plan with clear milestones and 
performance indicators.
Capital investment – a clear process 
is in place for the approval of capital 
expenditure, which includes detailed 
appraisal of the benefits of the proposed 
investment and any associated key risks. 
Material capital expenditure requires  
Board approval.
Health and safety – health and safety 
standards and benchmarks have  
been established in all our businesses  
and the performance of operating 
companies in meeting these standards  
is closely monitored.
Risk management reporting process 
– each division and operating company 
evaluates its internal control environment 
and key risks, and the results are reviewed 
at management level and passed to  
the Audit Committee before being 
presented to the Board. This process  
is reviewed on a regular basis to ensure  
the validity and relevance of the key  
risks included in reports. The review  
covers strategic, financial, compliance 
and risk management controls. These 
procedures are mandated and designed  
to manage the risk in order to ensure  
that the operations achieve their  
business objectives.
Internal audit – the internal control 
system is independently monitored and 
supported by a Group internal audit 
function. The internal audit function reports 
to management and the Audit Committee 
on the Group’s financial and operational 
controls, and monitors and reviews the 
extent to which its recommendations have 
been implemented.
Board-level reporting on internal 
control – during the year the Audit 
Committee reviews regular reports from 
the internal audit function, the external 
auditors and executive management on 
matters relating to internal control, financial 
reporting and risk management. The Audit 
Committee provides the Board with an 
independent assessment of the Group’s 
financial position, accounting affairs and 
control systems. In addition, the Board 
receives regular reports on how specific 
risks that are assessed as material to the 
Group are being managed.
  Review of internal control effectiveness
The system of internal control and risk 
management, described above, has been 
in place for the year under review and  
up to the date of approval of this Annual 
Report and Accounts. Such a system 
is designed to manage, rather than to 
eliminate, the risks inherent in achieving 
the Group’s business objectives, and can 
therefore provide only reasonable and 
not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. The effectiveness  
of this system has been regularly reviewed 
by the Directors in line with the Guidance 
on Audit Committees, published by the 
Financial Reporting Council in December 
2010. Where significant control failings 
or weaknesses have been identified, 
appropriate corrective action has  
been taken.
39
  Whistle blowing policy
‘Whistle blowing’ policies are in place in 
each of the Group’s businesses and are 
also available on the Group’s website 
www.nationalexpressgroup.com. The 
Board supports the highest standards of 
corporate governance and ethical practices 
within all its operations and continues to 
review its policies on an ongoing basis. 
The Board has endorsed a set of principles 
which establish the framework for how 
its businesses operate. Key to these is 
working in an open and honest manner. 
The Group is committed to the highest 
standards of quality, honesty, openness 
and accountability. Employees are 
encouraged to raise genuine concerns 
under the policy either by contacting their 
line manager or telephoning a dedicated 
external helpline. Any concerns raised 
are investigated carefully and thoroughly 
to assess what action, if any, should 
be taken and confidential records are 
maintained. The Company Secretary 
reports any matters of significance to the 
appropriate committee. In 201 1 no issues 
of significance were raised.
 Anti-bribery policy
A Group Anti-Bribery policy has been 
established and issued to all Group 
companies and is also available  
on the Group’s website at 
nationalexpressgroup.com. The policy 
prohibits any inducement which results  
in a personal gain or advantage to the 
recipient or any person or body associated 
with them, and which is intended to 
influence them to take action which may 
not be solely in the interests of the Group 
or of the person or body employing them 
or which they represent. The prevention, 
detection and reporting of bribery is  
the responsibility of all employees 
throughout the Group. Employees 
can report confidentially any suspicion 
of bribery via an externally facilitated 
whistleblower hotline.

Directors’ responsibilities statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law  
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required 
to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the parent Company financial statements in accordance 
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under 
company law the Directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. 
In preparing the parent Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
•	 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
•	 make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
•	 state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements; and
•	 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue  
in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
•	 properly select and apply accounting policies;
•	 present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; 
•	 provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and
•	 make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
•	 the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as  
a whole; and
•	 the business review, which is incorporated into the Directors’ report, includes a fair review of the development and performance  
of the business and the position of the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together  
with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Independent Auditor’s Report  
to the Members of National Express Group PLC
We have audited the Group financial statements of National Express Group PLC for the year ended 31 December 201 1 which comprise 
the Group Income Statement, the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Group Balance Sheet, the Group Statement of 
Changes in Equity, the Group Cash Flow Statement and the related notes 1 to 38. The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state  
to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions  
we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the Group 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion  
on the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).  
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation 
of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies  
we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Group financial statements:
•	 give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 201 1 and of its profit for the year then ended;
•	 have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
•	 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the Group financial statements are prepared  
is consistent with the Group financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
•	 certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
•	 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
•	 the Directors’ statement, set out on page 71, in relation to going concern; 
•	 the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for our review; and
•	 certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on Directors’ remuneration.
Other matters
We have reported separately on the parent Company financial statements of National Express Group PLC for the year ended 
31 December 201 1 and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.

Notes to The Consolidated Accounts 
1 Corporate information  
The consolidated accounts of National Express Group PLC and its subsidiaries (‘the Group’) for the year ended 31 December 
2011 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 29 February 2012. National Express  
Group PLC is a public limited company incorporated in England and Wales whose shares are publicly traded on the London 
Stock Exchange.  
The principal activities of the Group are described in the Business Review that accompanies these accounts.  
2 Accounting policies  
Statement of compliance  
These accounts have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and interpretations  
of the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) as adopted by the European Union (EU), and with those 
parts of the Companies Acts 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.  
The Group has previously disclosed that its accounting policy relating to the Railways Pension Scheme (RPS) represents a 
departure from the requirements of IAS 19. This was principally based on an assessment performed at the time of adoption  
of IFRS in 2005. During the current period, the Directors have reviewed the accounting standards and current industry practice, 
and have concluded that the Group’s accounting policy complies with IAS 19. 
Basis of preparation  
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis (see Directors’ report on page 71) under the historical 
cost convention, except for the recognition of derivative financial instruments and available for sale investments.  
The consolidated accounts are presented in pounds Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand 
Pounds (£0.1m) except where otherwise indicated.  
A summary of the Group’s accounting policies applied in preparing the accounts for the year ended 31 December 2011 is set 
out below. 
Significant accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
The preparation of accounts in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the accounts and the reported amounts  
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge, 
actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates.  
The most significant judgements were: 
Tax provisions 
Assessing the outcome of uncertain tax positions requires judgements to be made regarding the result of negotiations with and 
enquires from tax authorities in a number of jurisdictions. The assessments made are based on advice from independent tax 
advisors and the status of ongoing discussions with the relevant tax authorities. 
The key accounting estimates are: 
Goodwill and impairment 
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which 
goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise 
from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. Details of the assumptions used 
are set out in note 14 to the accounts. 
Retirement benefit obligations 
Determining the amount of the Group’s retirement benefit obligations and the net costs of providing such benefits requires 
assumptions to be made concerning long-term interest rates, inflation, salary and pension increases, investment returns and 
longevity of current and future pensioners. Changes in these assumptions could significantly impact the amount of the 
obligations or the cost of providing such benefits. The Group makes assumptions concerning these matters with the assistance 
of advice from independent qualified actuaries. Details of the assumptions made are set out in note 34. 
Insurance  
The estimation of the insurance provisions is based on an assessment of the expected settlement on known claims together with 
an estimate of settlements that will be made in respect of incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date but for which claims 
have not been reported to the Group.   Notes to the Consolidated Accounts

Basis of consolidation  
The consolidated accounts comprise the accounts of National Express Group PLC and all its subsidiaries drawn up to 
31 December each year. Adjustments are made to bring any dissimilar accounting policies that may exist into line with the 
Group’s accounting policies.  
On acquisition of a business, the purchase method of accounting is adopted, and the Group income statement includes the 
results of subsidiaries and businesses purchased during the year from the date control is assumed. The purchase consideration 
is allocated to assets and liabilities on the basis of fair value at the date of acquisition. On the sale of a business, the Group 
income statement includes the results of that business to the date of disposal.  
Intragroup transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.  
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of comprehensive income and equity in subsidiaries that is not attributable to the 
parent Company shareholders and is presented separately from parent shareholders’ equity in the consolidated balance sheet.  
Interests in joint ventures  
The Group has a number of contractual arrangements with other parties to share control of other entities which represent  
joint ventures.  
The Group recognises its interest in the entity’s assets and liabilities using the equity method of accounting. The Group balance 
sheet includes the appropriate share of these joint ventures’ net assets or liabilities and the income statement includes the 
appropriate share of their results after tax.  
Accounts of jointly controlled entities are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group. Adjustments are made in the 
Group’s accounts to eliminate the Group’s share of unrealised gains and losses on transactions between the Group and its 
jointly controlled entities. The Group ceases to use the equity method from the date it no longer has joint control over the entity.  
Interests in associates  
Companies, other than subsidiaries and joint ventures, in which the Group has an investment representing not less than 20%  
of the voting rights and over which it exerts significant influence are treated as associates. The consolidated accounts include  
the appropriate share of these associates’ results and net assets based on their latest accounts under the equity method.  
Changes in accounting policies  
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year and there have been no changes in 
accounting standards during the year that have had a material effect on the Group. 
Income statement presentation  
The income statement has been presented in a columnar format to enable users of the financial statements to view the 
normalised results of the Group. Normalised results are defined as the statutory results before the following, as appropriate:  
profit or loss on the sale of businesses, exceptional profit or loss on the sale of non-current assets and charges for goodwill 
impairment, amortisation of intangible assets, exceptional items and tax relief on qualifying exceptional items and intangibles.  
Exceptional items  
Exceptional items are material items of income or expenditure which, in the opinion of the Directors, due to their nature and 
infrequency require separate identification on the face of the income statement to allow a better understanding of the financial 
performance in the year, in comparison to prior years.

Revenue recognition  
Rendering of services  
Revenue comprises income from road passenger transport, train passenger services and related activities in the UK, North 
America and Europe. Where appropriate, amounts are shown net of rebates and sales tax.  
Revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the customer’s travel or services provided under contractual 
arrangements as a proportion of total services to be provided.  
UK Rail revenue includes amounts attributed to the train operating companies (TOCs), based principally on agreed models  
of route usage by Railway Settlement Plan Limited (which administers the income allocation system within the UK rail industry),  
in respect of passenger receipts. In addition, net franchise agreement receipts from the Department for Transport Rail Division 
(DfT Rail) and local Passenger Transport Executives (PTEs) are treated as revenue. Net franchise agreement payments to DfT Rail 
are recognised in operating costs. UK Coach revenue comprises amounts receivable generated from ticket sales. UK Bus and 
European Coach & Bus revenue comprises amounts receivable generated from ticket sales and revenue generated from  
services provided on behalf of local transport authorities, which is recognised as the services are provided. For all the divisions 
noted above, the relevant share of season ticket or travelcard income is deferred within liabilities and released to the income 
statement over the life of the relevant season ticket or travelcard. North American Bus revenue from school boards and similar 
contracts is recognised as the services are provided.  
Rental income  
Rental income is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  
Finance income  
Revenue is recognised using the effective interest method.  
Government grants  
Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are included in liabilities as deferred income and are credited to  
the income statement over the expected useful economic life of the assets concerned. Other grants are credited to the income 
statement as the related expenditure is expensed.  
Segmental reporting  
Each of the Group’s business and geographical segments provides services that are subject to risks and returns that are 
different from those of the other business segments. Due to the nature of the Group’s operations the distinct business segments 
align directly with geographical segments which are operating in separate economic environments.  
The Group’s segments comprise: UK Bus; UK Coach; UK Rail; North American Bus; European Coach & Bus; and Central 
functions. These segments are described in more detail in the Operating Review accompanying these accounts.  
Leases  
Leases of property, plant and equipment where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed  
to the Group, are capitalised in the balance sheet as property, plant and equipment. Finance leases are capitalised at the lower 
of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum lease payments. The capital element of future 
obligations under hire purchase contracts and finance leases is included as a liability in the balance sheet. The interest element  
of rental obligations is charged to the income statement over the period of the lease and represents a constant proportion of the 
balance of capital repayments outstanding. Property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases are depreciated over 
the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term.  
Leases of property, plant and equipment where a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by  
the lessor are classified as operating leases. Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Incentives received under operating leases and initial direct costs in negotiating  
the lease are amortised to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.  
All material arrangements and transactions entered into by the Group are reviewed to check whether they contain elements  
that meet the accounting definition of a lease, although they may not follow the legal form of a lease.   Notes to the Consolidated Accounts

Borrowing costs  
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when incurred except where they are directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of a qualifying asset, in which case they are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset. 
Current tax and deferred tax  
Current tax is provided on taxable profits earned according to the local tax rates applicable where the profits are earned.  
Income taxes are recognised in the income statement unless they relate to an item accounted for in other comprehensive  
income or equity, in which case the tax is recognised directly in other comprehensive income or equity. The tax rates and  
tax laws used to compute the current tax are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.  
Deferred tax is provided in full in respect of all material temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases  
of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes, apart from the following exceptions:  
• where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill;  
• where an asset or liability is recognised in a transaction that is not a business combination and that at the time of the 
transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss; and  
• in respect of investment in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures where the Group is able to control the reversal  
of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.  
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary 
differences reverse based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.  
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that future taxable profits will be 
available against which the underlying temporary differences can be deducted. Their carrying amount is reviewed at each 
balance sheet date on the same basis. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and when the 
Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.  
Intangible assets  
Intangible assets acquired separately that meet the recognition criteria of IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’, are capitalised at cost  
and when acquired in a business combination are capitalised at fair value at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, 
finite life assets are amortised on a straight-line basis and indefinite life assets are not amortised. The amortisation expense is 
taken to the income statement through operating expenses.  
The existing finite life intangible assets have a residual value of nil and are amortised over their estimated useful lives as follows:  
Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment and the useful lives of finite life intangible assets are 
examined on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis. Finite life assets are reviewed 
for impairment where indicators of impairment exist. 
The Group’s indefinite life intangible assets include customer relationships and goodwill. Customer relationship intangible assets 
are recognised only on contracts where historical experience has shown that these contracts are consistently renewed.  
Customer contracts  – over the life of the contract (between 1 and 33 years)  
Right to operate TOC franchises  – over the life of the franchise (between 1 and 7 years)

Software  
Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised separately as an intangible asset 
and is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Costs include software licences, 
consulting costs attributable to the development, design and implementation of the computer software and internal costs directly 
attributable to the development, design and implementation of the computer software. Costs in respect of training are expensed 
as incurred. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method so as to charge the cost of the computer software to the 
income statement over its estimated useful life (seven years).  
The carrying value of intangibles is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value 
may not be recoverable.  
Goodwill  
Goodwill on acquisition is initially measured at cost being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Group’s 
interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. Following initial recognition, goodwill is 
stated at historic cost less any accumulated impairment. If an acquisition gives rise to an excess of the acquirer’s interest in the 
net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over cost (previously referred to as negative 
goodwill), this is credited immediately to the income statement.  
In accordance with IFRS 3, goodwill is not amortised. All goodwill is subject to an annual test of impairment and an impairment 
charge recognised as required.  
Fair value accounting adjustments are made in respect of acquisitions. Fair value adjustments based on provisional estimates are 
amended within one year of the acquisition if required, with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill, in order to refine 
adjustments to reflect further evidence gained post acquisition.  
Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and all or part of that unit is disposed of, the associated goodwill is included 
in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on the disposal of the operation.  
Property, plant and equipment  
All property, plant and equipment is stated at historic cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. 
Under the transitional arrangements of IFRS 1, the Group elected to deem the fair value of certain revalued assets to be 
equivalent to cost.  
Land and buildings comprise mainly vehicle depots and garages, and offices. Freehold land is not depreciated. Other property, 
plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows:  
Useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis. 
Repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.  
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected  
to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the derecognition of the asset is included in the income 
statement in the period of derecognition.  
Freehold buildings  – 30 to 50 years  
Long leasehold property improvements  – 15 to 40 years  
Public service vehicles  – 8 to 15 years  
Plant and equipment, fixtures and fittings  – 3 to 15 years   Notes to the Consolidated Accounts

2 Accounting policies continued 
Impairment of non-financial assets  
All non-current assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable, except for indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill which are reviewed annually. An 
impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount which  
is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are 
grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows.  
In assessing value in use, the estimated risk adjusted future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. Impairment losses are recognised in the 
income statement in expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.  
Except for goodwill impairments, a review is made at each reporting date of any previous impairment losses to assess whether 
they no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated and any 
previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to assess the 
recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is 
increased, subject to a limit of the asset’s net book value had no previous impairment loss been recognised. Such reversal is 
recognised in the income statement. Future depreciation or amortisation is then adjusted to allocate the asset’s revised carrying 
amount over its remaining useful economic life. Impairments to goodwill cannot be reversed.  
Financial instruments  
The Group determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition. The Group classifies its financial assets  
in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, and available-for-sale. The classification 
depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired.  
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss  
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified in this 
category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading 
unless they are designated as hedges. Assets in this category are classified as current assets.  
Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value, and transaction costs are expensed 
in the income statement. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the ‘financial assets at fair value through profit 
or loss’ category are presented in the income statement within finance costs in the period in which they arise.  
Loans and receivables  
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date which  
are classified as non-current assets. The Group’s loans and receivables comprise ‘trade and other receivables’ and ‘cash  
and cash equivalents’ in the balance sheet.  
Available-for-sale financial assets  
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the 
other categories. They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within  
12 months of the balance sheet date.  
The Group’s investments in entities that are not subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures are classified as available-for-sale 
financial assets. After initial recognition these assets are measured at fair value with gains or losses being recognised as a 
separate component of equity until the investment is derecognised or the investment is determined to be impaired, at which  
time the previously reported cumulative gain or loss is included in the income statement. Where there is no active market for  
the Group’s investments, fair value is determined using valuation techniques including recent commercial transactions and 
discounted cash flow analyses. In the absence of any other reliable external information, assets are carried at cost or amortised 
cost as appropriate.  
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial 
assets is impaired. In the case of equity securities classified as available for sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair 
value of the security below its cost is considered as an indicator that the securities are impaired. If any such evidence exists for 
available-for-sale financial assets, the cumulative loss – measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current 
fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in profit or loss – is removed from equity and 
recognised in the income statement. Impairment losses recognised in the income statement on equity instruments are not 
reversed through the income statement.

Derivative financial instruments  
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency forward exchange contracts, fuel derivatives and 
interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency, fuel price and interest rate fluctuations. Such derivative 
financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value for the reported balance 
sheet. The fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts, interest rate and fuel derivatives is calculated by reference 
to market exchange rates, interest rates and fuel prices at the period end.  
The Group’s fuel derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that 
is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity, and the ineffective portion in the income statement. The 
gains or losses deferred in equity in this way are recycled through the income statement in the same period in which the hedged 
underlying transaction or firm commitment is recognised in the income statement.  
The Group’s interest rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges. The gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised 
immediately in the income statement. The carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted through the income statement for the 
gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, in this case movements in the risk free interest rate. 
Foreign currency derivatives are used to hedge the Group’s net investment in foreign currency denominated operations and  
to the extent they are designated and effective as net investment hedges are matched in equity against foreign exchange 
exposure in the related assets and liabilities. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement when 
the foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold. Foreign currency forward contracts are also used to hedge transactional 
exposures. These contacts are not hedge accounted and all gains and losses are taken direct directly to the income statement. 
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, gains or losses are taken directly to the income statement in  
the period.  
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires, is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies  
for hedge accounting.  
Inventories  
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value on a FIFO basis, after making due allowance for obsolete  
or slow moving items. 
Pre-contract costs  
Pre-contract costs associated with securing new rail franchises are expensed as incurred up to the point when a franchise is 
awarded. From this point in time, they are recognised as an asset and are expensed to the income statement over the life of the 
franchise. Costs associated with the commencement of all new contracts other than rail franchises are expensed as incurred.  
Trade and other receivables  
Trade and other receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectible 
amounts. Doubtful debts are provided for when collection of the full amount is no longer probable, whilst bad debts are written 
off when identified.  
Cash and cash equivalents  
Cash and cash equivalents as defined for the cash flow statement comprise cash in hand, cash held at bank with immediate 
access, other short-term investments and bank deposits with maturities of three months or less from the date of inception  
and bank overdrafts. In the consolidated balance sheet, cash includes cash and cash equivalents excluding bank overdrafts. 
Bank overdrafts that have no legal right of set-off against cash and cash equivalents are included within borrowings in  
current liabilities.  
Trade and other payables  
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective  
interest method.  
Interest-bearing borrowings  
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at cost being the net fair value of the consideration received plus transaction 
costs that are directly attributable to the issue of the financial asset or liability. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans  
and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.   Notes to the Consolidated Accounts  
88
2 Accounting policies continued 
Insurance  
The Group’s policy is to self-insure high frequency claims within the businesses. To provide protection above these types of 
losses the Group purchases insurance cover from a selection of proven and financially strong insurers. The insurance provision  
is based on estimated exposures at the year end principally for claims arising in the UK and North America prior to the year-end 
date, subject to the overall stop loss within the Group’s insurance arrangements. The majority of provisions will be utilised within 
six years, and the provision has been discounted to take account of the expected timing of future cash settlements.  
Pensions and other post-employment benefits  
The Group has a number of pension schemes, both of a defined benefit and defined contribution nature. Full details are provided 
in note 34.  
The balance sheet position in respect of defined benefit schemes comprises the net value for each scheme of the present value 
of the relevant defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets. The trustees complete a full 
actuarial valuation triennially, separately for each plan, but the obligation is updated annually for financial reporting purposes by 
independent actuaries, using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the obligation is determined by the estimated 
future cash outflows discounted using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds which have terms to maturity equivalent to 
the terms of the related liability.  
The current service cost and gains and losses on settlements and curtailments are recognised in staff pension costs within 
operating costs in the income statement. Past service costs are included in operating costs where the benefits have vested, 
otherwise they are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The finance elements of the pension cost, 
comprising the expected return on assets of funded defined benefit schemes and the interest on pension scheme liabilities,  
are also included in operating costs. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial 
assumptions are charged or credited to other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.  
Our TOCs participate in the RPS, a defined benefit scheme which covers the whole of the UK rail industry. This is partitioned  
into sections and the Group is responsible for the funding of these sections whilst it operates the relevant franchise. In contrast  
to the pension schemes operated by most businesses, the RPS is a shared cost scheme, which means that costs are formally 
shared 60% by the employer and 40% by the employee. A liability is recognised in line with other defined benefit schemes in the 
Group, although this is offset by a franchise adjustment so that the net liability represents the deficit that the Group expects to 
fund during the franchise term.  
The charges in respect of defined contribution schemes are recognised when they are due. The Group has no legal or 
constructive obligation to pay further contributions into a defined contribution scheme if the fund has insufficient assets to pay  
all employees benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.  
Share-based payment  
The Group awards equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees, under which the Group receives services from 
employees as consideration for equity instruments (options) of the Group. The fair value of the employee services received in 
exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference 
to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market service and performance vesting conditions  
(for example, profitability, sales growth targets and remaining an employee of the entity over a specified time period). Non-market 
vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest. The total amount 
expensed is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be 
satisfied. At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based  
on the non-market vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income 
statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.  
Provisions  
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is  
probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount can be  
made. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance 
sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material using a pre-tax discount rate. The amortisation  
of the discount is recognised as a finance cost.  
Contingent liabilities are obligations that arise from past events that are dependent on future events. They are disclosed in the 
notes to the accounts where the expected future outflow is not probable.

Share capital, share premium and dividends  
Where either the Company or employee share trusts purchase the Company’s equity share capital, the consideration paid, 
including any transaction costs, is deducted from total shareholders’ equity as Own shares until they are cancelled or reissued. 
Any consideration subsequently received on sale or re-issue is included in shareholders’ equity.  
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Group’s accounts on the date when 
dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised in the period they are paid.  
Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations  
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered 
principally through a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable. They are stated at the lower of carrying amount 
and fair value less costs to sell if their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than 
through continuing use.  
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group that has been disposed of, or is classified as held for sale and it either 
represents a separate major line of business or geographical area; is part of a plan to dispose of a separate major line of 
business or geographical area; or was an acquired subsidiary intended for resale. The resulting profit or loss from discontinued 
operations is reported separately in the income statement.  
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets once classified as held for sale are not depreciated or amortised.  
Foreign currencies  
The trading results of foreign currency denominated subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are translated into Sterling,  
the presentation currency of the Group and functional currency of the parent, using average rates of exchange for the year  
as a reasonable approximation to actual exchange rates at the dates of transactions.  
The balance sheets of foreign currency denominated subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are translated into Sterling  
at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end and exchange differences arising are taken directly to the translation reserve in 
equity. On disposal of a foreign currency denominated subsidiary, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in the translation 
reserve (since 1 January 2004 under the transitional rules of IFRS 1) relating to that entity is recognised in the income statement. 
All other translation differences are taken to the income statement, with the exception of differences on foreign currency 
borrowings and forward foreign currency contracts which are used to provide a hedge against the Group net investments in 
foreign enterprises. These are taken directly to equity until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised 
in the income statement.  
New standards and interpretations not applied  
The IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards, interpretations and amendments with an effective date after the  
date of these financial statements, which the directors expect may have a material impact on the accounts of the Group in  
future periods: 
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013) – the standard 
establishes the principles for the presentation of consolidated accounts when an entity controls one or more other entities. 
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013) – the standard determines the 
type of joint arrangement by assessing the rights and obligations, and accounts for those rights and obligations in accordance 
with that type of joint arrangement. 
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other entities (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013) – the standard 
sets out the requirements to disclose information that enables users of accounts to evaluate the nature of, and risks associated 
with, its interests in other entities and the effects of these interests on its financial position, financial performance and cash flows.  
IFRS 13 Fair value measurement (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013) – the standard defines fair 
value, and a framework for measuring fair value. 
IAS 19 Employee benefits (revised) (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013) – the standard will impact 
the measurement of the various components representing movements in the defined benefit pension obligation and associated 
disclosures, but not the Group’s total obligation. It is likely that following the replacement of expected returns on plan assets  
with a net finance cost in the income statement, the profit for the period will be reduced and accordingly other comprehensive 
income increased.

5 Segmental analysis 
The operating businesses are organised and managed separately according to the nature of the public transport services they 
provide and the geographical market they operate in. Commentary on the segments is included in the Business Review. 
Analysis by class and geography of business 
Inter-segment sales represent rail replacement services provided to UK Rail by UK Bus and UK Coach. Inter-segment trading  
is undertaken on standard arm’s length commercial terms. Due to the nature of the Group’s businesses, the origin and 
destination of revenue is the same. No single external customer amounts to 10% or more of the total revenue.

(b) Share schemes continued  
(i) Executive Share Option Plan  
The Company operates tax approved and unapproved executive share option schemes open to Group employees in senior 
management positions. Options granted by this Plan have a maximum term of 10 years. The options vest after three years 
subject to the satisfaction of certain performance criteria
1
 based on the achievement of a target growth in earnings per share.  
If the performance criteria are not met when initially tested, in some instances they may be reassessed during the term of the 
option. From 2005 executive share option grants have been replaced by awards made under the Long Term Incentive Plan,  
as described in (ii). There are no cash settlement alternatives.  
(ii) Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)  
The LTIP was introduced in 2005 on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee to replace the annual award under 
the Executive Share Option Plan to Executive Directors and to certain senior employees. Under the LTIP, a Performance Award 
to acquire a specified number of free shares may be made to the employee or Director. In addition, a Matching Award may be 
made, as described in (iii). Performance conditions are attached to the vesting of Performance and Matching Awards based on 
both the achievement of target growth in earnings per share and the relative total shareholder return (TSR) of the Company 
against a comparator group of companies. If the performance conditions are met, Performance and Matching Awards vest on 
the third anniversary of the grant date and remain exercisable for a period of up to six months following the vesting date. There 
are no cash settlement alternatives at present.  
In 2011 an HMRC approved share option plan was added as an appendix to the LTIP (‘Approved Plan’). A participant can only 
hold an option under the Approved Plan over shares with a market value of up to £30,000 at the grant date. Options under the 
Approved Plan are granted in tandem with the usual options under the LTIP. The options are structured such that on exercise, 
the proportion of the gain in respect of the first £30,000 worth of shares (as measured at the date of grant) will be delivered 
under the Approved Option and the LTIP option shall be scaled back to deliver the remaining gross gain that would have been 
delivered had the option been granted alone. The excess shares under the LTIP will be forfeited such that both awards will never 
become fully vested. 
(iii) Share Matching Plan (the ‘Plan’)  
The Share Matching Plan was introduced in 2005 as part of the new Long Term Incentive Plan arrangements described in (ii). 
Under the Plan, a Matching Award to acquire a specified number of shares for free may be made if the employee pledges a 
number of shares as investment shares which are then matched by the Company on up to a 2:1 basis with the number of shares 
that could have been purchased with the pre-tax equivalent of the amount invested. The Matching Awards vest on the third 
anniversary of the grant date and remain exercisable for a period of up to six months following the vesting date. There are no 
cash settlement alternatives at present.  
(iv) Deferred Annual Share Bonus Plan  
The Deferred Annual Share Bonus Plan is a discretionary scheme which forms part of the bonus arrangements for certain senior 
employees. Under the scheme, part of any bonus may be received in cash whilst the remainder is used to make an award of nil 
cost options which vest three years after the award date. The options must be exercised within six months of vesting. There are 
no cash settlement alternatives at present.  
(v) West Midlands Travel Ltd (WMT) Long Service Option Scheme  
The WMT Long Service Option Scheme utilises a fixed amount of shares set aside for this purpose following the acquisition of 
WMT in 1995 and is open to all WMT employees who have been in service for more than 25 years. The options are exercisable 
between three and ten years following the grant date. There are no cash settlement alternatives.  
(vi) TWM Share Incentive Plan (the ‘SIP’)  
The TWM SIP exists for the benefit of WMT employees. At the end of the year, 908 (2010: 908) National Express Group PLC 
shares were held for the benefit of the Trustee. Dividends on shares held in the SIP forfeited shares account are waived. There 
are no cash settlement alternatives.

(vii) Savings Related Share Option Scheme (Sharesave Scheme)  
The National Express Group approved Sharesave Scheme enabled eligible UK employees, including Executive Directors, to 
acquire shares in the Company through monthly savings over a three-year period, at the end of which they also received a tax 
free bonus. The savings and bonus could be used to purchase shares at a discounted option price set at the beginning of the 
savings contract. The options matured three years after the grant date and could be exercised for a period of up to six months 
after this date. There are no cash settlement alternatives.

 Performance criteria for Executive Share Option Plan:  
(a) Options granted under the 2002 National Express Group Executive Share Option Plan Part 2 Unapproved.  
(b) For options granted in 2002 and 2003, the performance condition is as follows: (a) for awards up to 50% of salary; EPS growth of RPI + 4% pa, (b) 
for awards between 51% of salary and up to 100% of salary; EPS growth of RPI + 6% pa, (c) for awards between 101% of salary and up to 150% of 
salary; EPS growth of RPI + 8% pa, (d) for awards between 151% of salary and up to 200% of salary; EPS growth of RPI + 10% pa. Parts (a) and (b) 
are initially tested over years 0-3 with a facility to retest over years 0-4 and 0-5. Parts (c) and (d) are not subject to retesting. Straight-line vesting 
occurs between EPS levels.  
(c)  For options granted in 2004, the performance condition is as follows: (a) for awards up to 50% of salary; EPS growth of RPI + 4% pa, (b) for awards 
between 51% of salary and up to 100% of salary; EPS growth of RPI + 5% pa, (c) for awards between 101% of salary and up to 150% of salary; EPS 
growth of RPI + 6% pa, (d) for awards between 151% of salary and up to 200% of salary; EPS growth of RPI + 10% pa. Performance is tested over 
years 0-3. Straight-line vesting occurs between EPS levels. Retesting is not permitted. 
(viii) Executive Deferred Bonus Plan 
As detailed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report, the Committee considered it appropriate for bonuses awarded in respect  
of the calendar year to be deferred for a period of one year and that these would vest, subject to the terms of the award and the 
relevant Director’s continuing employment. The deferred forfeitable ordinary shares are awarded under the terms of The National 
Express Group Executive Deferred Bonus Plan which was adopted by the Board of the Company on 10 March 2009.  
The principal terms of awards under the Executive Deferred Bonus Plan are summarised below: 
• awards under the Plan may be cash awards, conditional awards or forfeitable shares awards; 
• awards normally vest one year from the date of grant, subject to the relevant Director’s continued employment with  
the Company; 
• the Committee may decide that participants shall be entitled to receive a benefit determined by reference to the value of the 
dividends that would have been paid on the vested shares in respect of dividend record dates occurring during the period 
between the grant date and the date of vesting; and 
• the awards will normally lapse on cessation of employment save in certain compassionate ‘good leaver’ circumstances  
(eg death or disability). 
In the event of a variation of the share capital of the Company, the Committee may make such adjustments to the awards  
as it considers appropriate.  Notes to the Consolidated Accounts

8 Share-based payment 
The charge in respect of share-based payment transactions included in the Group’s income statement for the year is as follows: 
There were no exceptional costs included within the charge during the year (2010: £0.9m). 
During the year ended 31 December 2011, the Group had eight share-based payment arrangements, which are described  
in note 7(b).  
For the following disclosure, share options with a nil exercise price have been disclosed separately to avoid distorting the 
weighted average exercise prices. The number of share options in existence during the year was as follows: 
1
 Included within this balance are options over 21,342 (2010: 92,209) shares for which no expense has been recognised in accordance with the 
transitional provisions of IFRS 2 as the options were granted before 7 November 2002. Although there has been subsequent modification to the 
options, no IFRS 2 charge has been recognised as the amounts are not material. 
The options outstanding at 31 December 2011 had exercise prices that were between 129p and 604p (2010: between 117p  
and 604p) excluding options with a nil exercise price. The range of exercise prices for options was as follows: 
The options have a weighted average contractual life of one year (2010: one year). Options were exercised regularly throughout 
the year and the weighted average share price at exercise was 241p (2010: 229p).

8 Share-based payment continued 
The weighted average fair value of the share options granted during the year was calculated using a stochastic model, with the 
following assumptions and inputs: 
Experience to date has shown that approximately 24% (2010: 15%) of options are exercised early, principally due to leavers.  
This has been incorporated into the calculation of the expected option life for the share options without nil exercise price. 
Expected volatility in the table above was determined from historical volatility over the last eight years, adjusted for one-off events 
that were not considered to be reflective of the volatility of the share price going forward. The expected dividend yield represents 
the dividends declared in the 12 months preceding the date of the grant divided by the average share price in the month 
preceding the date of the grant. 
For share options granted during the year under the LTIP, the TSR targets have been reflected in the calculation of the fair value 
of the options above. 
9 Net finance costs 
The 2010 exceptional charge of £2.0m relates to residual unamortised loan fees as a result of refinancing the Group’s syndicated 
credit facility. On 12 July 2010, the Group’s £800m multi-currency syndicated credit facility (maturity June 2011), was replaced 
with a new four year £500m facility. The remaining unamortised fees relating to the £800m facility were taken to the income 
statement as an exceptional cost.

(c) Reconciliation of the total tax charge/(credit) 
(d) Temporary differences associated with Group investments 
No deferred tax (2010: £nil) is recognised on the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, as the Group 
has determined that these undistributed profits will not be distributed in the near future. As a result of changes to tax legislation  
in 2009, overseas dividends received on or after 1 July 2009 are generally exempt from UK corporation tax, but may be subject 
to withholding tax. There are no temporary differences (2010: £nil) associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and 
joint ventures, for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised but for which a tax liability may arise. 
(e) Unrecognised tax losses 
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for tax loss carry-forwards to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit 
against future taxable profits is probable. UK and overseas deferred tax assets that the Group has not recognised in the 
accounts amount to £40.3m (2010: £37.0m), which arise in tax jurisdictions where the Group does not expect to generate 
sufficient suitable future profits. In addition, there are capital losses of £7.1m (2010: £7.5m) which have not been recognised, 
recoverability of which is dependent on capital gains arising.  
(f) Deferred tax included in the income statement 
Details on the balance sheet position of deferred tax are included in note 27. 
(g) Factors that may affect future tax charges 
In the June 2010 Budget Statement, it was announced that the main rate of UK corporation tax would reduce from 28% to 27% 
on 1 April 2011. The legislation was enacted in July 2010. On March 2011, the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer announced a 
further 1% reduction in the UK corporation tax rate to 26% effective from 1 April 2011, along with subsequent reductions of 1% 
each year to a final rate of 23% from 1 April 2014. 
At the balance sheet date, a rate of 25% (2010: 27%) was substantively enacted. The change in rate from 27% to 25% has 
resulted in a tax credit of £0.4m to the income statement. 
The proposed changes to reduce the UK corporation tax rate from 25% to 23% on 1 April 2014 will have a similar effect  
in future years.

(h) UK tax settlement  
During 2011, there have been no exceptional tax charges or credits. 
During 2010, the Group entered into discussions with HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) to settle a number of UK corporation  
tax issues. Negotiations were concluded and the Group agreed to a liability of £16.8m, including interest, to be paid in 
instalments. This resulted in an exceptional tax release of £32.1m. 
11 Discontinued operations 
In 2011 there were no material movements arising from discontinued operations. 
The 2010 cash flows from discontinued operations include an outflow of £1.8m in relation to North America Public Transit 
(disposed in 2005), an outflow of £1.6m in relation to Dot2Dot (disposed in 2009) and an outflow of £0.1m in relation to  
the Group’s Australian operations (discontinued in 2009). 
In 2010 a £0.3m loss from discontinued operations was recognised in relation to Dot2Dot and a £0.1m loss in relation  
to the Australian operations. 
12 Dividends paid and proposed 
13 Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to equity shareholders of £101.2m (2010: £61.4m)  
by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by employee share ownership 
trusts and those held as treasury shares which are both treated as cancelled. 
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year is adjusted to include  
the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary 
shares into ordinary shares. 
The reconciliation of basic and diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares is as follows: 
The normalised basic and normalised diluted earnings per share have been calculated in addition to the basic and diluted 
earnings per share required by IAS 33 since, in the opinion of the Directors, they reflect the underlying performance of the 
business’ operations more appropriately.

14 Intangible assets continued 
Indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill have been allocated to individual cash-generating units for annual impairment testing 
on the basis of the Group’s business operations. The carrying value of indefinite life intangible assets by cash-generating unit is 
as follows: 
The useful economic lives of contractual relationships in North American Bus and European Coach & Bus are deemed to be 
indefinite where historical experience has shown that these contracts are consistently renewed. The customer contract and rail 
franchise intangible assets are amortised over the finite duration of the contract or franchise as appropriate. All amortisation 
charges in the year have been charged to operating costs. 
The recoverable amount of indefinite life intangible assets has been determined based on a value in use calculation using cash 
flow projections based on financial budgets and forecasts approved by senior management covering a five year period. Key 
assumptions, including growth rates and operating margins, are based on historical experience, detailed budget plans as well  
as management’s assessment of current market and economic conditions. Growth has then been extrapolated forward from  
the end of the forecasts.

The assumptions used for the cash-generating units, are as follows: 
The calculation of value in use for each cash-generating unit is most sensitive to the assumptions over operating profit margin, 
discount rates and revenue growth rates. 
The value in use of the North American Bus division exceeds its carrying amount by £31.5m (2010: £32.4m). Sensitivity analysis 
has been completed on each key assumption in isolation, and this indicates that the value in use of the division will be equal to  
its carrying amount following a reduction in operating profit margin of 50 basis points (2010: 50 basis points), an increase in the 
discount rate of 30 basis points (2010: 30 basis points) or a reduction in revenue growth rates of 100 basis points (2010: 110 
basis points). The continued non-impairment of North America is dependent upon continuing to deliver the margin recovery in 
future years. 
The value in use of the European Coach & Bus division exceeds its carrying amount by £176.8m (2010: £252.3m). Sensitivity 
analysis has been completed on each key assumption in isolation, and this indicates that the value in use of the division will be 
equal to its carrying amount following a reduction in operating profit margin of 260 basis points (2010: 380 basis points), an 
increase in the discount rate of 90 basis points (2010: 130 basis points) or a reduction in revenue growth rates of 410 basis 
points (2010: 620 basis points). The decrease in headroom and increased sensitivity reflects the Spanish macro-economic  
risks, which have been incorporated into the future cash flow assumptions (see Principal risk and uncertainties section for  
further details regarding how Group management recognises, prioritises and puts in place measures to mitigate these risks). 
It is believed that any reasonably possible movement on assumptions will not lead to an impairment of goodwill allocated  
to UK Coach. 
The Directors consider the assumptions used to be consistent with the historical performance of each cash-generating unit  
and to be realistically achievable in light of economic and industry measures and forecasts.

Cash and cash equivalents include restricted balances of £14.0m (2010: £21.7m) held by the UK Rail subsidiaries (TOCs). Under 
the terms of the train franchise agreements, cash can only be distributed by the TOCs either up to the value of retained profits or 
the amount determined by prescribed liquidity ratios. The restricted cash represents the balance that is either not available for 
distribution or the amount required to satisfy the liquidity ratio at the balance sheet date. 
Cash at bank and in hand earns interest at floating rates based on daily bank deposit rates. Short-term deposits are made for 
varying periods of between one day and three months depending on the immediate cash requirements of the Group and earn 
interest at the agreed short-term floating deposit rate. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents is equal to the carrying value. 
24 Current liabilities – trade and other payables 
Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are normally settled on 30 day terms and other payables are non-interest bearing

26 Provisions 
1
 The insurance claims provision arises from estimated exposures at the year end, the majority of which will be utilised in the next five years, and 
comprises provisions for existing claims arising in the UK and North America. 
2
 A provision was recognised in 2006 for the Group’s onerous contract for Eurostar with ICRRL. £9.0m (2010: £8.7m) was paid to ICRRL during  
the year. The remainder has been settled in 2012. 
3
 Other includes amounts provided for onerous property contracts, liabilities for future franchise exits within the UK Rail division, costs arising from 
restructuring activities and £4.6m of expected liabilities for a working time claim in North America. These amounts are expected to be settled during 
2012. Other non-current amounts are expected to be settled in 2013.  
When the effect is material, the provisions are discounted to their net present value. 
27 Deferred tax 
Based on current capital investment plans, the Group expects to be able to claim capital allowances in excess of depreciation  
in future years at a similar level to the current year. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities within the same jurisdiction have been offset.

The effective interest rates on loans and borrowings at the balance sheet date were as follows: 
1
 This date is the ultimate maturity date of the syndicated credit facility. 
During 2010, two new Sterling bonds with nominal values of £350m and £225m were issued under the £1bn EMTN. Following 
the issuance of the £350m bond in January 2010 the Group repaid its €270m Euro bank loan. The Group used the proceeds of 
the £225m bond to repay a portion of its £800m syndicated credit facility (maturity 5 June 2011). This facility was subsequently 
refinanced on 21 July 2010 and replaced with a £500m syndicated credit facility (maturity 31 August 2014).  
Under the terms of the £1bn EMTN programme, there is a change in control put option such that, upon a change of control 
event, any holder of any MTN may require the Company to redeem or purchase that MTN. 
Details of the Group’s interest rate risk management strategy and associated interest rate derivatives are included in notes  
30 and 31. 
The Group is subject to a number of financial covenants in relation to its syndicated credit facilities which, if contravened,  
could result in its borrowings under the facility becoming immediately repayable. These covenants specify maximum net debt  
to EBITDA and minimum EBITDA to net interest payable.

30 Financial risk management objectives and policies 
Financial risk factors and management 
The Group’s multinational operations and debt levels expose it to a variety of financial risks, of which the most material are 
market risks relating to fuel prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and the availability of funding at reasonable 
margins. The Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to manage the impact of these risks on the financial 
performance of the Group by using financial instruments including borrowings, committed facilities and forward foreign 
exchange, fuel and interest rate derivatives. 
The Board of Directors has delegated the responsibility for implementing the financial risk management policies laid down by the 
Board to the Group Finance Director and Group Treasurer. The policies are implemented by the Group Treasury department with 
regular reporting to the Group Finance Director on its activities.

Foreign currency 
The Group has major foreign operations in the US, Canada and Spain and as a result is exposed to the movements in foreign 
currency exchange rates on the translation of these foreign currency denominated net assets and earnings. These movements 
can have a significant impact on the Group’s reported results. The Group seeks to manage this foreign currency exchange 
movements risk by aligning its foreign currency denominated liabilities with the EBIT generated in each currency, such that  
some protection is afforded to the net debt: EBITDA covenant within the Group’s core borrowing facility. This is achieved by  
a combination of foreign currency borrowings and finance leases, and entering into derivative financial instruments such as  
cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchange swaps. At the year end, the Group had outstanding foreign exchange 
derivatives of €250.0m and US$195.0m; swaps of US$49.0m, €6.0m, C$7.0m and finance leases of US$182.3m and €16.6m. 
Derivative financial instruments are designated as net investment hedges of foreign currency assets. The effective portion  
of the gain or loss on the hedge is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income and recycled to the income  
statement at the same time as the underlying hedged net assets affect the income statement. Any ineffectiveness is taken  
to the income statement. 
The table below demonstrates the sensitivity of the Group’s financial instruments to a reasonably possible change in foreign 
exchange rates, with all other variables held constant. This would affect the Group’s profit before tax and translation reserve.  
The effect on the translation reserve represents the movement in the translated value of the foreign currency denominated loans 
and change in fair value of cross-currency swap contracts. These movements would be offset by an opposite movement in the 
translated value of the Group’s overseas net investments. It is estimated that a 10% change in the corresponding exchange  
rates would result in an exchange gain or loss in the translation reserve of £17.2m. 
Interest rate risk 
The Group is exposed to movements in interest rates on both interest-bearing assets and liabilities. It is the Group’s policy  
to maintain an appropriate balance between fixed and floating interest rates on borrowings in order to provide a level of certainty 
to interest expense in the short term and to reduce the year on year impact of interest rate fluctuations over the medium term.  
To achieve the desired fixed/floating ratio, the Group has entered into a series of interest rate swaps that have the effect of 
converting fixed rate debt to floating rate debt. The net effect of these transactions was that as at 31 December 2011 the 
proportion of Group net debt at floating rates was 16% (2010: 19%).  
The table below demonstrates the sensitivity of the Group’s financial instruments to a reasonably possible change in interest 
rates, with all other variables held constant, on the Group’s profit before tax and on the Group’s hedging reserve.  
The sensitivity analysis covers all floating rate financial instruments, including the interest rate swaps. If the interest rates 
applicable to floating rate instruments denominated in Sterling were increased by 100bps, it is estimated that the Group’s  
profit before taxation would decrease by approximately £1.3m. The Group does not hold significant floating rate instruments 
denominated in US$ or in Euro and it is therefore estimated that the Group’s profit before tax would change by less than £0.1m 
should the interest rates applicable to floating rate instruments denominated in US$ increase by 50bps, or should the interest 
rates applicable to floating rate instruments denominated in Euro increase by 75bps. The analysis assumes that the amount  
and mix of floating rate debt, including finance leases, remains unchanged from that in place at 31 December 2011.

Commodity prices 
The Group is exposed to movements in commodity prices as a result of its fuel usage. It is the Group’s policy to hedge this 
exposure in order to provide a level of certainty as to its cost in the short term and to reduce the year on year impact of price 
fluctuations over the medium term. This is achieved by entering into fuel derivatives. At 31 December 2011, the Group had 
hedged approximately 100% of its 2012 expected usage and 50% of its expected usage in 2013 (see the Financial review  
for further details).  
The table below demonstrates the effect of a reasonably possible variation in fuel prices, with all other variables held constant,  
on the fair value of the Group’s financial instruments and accordingly on the Group’s profit before tax and on the Group’s 
hedging reserve. 
The sensitivity analysis includes all fuel derivatives. The effect on the hedging reserve arises through movements on the fair value 
of the Group’s fuel derivatives. For these derivative contracts the sensitivity of the net fair value to an immediate 20% increase or 
decrease in all prices would have been £37.1m at 31 December 2011. The figure does not include any corresponding economic 
advantage or disadvantage that would arise from the natural business exposure which would be expected to offset the gain or 
loss on the derivatives. 
Credit risk 
The maximum credit risk exposure of the Group is the gross carrying value of each of its financial assets. This risk is mitigated  
by a number of factors. Many of the Group’s principal customers, suppliers and financial institutions with which it conducts 
business are public (or quasi-public) bodies, both national (DfT Rail and Network Rail in the UK) and local (school boards in  
North America, municipal authorities in Spain and Morocco, Transport for London and Centro in the UK). The Group does  
not consider these counterparties to pose a significant credit risk. Outside of this the Group does not consider it has significant 
concentrations of credit risk. The Group has implemented policies that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers 
before sales commence. 
The only elements of the Group’s financial assets which are not impaired but are past due are certain trade receivable items.  
An ageing of the assets which are past due is included in the table below. In terms of trade receivables that are neither impaired 
nor past due, there are no indications as at the year-end reporting date that the debtors will not meet their payment obligations 
(see Principal risks and uncertainties section for details of how management manages this process).

Liquidity risk 
The Group’s liquidity risk is managed centrally by the Group Treasury department with operating units forecasting their cash 
requirements. The Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and medium-term committed facilities that are designed  
to ensure the Group has sufficient available funds to meet current and forecast funding requirements. In managing the liquidity 
risk, the Group has access to a range of funding sources through the banking and capital markets.  
At 31 December 2011, the Group had committed bank borrowing and finance lease facilities of £620.5m (2010: £631.6m).  
The Group has a £500m committed unsecured revolving bank facility, maturing in August 2014, which was undrawn at 
31 December 2011 (2010: £460m). Letters of credit issued to support insurance retentions were £30.8m (2010: £39.4m).  
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities at 31 December 2011 based on the contractual 
undiscounted cash flows including interest cash flows. As such the amounts in this table will not agree to the carrying amounts 
disclosed in the Balance Sheet or other Notes. The table includes cash flows associated with derivative hedging instruments. 
Their amounts reflect the maturity profile of the fair value liability where the instrument will be settled net, and the gross settlement 
amount where the pay leg of a derivative will be settled separately to the receive leg.

Capital risk management 
The Group seeks to adopt efficient financing structures that enable it to use its balance sheet strength to achieve the Group’s 
objectives without putting shareholder value at risk. The Group’s capital structure comprises its equity (refer to the Group 
Statement of Changes in Equity) and its net debt (refer to note 37).  
The increase in the Group’s net debt from £610.4m to £633.7m (excluding accrued interest) is explained in the Financial review. 
Information about the financial covenants in relation to the Group’s borrowing facilities is included in note 29.  
31 Financial instruments (including cash, trade receivables and payables) 
Fair values 
The table below illustrates the fair values of all financial assets and liabilities held by the Group at 31 December 2011. 
Loans and receivables are non derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. They are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method and the carrying value in all cases 
approximates to the fair value.  
Available for sale investments are non derivative assets that are either designated as available for sale, or are not classified as 
loans and receivables or held to maturity investments. The Group’s available for sale investments have no active market, and in 
the absence of any other reliable external information are carried at cost or amortised cost which approximates to the fair value. 
The fair value of derivatives is either determined by the third-party financial institution with which the Group holds the instrument, 
in line with the market value of similar financial instruments or by use of valuation techniques using market data. Derivatives, other 
than those designated as effective hedging instruments, are classified as fair value through profit or loss and are carried on the 
balance sheet at their fair value with gains or losses recognised in the income statement. Derivatives designated as hedging 
instruments in an effective hedge are carried on the balance sheet at their fair value. For cash flow hedges and hedges of net 
investments in foreign operations, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in 
other comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement. Amounts taken to other 
comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss or when the 
foreign operation is sold or partially disposed. For fair value hedges, all gains or losses are recognised in the income statement. 
Derivatives are the only instrument which the Group holds at fair value. The fair value measurement of these instruments is 
categorised within the Level 2 (ie the fair values are derived based on observable market inputs), in accordance with IFRS 7. 
The Group’s bonds are held at a hybrid amortised cost with a fair value adjustment. After initial recognition at fair value, the 
bonds are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. A portion of the bonds are designated as the 
hedged item in an effective fair value hedging relationship. As such the carrying value of this portion is adjusted for changes in  
fair value attributable to the risk being hedged. This net carrying value will differ to the fair value depending on movements in the 
Group’s credit risk, movements in interest rates on the un-hedged portion and unamortised fees. 
All other liabilities including finance leases, banks loans, trade and other payables and other debt payable are held at amortised 
cost. After initial fair value recognition, these instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. 
The carrying value of these liabilities approximates to the fair value.

The Group assesses at each year-end reporting date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. In the 
financial year 2011 there was no objective evidence that would have necessitated the impairment of loans and receivables  
or available-for-sale assets except the provision for impairment of receivables (see note 22). 
Hedging activities 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage exposures to market risk, such as movements in foreign exchange 
rates, fuel prices and interest rates. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently 
re-measured at fair value. In line with IAS 39 the Group classifies hedges as (a) fair value hedges used to hedge exposure to 
changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability, (b) cash flow hedges used to hedge exposure to variability in cash flows 
associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction, and (c) hedges of a net investment in a 
foreign operation.  
In 2011 the Group applied cash flow hedge accounting for hedging floating fuel price risks in highly probable forecast purchase 
transactions and for hedging net investments in US$ and Euro foreign operations. The Group applied fair value hedge accounting 
for the fair value interest rate risk on £200m of the Group’s fixed rate bonds.

Hedge of net investments in foreign entities 
The Group uses foreign currency borrowings and derivative financial instruments to hedge the net investment in material foreign 
currency net assets of the Group and are used to reduce the exposure to foreign exchange rate movements. At 31 December 
2011 the Group had designated a total of €250.0m of synthetic debt in the form of foreign exchange derivatives as a net 
investment hedge of €250.0m of the net assets of the Spanish subsidiary. No ineffectiveness was recognised in relation to this 
hedge. The foreign exchange derivatives have a maturity date of 24 January 2012 and will be rolled forward as appropriate to 
maintain a desirable level of hedging. Following the Groups’ announcement of its intention to acquire Petermann Partners Inc,  
the Group has entered into a $200m foreign exchange forward as a cash flow hedge for this forecast transaction. The portion  
of the gain or loss on the hedging instruments that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in translation 
reserves and, to this extent, offsets any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in the subsidiaries. 
Fuel derivatives 
The Group has a number of fuel derivatives in place to hedge the different types of fuel used in each division. Ultra low sulphur 
diesel is used in the UK Bus, UK Coach and European Coach & Bus divisions and gasoil is used in the UK Rail division, both are 
hedged by swaps in the same type of fuel. Diesel used in the North American division is hedged using the heating oil and diesel 
market. The timing of the swap cash flows match underlying fuel purchases from 2012 through to 2013. There was no significant 
element of hedge ineffectiveness requiring recognition in the income statement.  
During the year £24.2m of fair value gains (2010: £21.1m) have been transferred to the hedging reserve due to movements in 
market fuel prices. Fair value movements of £25.3m (2010: £2.4m) have been transferred from the hedging reserve to the 
income statement following settlement of fuel trades, of which £14.6m was recognised in the hedging reserve at 1 January 2011 
and the remainder was generated during the year due to the movement in market fuel prices.

Interest rate swaps at fair value through profit or loss 
On 14 January 2010 the Group terminated all outstanding Euro interest rate swaps resulting in a net cash outflow of £20.9m  
for their fair value and accrued interest outstanding. This followed the issue of the Group’s £350m ten year Sterling bond and 
subsequent repayment of the Group’s €270m loan on 15 January 2010.  
The Group continued to account for two US$100m denominated interest rate swaps at fair value through profit or loss  
until their maturity in September 2010. The Group accounted for their fair market value gain of £0.2m in 2010 through the  
income statement.  
In July 2010 the Group entered into four £50m denominated interest rate swaps on a total of £200m of the Group’s Sterling 
bonds. These interest rate swaps all pay floating interest (LIBOR + a margin) semi-annually, receive fixed interest annually with 
maturities matching the Group’s Sterling bonds (two swaps with total notional value £100m mature in January 2017, two swaps 
with notional value £100m mature June 2020) and are designated as a fair value hedge of the interest rate risk on £200m of 
these bonds. These swaps are measured at fair value through profit or loss, with any gains or losses being taken immediately  
to the income statement to offset any fair value gains or losses due to changes in the risk free interest rate on the swapped 
portion of the bonds. As at 31 December 2011 a total fair value gain of £17.5m was recognised in the income statement in 
relation to these swaps. This is offset by a fair value loss of £17.5m on the underlying hedged item, in this case changes in  
fair value on the £200m of the Group’s bonds due to changes in the risk free interest rate.

• The merger reserve includes the premium on shares issued to satisfy the purchase of Prism Rail PLC in 2000. The reserve  
is not distributable; 
• The hedging reserve records the movements on designated hedging items, offset by any movements recognised directly  
in equity on underlying hedged items; and 
• The translation reserve records exchange differences arising from the translation of the accounts of foreign currency 
denominated subsidiaries offset by the movements on loans and derivatives used to hedge the net investment in  
foreign subsidiaries. 
34 Pensions and other post-employment benefits 
(a) Summary of pension benefits and assumptions 
The UK Bus and UK Coach divisions operate both funded defined benefit schemes and a defined contribution scheme. The 
majority of employees of the UK Rail companies are members of the appropriate shared-cost section of the Railways Pension 
Scheme (RPS), a funded defined benefit scheme. The assets of all schemes are held separately from those of the Group. 
Contributions to the schemes are determined by independent professionally qualified actuaries. 
Subsidiaries in North America contribute to a number of defined contribution plans. The Group also provides certain additional 
unfunded post-employment benefits to employees in North America and Spain, which are disclosed in section (c) in the  
‘Other’ category. 
The total pension cost for the year was £11.7m (2010: £15.3m), of which £3.5m (2010: £3.2m) relates to the defined  
contribution schemes. 
The UK Coach plan is now closed to all future accrual. A funding plan aimed at bringing the plan to self sufficiency over a six  
year period was agreed in 2010; National Express contributes £4.2m annually to this scheme. In 2011 UK Bus agreed a £5.5m 
annual deficit repayment plan with the trustees of the West Midlands Passenger Transport Authority Pension Fund to fund a 
£71m scheme funding deficit over 12 years. The plan remains open to accrual for existing members only.

(a) Summary of pension benefits and assumptions continued 
The demographic assumptions reflect those adopted in the most recent triennial actuarial valuation. For the UK Rail scheme, 
mortality assumptions have been set by reference to the recent experience of the scheme. Mortality is assumed to improve  
in the future in line with the ‘core projection’ model published by the actuarial profession’s Continuous Mortality investigation, 
incorporating a long-term improvement rate of 1.5% pa. 
The Directors regard the assumption around the discount rate to be the key assumption in the IAS 19 valuation, and the 
following table provides an approximate sensitivity analysis of the impact of a 0.1% change in the discount rate assumption. 
Scheme assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates. The expected rate of return on scheme 
assets is determined based on market returns on each category of scheme assets. 
(b) Accounting for the Railways Pension Scheme  
The majority of employees of the UK Rail companies are members of the appropriate section of the RPS, a funded defined 
benefit scheme. The RPS is a shared cost scheme, which means that costs are formally shared 60% employer and 40% 
employee. To date, the Group has experienced eleven changes of UK Rail franchise ownership where the current owner has 
funded the scheme during the franchise term and the pension deficit at franchise exit has transferred to the new owner, without 
cash settlement. By entering into the franchise contract, the TOC becomes the designated employer for the term of the contract 
and under the rules of the RPS must fund its share of the pension liability in accordance with the schedule of contributions 
agreed with the Scheme trustees and actuaries.  
In determining the appropriate accounting policy for the RPS to ensure that the Group’s accounts present fairly its financial 
position, financial performance and cash flows, management has consulted with TOC industry peers and has concluded that  
the Group’s constructive obligations should be accounted for in accordance with IAS 19. This accounting policy, which in all 
other respects is consistent with that set out in this note for the Group’s other defined benefit schemes, means that the Group’s 
accounts reflect that element of the deficits anticipated to be settled by the Group during the franchise term and will prevent 
gains arising on transfer of the existing RPS deficits to a new owner at franchise exit.  
In calculating the Group’s constructive obligations in respect of the RPS, the Group has calculated the total pension deficits  
in each of the RPS sections in accordance with IAS 19 and the assumptions set out above. These deficits are reduced  
by a ‘franchise adjustment’ which is that portion of the deficit projected to exist at the end of the franchise and which the  
Group will not be required to fund. The franchise adjustment, which has been calculated by the Group’s actuaries, is offset 
against the present value of the RPS liabilities so as to fairly present the financial performance, position and cash flows of the 
Group’s obligations.  
The franchise adjustment decreased from £72.4m at 31 December 2010 to £59.6m at 31 December 2011. The decrease is 
caused by interest on the franchise adjustment of £3.9m and net actuarial movements of £16.7m. In the prior year, the franchise 
adjustment decreased from £81.7m at 31 December 2009 to £72.4m at 31 December 2010. The decrease was caused by 
interest on the franchise adjustment of £4.7m and net actuarial movements of £14.0m.

The Group expects to contribute £13.3m to its defined benefit pension plans in 2012.  
The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses recognised in the statement of comprehensive income since 1 January 
2004 is £19.2m loss (2010: £10.6m loss). The Directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit 
recognised on transition to IFRSs and taken directly to equity of £51.9m is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since 
inception of those pension schemes. Consequently the Directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and 
losses that would have been recognised in the statement of comprehensive income before 1 January 2004.

35 Commitments and contingencies 
Operating lease commitments 
The Group’s total operating lease commitments are as follows: 
Operating lease commitments  
The majority of the Group’s commitments arise in the UK Rail division. UK Rail division companies have contracts with Network 
Rail Infrastructure Limited for access to the railway infrastructure (tracks, stations and depots). They also have contracts under 
which rolling stock is leased. The TOCs’ obligations to fulfil these commitments exist only as part of their franchise agreement. 
The table below reflects the commitments up to the current franchise end dates unless an extension or new franchise agreement 
has been signed. The commitments are based on charges advised by the Rail Regulator for the period starting on 1 April 2010. 
Commitments for future minimum rental payments under these contracts are shown below: 
Fixed track access agreements have an average remaining life of 1.0 years (2010: 1.1 years), other land and buildings have  
an average duration of 1.0 years (2010: 1.2 years). Rolling stock agreements have an average life of 0.9 years (2010: 1.0 years) 
and other plant and equipment 1.2 years (2010: 1.9 years).

Independent Auditor’s Report 
We have audited the parent Company financial statements of National Express Group PLC for the year ended 31 December 
2011 which comprise the Parent Company Balance Sheet and the related notes 1 to 20. The financial reporting framework that 
has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice). 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not  
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit  
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
parent Company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit  
and express an opinion on the parent Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes  
an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent Company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; 
and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the 
annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. 
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the parent Company financial statements: 
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2011; 
• have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and 
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006; and 
• the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the parent Company financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if,  
in our opinion: 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or 
• the parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. 
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of National Express Group PLC for the year ended  
31 December 2011.

1 Accounting policies  
Basis of preparation  
The separate accounts of the parent Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. The accounts have been 
prepared under the historic cost convention, except for the recognition of derivative financial instruments and available for sale 
investments detailed below, and in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.  
In applying these policies management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of 
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the accounts and the reported amounts  
of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  
No profit and loss account is presented by the Company as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.  
The retained profit of the Company for the year is £84.7m (2010: £70.6m). 
Leases  
Leases of tangible fixed assets where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed to the 
Company are classified as finance leases and the assets are capitalised in the balance sheet as plant and equipment. Finance 
leases are capitalised at the present value of the minimum lease payments. The capital element of future obligations under hire 
purchase contracts and finance leases is included as a liability in the balance sheet. The interest element of rental obligations is 
charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease and represents a constant proportion of the balance of capital 
repayments outstanding. Assets acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset  
and the lease term.  
Leases of assets where a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as 
operating leases. Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over  
the term of the lease. Incentives received under operating leases and initial direct costs in negotiating the lease are amortised  
to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, or to the first review if shorter.  
Tangible fixed assets  
Tangible fixed assets are stated at historic cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment. Tangible fixed assets are 
depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows:  
The carrying value of fixed assets is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the current 
carrying value may not be recoverable, and are written down immediately to their recoverable amount. Repairs and maintenance 
are charged to the profit and loss account during the financial period in which they are incurred.  
Investments in subsidiaries  
Investments are held at historic cost less any provision for impairment.  
Available for sale investments  
Available for sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such, or that are not classified as  
a loan or receivable, held to maturity or at fair value through profit or loss. After initial recognition these assets are measured at 
fair value with gains or losses being recognised as a separate component of equity until the investment is derecognised or the 
investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the previously reported cumulative gain or loss is included in the income 
statement.  
Interest bearing loans and borrowings  
Loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, net of issue costs. After initial 
recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective  
interest method.  
Hedge accounting is adopted where derivatives such as fixed to floating interest rate swaps are held as fair value hedges against 
fixed interest rate borrowings. Under fair value hedge accounting, fixed interest rate borrowings are revalued at each balance 
sheet date by the change in fair value attributable to the interest rate being hedged.  
Plant and equipment  – 3 to 5 years   Notes to the Company Accounts

1 Accounting policies continued 
Provisions  
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is 
probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. 
Where the Company expects a provision to be reimbursed the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when 
reimbursement is virtually certain.  
Pensions  
The Company participates in both the National Express Group multi-employer funded defined benefit scheme and a defined 
contribution scheme. The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the multi-employer 
scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis, and therefore has accounted for the scheme as if it were a defined contribution 
scheme under the requirements of FRS 17, ‘Retirement Benefits’.  
Share-based payment  
In accordance with the transition provisions, FRS 20 has been applied to all grants after 7 November 2002 that were unvested  
as of 1 January 2005.  
The Company awards equity-settled share-based payment to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are 
measured at fair value at the date of grant by an external valuer using a stochastic model. Non-market-based performance-
related vesting conditions are not taken into account when estimating the fair value; instead those non-market conditions are 
taken into account in calculating the current best estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest and at each balance 
sheet date before vesting. The cumulative expense is calculated based on that estimate. Market-based performance conditions 
are taken into account when determining the fair value and at each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense  
is calculated irrespective of whether or not the market conditions are satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions  
are met.  
Deferred tax  
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all material timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, by the balance sheet 
date. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the 
timing differences reverse based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax 
assets are recognised where it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of 
underlying timing differences can be deducted.  
Foreign currencies  
Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end. Foreign currency 
transactions arising during the year are translated into Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of the transaction. Any 
exchange differences so arising are dealt with through the profit and loss account.  
Derivative financial instruments  
The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks 
associated with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair 
value and subsequently remeasured to fair value for the reported balance sheet. The fair value of forward exchange contracts 
and interest rate swaps is calculated by reference to market exchange rates and interest rates at the period end.  
In relation to cash flow hedges which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity, and the ineffective portion in the profit  
and loss account. The gains or losses deferred in equity in this way are recycled through the profit and loss account in the  
same period in which the hedged underlying transaction or firm commitment is recognised in the profit and loss account.  
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, including the foreign currency contracts, gains or losses are taken 
directly to the profit and loss account in the period.  
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires, is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies 
for hedge accounting.  
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under FRS 29 for parent company accounts. The disclosures are included 
within the consolidated accounts.

11 Provisions for liabilities and charges 
1
 The insurance claims provision arises from estimated exposures at the year end, the majority of which will be utilised in the next five years  
and comprise provisions for existing claims arising in the UK and North America. 
2
 A provision was recognised in 2006 for the Company’s onerous contract for Eurostar with ICRRL. £9.0m (2010: £8.7m) was paid to ICRRL  
during the year. The remainder has been settled in 2012. 
12 Deferred tax 
The major components of the provision for deferred taxation are as follows: 
The reconciliation of deferred tax balances is as follows: 
Timing differences associated with Group investments 
No deferred tax (2010: £nil) is recognised on the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and associates, as no dividends have  
been accrued as receivable, and no binding agreement to distribute the past earnings in future has been entered into by  
the subsidiaries. 
Unrecognised tax losses 
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for tax loss carry-forwards to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit 
against future taxable profits is probable. Deferred tax assets that the Company has not recognised in the accounts amount to 
£9.2m (2010: £4.7m), which arise where the Company does not expect to generate sufficient suitable future profits.

15 Shareholders’ funds and statement of changes in shareholders’ equity 
Own shares comprise treasury shares and shares held in the Employee Benefit Trust. 
Treasury shares include 1,668,688 (2010: 1,668,688) ordinary shares in the Company. No additional shares have been added  
as treasury shares within equity for future issue under the Group’s share schemes or cancellation. No shares were cancelled 
during the year (2010: nil). The market value of these shares at 31 December 2011 was £3.7m (2010: £4.2m). 
Own shares include 380,430 (2010: 477,914) ordinary shares in the Company that have been purchased by the Trustees  
of the National Express Employee Benefit Trust (the ‘Trust’). During the year, the Trust purchased 991,615 (2010: 714,597) 
shares and 1,175,455 (2010: 1,301,553) shares were used to satisfy options granted under a number of the Company’s share 
schemes. The market value of these shares at 31 December 2011 was £0.9m (2010: £1.2m). The dividends payable on these 
shares were waived in 2011. 
16 Retirement benefits 
The Company participates in both the National Express Group Staff Pension Fund (a multi-employer funded defined benefit 
scheme) and the WM Pension Scheme (a defined contribution scheme). The Company is unable to identify its share of the 
underlying assets and liabilities of the multi-employer scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis, and therefore has 
accounted for the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme under the requirements of FRS 17, ‘Retirement Benefits’. 
Contributions to this scheme are determined by independent professionally qualified actuaries. The details of the latest actuarial 
valuation are detailed in note 34 to the consolidated accounts. 
The total pension charge for the year, including contributions to the defined benefit scheme above the normal charge, amounted 
to £5.9m (2010: £3.5m).

17 Share-based payment  
During the year ended 31 December 2011, the Company had the following share-based payment arrangements, which are 
described in note 7(b) to the consolidated accounts.  
For the following disclosure, share options with a nil exercise price have been disclosed separately to avoid distorting the 
weighted average exercise prices. The number of share options in existence during the year was as follows: 
1
 Included within this balance are options over nil (2010: 5,774) shares for which no expense has been recognised in accordance with the transitional 
provisions of FRS 20, as the options were granted before 7 November 2002. Although there has been subsequent modification to the options, no 
FRS 20 charge has been recognised as the amounts are not material. 
There were no options outstanding at 31 December 2011 (options in 2010 had exercise prices that were between 207p and 
568p) excluding options with a nil exercise price. The range of exercise prices for options was as follows: 
The options have a weighted average contractual life of one year (2010: one year). Options were exercised throughout the year 
and the weighted average share price at exercise was 244p (2010: 232p).

17 Share-based payment continued 
The weighted average fair value of the remaining share options granted during the year was calculated using a stochastic model, 
with the following assumptions and inputs: 
Experience to date has shown that approximately 24% (2010: 15%) of options are exercised early, principally due to leavers.  
This has been incorporated into the calculation of the expected option life for the share options without nil exercise price.  
Expected volatility in the table above was determined from historic volatility over the last nine years, adjusted for one-off  
events that were not considered to be reflective of the volatility of the share price going forward. The expected dividend  
yield represents the dividends declared in the 12 months preceding the date of the grant divided by the average share price  
in the month preceding the date of the grant.  
For share options granted during the year under the LTIP, the TSR targets have been reflected in the calculation of the fair  
value of the options above.

COMPANY OVERVIEW CONTINUED 
We have grown to become central and Eastern Europe’s leading low cost airline 
From our modest beginnings we have grown to become Central and Eastern Europe’s leading low cost 
airline. In the 2015 financial year we transported 16.5 million passengers, a cumulative increase of 101 per cent. 
over the last five years. During the course of the year we operated over 348 routes, handled 16.5 million 
passengers and at the end of the year we had a fleet of 55 Airbus A320 aircraft and employed more than 
2,100 people. Here are some of the highlights since we first started flying in May 2004. 
History of the Group 
Wizz Air was founded in 2003 by its current Chief Executive Officer József Váradi and five other individuals 
who recognised a demand for low-cost carriers in CEE driven in particular by the accession of ten new EU 
Member States on 1 May 2004, eight of which are in CEE (the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, 
Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia) and the anticipated accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the EU in 
January 2007. Wizz Air was established with bases in Budapest in Hungary and Katowice in Poland and its 
first flight took off from Katowice on 19 May 2004.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT 
 
I am pleased to report that the Company delivered record profits in the 2015 financial year with underlying 
profit after tax growing by 67 per cent to €146.2 million (see Financial Review for more detail). This increase 
was due to increased passenger demand, a 2.5 per cent increase in average fares and a relatively modest rise 
in fuel costs which increased just 10 per cent over the prior year to €396.6 million. The growing scale of the 
business, combined with sharply higher margins, accounted for the strong rise in profitability. 
During the year Wizz Air delivered a number of significant milestones: 
E Our traffic grew by 18.4 per cent to 16.5 million passengers, consolidating our position as the leading low 
cost airline in Central and Eastern Europe. 
E We continued to grow and diversify our route network by opening two new bases and 63 new routes. 
The Company now offers 375 routes to 38 countries. 
E We took delivery of 13 aircraft and returned four aircraft that had reached the end of their lease term 
and the fleet size increased from 46 to 55 aircraft. Wizz operates the youngest fleet of any major 
European airline. 
E The airline operated at 99.8 per cent of its schedule (cancelling only 187 out of 105,627 flights scheduled) 
making it one of the most reliable airlines in the industry. 
E We became even more cost competitive by further reducing our unit costs. Our cost per available seat 
kilometre (CASK) declined by 2.1 per cent to 3.62 Euro cents. 
E We successfully listed the Company’s Ordinary Shares on the London Stock Exchange at a price of 
£11.50 per share, a fully diluted equity valuation for the Company of £1,456 million (€2,008 million), 
raising gross proceeds of £110 million (€150 million) for the Company in the process. 
Opportunity 
The 500 million plus people that live in Central and Eastern Europe have traditionally had very poor access 
to air travel. Wizz Air is helping to change this by bringing affordable air travel to the region. As one of the 
few airlines operating the ultra low cost carrier model across the region, the Company has a unique 
opportunity to grow over the next decade. As such, it remains focused on developing its network of routes 
to, from and within the region and expects to be able to deliver premium growth rates for the foreseeable 
future. 
Customers 
More people choose to fly with Wizz Air every year. Last year alone, the airline handled 2.6 million more 
passengers than the previous year – this growth is itself more than the total passengers carried by most 
CEE-based airlines.  
This volume growth indicates that the Company’s strategy of providing safe, reliable, punctual and friendly 
air travel to a range of attractive destinations, all at the lowest possible fares, has proved to be a very 
successful formula. Every day of the week, the efforts of the management team, crew and service partners 
are focused on delivery of this formula.  
To the 16.5 million passengers who chose to fly with Wizz Air last year, we thank you for placing your trust in 
the Wizz Air team. To the millions more that will fly with Wizz Air in the coming year: welcome on board! 
Employees 
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all of our employees for another year where they again 
demonstrated their enthusiasm, professionalism and passion for the airline and its customers. The results, in 
terms of fleet expansion, new bases and destinations, schedule reliability and on-time performance, speak for 
themselves. Thank you all!

STRATEGIC REPORT 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW 
Financial performance 
I am pleased to present Wizz Air’s first annual report as a publicly listed company. The 2015 financial year 
saw many pleasing developments as we further extended the reach of our ultra-low cost business model, 
maintaining our position as Central and Eastern Europe’s largest low cost airline, and delivered record levels 
of profitability. 
Wizz Air delivered a profit for the year of €183.2 million. After adjusting for the effects of one-off items, this 
performance translates into a record underlying profit after tax of €146.2 million, a 67 per cent. improvement 
versus the €87.5 million reported in the previous financial year. Our underlying net profit margin increased 
from 8.6 per cent. to 11.9 per cent. over the course of the year, making us one of the most profitable airlines 
in Europe. 
This strong performance was driven by capacity expansion, rigorous cost control and a determination to 
allocate capacity to the most profitable parts of our network. Expressed in numerical terms the Company 
delivered: 
E a 20 per cent. increase in the capacity offered to the market (as measured by available seat kilometres 
or ASKs), as we extended and deepened our network of routes to and from Central and Eastern Europe; 
E despite this significant capacity expansion we were able to increase our average load factor by 1.0 
percentage point to 86.7 per cent. in the financial year; 
E our revenue per ASK increased 1.1 per cent. versus the previous financial year; and 
E the beneficial impact of lower jet fuel prices was only partially offset by the stronger US Dollar and so 
unit costs (as measured by cost per ASK) declined by 2.1 per cent. versus the 2014 financial year. 
Consequently, volume growth and a widening gap between unit revenues and unit costs were the primary 
drivers of the Company’s improved financial performance. 
The profit for the year of €183.2 million included a €37.0 million net gain from unusual and exceptional items. 
These comprised unrealised foreign exchange gains (€27.8 million), a translation gain in relation to the 
planned closure of Wizz Air Ukraine (€14.5m), the cost of extending and revaluing the Company’s 
convertible debt in August 2014 (€2.5m) and IPO related costs (€2.8m). All but the last of these items were 
non-cash. 
Market overview 
The European short-haul market is supplied by legacy carriers (national flag carriers and charter airlines) and 
a generally younger group of low-cost airlines. Low-cost airlines such as Wizz Air benefit from relatively 
simple business models, higher aircraft utilisation and staff productivity rates and therefore lower costs than 
their legacy rivals. This provides low-cost airlines with a competitive advantage which enables them to offer 
significantly lower fares and therefore attract a growing share of the air travel market. 
Wizz Air’s ultra-low cost model gives it a clear cost advantage versus most of its rivals, including many other 
low-cost airlines, and as a result it is able to stimulate the market with very low fares and sustain a relatively 
high growth rate compared to other airlines.  
Wizz Air’s premium growth rate is also a function of the market in which it operates: Central and Eastern 
Europe (CEE). All of Wizz Air’s routes connect to CEE countries where economic growth, and therefore 
growth in demand for air travel, is generally stronger than in Western Europe.  
The demand for air travel in CEE has increased more than five-fold in the last ten years and as a result Wizz 
Air has grown to be not only the largest low cost airline in CEE but also the fourth largest independent low-
cost airline in Europe after Ryanair, Easyjet and Norwegian Air Shuttle as measured by the number of 
passengers carried. 
The Company took the regrettable decision to close Wizz Air Ukraine in March 2015. This subsidiary had 
already been scaled down to just two aircraft. The Kiev base operation will be further rationalised to a single 
aircraft registered to and operated by Wizz Air Hungary.

STRATEGIC REPORT 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED 
Regulatory environment 
Wizz Air has its beginnings, and has since prospered, in the liberalised European aviation marketplace. 
Liberalisation has proven to be a very positive development, not only for customers but also for the airline 
industry itself. Increased competition demands cost discipline and those companies that manage their costs 
properly become stronger and more resilient, providing increasing numbers of secure, rewarding jobs.  
Liberalisation is also good for the communities we serve. Our ability to start international services, linking the 
capitals and regions of Central and Eastern Europe to the major business centres and leisure destinations of 
Western Europe, fosters integration within Europe. This much enhanced connectivity is a key catalyst for the 
rising prosperity of the towns and cities within our network.  
Wizz Air has also developed services from a number of its home countries to destinations beyond the 
borders of the European Union, to countries such as Georgia, Israel and the United Arab Emirates, all of 
which were made possible by the European Union’s continuing push to liberalise aviation relations with other 
countries and regions, an ongoing process that Wizz Air fully supports and encourages. 
However, despite the liberalised environment, challenges do remain. In particular, Wizz Air would encourage 
all authorities to ensure that airlines have access to genuinely competitive infrastructure and ground-
handling services at major airports. While we believe that competition at all levels is good, that competition 
must be on a level playing field. The time is past for inefficient carriers to exist merely because they receive 
state subsidies.  
Finally, a note on passenger rights. Wizz Air operates a young, reliable fleet and we are committed to 
delivering a high quality service to our passengers. By industry standards, Wizz Air delivers extremely high 
rates of reliability. Only 187 flights out of a total of 105,627 were cancelled in the 2015 financial year, of which 
only a small portion for technical reasons, and only 0.2% of flights were delayed more than three hours.  
On the few occasions that flights are significantly delayed or cancelled, we comply fully with all applicable 
rulings related to regulation EU261. Wizz Air pays the relevant compensation in accordance with the relevant 
authorities’ guidance. We also believe that the contractual two-year limit within which claims must be 
brought is fair, reasonable and legally valid. 
Strategic progress 
Wizz Air’s ambition is to make safe, reliable and affordable air travel available to everyone in CEE. This 
objective is reflected in the Company’s slogan used in its first eleven years: “Now We Can All Fly”. 
In order to achieve this ambition the Company operates the youngest fleet of any European airline, to and 
from a range of primary and secondary airports across Europe, offering highly competitive fares and a range 
of additional services designed to satisfy the requirements of as many people as possible. 
The Company is convinced that its strategy of building on its strong network, highly efficient model, 
compelling customer proposition, solid finances and sound risk management policies, will enable it to deliver 
sustainable growth and returns for Shareholders. 
In order to deliver on its strategy Wizz Air has three key objectives: 
1. increase our cost advantage; 
2. build a strong, diversified market position; and 
3. improve the customer experience. 
1. Increase our cost advantage 
Wizz Air has always been focused on being as efficient as possible and has already established some 
impressive credentials compared to other major European short-haul airlines, including: 
E the youngest fleet of aircraft; 
E a strong point-to-point network; 
E the highest aircraft utilisation; 
E the highest staff productivity; 
E one of the highest load factors; 
E an “unbundled” product producing the highest ancillary income per passenger; and 
E a group of reliable and efficient outsourced suppliers of key services. 
    
 
Wizz Air Holdings Plc Annual report and accounts 2015  13 
STRATEGIC REPORT 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED 
Strategic progress continued 
1. Increase our cost advantage continued 
As a result, Wizz Air is already one of the most cost competitive airlines in Europe. However, the Company 
believes it can become even more cost efficient by: 
E exploiting scale economies as the Company grows; 
E taking advantage of its stronger financial standing and easier access to capital following its listing on the 
London Stock Exchange in March 2015; and 
E reaping the benefits of an increasingly efficient fleet. 
The composition of our fleet at the last year-end and at the next two is the following: 
  March 2015 March 2016 March 2017 
  Actual Planned Planned 
A320 without winglets (180 seats) 35 35 35 
A320 with winglets (180 seats) 20 28 28 
A321 with winglets (230 seats) — 4 15 
Fleet size 55 67 78 
Share of fleet with winglets  36.4% 47.8% 55.1% 
Average number of seats per aircraft 180 183 190 
 
Wizz Air was one of the first airlines to take delivery of Airbus A320 aircraft fitted with winglets. These 
winglets reduce fuel burn and emissions, particularly on longer flights. All aircraft joining the fleet in the 
future (both A320 and A321) will be fitted with winglets and therefore this proportion of the fleet will rise 
steadily over the next five years. 
In addition, the Company will take delivery of the larger Airbus A321 from November 2015. Wizz Air has 27 of 
these aircraft on order and, from an operational point of view, they are essentially the same aircraft as an 
Airbus A320 except its longer fuselage accommodates 230 seats compared to 180 on the Airbus A320. The 
A321s will be employed on higher volume routes and provide efficiencies that will enable the Company to 
offer even lower fares to the market. 
2. Build a strong, diversified market position 
Central and Eastern Europe comprises 21 countries with a total population of over 550 million people. 
However, as this market is relatively under-served by airlines and in particular low-cost airlines, it represents 
a huge opportunity for a low-cost airline.  
At present Wizz Air has operations in 16 CEE countries with an aggregate population of 295 million. We 
serve the market by offering a network of 22 bases and 110 destinations. We are convinced that the ultra-low 
cost business model is best placed to serve this market and as such the Company offers safe, reliable 
operations, low fares and hassle-free services and a distinctive brand designed to appeal to the whole 
market. 
This approach has enabled the Company to become the number one or number two low-cost airline in all of 
its base countries. The Company’s aggregate market share in CEE reached 39.2 per cent. in the 2015 financial 
year, up from 35.6 per cent. in 2010. The table below shows the Company’s ranking by low-cost market 
share in each of its base countries.

3. Improve the customer experience 
Market research consistently demonstrates that the most important driver of a customer’s choice of airline is 
ticket price. For this reason Wizz Air will remain focused on offering passengers safe, reliable services to a 
broad range of destinations, at the lowest possible price. 
However, the Company also recognises that everyone is different and customers have varying requirements 
in terms of how they access Wizz Air’s services and what is important to them when they travel. So, beyond 
the basic product of flying customers from A to B, Wizz Air offers a range of products and services that 
enable passengers to customise their trip to meet their own individual needs.  
These services include a range of seating alternatives, baggage options, flexible tickets, priority boarding and 
a range of on-board purchases. In the Company’s view, this “unbundling” philosophy enables Wizz Air to 
offer each customer exactly and only what he or she needs whilst keeping the price of the basic service as 
low as possible.  
In addition, the Company also provides customers with the opportunity to buy hotel, car hire and public 
transport services as part of the same booking. Wizz Discount Club enables customers and their friends and 
families to benefit from lower air fares than those that are generally available. 
Wizz Air listens to its customers and strives to provide them with what they want. This is why we have 
upgraded our website and made it more user-friendly for all customers but in particular for mobile and tablet 
users. We have introduced allocated seating* across the network and are updating our brand**, modernising 
the look and feel of our aircraft and website.  
Wizz Air remains committed to the view that low-cost air travel can be as comfortable and stress free as 
travelling with legacy airlines, only significantly cheaper. Adhering to this philosophy will help the Company 
deliver sustainable growth and returns for Shareholders.

Hedging positions 
Wizz Air operates under a clear set of treasury policies supervised by the Board. The aim of the Company’s 
hedging policy is to reduce short-term volatility in earnings and liquidity. Therefore Wizz Air hedges a 
minimum of 50 per cent. of the projected US Dollar and jet fuel requirements for the next twelve months (40 
per cent. on the full 18-month hedge horizon).

Sensitivities 
E Pre-hedging a $10 (per metric ton) movement in the price of jet fuel impacts the 2016 financial year fuel 
costs by $6.3 million. 
E Pre-hedging a one cent movement in the Euro/US Dollar exchange rate impacts the 2016 financial year 
operating expenses by €5.4 million. 
In the Company’s view, the profit impact of such changes is likely to be less given the empirical evidence of 
major industry-wide movements in input costs being passed through to air fares with a lag of three to twelve 
months.  
Outlook 
2016 financial year 
Wizz Air plans to grow capacity, both in terms of seats flown and Available Seat Kilometres,(ASK) by around 
17% in the 2016 financial year. This will be split broadly 18% in H1 and 16% in H2. The average stage length is 
expected to be in line with that of the 2015 financial year. A further modest rise in the load factor points to a 
total of 19.4 million passengers handled in the year as a whole. 
Assuming the jet fuel price and Euro/US Dollar exchange rate remain close to the prevailing spot levels 
($625 per metric tonne and $/€ 1.12 respectively), the Company expects Total CASK to be in line with the 
figure achieved in the 2015 financial year. This comprises an anticipated Fuel CASK decline of 1.5% and an 
increase in Non-fuel CASK of 1%. The expected Fuel CASK decline reflects the combined impact of lower fuel 
prices, a much stronger US Dollar, fuel consumption savings and hedging positions. The rise in Non-fuel 
CASK reflects the impact of US Dollar strength on lease expenses, some modest inflation in crew costs and 
rising airport and air traffic control charges. 
Consistent with historical experience, lower fuel prices are feeding through to lower air fares. Management’s 
view that there will be no earnings benefit from the decline in fuel prices since last summer remains 
unchanged. Based on current booking trends management expects total RASK to decline by a low single-
digit percentage in H1 and remains cautious regarding the H2 revenue performance, when capacity growth is 
planned to be 16%.  
Nonetheless, we currently expect a further significant rise in the Group’s profit for the year to a range of 
between €165 million and €175 million (excluding unusual and exceptional items), significantly ahead of the 
€146.2 million figure achieved in the 2015 financial year. This guidance is heavily caveated by the H2 revenue 
performance, a period for which we currently have no visibility.

Outlook continued 
First (June) quarter of the 2016 financial Year 
The Company expects to grow capacity, both in terms of seats flown and Available Seat Kilometres, by 18% 
in the June quarter and anticipates a modest rise in load factor versus the same period of the previous year. 
The fact that Easter fell one week earlier in 2015 than in 2014 pushed a higher proportion of this high yield 
traffic into the March quarter. As a result Q1 (June quarter) net profit is expected to be only marginally ahead 
of Q1 of last year. 
The Company will provide an update to this guidance at least every three months with its quarterly earnings 
reports. 
Wizz Air is successfully implementing its strategy of delivering low cost, professional and friendly air travel to 
an ever expanding range of Central and Eastern European destinations. This winning formula leaves Wizz Air 
well placed to deliver significant growth and returns for shareholders.

STRATEGIC REPORT 
FINANCIAL REVIEW 
 
In the 2015 financial year Wizz Air handled a total of 16.5 million passengers, a 18.4 per cent. increase versus 
the previous year, and generated revenues of €1,227.3 million, growth of 21.3 per cent. These growth rates 
compare to capacity growth measured in terms of available seat kilometres (ASK) of 20 per cent. and seats 
of 17 per cent. 
Given strong volume growth and declining industry wide input costs through the year, the unit revenue 
performance of the business was creditable. Revenue per ASK increased by 1.1 per cent. versus the previous 
year. 
Fuel unit costs (per ASK) declined 8.4 per cent. reflecting the combined impact of lower fuel prices and fuel 
consumption savings partly offset by the stronger US Dollar. Non-fuel unit costs, excluding the impact of 
exceptional operating income and expense items, increased 0.5 per cent. as a result of the stronger US 
Dollar, rising crew unit costs and the cost of returning four older aircraft to lessors as their contracted lease 
terms expired. 
Underlying profit after tax increased by 67 per cent. from €87.5 million in 2014 to €146.2 million in 2015. This 
equates to a 3.3 percentage point rise in the underlying after tax profit margin from 8.6% to 11.9%.  
The profit for the year was €183.2 million and included a €37.0 million net gain from unusual and exceptional 
items. These comprised unrealised foreign exchange gains resulting primarily from the impact of the 
strengthening US Dollar on the Group’s net US Dollar monetary asset position (€27.8 million), a translation 
gain in relation to the planned closure of Wizz Air Ukraine (€14.5 million), the cost of extending and revaluing 
the Company’s convertible debt in August 2014 (€2.5 million) and IPO related costs of €2.8 million. All but 
the last of these items were non-cash. 
The income tax expense for the year was €8.5 million (2014: €7.7 million) giving an effective tax rate for the 
Group of 4.5 per cent. (2014: 8.0 per cent.). The main components of this charge are local business tax and 
innovation tax paid in Hungary and corporate income tax paid in Switzerland.

The proforma underlying earnings per share (EPS) is a fully diluted measure defined by the Company and its 
calculation is different from the IFRS diluted EPS measure in the following: 
E For earnings the underlying profit for the year was used, as opposed to the statutory (IFRS) profit for 
the year 
E For the fully diluted number of shares, all convertible debt was taken into account for its dilution impact 
as at the year-end, resulting in 106.6 million shares for 2014 and 126.5 million shares for 2015 being used 
as the denominator. By contrast, the IFRS diluted EPS measure includes only those convertible debts 
that could be converted without restriction and takes a weighted average position for the year.  
Return on capital employed and capital structure 
ROCE** for the year was 21.5 per cent., an improvement of 4.9 percentage points versus the previous year 
driven by significantly improved profitability partially offset by rising aircraft operating lease expenses (an 
important component of the capital employed calculation) and a significant increase in equity capital as a 
result of the IPO. 
The Company’s leverage, defined as net debt adjusted to include capitalised operating lease obligations* 
divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and aircraft rentals, fell to a ratio of 1.6 
from 2.6 at the end of the 2014 financial year. 
Liquidity, defined as cash and equivalents as a percentage of the last twelve months’ revenue, rose from 18% 
at the end of the 2014 financial year to 37% a year later.  
These improvements in the Company’s leverage and liquidity ratios reflect the combined effect of improved 
profitability and the IPO proceeds.

Total revenue  1,227.3 100% 1,011.8 100% 21.3% 
 
The growth in total revenue in 2015 was principally due to a 20.0 per cent. rise in ASKs and a 1.1 per cent. 
increase in revenue per ASK (RASK). Passenger ticket revenue increased by 20.5 per cent. to € 793.8 million 
and ancillary (or “non-ticket”) revenue increased by 22.8 per cent. to €433.5 million. 
Average revenue per passenger increased from €72.7 in 2014 to €74.5 in 2015, an increase of 2.5 per cent. 
Average passenger ticket revenue per passenger increased from €47.3 in 2014 to €48.2 (+1.8 per cent.), 
while average ancillary revenue per passenger also increased from €25.4 in 2014 to €26.3 in 2015, an 
increase of 3.7 per cent. This increase in average revenue per passenger was due to: 
E a significant increase in average passenger ticket revenue per passenger in 2015 compared to 2014, 
which was the result of: (a) the increasing maturity of Wizz Air’s route network (the average capacity-
weighted age of Wizz Air’s routes increased from 56 months as at 30 September 2013 to 65 months as 
at 30 September 2014); (b) higher passenger demand in 2015 than in 2014; and (c) a 2.6 per cent. rise in 
average stage length from 1,500km to 1,539km; and 
E an increase in average ancillary revenue per passenger reflecting higher convenience service (including 
Wizz Discount Club membership fees and multi-currency pricing) and administration fees. Baggage fees 
per passenger remained broadly flat. 
Operating expenses 
Total operating expenses increased by 17.8 per cent. to €1,063 million in 2015 from €902 million in 2014. 
CASK declined by 2.8 per cent. to €3.62 cents in 2015 from €3.72 cents in 2014. This reduction in CASK 
was principally driven by a reduction in the average fuel price and a favourable airport mix 
development. CASK excluding fuel expenses rose 0.9 per cent. to 2.27 Euro cents in 2015 from 2.25 
Euro cents in 2014 driven by the adverse development of the $/€ exchange rate during the year.

Staff costs increased by 22.1 per cent. to €83.4 million in 2015, up from €68.3 million 2014. The increase in 
overall staff costs reflected a 19.8 per cent. rise in aircraft block hours and higher bonus payments than in the 
previous year. Of the bonus payments €1.6 million is a one-off payment related to the IPO and was classified 
as exceptional expense in 2015 (see Note 10 to the financial statements). Excluding this charge the 
underlying staff costs in 2015 were €81.8 million, growing 19.8 per cent. versus 2014 in line with the increase 
in ASKs.

FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED 
Financial performance continued 
Operating expenses continued 
Fuel expenses rose by 10.0 per cent. to €396.6 million in 2015, up from €360.6 million in 2014. The major 
drivers of the increase were the 20.0% per cent. growth in ASKs, a 5.4 per cent. appreciation of the US Dollar 
against the Euro (1.3% after hedging), offset by a 1.2 per cent. reduction in fuel consumption per block hour 
and a 7.8 per cent. decline in the fuel price. The average fuel price (including hedging impact and into-plane 
premium) paid by Wizz Air in 2015 was US$986 per tonne, a decline of 7.8 per cent. from the previous 
year’s figure of US$1,069 per tonne.  
Distribution and marketing costs rose 72.5 per cent. to €18.8 million in 2015 from €10.9 million in 2014. 
However, the 2014 figure was reduced by an exceptional income of €6.3 million. Without this credit the 
underlying expense in 2014 was €17.2 million, resulting in an increase of 9.3 per cent. year on year. 
Maintenance, materials and repair costs increased by 28.1 per cent. to €62.0 million in 2015 from €48.4 
million in 2014. This cost increase was the result of the increase in the overall fleet size and costs 
associated with the redelivery of four aircraft to lessors during the period.  
Aircraft rental costs grew 22.0 per cent. to €137.1 million in 2015, from €112.4 million in 2014. This increase 
was largely due to fleet growth (equivalent aircraft expanded 18.2 per cent.), a higher average lease rate as 
older aircraft were replaced by new aircraft with higher ownership costs and the sharp rise in the US$/€ rate. 
Airport, handling and en-route charges increased by 18.9 per cent. to €297.7 million in 2015 from €250.4 
million in 2014. This category comprised €170.5 million of airport and handling fees and €127.2 million of en-
route and navigation charges in 2015 and €143.9 million of airport and handling fees and €106.5 million of 
en-route and navigation charges in 2014. The cost increase was primarily due to a 17 per cent. increase in 
the number of flights, an 18.4 per cent. rise in passenger numbers and stage length expansion of 2.6 per cent. 
Depreciation and amortisation charges increased by 33.5 per cent. to €33.9 million in 2015, up from €25.4 
million in 2014. This was primarily as a result of a rise in the number of engines and other components that 
no longer met their contracted lease return conditions. It is this that triggers the creation and depreciation of 
the related heavy maintenance asset in accordance with our accounting policy set out on page 85. In 
addition, there were four aircraft re-delivery events that resulted in additional depreciation costs in 2015 
compared to 2014. 
Other expenses increased by 19.1 per cent. to €30.5 million in 2015 from €25.6 million in 2014. The 2015 figure 
included advisory expenses of €1.2 million that were classified as exceptional expense (see Note 10 to the 
financial statements). Excluding this charge the underlying expense in 2015 was €29.3 million, growing 14.4 
per cent. versus 2014. This increase was primarily as a result of an increase in non-salary related overhead 
and crew costs and flight cancellation costs, which were partially offset by lower insurance premiums due to 
better terms achieved on the renewal of the insurance policy. 
Operating profit 
As a result of the foregoing factors, Wizz Air made an operating profit (including exceptional items) of 
€167.3 million in 2015, a 52.4 per cent. increase from the operating profit of €109.8 million made in 2014. 
Excluding exceptional items the operating profit increased to €170.1 million in 2015, a 64.3 per cent. increase 
from the equivalent figure of €103.5 million in 2014. This equates to a 3.7 percentage point improvement in 
the underlying operating profit margin from 10.2% to 13.9%. 
Net financing income and expense 
Wizz Air’s net financing costs improved dramatically from a cost of €14.4 million in 2014 to a net gain of 
€24.4 million in 2015. This was due to Wizz Air incurring a net foreign exchange gain of €16.2 million in 2015 
mainly as a result of the appreciation of the US Dollar against the Euro, compared to a net foreign 
exchange loss of €7.0 million in 2014. This impact was further boosted by the exceptional financial gain of 
€14.5 million triggered by the decision to close the Wizz Air Ukraine subsidiary. This latter item and part of 
the net foreign exchange gains are non-cash items (see Note 11). 
These positive effects were partially offset by a modest rise in interest expenses, driven mainly by a €2.5 
million one-off non-cash charge arising as a result of recalculating the fair value of convertible loans and 
convertible notes due to their extension in August 2014.

FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED 
Financial performance continued 
Taxation 
Wizz Air recorded an income tax expense of €8.5 million in 2015, compared to a figure of €7.7 million in 
2014. This increase was primarily due to the increasing profitability of the Group. The parent company of the 
Group, Wizz Air Holdings Plc had a statutory tax rate in Switzerland of 7.8 per cent. in both 2015 and 2014. 
The effective tax rate for the Group was 4.5 per cent. in 2015 and 8.0 per cent. in 2014. The reduction in 
the effective tax rate reflects the fact that the Ukrainian airline subsidiary of the Group incurred tax of €2.0 
million in 2014 but none in 2015. 
Profit for the period 
As a result of the foregoing factors, Wizz Air generated an IFRS profit for 2015 of €183.2 million, a 44.5 
per cent. increase from the profit of €87.7 million in 2014. 
Other comprehensive income and expense 
In 2015 the Group had other comprehensive expense of €51.7 million compared to the €0.9 million gain in 
2014. The substantial expense in 2015 was driven primarily by the increase of the cash flow hedging reserve 
(debit) by €43.0 million during the year. This in turn corresponds to the increase of the Group’s liability 
under open derivative financial instruments, caused by the sharp fall in fuel prices during the year. The 
smaller element of other comprehensive expense in 2015 was an €8.7 million charge from currency 
translation differences. This is the consequence of the recycling of the cumulative translation adjustment 
account balance to the statement of comprehensive income, resulting in an exceptional financial gain as 
explained above under net financial costs.

Cash flow from operating activities 
The vast majority of Wizz Air’s cash inflows from operating activities are derived from passenger ticket 
sales. Net cash flows from operating activities are also materially affected by movements in working 
capital items. 
Cash generated by operating activities before changes in working capital and before taxation increased by 
€56.3 million to €189.7 million in 2015 from €133.4 million in 2014. However, after the impact of changes in 
working capital, net cash generated by operating activities declined by €22.4 million to €174.0 million in 
2015 from €196.4 million in 2014. This development was mainly driven by the increase in trade and other 
receivables, restricted cash and derivative balances compared to 2014. These increases, in turn, can be 
explained primarily by the increase in cash deposits placed with lessors, letters of credit provided to lessors 
(secured by cash deposits) and by option fees paid to hedge counterparties in relation to fuel caps entered 
into during 2015 but expiring only in the next two financial years. 
Cash flow from investing activities 
Net cash used in investing activities declined by €44.2 million from a net cash outflow of €94.0 million in 
2014 to €49.8 million in 2015. The purchase of aircraft maintenance assets declined from €54.9 million in 
2014 to €36.3 million in 2015 primarily due to fewer scheduled heavy maintenance events, particularly engine 
shop visits and engine life limited part replacements, being performed in 2015 than in 2014. Advances paid 
for aircraft, net of refunds of advances, decreased from a net cash outflow of €31.8 million in 2014 to €6.4 
million in 2015.

Cash flow from financing activities 
Net cash from financing activities increased by €158.5 million to a €139.3 million inflow in 2015 from a €19.2 
million outflow in 2014. This was mainly due to the net proceeds of €149.1 million received during 2015 from 
the issue of new shares, most of it being the primary proceeds from the Company’s IPO.

 * Including both current and non-current asset and liability balances, respectively 
Property, plant and equipment increased by €25.3 million (see Note 14 to the financial statements). This was 
driven primarily by the increase in the balance of advances paid for aircraft maintenance assets: the value of 
FHA payments made during 2015 was €20.5 million higher than the amount that was utilized for new 
maintenance assets. 
Restricted cash (current and non-current) increased by €31.2 million (see Note 23). This was driven by the 
growth in the amount lease-related letters of credit, issued both in relation to maintenance reserves (€20.9 
million) and lease security deposits (€10.6 million). On top of these underlying impacts the 32% appreciation 
of the US Dollar to the Euro during the 2015 financial year also contributed to the increase. 
Derivative financial assets (current and non-current) increased by €60.3 million (see Notes 3 and 21). The 
increase was driven primarily the receivable on Fx hedge instruments (collars) due to the appreciation of the 
US Dollar to the Euro during the year (€37.5 million), and by the fee paid by the Company in relation to fuel 
cap options (€25.9 million). 
Trade and other receivables (current and non-current) increased by €51.4 million (see Notes 19). The key 
drivers of this change were the increases in maintenance reserves (€23.6 million) and ticket sales receivables 
(€14.8 million) during the year. 
Cash and cash equivalents increased by €263.0 million. This change is explained in detail in the cash flow 
analysis above, the most important contributor being the €149.1 million net proceeds from the IPO of the 
Company. 
Borrowings (current and non-current) declined by €16.0 million (see Note 24). This was because all 
outstanding loans for pre-delivery payments (PDPs) that existed at the end of 2014 were fully repaid.  
Convertible debt (current and non-current) fell by €15.9 million (see Note 25). This was because part of the 
convertible debt existing in 2014 was converted into shares in March 2015 in connection with the Company’s 
IPO.

Summary statement of balance sheet continued 
Deferred income (current and non-current) increased by €56.6 million (see Note 27). This was driven by the 
increase in unflown revenues (€32.6 million), itselfprimarily due to the increase of offered seat capacity at 
the end of the year, and by the concessions received by aircraft and component manufacturers in relation to 
the thirteen new aircraft delivered during the year. 
Derivative financial liabilities (current and non-current) increased by €78.2 million (see Notes 3 and 21). This 
relates to the fuel hedging positions taken by the Company before the significant drop in fuel prices in the 
second half of2014. 
Provisions (current and non-current) increased by €24.8 million (see Note 30). This relates to maintenance 
provisions and the increase versus 2014 can be explained by the fact that the 2014 balance was particularly 
low, as many high-value maintenance events were completed that year.

STRATEGIC REPORT 
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES 
 
Wizz Air operates in a dynamic, fast-paced and competitive industry. It is an industry where reputations and 
businesses can be lost quickly if a risk is not anticipated and dealt with effectively.  
This section of the report sets out our risk management process, as well as a short description of some of the 
key risks that could, if not properly dealt with, affect Wizz Air’s future success, although it does not by any 
means list all risks that might possibly affect our business.  
Our risk management process 
The Board oversees the Company’s risk process and has delegated authority for this to the Audit 
Committee. The Company’s Head of Internal Audit reports directly to the Chairman of the Audit Committee. 
Each year, a risk universe exercise is undertaken with the Company’s senior and operational management. 
The results of this exercise are used to produce an internal audit plan for the coming year. In addition, the 
Audit Committee and senior management are developing a comprehensive risk analysis and reporting 
framework. 
Risks relating to the group 
Market risks 
Competition is one of the key risks to our business. The airline industry in Europe is fiercely competitive. 
We have yet to see consolidation on the scale experienced in, for example, the United States and so there is 
a large number of airlines, including ultra-low cost and low-cost carriers, traditional airlines and charter 
airlines, competing throughout our network. Our competitors may seek to protect or gain market share in 
markets in which we operate, perhaps by offering discounted fares or more attractive schedules. We believe 
that competition is good for the industry – both for consumers, who benefit from lower prices as well as 
airlines themselves, as they must embrace cost discipline – but we must react to a competitive threat. We 
constantly seek to enhance our customer offering and have recently launched a comprehensive re-branding 
programme which will put the WIZZ brand in a strong position to continue its success in the future. 
Ultimately, our key competitive strength is our commitment to driving our cost advantage ever lower – we 
firmly believe that, in a tough market, lowest cost ultimately wins and the necessary cost discipline is 
something to which we are committed, day in, day out.  
We don’t just compete for customers, we compete for access to infrastructure too. We need terminal 
space, slots and aircraft parking to be able to operate our flights. As we continue to grow, we will need 
additional ground and maintenance facilities. Certain airports to which we operate may already be or 
become congested, meaning we may not be able to secure access to those airports at our preferred times. 
We mitigate this risk by operating primarily from secondary airports which have significant spare capacity 
and, where we do fly to congested airports, our flights often constitute in-bound traffic for such airports 
and take up off-peak capacity. 
Our business model is borne of and flourishes in a liberalised market. It is no coincidence that Wizz Air’s 
first flight coincided with the accession to the EU of a number of our home base countries. Since then, our 
business has grown in a liberalised market which allows to fly where we want, when we want and to charge 
our customers the lowest prices possible. However, we have also pushed our route network beyond the 
borders of the EU, to countries with which the EU has liberalised or partially-liberalised air service 
agreements. We believe that this diversification of our route network and development of new markets 
places Wizz Air in a strong position if, for example, the EU market were to be disrupted following the 
secession of a member state. We will continue actively to assess potential new markets.  
We are exposed to political and economic events and trends in CEE and elsewhere. Our business 
extends beyond the borders of the EU and into countries such as Russia, Turkey and Ukraine and regions 
including the Caucasus, North Africa and the Middle East. These and other countries in the region have 
experienced, and may still be subject to, potential political and economic instability caused by changes in 
governments, political deadlock in the legislative process, contested election results, tension and conflict 
between federal and regional authorities, corruption among governmental officials, social and ethnic unrest 
and currency instability. We maintain close relationships with local authorities and, as an organisation, we 
were able to react quickly following unrest in Ukraine. We initially re-deployed capacity to other markets but, 
ultimately and with much regret, had to take the decision that Wizz Air Ukraine Airlines LLC should stop 
operations. However, we were able to mitigate this by obtaining operating permits on a number of the 
routes for Wizz Air Hungary Ltd. and, as a result, we were able to offer the vast majority of our Ukrainian 
employees jobs either elsewhere in the network or at the new Wizz Air Hungary base to be set up in Kiev.

STRATEGIC REPORT 
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES CONTINUED 
 
Risks relating to the group continued 
Operational risks 
We operate only the Airbus A320 family – very effectively. In fact, we were awarded Airbus’ Operational 
Excellence Award for the A320 family in Europe. We also operate our aircraft very efficiently, with average 
fleet utilisation in the 2015 financial year reaching 12.55 hours, the highest of any airline in Europe. But this 
means that we are vulnerable to any issue which might affect the A320 family or the IAE V2500 type 
engines which power our fleet. However, we think that the risk of such an issue is small: we chose the Airbus 
A320 family precisely because it is one of the most advanced aircraft on the market and a true workhorse of 
short and medium range flights. We invest heavily in maintenance, using the services of world-class 
maintenance organisations. And, we have a young fleet with an average age of 3.8 years as at 31 March 2015.  
Safety events. An accident or incident, or terrorist attack, can adversely affect an airline’s image and 
customers’ willingness to travel with that airline. 
E At Wizz Air, our number one priority is the safety of our aircraft, passengers and crew. Our aircraft fleet 
is young and reliable, we use the services of world-class maintenance organisations and we have a 
strong safety culture. A cross-functional safety council meets twice a year, involving both senior 
management as well as operational staff and reviews any issues which have arisen in the past six months 
and the actions taken as a consequence. In addition to this, we collect detailed data from all aspects of 
our operation in order to identify trends and relevant personnel from our Operations department meet 
twice a year to discuss any trends identified in their sphere of operation and how they are being dealt 
with. We also operate an anonymous safety reporting system, to allow our flight and cabin crew to 
report safety issues which are a concern to them. Our entry standards for operating crew are high and 
our own Approved Training Organisation (ATO) ensures that all of our pilots are trained to the same 
exacting standards.  
E Our experienced Security team has an ongoing programme to check that the security standards of our 
operations and the airports which we serve meet high standards. We know that the proper management 
of risk means that we must anticipate and deal with issues in advance. Our Security team also maintains 
close contact with relevant authorities in order to assess any potential security or other threats to our 
operations. Any serious threat will be escalated to senior management. We have in the past suspended 
operations to destinations where the safety of our aircraft, passengers and crew cannot be guaranteed.  
We can control many risks, but some remain beyond our control. Like other airlines, Wizz Air is subject to 
disruptions caused by factors beyond its control, including adverse weather conditions and other natural 
events. Delays frustrate passengers, may affect Wizz Air’s reputation and may reduce aircraft utilisation as 
a result of flight cancellations and increase costs, all of which, in turn, affect profitability. However, Wizz 
Air’s policy remains to cancel as few flights as possible, reflected in its flight completion rate. We have 
detailed handling manuals for delayed passengers or passengers whose flights have been cancelled and, as 
needed, have developed contingency plans for particular possible events. 
We outsource non-core functions, which means that we’re dependent on third-party services and 
facility providers. A failure of any of our business partners – whether to observe contractual obligations or 
financially – can affect our operation. Proper performance by our partners is of the utmost importance to us 
and we generally impose contractually-binding performance standards. We also look at the track records of 
our suppliers and our centralised procurement process looks at the financial fitness of key suppliers before 
contracts are awarded. 
Wizz Air is a people business. We know that our people are the backbone of our business and it’s their 
dedication, day in, day out that allows us to deliver our low cost, quality service. But we know that we can’t 
take our people for granted that competition for the high quality people whom we seek is keen and may 
become even more so. 
E From time to time, pilots and others can be in short supply. We invest a huge amount of time in 
recruiting pilots and also training them to maintain our high standards. In order to ensure the future 
availability of pilots of the right calibre, we have recently announced a five year training partnership with 
CTC Aviation Training and Central European Flight Academy, to provide cadet pilots to Wizz Air. Wizz 
Air will provide a job guarantee (subject to achieving proficiency) and so assist the trainee pilots in 
securing funding for their training.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES CONTINUED 
 
Risks relating to the group continued 
Operational risks continued 
E We are proud that, to date, we have maintained a good relationship with our employees and we have 
not experienced industrial unrest. We strive to make sure that this will remain the case, but we realise 
that there can be no guarantee. We consider direct communication between senior management and 
other employees as the best way of listening to our employees’ concerns. Visits by senior management 
to each of our operating bases are organised twice a year.  
E Our success to date has also depended on a number of key personnel, including our Chief Executive 
Officer, other senior managers and post holders required by regulation. Our continuing success will 
depend on having the right people in those key positions. While, in the past, we have successfully 
recruited for those positions, we recognise that we have a pool of talent within the Company and have 
recently started a talent assessment programme for our staff. 
Financial risks 
Financial risk and financial risk management are analysed also in Note 3 to the accounts on pages 87 to 92. 
We are a truly international business and, while we report in Euros, we transact in 20 currencies. We 
also have to make a large number of payments in US Dollars. Appreciation of the US Dollar against the Euro 
may impact results and margins. Therefore, to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations in respect of 
costs incurred in US Dollars, we engage in Euro/US Dollar hedging in accordance with a Board-approved 
hedging policy. Transactions are subject to the approval of the Audit Committee.  
Fuel accounted for 37.4% of our total operating cost in the 2015 financial year. A rise in fuel prices can 
significantly affect our operating costs. We therefore hedge our aviation fuel cost in accordance with a 
Board-approved hedging policy and involving the Audit Committee.  
Our cash needs to be safe. We believe that security of our cash should take priority over investment 
income. Investment of the Company’s cash is carried out in accordance with the Board-approved 
counterparty risk policy, with a large part of our free cash being invested in AAA-rated money market funds. 
Information technology risks 
Wizz Air is, primarily, an e-business. During the 2015 financial year 94% of bookings were made through 
our website, wizzair.com. We are therefore dependent on our information technology systems to manage, 
for example, receive and process ticket reservations, process credit and debit card payments, check in 
passengers, manage our traffic network, perform flight operations and engage in other critical business tasks. 
We outsource the operation of these systems to a number of IT suppliers. However, we retain an 
experienced internal team to oversee the operation of these systems and include suitable contractual 
recovery and other key performance standards with each of our key IT suppliers. We are also planning to 
increase the number of card acquirers and payment service providers that we use, with each provider being 
an effective back-up for the others. We will continue to review our business critical systems to ensure that 
the appropriate level of back-up is in place. Business continuity processes are also tested and we have 
procedures in place to ensure that key staff can be relocated to an alternative location should our normal 
offices become unusable. 
Cyber security is a key consideration. We will review the protections we have in place to ensure that they are 
maintained at an appropriate level and those reviews will involve the Audit Committee.  
The Strategic Report on pages 4 to 30 was approved by the Board on 26 May 2015 and was signed on its 
behalf.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT 
A COMPANY COMMITTED TO HIGH STANDARDS OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Chairman’s statement on corporate governance 
Wizz Air’s Ordinary Share capital was admitted to the premium listing segment of the UK Listing Authority’s 
Official List and to trading on the London Stock Exchange’s main market for listed securities on 2 March 
2015. In this, Wizz Air’s first annual report to be issued since listing, I want to stress that Wizz Air’s Directors 
have always sought to maintain high standards of corporate governance appropriate for a company of its 
size. 
As the Company moves into its new life as a listed company, the Directors are committed to ensure that this 
remains the case. This section of the report outlines how Wizz Air has complied with the provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (September 2012), which is issued by the Financial Reporting Council and 
available to view at www.frc.org.uk. 
While Wizz Air is committed to complying fully with the UK Corporate Governance Code, at this particular 
stage of the Company’s development, there is one area where an exception to full compliance has been 
approved by the Directors and which is described in the section headed “Compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code” below. Three Directors, namely Stephen L. Johnson, John R. Wilson and myself, have 
been nominated to hold office as Non-Executive Directors by Indigo Hungary LP and Indigo Maple Hill LP 
(together, “Indigo”), as contemplated by the relationship agreement entered into by Indigo and Wizz Air 
which is described in the section headed “Our Key Shareholders”. The Directors recognise that the Company 
must retain appropriate expertise on the Board and its committees at all times and therefore agreed that 
Stephen L. Johnson and John R. Wilson should remain members of the Company’s Audit Committee and 
Remuneration Committee respectively until 2 March 2016 at the latest.  
As the Company continues to develop, so will the corporate governance processes. As Chairman, my 
primary aim is to ensure that the Board provides effective leadership of the Company. During the recent 
initial public offering process, we looked closely at the Board’s composition and concluded that the Board 
does, indeed, have the necessary balance of skills and experience as well as independence. It is, however, 
important that the Board recognises that it must continually re-appraise its involvement in the Company’s 
business and also its own processes, so that its capabilities grow alongside the Company. As an indication of 
the developments planned for the 2016 financial year, the Board will introduce a performance evaluation 
programme of the Board, its committees and individual Directors. The Board has also requested that the 
Audit Committee further develop the comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation reviews already carried 
out by the Company’s Internal Audit function.  
I have already noted that the Company is at the start of its public life. It is vitally important that both the 
Board and the Company’s senior management positively engage with those investors who have placed their 
trust in the Company. Senior management will, therefore, arrange quarterly meetings to discuss periodic 
financial results with the Company’s key investors and their views and any concerns they might have will be 
fed back to the Board. 
The trust that both investors and other stakeholders have placed in the Board is not taken for granted. We 
will continue to develop our processes to ensure that our policy of ensuring high standards of governance 
appropriate for the Company is maintained in the future.

GOVERNANCE 
COMPLIANCE WITH THE UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE 
 
The Directors support high standards of corporate governance and it is the policy of the Company to 
comply with current best practice in UK corporate governance to the extent appropriate for a company of 
its size. The Board intends that the Company will comply fully with the requirements of the Corporate 
Governance Code (2014) during the 2016 financial year, its first full year since completion of the initial public 
offering and, so, becoming subject to the Corporate Governance Code, save as set out below: 
a) William A. Franke, the Chairman, does not meet the independence criteria set out in the Corporate 
Governance Code, given that he is the managing partner of Indigo. However, given the benefits for the 
Company of his recognised experience in the airline industry, the Board believes that Mr Franke should 
continue as Chairman. 
b) Stephen L. Johnson, who is not considered to be an independent Non-Executive Director given his past 
position with Indigo, is a member of the Audit Committee. The Board considers that given Mr Johnson’s 
experience and familiarity with the Group, and the fact that the Audit Committee Chairman, Mr Duffy, 
was recently appointed to the Board, Mr Johnson should remain on the Audit Committee until 2 March 
2016, at the latest. Until that date, the Company will not comply with the provisions of paragraph C.3.1. of 
the Corporate Governance Code, which requires all members of the Audit Committee to be independent 
non-executive Directors. 
c) John R. Wilson, who is not considered to be an independent Non-Executive Director as he is a principal 
of Indigo, is a member of the Remuneration Committee. The Board considers that given Mr Wilson’s 
experience and familiarity with the Group, and the fact that the Remuneration Committee Chairman, Mr 
Demuynck, was recently appointed to the Board, Mr Wilson should remain on the Remuneration 
Committee until 2 March 2016, at the latest. Until that date, the Company will not comply with the 
provisions of paragraph D.2.1. of the Corporate Governance Code, which requires all members of the 
Remuneration Committee to be independent non-executive Directors. 
The Board considers that it and the Company have, from the period from the admission of its shares to the 
premium segment of the Official List on 2 March 2015 to 31 March 2015, complied with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (September 2012) which is the version of the Code which applies to the Company for its 
2015 financial year, save as set out above. The Code is issued by the Financial Reporting Council and is 
available for review on the Financial Reporting Council's website: www.frc.org.uk.

Ordinary Shares into which the Convertible Shares may be converted. 
Each convertible share may be converted into one Ordinary Share, as long as the ownership of the Company 
remains compliant with applicable EU ownership and control rules. Indigo also holds a number of convertible 
notes which may be converted into Ordinary Shares, again provided that the Company’s ownership remains 
compliant with EU ownership and control rules. The Company, Wizz Air Hungary Ltd. and Indigo entered 
into a new note purchase agreement on 24 February 2015 which governs the terms of these convertible 
notes. Our Chairman, William A. Franke, is the managing partner of Indigo. 
According to the Listing Rules, any person who exercises or controls the exercise, on their own or together 
with any person with whom they are acting in concert, 30% or more of the votes able to be cast on all or 
substantially all matters at general meetings of a company are known as “controlling shareholders”. The UK 
Listing Authority takes the view that, in the circumstances, Indigo is a controlling shareholder for these 
purposes. The Listing Rules require companies with controlling shareholders to enter into a written and 
legally binding agreement which is intended to ensure that the controlling shareholder complies with certain 
independence provisions. The agreement must contain undertakings that: 
a) transactions and arrangements with the controlling shareholder (and/or any of its associates) will be 
conducted at arm’s length and on normal commercial terms; 
b) neither the controlling shareholder nor any of its associates will take any action that would have the 
effect of preventing the listed company from complying with its obligations under the Listing Rules; and 
c) neither the controlling shareholder nor any of its associates will propose or procure the proposal of a 
shareholder resolution which is intended or appears to be intended to circumvent the proper application 
of the Listing Rules. 
Wizz Air entered into a relationship agreement with Indigo dated 24 February 2015. The key terms of this 
relationship agreement are set out below. 
Independence 
Indigo has undertaken to exercise its voting powers in relation to the Company to ensure that the Company 
is capable of operating and making decisions for the benefit of the shareholders of the Company as a whole 
and independently of Indigo at all times. In addition, Indigo has undertaken that it will not, and will procure 
that none of its associates will, (a) take any action that would have the effect of preventing the Company 
from complying with its obligations under the Listing Rules and (b) propose or procure the proposal of a 
Shareholder resolution which is intended or appears to be intended to circumvent the proper application of 
the Listing Rules. 
Board 
Indigo may nominate: (a) three Directors to the Board if Indigo and its associates hold in excess of 30 per 
cent. of the fully converted share capital of the Company (i.e. assuming the conversion in full of all 
Convertible Shares and Convertible Notes); (b) two Directors to the Board if Indigo and its associates hold in 
excess of 20 per cent. of the fully converted share capital or (c) one Director to the Board if Indigo and its 
associates hold in excess of ten per cent. of the fully converted share capital (each an “Indigo Director”). If 
Indigo and/or its associates no longer hold at least 30, 20 or ten per cent., respectively, of the fully 
converted share capital of the Company, then Indigo has agreed to procure, in so far as it is legally able to do 
so, that the appropriate number of Indigo Directors resigns from the Board unless a majority of the 
independent Directors resolve that any Indigo Director should remain on the Board. 
Indigo may not nominate any person to be an Indigo Director whose re-election has been proposed to, but 
not approved by, the holders of Ordinary Shares in general meeting, or who has been removed from office 
by a resolution of the holders of Ordinary Shares.

hold at least ten per cent. of the fully converted share capital of the Company. 
The Board shall manage the Company independently of Indigo in accordance with the Articles, the Listing 
Rules and applicable law. The parties have also agreed that at least half of the Board (excluding the 
chairman) shall comprise independent Non-Executive Directors, the Nomination Committee shall consist of a 
majority of independent Directors and, save as set out in the paragraph above, the Remuneration and Audit 
Committees shall consist only of independent Directors. 
Arm’s length transactions 
All transactions and relationships between the Company and Indigo or any of their associates shall be 
conducted at arm’s length, on a normal commercial basis and in accordance with the related party 
transaction rules set out in Chapter 11 of the Listing Rules.  
Provision of information and confidentiality 
Indigo shall, subject to the Company’s obligations under all applicable laws (including, without limitation, the 
Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules), be provided with financial, management 
and/or other information relating to any member of the Group as Indigo (or any of its associates) may 
reasonably require for the purposes of any internal or external reporting requirements which the relevant 
party is required by internal compliance, law or regulation to make. Indigo may disclose any such financial, 
management and/or other information to its associates provided that (a) Indigo will (and will procure that 
any associate to whom any information is passed) keep confidential any such information, (b) such 
information does not include information relating to any transaction between the Company and Indigo or 
any of their associates obtained as a result of an Indigo Director’s position as a Director, (c) disclosure 
would not result in the breach by the Company of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules or require 
the Company to make a public announcement and (d) the name of such persons to whom information is 
disclosed is added to the Company’s insider list.  
Confirmation regarding compliance 
The Board confirms that, since the entry into the relationship agreement, on 24 February 2015 until 26 May 
2015, being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this report: 
a) the Company has complied with the independence provisions included in the relationship agreement; 
and 
b) so far as the Company is aware, the independence provisions included in the relationship agreement 
have been complied with by Indigo. 
Engaging with our Shareholders 
Wizz Air recognises the need to engage with our Shareholders. Prior to the IPO, the Chief Executive Officer 
and the Chief Financial Officer met with a number of potential investors during a roadshow. A number of 
those potential investors participated in the IPO and are now Shareholders. 
The Company’s Investor Relations department will arrange a number of meetings and roadshows, timed 
around the release of financial results, with investors. The Chairman and Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director will be available to answer questions from key investors at the Annual General Meeting.  
A report on Investor Relations is presented by the Chief Financial Officer at each Board meeting, during 
which feedback from meetings held by senior management with investors is provided. The Board is supplied 
with copies of analysts’ and brokers’ briefings as they are received.  
During the course of the 2016 financial year, the Company will consider arrangements to allow the Chairman 
and Senior Independent Non-Executive Director to meet with key investors.

Independence 
The UK Corporate Governance Code recommends that at least half the members (excluding the chairman) 
of the board of directors of a company with a premium listing should be non-executive directors, determined 
by the Board to be independent in character and judgment and free from relationships or circumstances 
which are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, their judgment. 
The Board has considered the independence of the Company’s Non-Executive Directors and has concluded 
that: 
a) William A. Franke, the Chairman, does not meet the independence criteria set out in the Corporate 
Governance Code, given that he is the managing partner of Indigo (a significant shareholder). However, 
given the benefits for the Company of his recognised experience in the airline industry, the Board 
believes that it is in the Company’s best interest that Mr Franke should continue as Chairman of Wizz Air. 
b) Stephen L. Johnson is not considered to be an independent Non-Executive Director given his past 
position with Indigo. He is also a member of the Audit Committee. The Board considers that given Mr 
Johnson’s experience and familiarity with the Group, and the fact that the Audit Committee Chairman, 
Mr Duffy was recently appointed to the Board, Mr Johnson should remain on the Audit Committee until 
no later than 2 March 2016. 
c) John R. Wilson is not considered to be an independent Non-Executive Director as he is a principal of 
Indigo. He is also a member of the Remuneration Committee. The Board considers that given Mr 
Wilson’s experience and familiarity with the Group, and the fact that the Remuneration Committee 
Chairman, Mr Demuynck, was recently appointed to the Board, Mr Wilson should remain on the 
Remuneration Committee until no later than 2 March 2016. 
Other than William A. Franke, John R. Wilson and Stephen L. Johnson, the Company regards all of its Non-
Executive Directors, namely, Guy Demuynck, Simon Duffy, Thierry de Preux and John McMahon, as 
independent Non-Executive Directors within the meaning of “independent” as defined in the Corporate 
Governance Code and free from any business or other relationship which could materially interfere with the 
exercise of their independent judgment. Accordingly, the Company complies with the requirement of the 
Corporate Governance Code that at least half of the board (excluding the chairman) of a company with a 
premium listing should comprise independent non-executive directors.

MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY CONTINUED 
Board Committees 
The Directors have established an Audit Committee, a Remuneration Committee and a Nomination 
Committee. The members of these committees are appointed principally from among the independent 
Directors and all appointments to these committees shall be for a period of one year. The terms of reference 
of the committees have been drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Corporate Governance 
Code. A summary of the terms of reference of the committees is set out below. 
Each committee and each Director has the authority to seek independent professional advice where 
necessary to discharge their respective duties, in each case at the Company’s expense. 
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee’s duties, as set out in its terms of reference, include: 
a) monitoring the integrity of the Company’s financial statements of the Company, including its annual and 
semi-annual reports, interim management statements, preliminary results announcements and any other 
formal announcement relating to its financial performance; 
b) reviewing significant financial reporting issues and judgments which they contain having regard to 
matters communicated to it by the auditors;  
c) where requested by the Board, reviewing the content of the annual report and accounts and advise the 
Board on whether, taken as a whole, it is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for Shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy;  
d) keeping under review the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company’s internal financial controls and 
internal control and risk management systems;  
e) reviewing the adequacy and security of the Company’s arrangements for its employees and contractors 
to raise concerns, in confidence, about possible wrongdoing in financial reporting or other matters. The 
Committee shall ensure that these arrangements allow proportionate and independent investigation of 
such matters and appropriate follow-up action;  
f) monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the Company’s Internal Audit function in the context of 
the Company’s overall risk management system; 
g) considering and approving the remit of the Internal Audit function and ensuring it has adequate 
resources and appropriate access to information to enable it to perform its function effectively and in 
accordance with the relevant professional standards. The Audit Committee shall also ensure the Internal 
Audit function has adequate standing and is free from management or other restrictions; 
h) meeting the Company’s head of the Internal Audit function at least once a year, without management 
being present, to discuss their remit and any issues arising from the internal audits carried out. In 
addition, the Audit Committee shall ensure that the Company’s head of the Internal Audit function has 
the right of direct access to the Chairman, the Audit Committee Chairman and to the rest of the 
Committee, and is accountable to the Committee; 
i) considering and making recommendations to the Board, to be put to Shareholders for approval at the 
AGM, in relation to the appointment, re-appointment and removal of the Company’s external auditors. 
The Committee shall oversee the selection process for new auditors and if auditors resign, the 
Committee shall investigate the issues leading to this and decide whether any action is required; 
j) overseeing the relationship with the external auditors including (but not limited to): 
I. assessing annually their independence and objectivity taking into account relevant UK 
professional and regulatory requirements and the relationship with the external auditors as a 
whole, including the provisions of any non-audit services; and 
II. satisfying itself that there are no relationships (such as family, employment, investment, financial 
or business) between the external auditors and the Company (other than in the ordinary course 
of business) which could adversely affect the auditors’ independence and objectivity; 
k) meeting regularly with the external auditors, including once at the planning stage before the audit and 
once after the audit at the reporting stage. The Audit Committee shall meet the external auditors at least 
once a year, without management being present, to discuss their remit and any issues arising from the 
audit;

Board Committees continued 
Audit Committee continued 
l) reviewing and approving the annual audit plan and ensuring that it is consistent with the scope of the 
audit engagement having regard to the seniority, expertise and experience of the audit team; and 
m) reviewing the findings of the audit with the external auditors. This shall include but not be limited to the 
following: 
I. a discussion of any major issues which arose during the audit; 
II. any accounting and audit judgments;  
III. levels of errors identified during the audit; and  
IV. the effectiveness of the audit process. 
The Corporate Governance Code recommends that the Audit Committee should comprise at least three 
members, who should all be independent Non-Executive Directors, and that at least one member should 
have recent and relevant financial experience. The membership of the Company’s Audit Committee 
comprises three members, namely Simon Duffy, Stephen L. Johnson and John McMahon, all of whom apart 
from Stephen L. Johnson are independent Non-Executive Directors. No members of the Audit Committee 
have links with the Company’s external auditors. Mr Duffy is considered by the Board to have recent and 
relevant financial experience and is Chairman of the Audit Committee, a position to which he was appointed 
on 24 July 2014, following his predecessor Mr Tierney’s resignation as a Director in accordance with the 
provisions of a noteholders’ and shareholders’ agreement then in place. 
The Company therefore considers that it complies with the Corporate Governance Code recommendation 
regarding the composition of the Audit Committee other than in respect of Stephen L. Johnson’s position on 
that committee. Mr Johnson will be replaced as a member of the Audit Committee by no later than 2 March 
2016. 
The Audit Committee will formally meet at least three times per year and otherwise as required. The Chief 
Executive Officer, other Directors and representatives from the finance function may attend and speak at 
meetings of the Audit Committee. The Company’s external auditors and Chief Financial Officer will be invited 
to attend meetings of the Audit Committee on a regular basis. Following each meeting, the Chairman of the 
Audit Committee reports to the Board on the significant items discussed during the Audit Committee’s 
meeting. The Audit Committee met on seven occasions during the 2015 financial year. In addition to the 
formal meetings, the Audit Committee is in regular contact with relevant management in connection with, 
for example, the implementation of the Group’s hedging strategy. 
Remuneration Committee 
On 2 March 2015, the Remuneration Committee replaced the Company’s previous Compensation 
Committee, which was chaired by William A. Franke and the members of which were Guido Demuynck, 
Thierry de Preux and John R. Wilson. 
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for setting the remuneration policy for all Executive Directors 
and the Chairman, including pension rights and any compensation payments, and recommending and 
monitoring the remuneration of the senior managers. Non-Executive Directors’ fees are determined by the 
full Board.  
The objective of the Company’s remuneration policy is to attract, retain and motivate executive 
management of the quality required to run the Company successfully without paying more than is necessary, 
having regard to the views of Shareholders and other stakeholders. 
The Remuneration Committee is also responsible for making recommendations for the grants of awards 
under the Company’s share option schemes. In accordance with the Remuneration Committee’s terms of 
reference, no Director may participate in discussions relating to his own terms and conditions of 
remuneration. 
The Corporate Governance Code provides that the Remuneration Committee should comprise at least three 
members, all of whom should be independent Non-Executive Directors. The membership of the Company’s 
Remuneration Committee comprises three members, namely Guido Demuynck, John R. Wilson and Thierry 
de Preux, all of whom apart from John R. Wilson are independent Non-Executive Directors. The Chairman of 
the Remuneration Committee is Mr Demuynck, who took up his appointment on 2 March 2015 following 
completion of the Company’s initial public offering.

The Company therefore considers that it complies with the Corporate Governance Code recommendations 
regarding the composition of the Remuneration Committee other than in respect of John R. Wilson’s 
position on that committee. Mr Wilson will be replaced as a member of the Remuneration Committee no 
later than 2 March 2016. 
The Remuneration Committee meets formally at least twice each year and otherwise as required. Following 
its establishment, there was one meeting of the Remuneration Committee during the 2015 financial year, 
although there were also four meetings prior to 2 March 2015 of the Company’s former Compensation 
Committee during that financial year. 
Nomination Committee 
The Nomination Committee assists the Board in discharging its responsibilities relating to the composition of 
the Board. The Nomination Committee is responsible for evaluating the balance of skills, knowledge and 
experience on the Board, the size, structure and composition of the Board, retirements and appointments of 
additional and replacement directors and will make appropriate recommendations to the Board on such 
matters. While a number of Directors were initially appointed to the Board under investor appointment 
rights, the most recent appointments of Simon Duffy and Guy Demuynck were conducted through 
Korn/Ferry, which has no other connections with the Company. 
The Corporate Governance Code provides that a majority of the members of the Nomination Committee 
should be independent Non-Executive Directors. The Company’s Nomination Committee is comprised of 
three members, namely William A. Franke, John McMahon and Simon Duffy. The Chairman of the Nomination 
Committee is Mr Franke. The Company therefore considers that it complies with the Corporate Governance 
Code’s recommendations regarding the composition of the Nomination Committee. 
The Company recognises the importance to the Company of diversity, including gender equality. The 
Company’s Code of Ethics is unequivocal that discriminatory practices will not be tolerated and that people 
will be judged on the basis of their performance and ability to do their jobs and not on any other basis. In 
addition, the Nomination Committee intends to work further on developing a policy to ensure that, when the 
opportunity presents itself, diversity is properly reflected in the Board and in the Company’s senior 
management. 
The Nomination Committee is scheduled to meet formally at least twice a year and otherwise as required. As 
a newly constituted committee, there were no meetings of the Nomination Committee during the 2015 
financial year.

MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY CONTINUED 
Board procedures 
At least five Board meetings are scheduled during each financial year. At these meetings, the Directors meet 
with senior executives to receive detailed updates on Wizz Air’s business and operations. Prior to these 
meetings, each Director receives an information pack containing a comprehensive review of the Company’s 
business as well as detailed proposals for approval of transactions and development falling within the 
Board’s remit. The Company believes that this enables each Director properly to discharge his or her 
responsibilities. At each Board meeting, Directors who have a conflict of interest in any agenda item declare 
that interest and are not entitled to vote on that agenda item. 
A number of key strategic and commercial decisions require Board approval and, as and when any such 
decision is needed, an ad hoc telephone Board meeting may be arranged. In general, therefore, it is 
anticipated that there will be around ten Board meetings in total during each financial year. 
Newly appointed Non-Executive Directors meet with the Company’s senior management and visit Wizz Air’s 
operational headquarters to ensure that they have a thorough understanding of the Company’s business. 
Wizz Air maintains directors’ and officers’ liability insurance. This insurance covers any claim that may be 
brought against the Directors in the exercise of their duties. 
The Company has adopted a Share Dealing Policy that reflects and incorporates the provisions of the UK 
Listing Authority’s Model Code. As a consequence, the Directors as well as certain designated employees 
must obtain clearance from the Company’s Chairman before dealing in the Company’s shares and are 
prohibited from dealing at all during certain periods as set out in the Model Code.It is proposed that, in 
accordance with the recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code, all Directors will offer 
themselves for re-election at the Annual General Meeting.

REPORT OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
 
“I took over as Chair of Wizz Air’s Audit Committee on 24 July 2014. The Audit Committee played a key role 
in working with the Company’s Reporting Accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, during the recent 
initial public offering (IPO) to assess the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company’s control and 
corporate governance processes. One of the key issues that the Audit Committee looked at was the 
effectiveness of the Company’s risk assessment and monitoring, particularly in the context of control 
processes and the robustness of the internal and external audit processes. 
Over the coming year, the Audit Committee will implement recent changes in the UK Corporate Governance 
Code and the FRC’s Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business 
Reporting published in September 2014. The Audit Committee will ensure that a robust assessment of 
principal risks is carried out and will assess how these risks are managed and mitigated, working closely with 
the Company’s existing Internal Audit function.” 
Main activities of the Audit Committee during the 2015 financial year 
Materials and documents related to the Company’s initial public offering 
The Audit Committee worked closely with the reporting accountants in connection with the financial 
statements and other documentation produced for the purposes of the Company’s IPO. A number of 
meetings were held between the reporting accountants and the Audit Committee to discuss the contents of 
the working capital report, the long form report, the short form report and the report on financial position 
and prospects procedures. The Audit Committee was also responsible for giving the Board assurance on the 
audit procedures leading up to the IPO. 
Risk management 
The Audit Committee is tasked with ensuring that the Board has adequate oversight of risk management 
and that it deems the controls sufficient and effective.  
The Company’s Internal Audit function conducts an annual risk assessment exercise involving senior 
management from the level of heads of function upwards. Based on this risk assessment exercise, a risk 
register is compiled showing risk description, inherent risk, mitigating measures and residual risk. 
Consideration is then given to which areas can be efficiently improved in line with the Company’s risk 
appetite. 
This risk register is then used to develop an Internal Audit Plan for the year, which is approved by the Audit 
Committee. Internal audits are performed by Deloitte and the Head of Internal Audit, who has direct 
responsibility to the Chairman of the Audit Committee as well as a reporting line to the Company’s Chief 
Executive Officer.  
Following completion of an internal audit, a report is compiled which sets out the findings, makes 
recommendations for control improvement and presents the improvement actions undertaken by 
management. Internal audit reports are submitted and presented to the Audit Committee for approval. The 
Chairman gives a report of the internal audit reports completed in a particular period to the full Board. 
Internal Audit then follows up the completion of the actions and reports back to the Audit Committee on the 
status. A process for verifying the effective application of the controls that are put in place has also been 
started. The Audit Committee will work to ensure that the Company continues to develop effective risk 
assessment and management processes.  
Financial information 
The Audit Committee reviews and approves all interim and final financial statements, as well as the content 
of the Company’s annual report. The Company’s external auditors provide the Audit Committee with a 
briefing on any issues arising. The Audit Committee will also review and approve any regulatory 
announcements that will be made in connection with such financial information. It is only after the Audit 
Committee’s approval that the statements are put to the Board for approval.

Main activities of the Audit Committee during the 2015 financial year continued 
Relationship with external auditors 
The Audit Committee has approved the fees to be paid and the external audit plan for the 2015 financial year 
and reviewed the report of the auditor on the audit performed.  
The Audit Committee will consider the appointment of external auditors for the financial year ending 31 
March 2016 and the Directors will propose a resolution in this respect for the forthcoming annual general 
meeting of the Company. 
The Audit Committee ensures the independence of the Company’s external auditors. The Audit Committee 
considered the fees paid to the external auditor during the year. The relatively high fees paid for non-audit 
services were due to the IPO project of the Company and are not expected to re-occur in the future. 
Significant matters relating to the annual report 
In the course of the preparation of the Company’s financial statements, the following issues were considered 
by the Audit Committee: 
E Maintenance accounting: The Audit Committee satisfied itself that the policy and the procedures 
established in this area in earlier years were followed in the year consistently, including the regular 
updates to estimates and judgments and the maintenance of the system supporting the calculations. 
The Audit Committee considered the issue of a significant contract amendment in progress with a key 
service provider in the area of heavy maintenance and concurred with the conclusion of management 
and the auditor that it is a non-adjusting event for the current year. 
E Hedging: During the year the Audit Committee has overseen a significant increase in the hedging 
volume of the Group, including the introduction of caps (options) as a new instrument for fuel hedging. 
The Audit Committee reviewed the accounting for the time value of hedges as this was the first occasion 
when the time value of open hedge positions was a material number. 
E Convertible debt: Management and the auditor proposed a historic adjustment in the accounting for 
convertible debt instruments (as shown in Note 5 to the financial statements). The Audit Committee 
concurred with the prior year restatement and satisfied itself that the issues leading to the error were 
isolated several years before the current period. 
E IPO: The IPO of the Company brought with itself a number of complex and/or material one-off 
transactions in the areas of share capital, transaction costs, convertible debt instruments and share 
options. The Audit Committee reviewed and agreed to the technical treatment proposed by 
management. 
E Wizz Air Ukraine: The Group announced in March the discontinuation of Wizz Air Ukraine operations 
with effect from 20 April 2015. This decision required a number of considerations both in technical 
accounting treatment and in presentation of the effects of the transaction. The Audit Committee was 
satisfied with the treatment adopted, including the presentation of the arising one-off non-cash gain as 
an exceptional item in the statement of comprehensive income.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT 
 
“Wizz Air is proud of the first set of results delivered as a listed company. The Remuneration Committee 
believes that, to ensure that the Company’s business continues to be run in the best interests of 
Shareholders, the Chief Executive Officer and other senior management should be competitively 
remunerated but that a significant proportion of the remuneration should be performance based, taking into 
account both the Company’s financial and operational performance as well as individual performance.  
The Remuneration Committee will ensure that remuneration remains competitive while not being more than 
is necessary to attract, retain and motivate executive management of the quality required to run the 
Company successfully. In order to ensure that this is the case, the Remuneration Committee has worked with 
Towers Watson to benchmark executive remuneration against a number of comparator companies and we 
intend to continue to benchmark in the coming years. 
During the 2015 financial year, the key major decision taken in connection with Directors’ remuneration was 
the adoption of a new long-term incentive plan, which affects any Executive Director of the Company. 
Details of this long term incentive plan are set out on page 55. The long-term incentive plan reflects the aim 
of the Remuneration Policy that an Executive Director should be incentivised to deliver successfully the 
Company’s strategy and that his or her interests should be aligned with those of the Shareholders. However, 
no award has yet been made under the new long-term incentive plan as it became effective only following 
completion of the IPO. No other substantial changes were made to Directors’ remuneration during the 2015 
financial year. 
Finally, I would note that, while the Company is incorporated in Jersey, we have chosen voluntarily to comply 
in all material respects with the provisions of the UK Companies Act 2006 and related regulations with 
regards to the Directors’ remuneration report and remuneration policy, underlining the Company’s 
commitment to adopt best corporate governance practice.”

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED 
Background 
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for setting the remuneration policy for all Executive Directors 
and the Chairman, including pension rights and any compensation payments, and recommending and 
monitoring the remuneration of the senior managers. Non-Executive Directors’ fees are determined by the 
full Board. The Remuneration Committee and the Board have, in the past, been advised by Towers Watson in 
setting appropriate remuneration levels. The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that Towers Watson 
offers impartial and objective advice and brings a high degree of expertise to the Remuneration Committee’s 
discussions. During the 2015 financial year, Towers Watson assisted the Remuneration Committee in 
developing the long term incentive plan. Towers Watson received fees totalling just over GBP 40,000 for 
this work. 
Our principle consideration when determining the remuneration policy is to ensure that it supports our 
Company strategy and business objectives, as well as to attract, retain and motivate executive management 
of the quality required to run the Company successfully without paying more than is necessary. 
In the selection of performance measures for both the annual performance bonus and long-term incentive 
plan the Committee takes into account the Group’s strategic objectives and short and long-term business 
priorities. The performance targets are set in accordance with the Group’s annual operating plan and are 
reviewed annually to ensure that they are sufficiently stretching. In selecting the targets the Committee also 
takes into account analysts’ forecasts, economic conditions and the Committee’s expectation of 
performance over the relevant period. 
A summary of the Remuneration Committee’s terms of reference can be found on our corporate website, 
corporate.wizzair.com. The current members of the Remuneration Committee are Guy Demuynck, John R. 
Wilson and Thierry de Preux. Further details about the Remuneration Committee are set out on pages 41 to 
42 of the Corporate Governance Report. 
Remuneration policy 
Introduction 
This section of the Directors’ Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with The Large and 
Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 as amended (the 
Regulations), which the Company has chosen to comply with in all material respects as a matter of best 
practice. It sets out the Remuneration Policy, which will be put forward for Shareholder approval at the AGM 
on 29 September 2015 and will apply, subject to such Shareholder approval, to any remuneration and loss of 
office payments made on or after that date. All remuneration and loss of office payments will only be made if 
they are consistent with the approved policy. 
The aim of the Remuneration Policy is to: 
E attract, retain and motivate executive management without paying more than is necessary; 
E incentivise the successful execution of the Company’s business strategy; and 
E align the Executive Directors’ long term interests with those of Shareholders. 
Remuneration policy 
a) Executive Director remuneration 
The Chief Executive Officer is currently the Company’s sole Executive Director. The Remuneration 
Committee believes that the Company’s Remuneration Policy supports the Company’s ultra-low cost 
business model by incentivising senior management, including the Chief Executive Officer, to continue to 
strive to increase the Company’s cost advantage while improving the customer’s experience. The Chief 
Executive Officer currently receives a base salary and is eligible for an annual performance bonus of up to 
200 per cent. of base salary, with the actual bonus amount paid being dependent on the Company 
achieving certain financial and operational targets.  
In deciding appropriate remuneration levels, the Remuneration Committee takes into account, among other 
things, the levels paid at competitor low cost carriers.

performance requirements as 
determined by the 
Remuneration Committee being 
met and up to a maximum 
bonus set as a percentage of 
base salary by the 
Remuneration Committee. The 
maximum bonus for an

requirements relate to Company 
profitability, on-time 
performance, operating cost 
and personal performance. The 
Chief Executive’s maximum 
bonus is currently 200% of 
base salary. 
Performance requirements 
are determined by the 
Remuneration Committee 
annually. They are intended 
to align the performance of the 
Executive Directors with the 
Group’s near-term objectives  
of delivering against its strategy. 
In particular, the performance 
requirements incentivize the 
Executive Directors to focus 
on cost control to achieve 
profitability targets, while 
delivering a reliable service 
to customers. 
There are no provisions for the 
recovery of sums paid pursuant

maximum face value of annual 
awards will be 250% of salary 
for the Chief Executive Officer 
and the Executive Director must 
remain in office when the 
performance shares vest. 
Performance targets 
are determined by the 
Remuneration Committee and 
vesting of the performance 
shares is subject to performance 
targets being met over the 
performance period. 
If a participant’s employment 
ends before the end of the 
performance period, any vested 
and unvested options will 
normally lapse, save in certain 
“good leaver” scenarios.

In approving this policy, authority is to be given to the Company to honour commitments paid, promised to 
be paid or awarded to (i) current or former Directors prior to the date of this policy being approved or (ii) to 
an individual (who subsequently is appointed as a Director of the Company) at a time when the relevant 
individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, was not in 
consideration of that individual becoming a Director of the Company, even where such commitments are 
inconsistent with the provisions of this policy. 
Outstanding awards under the Company’s previous 2009 international employee share option plan remain 
eligible for vesting and exercise in accordance with their terms. 
Consideration of shareholder views 
The Remuneration Committee and the Board will consider Shareholder feedback received in relation to the 
AGM each year at a meeting immediately following the AGM and any action required will be incorporated 
into the Remuneration Committee's business plan for the ensuing period. This, and any additional feedback 
received from Shareholders from time to time, will then be considered by the Remuneration Committee and 
as part of the Company's annual review of remuneration arrangements. 
Specific engagement with major Shareholders may be undertaken when a significant change in remuneration 
policy is proposed.

**  At ‘Target’ there is 100% payout (being equal to twelve months salary in the case of the CEO) 
*** If the ‘Maximum’ is reached or exceeded then there is 200% payout. 
The amount in the LTIP column is nil because no shares or share options were issued to the Chief Executive 
Officer in the 2015 financial year (2014: nil).  
1,920,075 share options were issued to the Chief Executive Officer during the 2005-2011 calendar years from 
the previous long-term incentive plan (ESOP) of the Company. The options vested three years after grant 
but their exercise was subject to the occurrence of a qualifying IPO (see Note 28 to the financial statements). 
Of these, 1,755,075 were exercised during the 2015 financial year. At the IPO share price of GBP 11.50 (app. 
€15.66) and deducting the grant price, this equates to a net transfer value of €23.8 million. The remaining 
165,000 (vested) options were unexercised at 31 March 2015, valid until April 2021.

Executive Director’s remuneration continued 
During the 2015 financial year the Company and one of its subsidiaries provided loans to four out of the six 
Officers of the Group, including to the Chief Executive Officer. The purpose of the loans was to enable these 
employees to exercise their share options by buying the respective shares before the end of 2014, so that 
they could take advantage of preferential tax rules available in Switzerland until the end of 2014.  
The amount of the loan provided to the Chief Executive Officer was €4.6 million, secured by the shares 
purchased. The loan tranches were provided between December 2014 and February 2015 and repaid in 
March 2015. The interest rate on the loan was 1.50% per annum and that was considered to be the market 
rate of interest in Switzerland for similar loans. Altogether €12,000 interest was paid by the Chief Executive 
Officer on repayment.

Directors’ service agreement and letters of appointment 
Executive Director 
The Chief Executive Officer entered into a service agreement with the Geneva branch of Wizz Air Hungary 
Ltd. (“WAHL”), effective as of 1 April 2010, subject to termination upon three months’ notice by either 
party. WAHL also has the right to terminate Mr Váradi’s employment with immediate effect by 
payment in lieu of notice. The service agreement contains post-termination restrictive covenants 
preventing Mr Váradi from competing with WAHL or any of its business partners in the EU as well as those 
non-EU countries where WAHL operates for a period of one year following the termination of his 
employment. Mr Váradi will be paid a sum equal to six months’ base salary if WAHL chooses to enforce 
these restrictive covenants. Upon termination of employment other than for cause, Mr Váradi is entitled to a 
severance payment equal to six months’ salary.

Directors’ service agreement and letters of appointment continued 
Non-Executive Directors 
The Company entered into letters of appointment with each of its Non-Executive Directors on 4 June 2014, 
which became effective on completion of the IPO for a term of three years. Each Non-Executive Director’s 
appointment may be terminated by the Company or the Non-Executive Director with one month’s written 
notice. Continuation of the appointment is contingent on continued satisfactory performance and re-election 
at the Company’s annual general meetings and the appointment will terminate automatically on the 
termination of the appointment by the Shareholders or, where Shareholder approval is required for the 
appointment to continue, the withholding of approval by the Shareholders. Reappointment will be reviewed 
annually.  
The Non-Executive Directors receive a fee of €25,000 per annum, plus €2,500 for each full Board Meeting 
attended. Simon Duffy, as chairman of the Audit Committee, will receive an additional fee of €18,750 per 
annum for taking on that role. Guido Demuynck, as chairman of the Remuneration Committee, will receive an 
additional fee of €12,500 per annum for taking on that role. Mr Franke, as Chairman, will receive an additional 
fee of €25,000 per annum for taking on that role. The Non-Executive Directors will also be reimbursed for all 
proper and reasonable expenses incurred in performing their duties. 
In accordance with the terms of the letters of appointment described above, each of the Non-Executive 
Directors is required to allocate sufficient time to discharge their responsibilities effectively. Each Letter of 
Appointment contains obligations of confidentiality which have effect during the appointment and after 
termination thereof. 
Directors’ shareholdings 
The Chief Executive Officer holds a significant shareholding in the Company, through a family trust and is 
also eligible to participate in the Company’s long-term incentive plan. 
Each of the Non-Executive Directors is also a Shareholder in the Company, following awards made under a 
historic non-executive share scheme and/or the purchase of shares with the relevant Director’s own cash. No 
new share plan awards have been made since July 2013 or will be made in the future under this historic share 
scheme. 
The Company therefore believes that the interests of the Directors are well aligned with those of the 
Shareholders. Full details of the Directors’ and their connected persons’ interests in the Company’s shares as 
at 31 March 2015 are set out below:

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED 
Long-term Incentive Plan 
It is intended that awards will be made under the long-term incentive plan (“LTIP”) previously approved by 
the Board, the entry into force of which was conditional upon completion of the IPO. The LTIP is intended to 
attract, retain and motivate the Group’s senior management and to focus them on delivery of the Group’s 
strategic and business objectives. Dilution under the LTIP is limited to 5 per cent. of the issued 
Ordinary Share capital of the Company over any rolling ten-year period. 
The LTIP is a discretionary performance share plan (structured as a nil-cost option). Under the LTIP the 
Remuneration Committee has the discretion to, within certain limits and subject to certain performance 
conditions as the Remuneration Committee may determine, grant to eligible employees nil-cost options 
over Ordinary Shares (“Options”). No payment is required for the grant of an Option. Options are 
granted as either “Performance Options” (whereby vesting of the Option is subject to pre-defined and 
notified performance conditions being met during a specified performance period, which is no shorter 
than three years from the date of grant) or “Restricted Options” (whereby the Option vests over time 
without any performance conditions attached). The Chief Executive Officer and any other Executive Director 
who may be appointed will only be eligible to receive Performance Options. 
Options will vest at least three years from the grant of the Option depending on the length of the 
performance period. Participants will have ten years from the date of grant to exercise an Option.  
Vesting of performance options is subject to performance conditions being met over the performance 
period, which is a minimum of three years from the date of grant. The performance conditions applicable to 
performance options will be set by the Remuneration Committee at the beginning of each performance 
period. The Remuneration Committee has set the following performance criteria for awards of Performance 
Options to be made during the 2016 financial year: 
a) relative total shareholder return (TSR) growth versus selected European airlines (50 per cent. weighting) 
during the performance period; and 
b) absolute fully diluted earnings per share (EPS) growth of the Company (50 per cent. weighting) during 
the performance period. 
The selected European airline peer group is to consist of the following entities: Ryanair, easyJet and Aer 
Lingus (50 per cent. weighting); AirFrance / KLM, Air Berlin, Deutsche Lufthansa, Finnair, Flybe, IAG and SAS 
(50 per cent. weighting). 
At vesting, for the relative TSR performance measure, payout is to be 25 per cent. of the award for 
performance equal to median performance, with a 100 per cent. payout for performance equal to or 
exceeding upper quartile performance. There will be no payout for below median performance for either 
TSR or EPS individually, and no more than 100 per cent. may be paid out in either category. Linear 
interpolation will apply for performance between the median and upper quartile. 
At vesting, for the absolute EPS growth performance measure, payout is to be 25 per cent. of the award for 
threshold average annual EPS growth during the performance period with a 100 per cent. payout for 
maximum average annual EPS growth during the performance period. 
The Remuneration Committee will notify each participant of how many Option shares have vested at the 
end of each performance period. The Remuneration Committee shall determine the impact, if any, of the 
performance criteria on the vested Options and whether the performance outcome represents a fair 
reflection of the Company’s underlying financial performance. 
If a participant’s employment with the Group ceases before the end of the performance period any 
vested (if not exercised) and unvested Options will normally lapse and be forfeited. 
It is anticipated that the first awards under the LTIP will be made during the course of the 2016 financial year.  
A number of options remain outstanding under the Company’s previous international employee share option 
plan (ESOP). See details of this in Note 29 to the financial statements. Of the outstanding ESOP options as at 
31 March 2015 the Chief Executive Officer held options for 165,000 shares. The Chief Executive Officer 
received his last share option award under this plan in 2011. 
The Non-Executive Directors have not received and do not hold share options.

Change in total employee remuneration compared to dividends and share buybacks 
There were no dividends or share buybacks either in the 2015 financial year or the 2014 financial year. Total 
employee remuneration changed from €47.3 million in the 2014 financial year to €55.6 million in the 2015 
financial year (see Note 8 to the financial statements), being a 17.5% increase year or year. 
Application of the remuneration policy in the 2016 financial year 
a) Chief Executive Officer’s base salary 
The Remuneration Committee requested Towers Watson to benchmark the remuneration of the Chief 
Executive Officer and other members of senior management against the Company’s competitors.  As a 
result, the Remuneration Committee agreed to increase the Chief Executive Officer’s base salary from 
current CHF 620,000 per annum to CHF 682,000 with effect from 1 June 2015.  
b) Short-term Inventive Plan 
The Chief Executive Officer is eligible to receive a cash bonus of up to 200% of base salary in respect of the 
2016 financial year.  The actual cash bonus received depends on the achievement of certain performance 
criteria including profit after tax (67%), on-time performance (11%), cost per available seat kilometer (11%) 
and personal evaluation (11%).  The Remuneration Committee believe that the specified performance criteria 
are sufficiently challenging compared to the Company’s business plan.  
c) Long-term Incentive Plan 
An award of performance shares of up to 250% of base salary may be made to the Chief Executive Officer.  
The vesting profile of any such award is set out in the section headed “Long-term Incentive Plan” on page 
55.  The Long-term Incentive Plan will use the absolute fully diluted earnings per share (EPS) as the basis of 
measurement. The performance measure will be the average annual EPS growth over the vesting period, as 
determined by the Remuneration Committee. The relevant EPS growth levels will be: 
Threshold:  14%;   Target:   17%;      Maximum:  20%.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 
Wizz Air is a successful company. We also consider ourselves to be a regional champion in the aviation 
industry in our home markets. However, we recognise that financial performance is not all that it takes to be 
successful. Wizz Air must also be a responsible company, where business is done ethically and with integrity.  
We already have in place our Code of Ethics – The Wizz Way – which sets out how our business is run. But 
being a responsible company goes further than just business and so we are developing a sustainability 
strategy that will set out a framework for our sustainability endeavours and objectives to reach in the next 
three years.  
The sustainability strategy will be built upon three pillars: our people and how we interact with our 
colleagues, passengers and communities in which we operate; the planet and how we manage our 
environmental impact; and our focus, already mentioned, of making sure that conduct our business ethically. 
We want our sustainability strategy not only to be achievable but also to contribute genuine value. Although 
the strategy itself is being finalised, we are already implementing a number of initiatives which we believe 
embody some of what we want to achieve, for example: 
E sponsorship of running events including the Skopje marathon and Budapest half-marathon, where we 
not only engage with our communities but encourage participation of our colleagues by providing 
travel, accommodation and entry to the events; 
E encourage team building amongst colleagues and ensure a genuine and unique WIZZ culture through 
the organisation of an annual ski event attended by over 250 colleagues; 
E personal development of our employees, through the introduction of talent assessment and 
development programmes; and 
E the implementation of a large number of fuel-saving initiatives, driving down our emissions and carbon 
footprint. The fuel consumption of the fleet, measured in tonnes per block hour, was 1.2 per cent. lower in 
the 2015 financial year than a year before. 
These initiatives are very much the start of what we aim to achieve. We want Wizz Air to be recognised not 
only as a great airline to fly with, but also as a company that adds real value to its employees’ careers, the 
communities in which we operate and with a real concern for its environment.

Political donation and expenditure 
Wizz Air works constructively with all levels of government across its network, regardless of political 
affiliation. Wizz Air believes in the right of individuals to engage in the democratic process, however Wizz Air 
itself does not make any political donations and does not incur any political expenditure.  
Capital structure 
As at 31 March 2015, the Company had 52,280,115 Ordinary Shares of £0.0001 each in issue, each with one 
vote, and 48,830,503 convertible shares, which do not entitle the holder to voting rights save in very limited 
circumstances. There were no shares held in treasury at that date. The rights and obligations attaching to the 
Company’s shares are set out in the articles of association. Holders of Ordinary Shares have the following 
rights: 
a) subject to any rights or restrictions as to voting attached to any Ordinary Shares, on a show of hands,

Ordinary Shares. Ordinary Shares in uncertificated form may be transferred by means of the relevant 
system; 
c) the right to receive dividends on a pari passu basis; and 
d) on a winding-up, the liquidator may divide amongst the members in specie the whole or any part of the

GOVERNANCE 
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES 
 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations. 
The Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial 
year. Under that law the Directors have prepared the Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. Under company law 
the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing 
these financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
E select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
E make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
E state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union have been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and 
E prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that 
the Company will continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and 
explain the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the 
Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and the Directors’ Remuneration Report complies with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation in 
Jersey and the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.  
The Directors consider that the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for Shareholders to assess the Company’s position 
and performance, business model and strategy. 
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on page 36 confirm that, to the best of their 
knowledge: 
E the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group; and 
E the Strategic Report contained in the annual report includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Group, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that it faces.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF 
WIZZ AIR HOLDINGS PLC 
Report on the group financial statements 
Our opinion 
In our opinion, Wizz Air Holdings plc’s group financial statements (the “financial statements”): 
E give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as at 31 March 2015 and of its profit and cash 
flows for the year then ended; 
E have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) 
as adopted by the European Union; and 
E have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. 
What we have audited 
Wizz Air Holdings plc’s financial statements comprise: 
E the Consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 March 2015; 
E the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended; 
E the Consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended; 
E the Consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then ended; and 
E the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and 
other explanatory information. 
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the Annual report and accounts (the “Annual 
Report”), rather than in the notes to the financial statements. These are cross-referenced from the financial 
statements and are identified as audited. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is 
applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. 
Our audit approach 
Overview 
  
 
 Materiality 
E Overall group materiality: €9.6m which represents 5% of profit before tax. 
 Audit scope

centralised in Hungary. 
E Our audit scope comprised an audit of the Company and the complete 
financial information of Wizz Air Hungary, being the only significant 
component. 
 Areas of focus 
E Aircraft maintenance provisioning. 
E Hedge and derivative accounting. 
E Net presentation of government taxes and other similar levies. 
E Accounting for the Group’s initial public offering (IPO). 
E Accounting for the closure of Wizz Air Ukraine.

Our audit approach continued 
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK 
& Ireland)”). 
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the 
financial statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for 
example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering 
future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management 
override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that 
represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.  
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our 
resources and effort, are identified as “areas of focus” in the table below. We have also set out how we 
tailored our audit to address these specific areas in order to provide an opinion on the financial statements 
as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be read in this context. This 
is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.  
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus 
Aircraft maintenance provisioning 
The Group operates aircraft which are held under 
operating lease arrangements and incurs liabilities 
for maintenance during the term of the lease. These 
arise from legal and contractual obligations relating 
to the condition of the aircraft when it is returned 
to the lessor. 
Maintenance provisions of €50.6 million for aircraft 
maintenance costs in respect of operating leased 
aircraft are recorded in the financial statements at 
31 March 2015 (refer to note 30 to the financial 
statements). 
For aircraft held under operating lease agreements, 
the Group is contractually committed to either 
return the aircraft in a certain condition or to 
compensate the lessor based on the actual 
condition of the aircraft and its major components 
upon return.  
Provision is made for the minimum unavoidable 
costs of specific future obligations created by the 
lease at the time when such obligation becomes 
certain. This is when the respective aircraft 
component no longer meets the lease re-delivery 
conditions. 
At each balance sheet date, the calculation of the 
maintenance provision includes a number of 
variable factors and assumptions including: likely 
utilisation of the aircraft; the expected cost of the 
heavy maintenance check and the time it is 
expected to occur; the condition of the aircraft; and 
the lifespan of life-limited parts. 
We focused on this area because of an inherent 
level of management judgement required in 
calculating the amount of provision needed as a 
result of the complex and subjective elements 
around these variable factors and assumptions. 
We evaluated the integrity of the maintenance 
provision system (MPS) and tested the calculations 
therein. This included assessing the process by which 
the variable factors within the provision were 
estimated, evaluating the reasonableness of the 
assumptions, testing the input data and reperforming 
calculations. 
In particular, we read new or amended aircraft lease 
contracts and validated the MPS input data. 
Specifically, we compared the cost assumptions in 
MPS to recent invoices, inspected future flight 
schedules and approved maintenance plans as well 
as validating current flight hours and flight cycles to 
non-financial data sources. We also performed 
sensitivity analysis around the key assumptions, such 
as future estimated overhaul costs and the 
anticipated number of flight hours and cycles 
between maintenance events. 
We found no significant issues in the MPS input data 
or the calculated maintenance assets and provisions. 
The MPS outputs were agreed to the amounts 
presented in the financial statements.  
The basis for these calculations was found to be 
consistent with prior periods and in line with the 
detailed accounting policy set on pages 84 to 85.

The scope of our audit and our areas of focus continued 
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus 
Hedge and derivative accounting 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments 
(options) to hedge transaction currency 
(comprising fuel, leasing and maintenance US dollar 
payments) and jet fuel price risks. 
At 31 March 2015, derivative financial assets 
amounted to €60.7 million and derivative financial 
liabilities were €81.7 million. Further details are set 
out in notes 3, 21 and 31 to the financial statements. 
We focused on these balances because of their 
materiality to the financial position of the Group, 
the level of manual involvement required to 
monitor open, closed and settled derivatives and 
the complexity of the requirements in order to 
apply hedge accounting (e.g. timely tailored 
documentation, including details of how hedge 
effectiveness is monitored both prospectively and 
retrospectively). 
We evaluated the processes, procedures and 
controls in respect of the Group’s treasury and other 
management functions which directly impact the 
relevant account balances and transactions. We 
tested management’s year end account 
reconciliation process, including cut-off procedures. 
The results of this work allowed us to focus on 
substantiating the year-end positions recorded in the 
financial statements. 
We independently obtained direct confirmations 
from each of the counterparties to test the cut-off at 
the year end. We assessed the appropriateness of 
hedge accounting for the derivative financial 
instruments and tested, using independent data-
feeds, the fair values being ascribed to those 
instruments at the year end. 
We also assessed the appropriateness of the 
disclosures in the financial statements in respect of 
derivative financial instruments. 
We did not identify any significant issues with the 
measurement or presentation of the Group’s 
derivative financial instruments. Adequate hedge 
documentation was found to be in place to support 
the adopted accounting. 
Net presentation of government taxes and other 
similar levies 
The Group assesses all charges levied by airports 
and government authorities to ensure that any 
amounts recovered from passengers in respect of 
these charges are appropriately classified within the 
income statement. The Group’s accounting policy 
stipulates that where charges levied by airports or 
government authorities on a per passenger basis 
represent a tax in fact or substance, such amounts 
are presented on a net basis in the consolidated 
income statement (revenue and airport, handling 
and en-route charges lines).  
Given the variability of these charges and the 
number of airports and jurisdictions within which 
the Group operates, the assessment of whether 
these items constitute taxes in nature is an 
inherently more complex area, requiring a level of 
judgement. 
We read significant new or amended airport 
contracts to validate that only tax or tax-like items 
had been netted within the income statement.  
In addition, we analysed the costs per passenger, 
investigating significant variances from prior years to 
check that the accounting was in line with the 
Group’s accounting policy. 
Our work did not identify any inappropriately netted 
amounts within revenue or airport, handling and en-
route charges financial statement line items. We 
found that the treatment adopted is therefore 
consistent with the criteria set out in the Group’s 
accounting policy.

Accounting for the Group’s initial public offering 
(IPO) 
The admission of the Group’s ordinary share capital 
to the premium listing segment of the Official List 
of the UK Financial Conduct Authority and to 
trading on the London Stock Exchange’s main 
market for listed securities in March 2015 triggered 
a series of one-off material transactions in respect 
of: 
E the conversion of a portion of the Group’s 
existing debt into equity; 
E recording the IPO proceeds and associated 
transaction expenses; 
E share options, conditional upon the IPO, being 
exercised; and 
E where applicable, taxes associated with each of 
these items. 
These accounting matters are either complex or 
highly material in nature, representing areas of 
focus for our audit. 
Further details can be found in notes 25, 28 and 29 
to the financial statements. 
In respect of the convertible debt, our work focussed 
on reading the Board minutes and debt agreements 
in place, as well as evaluating management’s 
assessment of whether the extension and other 
changes in the convertible notes represented a 
modification or extinguishment of the pre-existing 
convertible debt. We concur with management’s 
view that this is a modification in nature. 
We agreed a sample of the largest transaction costs 
to invoices and considered the classification of the 
items between the income statement and share 
premium accounts. We found that, in line with IFRSs, 
only those costs associated with the new shares had 
been allocated to equity. 
Upon the completion of the IPO, a large number of 
pre-existing share options vested, a portion of which 
have now been exercised. We examined a sample of 
employee correspondence and agreed the 
settlement of consideration to the Group’s bank 
statements, noting no significant issues. 
Where material, we assessed the tax implications of 
the transactions, liaising with our colleagues in 
Switzerland (where the Group is tax resident) and 
Hungary. We found that significant taxes had been 
reasonably calculated and classified within the 
financial statements. 
Our work did not identify any significant issues in 
respect of the IPO related accounting matters. The 
measurement and presentation of the related items 
was found to be in accordance with the relevant 
IFRSs.  
Accounting for the closure of Wizz Air Ukraine 
On 26 March 2015, the Group announced further 
restructuring of the Group's operations in Ukraine 
which will see the Group's Ukrainian subsidiary, 
Wizz Air Ukraine Airlines LLC ("Wizz Air Ukraine"), 
cease to operate. 
This announcement resulted in a number of 
accounting considerations, both in terms of closure 
costs and the recycling of foreign exchange gains 
held in equity within the cumulated translation 
adjustment reserve into the income statement. Due 
to their nature and magnitude these items have 
been classified as exceptional items on the face of 
the income statement. 
As exceptional items and other categories are 
excluded from underlying profit the nature and 
consistency of classification of these items is 
important in understanding the result for the year 
and is a matter of judgement. 
Management prepared a schedule of all significant 
contracts and commitments in respect of Wizz Air 
Ukraine, assessing each to determine the extent of 
any unavoidable costs requiring provision. We 
challenged the completeness of this schedule by 
reference to the cost base of the business, our 
understanding of its operations and other 
information obtained during the course of our audit, 
such as Board minutes. We did not identify any 
significant unprovided exposure, and found that the 
costs met the criteria for classification as exceptional. 
We examined management’s calculation of the 
current year translation adjustment as well as the 
classification of the transferred amount as 
exceptional within the income statement, noting no 
significant issues.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT CONTINUED 
Report on the group financial statements continued 
Our audit approach continued 
How we tailored the audit scope 
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion 
on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the group, the 
accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the group operates. 
During the period, the Group operated through the Company and its two trading subsidiaries: Wizz Air 
Hungary and Wizz Air Ukraine. The Group financial statements are a consolidation of these entities and a 
number of insignificant intermediate holding companies. The accounting for these entities and the Group 
consolidation is centralised in Hungary where we instructed PwC Hungary to perform work on our behalf. 
Our audit scope comprised an audit of the Company and the complete financial information of Wizz Air 
Hungary, being the only significant component.  
Other than revenue and maintenance provisions, which are accounted for and audited centrally in Hungary, 
we performed risk assessment analytics in respect of Wizz Air Ukraine, reflecting the relatively small size of 
this reporting unit. 
The Group audit team visited the Hungarian component team three times during the audit cycle. These visits 
involved discussing the audit approach, areas of focus and issues arising from our work, as well as meeting 
local management. In addition, the Group team attended the local clearance meeting and all Audit 
Committee meetings, either in person or via call. This, together with additional procedures performed at the 
Group level such as consolidation testing and considering financial statement disclosures, gave us the 
evidence we required for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole. 
Materiality 
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative 
thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope 
of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of 
misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole.  
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as 
follows: 
Overall group materiality €9.6m (2014: €4.4m). 
How we determined it 5% of profit before tax. 
Rationale for benchmark applied Consistent with the prior year, we applied this benchmark, a generally 
accepted auditing practice, in the absence of indicators that an 
alternative benchmark would be appropriate. 
 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our 
audit above €0.4m (2014: €0.2m) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted 
reporting for qualitative reasons. 
Going concern 
The Directors have voluntarily complied with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) of the UK Financial Conduct Authority 
and provided a statement in relation to going concern, set out in the Directors’ report, required for UK 
registered companies with a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange. 
The Directors have requested that we review the statement on going concern as if the Group were a 
premium listed UK registered company. We have nothing to report having performed our review. 
As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the 
financial statements using the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis presumes that the 
group has adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the directors intend it to do so, for at least 
one year from the date the financial statements were signed. As part of our audit we have concluded that 
the directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate. 
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee 
as to the group’s ability to continue as a going concern.

Consistency of other information 
ISAs (UK & Ireland) reporting 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
E information in the Annual Report is: 
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial 
statements; or 
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our 
knowledge of the group acquired in the course of performing our audit; or 
• otherwise misleading. 
We have no 
exceptions to 
report arising from 
this responsibility. 
E the statement given by the directors on page 62, in accordance with provision 
C.1.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”), that they consider the 
Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for members to assess the group’s 
performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our 
knowledge of the group acquired in the course of performing our audit. 
We have no 
exceptions to 
report arising from 
this responsibility. 
E the section of the Annual Report on pages 44 to 45, as required by provision 
C.3.8 of the Code, describing the work of the Audit Committee does not 
appropriately addresses matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee. 
We have no 
exceptions to 
report arising from 
this responsibility. 
 
Adequacy of information and explanations received 
Under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, we have not 
received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. We have no exceptions to report 
arising from this responsibility.  
Corporate Governance Statement 
Under the Listing Rules, we are required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating 
to the company’s compliance with ten provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing 
to report having performed our review.  
Other voluntary reporting 
Opinions on additional disclosures 
Directors’ remuneration report  
The Company voluntarily prepares a Directors’ remuneration report in accordance with the provisions of the 
United Kingdom Companies Act 2006. The Directors have requested that we audit the part of the Directors’ 
remuneration report specified by the United Kingdom Companies Act 2006.  
In our opinion the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in 
accordance with the United Kingdom Companies Act 2006. 
Corporate Governance Statement 
The company prepares a Corporate Governance Statement that includes the information with respect to 
internal control and risk management systems and about share capital structures required by the Disclosure 
Rules and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority. The directors have requested that we 
report on the consistency of that information with the financial statements.  
In our opinion, the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement set out on page 44 with 
respect to internal control and risk management systems and in the Directors’ Report on page on page 59 
about share capital structures is consistent with the financial statements. 
Opinion on other matters 
In our opinion, the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year 
for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT CONTINUED 
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit 
Our responsibilities and those of the directors 
As explained more fully in the Statement of the directors’ responsibilities set out on page 62, the directors 
are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in 
accordance with Article 113A of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and for no other purpose. We do not, in 
giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom 
this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in 
writing. 
What an audit of financial statements involves 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient 
to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of:  
E whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed;  
E the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and  
E the overall presentation of the financial statements.  
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available 
evidence, forming our own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements. 
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider 
necessary to provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through 
testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both.  
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of 
performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we 
consider the implications for our report.

ACCOUNTS AND OTHER INFORMATION 
NOTES FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
1. General information 
Wizz Air Holdings plc (“the Company”) is a limited liability company incorporated in Jersey under the 
address 44 The Esplanade, St Helier, Jersey JE4 9WG. The Company is managed from Switzerland. The 
Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as “the Group” or “Wizz Air”) provide low-cost, low-fare 
passenger air transportation services on scheduled short-haul and medium-haul point-to-point routes across 
Europe and the Middle East. 
2. Accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies applied in the presentation of these consolidated financial statements are 
set out below.  
Basis of preparation 
These consolidated financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries. The 
consolidated financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (“Adopted IFRSs” and IFRS IC 
interpretations). 
Based on the exemption provided in Article 105 (11) of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 the Company does 
not present its individual financial statements and related notes. 
The financial statements are presented in Euros which is the functional currency of all companies in the 
Group with the exception of Dnieper Aviation LLC and Wizz Air Ukraine Airlines LLC for which the functional 
currency is the Ukrainian Hryvnia (national currency of Ukraine).  
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified 
by the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets, and financial assets and financial liabilities (including 
derivative instruments) at fair value through profit or loss.  
New standards and interpretations 
a) Standards, amendments and interpretations effective and adopted by the Group 
The following new IFRSs are mandatory for financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 and have 
therefore been adopted by the Group as of 1 April 2014.  
E IFRS 10, ‘Consolidated financial statements’. The objective of IFRS 10 is to establish principles for the 
presentation and preparation of consolidated financial statements when an entity controls one or more 
other entities to present consolidated financial statements. It defines the principle of control and 
establishes controls as the basis for consolidation. It sets out how to apply the principle of control to 
identify whether an investor controls an investee and therefore must consolidate the investee. It also 
sets out the accounting requirements for the preparation of consolidated financial statements.  
E IFRS 11, ‘Joint arrangements’, focuses on the rights and obligations of the parties to the arrangement 
rather than its legal form. There are two types of joint arrangements: joint operations and joint ventures. 
Joint operations arise where the investors have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities of an 
arrangement. A joint operator accounts for its share of the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Joint 
ventures arise where the investors have rights to the net assets of the arrangement; joint ventures are 
accounted for under the equity method. Proportional consolidation of joint arrangements is no longer 
permitted.  
E IFRS 12, ‘Disclosures of interests in other entities’, includes the disclosure requirements for all forms of 
interests in other entities, including joint arrangements, associates, structured entities and other off 
statement of financial position vehicles.  
E Amendment to IAS 32, ‘Financial instruments: presentation’. These amendments are to the 
application guidance in IAS 32, ‘Financial instruments: presentation’, and clarify some of the 
requirements for offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities in the statement of financial position. 
E Amendment to IAS 36, ‘Impairment of assets’. This amendment addresses the disclosure of 
information about the recoverable amount of impaired assets if that amount is based on fair value less 
costs of disposal. 
E Amendment to IAS 39, ‘Financial instruments: recognition and measurement’. This amendment 
provides relief from discontinuing hedge accounting when novation of a hedging instrument to a central 
counter party meets specified criteria.

2. Accounting policies continued 
New standards and interpretations continued 
a) Standards, amendments and interpretations effective and adopted by the Group continued 
E IFRIC 21, ‘Levies’. This is an interpretation of IAS 37, ‘Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent 
assets’. IAS 37 sets out criteria for the recognition of a liability, one of which is the requirement for the 
entity to have a present obligation as a result of a past event (known as an obligating event). The 
interpretation clarifies that the obligating event that gives rise to a liability to pay a levy is the activity 
described in the relevant legislation that triggers the payment of the levy. 
The Group anticipates that the adoption of the above standards will not have a material effect on its 
results or financial position. 
b) Standards early adopted by the Group 
There are no early adopted standards by the Group.  
c) Interpretations and standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group 
E IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’, addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial 
assets and financial liabilities. The complete version of IFRS 9 was issued in July 2014. It replaces the 
guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the classification and measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 
retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement 
categories for financial assets: amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or 
expense and fair value through profit or loss. For financial liabilities there were no changes to 
classification and measurement except for the recognition of changes in own credit risk in other 
comprehensive income, for liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss. IFRS 9 relaxes the 
requirements for hedge effectiveness by replacing the bright line hedge effectiveness tests. It requires 
an economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument and for the “hedged ratio” 
to be the same as the one management actually uses for risk management purposes. Contemporaneous 
documentation is still required but is different to that currently prepared under IAS 39. The standard has 
not been adopted by the European Union, but is expected to be effective for accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2018 with early adoption permitted. 
E IFRS 14, ‘Regulatory deferral accounts’ (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 
2016). The objective of this standard is to specify the financial reporting requirements for regulatory 
deferral account balances that arise when an entity provides goods or services to customers at a price 
or rate that is subject to rate regulation. 
E IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ deals with revenue recognition and establishes 
principles for reporting useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, 
timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity’s contracts with customers. 
Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has the ability to 
direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good or service. The standard replaces IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ 
and IAS 11 ‘Construction contracts’ and related interpretations. The standard is effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 and earlier application is permitted subject to EU 
endorsement. The Group is assessing the impact of IFRS 15.  
The Group anticipates that the adoption of the above standards will not have a material effect on its results 
or financial position, except potentially in the presentation of the time value of hedge instruments if the time 
value at any reporting date will be material.  
Basis of consolidation 
Subsidiaries are all entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Group has the power, 
directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from 
its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are 
taken into account. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial 
statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. 
The results of all the subsidiaries are consolidated up to 31 March which is the financial year end of the 
Company. 
Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group 
transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

2. Accounting policies continued 
Going concern  
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes that the Group will 
continue in business for the foreseeable future. This assumption is based on the Directors’ assessment of the 
Group’s financial performance and position to date, together with a review of its forecasts, in light of the risks 
to which the Group is exposed.  
Foreign currency 
The Group’s presentational currency is the Euro. The functional currency of all the Group entities with the 
exception of Dnieper Aviation LLC and Wizz Air Ukraine Airlines LLC is the Euro. Transactions in foreign 
currencies are translated into functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the statement of financial position date 
are translated into Euros at the exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on 
translation are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as financial income or expense. Non-
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and which are recognised at their historical 
cost are translated into Euros at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and which are stated at fair value are translated into Euros at 
exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined. 
The functional currency of Dnieper Aviation LLC and Wizz Air Ukraine Airlines LLC is the Ukrainian Hryvnia 
(UAH). The results and financial position of all the Group entities that have a functional currency different 
from the presentational currency are translated into the presentational currency as follows: 
E assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate 
at the date of that statement of financial position; 
E income and expenses for each statement of comprehensive income are translated at monthly average 
exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the 
rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate 
on the dates of the transactions); and 
E all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity (cumulative 
translation adjustments).  
The below exchange rates were used for the translation in the respective financial years:

2. Accounting policies continued 
Financial assets and liabilities continued 
The classification of financial assets depends on the purpose for which the assets were acquired. 
Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition. 
a) Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss  
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is 
classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short-term. Assets in this 
category are classified as current assets. Derivatives (assets or liabilities) are also categorised as held for 
trading unless they are designated as hedges.  
b) Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are 
not quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than twelve 
months after the statement of financial position date, that are classified as non-current assets. The Group’s 
loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash in 
the statement of financial position. 
c) Available-for-sale financial assets 
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not 
classified in any of the other categories. They are included in non-current assets unless management intends 
to dispose of the investment within twelve months of the statement of financial position date. Available-for-
sale financial assets are subsequently carried at fair value. 
d) Other financial liabilities measured at amortised costs  
Other financial liabilities are non-derivative financial liabilities with fixed or determinable payments that are 
not quoted in an active market.  
They are included in current liabilities, except for maturities greater than twelve months after the statement 
of financial position date that are classified as non-current liabilities. The Group’s other financial liabilities 
comprise trade and other payables and interest-bearing loans and borrowings in the statement of financial 
position. 
The Group invests excess cash in a conservative way, primarily in short-term time deposits and money 
market funds. Management does not, in the short term, plan to have held-to-maturity investments. The 
recognition and measurement criteria are described in the relevant accounting policy section. 
Derivative financial instruments and hedging 
Derivative financial instruments 
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value. The gain or loss on remeasurement to 
fair value is recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income, within financial income or 
expenses. However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss 
depends on the nature of the item being hedged (see below). The Group enters into foreign exchange and 
jet fuel price hedging transactions to minimise the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and fuel 
price on the Group. Both types of hedging transactions are cash flow hedges under IAS 39. 
Cash flow hedges 
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a 
recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any unrealised 
gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in the hedging reserve within other 
comprehensive income. Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the statement of 
comprehensive income as financial income or expenses. 
The associated cumulative gain or loss on the effective part is removed from other comprehensive income 
and recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in the respective operating expense line(s) in the 
same period or periods as the hedged forecast transaction. 
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of 
the hedge relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or 
loss at that point remains in other comprehensive income and is recognised in accordance with the above 
policy when the hedged transaction is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. If the hedged 
transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in other 
comprehensive income is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income immediately, net of tax, 
within the cash flow hedging reserve.

2. Accounting policies continued

Derivative financial instruments and hedging continued 
Cash flow hedges continued 
Accordingly:  
E the open position on the derivative hedging instrument is recorded as an asset or liability in the 
statement of financial position at fair value and the effective portion of changes in the fair value is 
recorded in other comprehensive income; and 
E the realised gains or losses on the hedging instrument are recorded against the respective operating 
expense line(s) in the statement of comprehensive income. 
The ineffective portion is determined in line with IAS 39, applying the 80–125 per cent. rule. The ineffective 
part of changes in fair value, if any, is recorded as financial income or expense in the statement of 
comprehensive income. 
Hedging with non-derivatives 
The Group uses its selected financial assets denominated in foreign currency to hedge highly probable future 
expenses in foreign currency. The Group does not apply hedge accounting for non-derivatives.  
Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables are stated at their amortised cost using the effective interest rate method less 
impairment losses. 
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the trade and other receivables account, and the 
amount of the loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income within other expenses. 
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against other expenses in the 
statement of comprehensive income. 
Other receivables also comprise insurance claims related to events that are covered by insurance contracts. 
The Group recognises the income in the financial statements only from those insurance claims which, based 
on management’s judgment, are virtually certain to be received by the Group. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits repayable on demand or which mature 
within three months of inception, less any overdrafts repayable on demand. Cash held in money market 
funds is also included in cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents do not include restricted cash. 
Cash and cash equivalents are netted only when right of offset has been obtained. 
Restricted cash 
Restricted cash represents cash deposits held by the banks that cover letters of credit, issued by the same 
bank, to certain suppliers. Restricted cash is split between non-current and current assets depending on the 
maturity period of the underlying letters of credit. 
Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Trade and 
other payables comprise balances payable to suppliers, authorities and employees. 
Interest-bearing borrowings 
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any 
difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the statement of comprehensive income 
as a financial expense over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest rate basis. Financial 
expenses include also withholding tax paid on the interest if according to the loan agreement the payment 
of withholding tax is the liability of the Group. 
Convertible debt 
Convertible debt instruments that can be converted to share capital at the option of the holder, where the 
number of shares issued does not vary with changes in their fair value, are accounted for as compound 
instruments. Transaction costs that relate to the issue of a compound instrument are allocated to the liability 
and equity components in proportion to the allocation of proceeds. The liability component is recognised 
initially at the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an equity conversion option. The equity 
component of the compound instrument is calculated as the excess of the issue proceeds over the value of 
the liability component.

Classification of compound instruments issued by the Group 
Compound instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity (i.e. forming part of Shareholders’ funds) 
only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions: 
a) they include no contractual obligations upon the Company (or Group as the case may be) to deliver 
cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party 
under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Company (or Group); and  
b) where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it is either a non-
derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Company’s own equity 
instruments or it is a derivative that will be settled by the Company exchanging a fixed amount of cash 
or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments. 
To the extent that this definition is not met the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where 
the instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts presented in 
these financial statements for called up share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in 
relation to those shares.  
Where a compound instrument that contains both equity and financial liability components exists these 
components are separated by recognising the liability at fair value and accounted for individually under the 
above policy. The finance cost on the financial liability component is correspondingly higher over the life of 
the instrument. 
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance expenses. Finance 
payments associated with compound instruments that are classified in equity are dividends and are 
recorded directly in equity. 
Impairment of financial assets 
Impairment losses are recognised on financial assets carried at amortised cost where there is objective 
evidence that a loss has been incurred. The amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the 
asset’s carrying amount and the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the original effective 
interest rate. 
If, subsequently, the amount of the impairment loss decreases, and the decrease can be related objectively 
to an event that occurred after the impairment was recognised, the appropriate portion of the loss is 
reversed. Both impairment losses and reversals are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as 
components of financial income or expenses, except in the case of impairment of available-for-sale financial 
assets where the impairment and its reversal may be charged to other comprehensive income under certain 
circumstances. 
Current trade and other receivables are discounted where the effect is material.  
Non-financial assets and liabilities 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. 
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for 
as separate items of property, plant and equipment. 
Depreciation is charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis to write off cost 
to residual value over the estimated useful economic lives of each part of an item of property, plant and 
equipment. In the case of certain aircraft maintenance assets, the useful economic life of the asset can be 
defined in terms of flight hours or flight cycles, and in this case the depreciation charge is determined based 
on the actual number of flight hours or flight cycles. The estimated useful lives are as follows: 
Land and buildings 
three to five years, being the shorter of useful economic life and 
the lease term 
Aircraft maintenance assets 
two to seven years, being the shorter of useful economic life and 
the lease term 
Aircraft parts seven years 
Fixtures and fittings three years 
 
The residual values and useful lives are re-assessed annually.

Assets received free of charge 
In certain cases the Group receives assets free of charge. These are treated as non-cash items in the 
statement of cash flows. 
Advances paid for aircraft – Pre-delivery payments (PDP) 
Pre-delivery payments (PDP) are paid by the Group to aircraft and engine manufacturers for financing the 
production of the ordered aircraft or spare engine as determined by the contractual terms. Such advance 
payments for aircraft or spare engines are recognised at cost and classified as property, plant and 
equipment in the statement of financial position. The amount is not depreciated.  
The Group may enter into sale and leaseback arrangements with lessors to finance future aircraft or spare 
engine deliveries. These arrangements are structured such that the right and the commitment to purchase 
the aircraft or spare engine are assigned to the lessor only on the date of delivery (a “delivery date 
assignment”); as such, the recognition and classification of the PDP balance does not change when the sale 
and leaseback contracts are signed. On the delivery of the aircraft or spare engine the lessor pays the full 
purchase price of the asset to the manufacturer and the Group receives from the manufacturer a refund of 
the PDPs paid. At this moment the fixed asset is de-recognised from the statement of financial position and 
any gain or loss arising is transferred to the statement of comprehensive income as an operating income or 
expense. 
In some instances PDPs are paid – in the name of the Group – by the lessors directly to the aircraft 
manufacturer. These PDPs are also recognised by the Group in the statement of financial position as 
advances paid for aircraft and as received loans until the delivery of the aircraft. In the statement of cash 
flows these PDPs and loans are treated as non-cash items and are eliminated both from advances paid for 
aircrafts/refund of advances paid for aircraft and commercial loan lines. 
Advances paid for aircraft maintenance assets (FHA) 
Advances paid for aircraft maintenance assets represent advance payments made in relation to heavy 
maintenance scheduled to be performed in the future (for the definition of heavy maintenance see the 
accounting policy section on maintenance). Such advance payments are made by the Group particularly to 
the engine maintenance service provider under fleet hour agreements (FHA). The balance of such assets is 
re-categorised into aircraft maintenance assets at the time when the aircraft maintenance asset is recognised 
in respect of the same component and the same heavy maintenance event. This is when the component no 
longer meets the conditions set out in the lease agreement. Advances paid for aircraft maintenance are not 
depreciated. 
In the statement of cash flows the FHA payments are shown under the purchase of maintenance assets line 
together with other aircraft maintenance asset purchases.  
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and 
impairment losses.  
Web development costs are capitalised to the extent they are expected to generate future economic 
benefits and meet the other criteria described in IAS 38 ‘Intangible assets’. 
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future 
economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is expensed as 
incurred. 
Amortisation is charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the 
estimated useful economic lives of intangible assets. Intangible assets are amortised from the date they are 
available for use. The estimated useful lives are as follows: 
Software licences     three years 
Web and other software development costs  three to five years 
Inventories 
Inventories (mainly spares) are purchased for internal use and are stated at cost unless impaired or at net 
realisable value if any items are to be sold or scrapped. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in 
the ordinary course of the business less the estimated selling expense. Cost is based on the first-in first-out 
principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing 
location and condition.

Emissions Trading Scheme 
As of January 1, 2012 the scope of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme 2008/101/EC (EU ETS) covers airlines. 
The Group is required to formally report its annual emissions to the relevant authorities and surrender 
emission allowances (EUAs) equivalent to the emission made during the year. Surrendered allowances are a 
combination of the free allowances granted by the authorities and allowances purchased by the Group from 
other parties. The Group follows the “cost method” of booking the allowances: the free allowances have nil-
cost value so therefore are not recognised as an asset; allowances purchased in the market are recorded at 
the purchase price in inventory. The Group is given free allowances by the competent authorities, and the 
net economic impact to the Group is therefore represented by the shortfall between the actual carbon 
emitted and the free allowances given to the Group for that period. The shortfall is recorded at forward 
prices as a cost. 
Application of this accounting treatment means that the statement of comprehensive income and the 
statement of financial position reflect the net economic impact and are not grossed up to reflect the full 
obligation.  
Deferred interest 
The Group enters into sale and leaseback agreements to finance future aircraft or spare engine deliveries. In 
some cases it enters also into arrangements to finance the pre-delivery payments (PDP) of such deliveries. 
Interest accrued on loans to finance the PDPs on aircraft or spare engines is initially recognised under 
property plant and equipment (advances paid for aircraft). When the leased aircraft or spare engine is 
delivered, the PDP interest balance is reclassified within the statement of financial position from property, 
plant and equipment into deferred interest. From this point forward the interest is amortised to the 
statement of comprehensive income during the term of the respective lease contract.  
The Group recognises in the deferred interest line also the effect of the discounting adjustment of non-
current receivables.  
Impairment of non-financial assets 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets are reviewed at each statement of financial position date to 
determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable 
amount is estimated. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value 
in use. An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit 
exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income. 
Employee benefits 
Share based payment transactions 
The Group operates an equity-settled share option programme that allows Group employees to acquire 
shares in the Company. The options are granted by the Company. The fair value of options granted is 
recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at 
grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the 
options. The fair value of the options granted is measured using an option valuation model, taking into 
account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised as an 
expense is adjusted at any measurement date so that the cumulative expense to date reflects the actual 
number of share options that are expected to vest.  
The share award programme allows the Directors of the Company to acquire shares in the Company at 
nominal value. The fair value of the awards granted is recognised as an employee expense with a 
corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during 
which there are restrictions in place in respect of the transfer of the award shares by the Directors. 
Provisions 
A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position when the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will 
be required to settle the obligation.  
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax 
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks 
specific to the liability (please see further details of aircraft maintenance provisions in the accounting policy 
section on maintenance).

Revenue 
Revenue comprises the invoiced value of flight seats and ancillary revenues.  
Passenger ticket revenue arises from the sale of flight seats and is recognised net of government taxes in the 
period in which the service is provided, that being when the airplane has departed. Unearned revenue 
represents flight seats sold but not yet flown and is included in deferred income. Refunds made to 
passengers are recorded as reductions in revenue.  
Ancillary revenue arises from the sale of other services made by the Group and from commissions earned in 
relation to services sold on behalf of other parties. Revenues from other services comprise mainly baggage 
charges, booking / payment handling fees, airport check-in fees, fees for various convenience services 
(priority boarding, extended legroom, reserved seat) and loyalty programme membership fees. Commission 
revenue arises in relation to the sale of on-board catering, accommodation, car rental, travel insurance, bus 
transfers, premium calls and co-branded credit cards. Ancillary revenues are recognised as revenue on the 
date that the right to receive consideration occurs which is the date when the underlying service was 
provided. This, depending on the type of service, might be either the date of sale, the date of flight or (in the 
case of membership fees) over the period of membership. 
Leases 
Finance leases 
If the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset are substantially transferred to Wizz Air then it is 
accounted for as a finance lease. The Group analyses five criteria as follows: 
E transfer of ownership of the asset at the end of lease term;  
E option to purchase the asset at sufficiently below fair value; therefore, it is reasonably certain that the 
option will be exercised;  
E major part of assets' economic life is at the lessee;  
E the asset is so special that it can be used only by the lessee; and 
E present value of minimum lease payments is substantially all of the fair value of the asset. 
Management uses the above criteria as guidelines for its analyses; however, the substance of a transaction is 
always considered during the assessment. 
Management assesses each leasing contract individually at initial recognition based on the above discussed 
criteria.  
Finance leases are capitalised at the lease’s commencement at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset 
and the present value of the minimum lease payments. 
Operating leases 
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are 
classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as an integral part of the total lease expense.  
Sale and leaseback transactions 
The Group enters into transactions whereby it assigns to a third party the right to acquire new aircraft or 
spare engines. On delivery of the aircraft or spare engine, the Group will lease the aircraft or spare engine 
back through an operating lease from the same party. Any gain arising on disposal, where the price that the 
aircraft is sold for is above fair value, is recognised in deferred income and amortised on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term of the asset. 
Maintenance 
Aircraft maintenance provisions 
For aircraft held under operating lease agreements, the Group is contractually committed to either return the 
aircraft in a certain condition or to compensate the lessor based on the actual condition of the aircraft and its 
major components upon return. Provision is made for the minimum unavoidable costs of specific future 
obligations created by the lease at the time when such obligation becomes certain. This is when the 
respective aircraft component no longer meets the lease re-delivery conditions. The provision is used 
through the completion of a maintenance event such that the component again meets the re-delivery 
conditions.

Maintenance continued 
Aircraft maintenance assets 
Heavy maintenance relates to the overhaul of engines and associated components, the replacement of life 
limited parts, the replacement of landing gears and the non-routine airframe inspection and rectification 
works. Under normal operating conditions heavy maintenance relates to work expected to be performed no 
more frequently than every two to four years.  
The cost of heavy maintenance is capitalised and recognised as a tangible fixed asset (and classified as 
“aircraft maintenance assets”) at the earlier of (a) the time the lease re-delivery condition is no longer met 
(see above under aircraft maintenance provisions) or (b) when maintenance including enhancement is 
carried out. Other maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.  
Such maintenance assets are depreciated over the period the Group benefits from the asset which is the 
shorter of (a) the estimated period until the next date when the lease re-delivery condition is no longer met 
or (b) the end of the asset’s operational life or (c) the end of the lease.  
For engines and associated components, depreciation is charged on the basis of flight hours or cycles, while 
for other aircraft maintenance assets depreciation is charged evenly over the period the Group expects to 
derive benefit from the asset.  
Components of newly leased aircraft such as life limited parts and engines are not accounted for as separate 
assets, and the inherent benefit of these assets which are utilised in the period from inception of the lease 
until the time the assets no longer meet the lease re-delivery condition is reflected in the payments made to 
the lessor over the life of the lease.  
Aircraft maintenance assets are non-monetary items. Non-Euro amounts are translated on inception to Euro 
and are not retranslated. 
The recognition of aircraft maintenance assets against provisions for other liabilities and charges in the 
Statement of financial position is a transaction not involving cash flows. In the statement of cash flows the 
spending on these assets is presented as “purchase of aircraft maintenance assets” in the period when cash 
actually flows out of the Group. This can happen either before or after the recognition of the asset, 
depending on the exact facts and circumstances associated with the relevant asset or assets. 
Please refer also to the property, plant and equipment section of accounting policies. 
Other receivables from lessors – maintenance reserve 
Payments for aircraft and engine maintenance, as stipulated in the respective operating lease agreements, 
are made to the lessors as a security for the performance of future heavy maintenance works. The payments 
are recorded as receivables from the lessors until the respective maintenance event occurs and the 
reimbursement with the lessor is finalised. Any payment that is not expected to be reimbursed by the lessor 
is recognised within operating expenses (Aircraft rentals) in the statement of comprehensive income. 
Other 
The Group enters into agreements with maintenance service providers that guarantee the maintenance of 
major components at a rate defined in the contract, the prime example being fleet hour agreements (FHA) 
for aircraft engines. Such FHA agreements cover the cost of both scheduled and unscheduled engine 
overhauls. FHA payments are accounted for as follows: 
E Payments for scheduled maintenance work are recognised as advances paid for aircraft maintenance 
assets until the maintenance asset for the respective engine overhaul is created. After this point any 
further FHA payments are either used to settle previously established aircraft maintenance provisions 
(to the extent a provision for the respective FHA contract exists) or, in the absence of a provision, are 
added to the amount previously capitalised within property, plant and equipment as advances paid for 
aircraft maintenance assets. 
E Payments that are made to provide guaranteed coverage for the performance of unscheduled 
maintenance events are considered as insurance payments and are expensed as incurred.  
Please refer to the property, plant and equipment section of accounting policies.

Supplier credits 
The Group receives certain assets for nil consideration in connection with its acquisition of aircraft and of 
major aircraft parts. 
Cash contributions or aircraft spares received are recognised as an asset in the statement of financial 
position. The corresponding credits are recognised as income, spread equally across the shorter of useful 
economic life and the lease term of the respective aircraft.  
Net financing costs 
Net financing costs comprise interest payable, finance charges on finance leases, interest receivable on funds 
invested and foreign exchange gains and losses that are recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income. 
Interest income and interest payable are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income using the 
effective interest method. 
Non-cash elements of financial income and expenses are eliminated from the statement of cash flows as an 
adjusting item whereas cash elements, e.g. realised foreign exchange gains and losses, are included in the 
statement of cash flows. 
Share capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Qualifying transaction costs directly attributable to the issuing of 
new shares are debited to equity, reducing the share premium arising on the issue of shares.  
Taxation 
Taxation on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in 
the statement of comprehensive income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in 
equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted at the 
statement of financial position date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. 
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary 
differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or 
liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination; and 
differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the 
foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or 
settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the statement of financial position date. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that sufficient future taxable profits will be 
available against which the asset can be utilised. 
Exceptional items 
Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the financial statements where it is necessary to do so to 
provide further understanding of the financial performance of the Group. They are non-recurring material 
items of income or expense that are shown separately due to the significance of their nature or amount. 
Underlying profit after tax excludes the effect of unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses. 
Segment reporting 
Operating and reportable segments 
The Company is managed as a single business unit that provides low cost, low fare passenger air 
transportation services using a fleet of single aircraft type. The Company has only one reportable segment 
being its entire route network. Management information is provided to the Executive Management Team 
which is the Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (‘CODM’). Resource allocation decisions are made 
by the CODM for the benefit of the route network as a whole, rather than for individual routes within the 
network. The performance of the network is assessed primarily based on the operating profit or loss for the 
period.

3. Financial risk management  
Financial risk factors 
The Group is exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and 
currency exchange rates. The objective of financial risk management at Wizz Air is to minimise the impact of 
commodity price, interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the Group's earnings, cash flows 
and equity. To manage commodity and foreign exchange risks, Wizz Air uses various derivative financial 
instruments, including foreign currency and commodity zero cost collar contracts. 
Risk management is carried out by the treasury department under policies approved by the Board of 
Directors. The Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies 
covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, fuel price risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial 
instruments, adherence to hedge accounting, and hedge coverage levels. The Board has mandated the Audit 
Committee of the Board to supervise the hedging activity of the Group and the compliance with the policies 
approved by the Board. 
Risk analysis 
Market risks 
Foreign currency risk 
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales, purchases and commitments that are denominated in 
a currency other than the Euro. The main currency that gives rise to foreign currency risk related to 
purchases is primarily the US Dollar (USD), while the currencies giving rise to foreign currency risk related to 
sales revenues are primarily the British Pound (GBP) and the Polish Zloty (PLN). 
The foreign currency exposure is significant as only a small portion of the Group’s revenues are denominated 
or linked to the USD while a significant portion of the Group’s expenses are USD denominated, including fuel, 
aircraft leases, maintenance reserves and aviation insurance. 
The Group chooses the Euro/USD foreign currency rate as the underlying foreign currency pair in its foreign 
currency rate hedging strategies. The main objective is to cover the Group’s ongoing USD cash flow 
requirements. The Group’s maximum hedge coverage level is 75 per cent. of the total anticipated USD 
purchases hedged by the time the respective quarter on monthly rolling forward basis is reached. This 
maximum target hedge coverage level was 70 per cent. until 31 March 2014 and increased to 75 per cent. 
during the year ended 31 March 2015. . These levels were not always maintained during the current or prior 
years.

Interest rate risk 
The Group has future commitments under certain operating lease contracts that are based on floating 
interest rates. The floating nature of the interest charges on the operating leases exposes the Group to 
interest rate risk. Interest rates charged on convertible debt liabilities and on short and long-term loans to 
finance the deposits of aircraft are not sensitive to interest rate movements as they are fixed until maturity. 
See Notes 24 and 25.  
The Group is also exposed to interest rate risk in relation to the valuation of financial instruments as they are 
carried at fair value.  
The Group has not used financial derivatives to hedge its interest rate risk during the year. The Directors may 
in the future consider hedging interest rate risk to reduce the potential Group earnings volatility arising from 
fluctuations in interest rates.  
Commodity risks 
One of the most significant costs for the Group is jet fuel. The price of jet fuel can be volatile and directly 
impacts the Group’s financial performance. The Group’s maximum hedge coverage level under its hedge 
programme is 75 per cent. of the total anticipated fuel purchases hedged by the time the respective quarter 
on a monthly rolling forward basis is reached. This maximum target hedge coverage level was 70 per cent. 
until 31 March 2014 and increased to 75 per cent. during the year ended 31 March 2015. These levels were not 
always maintained during the current or prior years..  
Hedge transactions during the periods 
The Group uses non-derivatives and zero cost collar instruments to hedge its foreign exchange exposures 
and uses zero cost collar and outright cap instruments to hedge its jet fuel exposures. The time horizon of 
the hedging programme with derivatives is a usually a maximum of 18 months; however, this horizon can be 
exceeded at the Board’s discretion. The volume of hedge transactions expired during the periods was as 
follows: 
a) Foreign exchange hedge (USD versus EUR): 
USD 390.0 million (2014: USD 349.5 million).  
b) Fuel hedge: 
306,000 metric tons (2014: 260,000 metric tons). 
Hedge year-end open positions 
At the end of the year and the prior year the Group had the following open hedge positions: 
a) Foreign exchange hedge with derivatives: 
The fair value of the open positions was €37.5 million gain (2014: €2.4 million gain) recognised within other 
comprehensive income, current assets or current liabilities, respectively.  
The notional amount of the open positions was USD 297.0 million (2014: USD 450.0 million).

Hedge year-end open positions continued 
b) Foreign exchange hedge with non-derivatives: 
The notional amount of the open positions was USD 132.0 million (2014: USD 140.6 million).  
Non-derivatives are existing financial assets that hedge highly probable foreign currency cash flows in the 
future, therefore act as a natural hedge. The Group does not apply hedge accounting for non-derivatives. 
c) Fuel hedge: 
The fair value of the open positions was €84.4 million loss (2014: €0.7 million) recognised within other 
comprehensive income and current assets or liabilities, respectively. The balance of fuel related hedge 
derivatives on the statement of financial position in 2015 includes also €25.9 million asset (2014: nil) in 
relation to cash deposits paid for fuel caps (purchase options) that were open at the end of the year. 
The notional amount of the open positions was 888,500 metric tonnes (2014: 192,500 metric tonnes). 
In relation to these open hedge positions the cash flows will occur and the hedge relationships will impact 
the statement of comprehensive income during the years ending 31 March 2016 and 2017. 
Hedge effectiveness 
During the year covered by these financial statements, based on the evaluation of the Group, the hedging 
transactions did not give rise to material ineffectiveness under IAS 39. As explained below in the credit risk 
section, in the opinion of the management none of the hedge counterparties had a material change in their 
credit status that would have influenced the effectiveness of the hedging transactions.

The interest rate sensitivity calculation considers the effects of varying interest rates on the interest income 
on bank deposits and on the expense from floating lease rentals. 
The impact of these macro-economic variables on equity is the same as the impact on profit after tax, except 
for the fuel price and for the USD/EUR FX rate variables where the equity impact would also include the 
change in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments that are open at the year end. The fair value of 
these instruments was provided by the hedge counterparties and management has not calculated the 
theoretical value of these instruments for other scenarios.

Liquidity risks 
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and the availability of funding. The 
Group has an adequate liquidity position. The Group invests excess cash in a conservative way, primarily in 
AAA-rated money market funds and also in short-term time deposits with high quality bank counterparties. 
The table below analyses the Group’s financial assets and liabilities (receivable or payable either on cash 
base or net-settled derivative financial assets and liabilities) into relevant maturity groupings based on the 
remaining period at the statement of financial position date to the contractual maturity date. 
The amounts disclosed in the table below are the contractual undiscounted cash flows except for derivatives 
where fair values are presented. Therefore, for certain asset and liability categories the amounts presented in 
this table can be different from the respective amounts presented in the statement of financial position.

The Group has obligations under financial guarantee contracts as detailed in Note 32.  
The Company provides guarantees in relation to aircraft lease contracts to guarantee the performance of its 
airline subsidiaries. These possible obligations are disclosed in the table above, with the shortest maturity 
under the financial guarantees line. Management does not expect that any payment under these guarantee 
contracts will be required in the future because the respective subsidiaries have so far paid all their liabilities 
under the lease contracts and are expected to do so also in the future.

3. Financial risk management continued 
Liquidity risks continued 
Other financial guarantee contracts relate to hedging, aircraft pre-delivery payments, and convertible loans 
and notes. The respective liabilities are reflected under the appropriate line of the financial liabilities part of 
the table above. Since the liability itself is already reflected in the table, it would not be appropriate to 
include also the financial guarantee provided by another Group entity for the same obligation. 
Credit risk 
The Group’s exposure to credit risk from individual customers is limited as the large majority of the 
payments for flight tickets are collected before the service is provided. See Note 27. 
However, the Group has significant banking, hedging, aircraft manufacturer and card acquiring relationships 
that represent counterparty credit risk. The Group analysed the creditworthiness of the relevant business 
partners in order to assess the likelihood of non-performance of liabilities due to the Group. The credit 
quality of the Group’s financial assets is assessed by reference to external credit ratings (published by 
Standard & Poor’s) of the counterparties as follows:

The “Other” column shows the receivables from the Group’s main credit card acquirer. This partner has a 
credit rating of two on a scale of four (one being the best), provided by Dun & Bradstreet.  
From the unrated category within trade and other receivables the Group has €86.8 million (2014: €63.7 
million) receivables from different aircraft lessors in respect of maintenance reserves and lease security 
deposits paid (see also Note 19). However, given that the Group physically possesses the aircraft owned by 
the lessors and that the Group has significant future lease payment obligations towards the same lessors 
(see Note 33), management does not consider the credit risk on maintenance reserve receivables to be 
material. 
Based on the information above management does not consider the counterparty risk of either party being 
material and therefore no fair value adjustment was applied to the respective cash or receivable balances. 
Fair value estimation 
The Group classifies its financial instruments based on the technique used for determining fair value into the 
following categories: 
Level 1: Fair value is determined based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or 
liabilities. 
Level 2: Fair value is determined based on inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset 
or liability, either directly or indirectly. 
Level 3: Fair value is determined based on inputs that are not based on observable market data (that is, on 
unobservable inputs).

Financial assets available for sale represents a unit linked insurance invested in government bonds by the 
insurer. These government bonds are traded in an active market therefore it falls into Level 1 category. 
The Group measures its derivative financial instruments at fair value, calculated with a technique by the 
banks involved in the hedging transactions that falls into the Level 2 category. 
All the other financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost. 
Capital risk management  
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern in order to provide returns for Shareholders, benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an 
optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.  
The capital structure of the Group consists of financial liabilities, cash and cash equivalents and equity. 
Financial liabilities primarily consist of commercial loans relating to aircraft financing and convertible debt as 
disclosed in Notes 24 and 25 respectively. Equity comprises issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as 
disclosed in the statement of changes in equity. Since the financial year beginning on 1 April 2007, the 
Group’s growth has been financed entirely out of cash from operations and commercial debt with financial 
institutions. The overall capital risk management strategy remains unchanged from prior years.  
Management reviews the Group’s cost of capital on an ongoing basis as well as the risks associated with 
each capital instrument and makes recommendations to the Board for approval.  
4. Critical accounting estimates and judgments made in applying the Group’s accounting 
policies  
a) Maintenance policy 
For aircraft held under operating lease agreements, provision is made for the minimum unavoidable costs of 
specific future obligations created by the lease at the time when such obligation becomes certain. The 
amount of the provision involves making estimates of the cost of the heavy maintenance work that is 
required to discharge the obligation, including any end of lease costs.  
The cost of heavy maintenance is capitalised and recognised as a tangible fixed asset (and classified as 
“aircraft maintenance asset”) at the earlier of (a) the time the lease re-delivery condition is no longer met or 
(b) when maintenance including enhancement is carried out. The calculation of the depreciation charge on 
such assets involves making estimates for the future utilisation of the aircraft and in case of engines also of 
the future operating conditions of the engine. 
b) Fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments 
Fair value of derivatives (namely open position of cash flow hedges) is determined by the contracting 
financial institutions as per their industry practice. 
Management considers that the fair value of short-term financial instruments is equal to their value 
determined in the underlying contracts (contracts with suppliers, customers, banks or creditors). Long-term 
financial instruments are discounted to arrive to their fair value if the effect of discounting is considered to 
be material. Management believes that only long-term deposits (including maintenance reserves) represent 
such financial instruments where discounting is necessary. For discounting the Group uses a USD LIBOR rate 
that best reflects the market risk related to the long-term deposits based on the underlying contracts with 
the deposit holder.

4. Critical accounting estimates and judgments made in applying the Group’s accounting 
policies continued 
c) Compound instruments 
The equity component of the convertible notes is calculated as the excess of the issue proceeds over the 
present value of the future interest and principal payments, discounted at the market rate of interest that – 
according to the assessment of management – would have been available to the Group at the date of issuing 
these instruments. In determining these rates (for the various issues) management considered various 
factors, such as the credit risk of the Group, the risk premium applied by banks, the fact that the rate of 
interest of a non-convertible instrument should be higher than that of an equivalent convertible instrument, 
and the fact that there should be an equity component for all tranches issued. 
For more information please see the accounting policy section on financial assets and liabilities, Note 25 and 
Note 31. 
d) Leasing classification 
Management assesses each leasing contract individually at initial recognition based on the criteria described 
in the accounting policy section on leases. During the assessment management applied the following 
judgments: 
E useful economic life of the asset; 
E incremental borrowing rate of interest applicable for the Group (used when calculating the present value 
of the minimum lease payments); and 
E fair value of aircraft at the end of the lease term. 
e) Sale and leaseback calculation 
For the accounting of sale and leaseback transactions management applied the available information on 
market value of aircraft and of spare engines with the aim of determining if the assets were sold at a price 
below or above fair value. 
See the accounting policy section on leases. 
5. Prior period adjustments 
Correction related to convertible debt instruments  
During the financial year management concluded that accounting for convertible debt instruments in 
previous years was not fully correct, particularly with regard to the calculation of interest using the effective 
rate of interest method and the test whether an amendment of contract terms results in a new instrument. 
The revision of the historic accounting resulted in the liability value and the equity part of the convertible 
debt instruments as well as the interest recognised in the income statement changing, as explained in the 
tables below.

Ancillary revenues 433.5 353.1 
Total revenue from external customers 1,227.3 1,011.8 
Ancillary revenues arise mainly from baggage charges, booking/payment handling fees, airport check-in 
fees, fees for various convenience services (priority boarding, extended legroom, reserved seat), loyalty 
programme membership fees, and from commission on the sale of on-board catering, accommodation, car 
rental, travel insurance, bus transfers, premium calls and co-branded cards, all directly attributable to the 
low-fare business.

EU 1,116.2 909.2 
Other (non-EU) 111.1 102.6 
Total revenue from external customers 1,227.3 1,011.8 
Revenue was allocated to geographic areas based on the location of the first departure airport on each 
ticket booking. 
Major customers 
The Group derives the vast majority of its revenues from its passengers and sells most of its tickets directly 
to the passengers as final customers rather than through corporate intermediaries (tour operators, travel 
agents or similar). Therefore the Group does not have any major corporate customers.

Social security costs increased primarily because of the vesting of the share options held by the Chief 
Executive Officer, and the exercise of most of these options. These costs were not accrued earlier during the 
vesting period of the options because until 2014 it was not assumed that Swiss social security would apply to 
the exercise of most of these options.

10. Exceptional items and underlying profit 
Exceptional items 
In the 2015 financial year the Group had a net exceptional income of €9.2 million from the following items: 
E €2.8 million of operating expenses in relation to the IPO of the Company. These consisted of (i) €1.6 
million within staff costs for a one-off IPO bonus for employees other than senior management; and (ii) 
€1.2 million within other expenses for advisory fees incurred in relation to the IPO. 
E €12.0 million of net financial income, consisting of: (i) An exceptional income of €14.5 million relating to 
the recycling of the balance of the cumulated translation adjustment account from equity to the 
statement of comprehensive income. This balance had been accumulated in relation to Wizz Air Ukraine, 
and the Company announced in March 2015 that the operations of this subsidiary would be discontinued 
which then happened in April 2015. (ii) An exceptional expense of €2.5 million arising on the extension of 
the Company’s convertible debt in August 2015 (see Note 25). 
The financial income and expense items are not cash. The €1.6 million IPO bonus is paid only in the 2016 
financial year. The cash flow impact of the €1.2 million advisory expenses is not significant in either year 
and is therefore not presented as an exceptional item in the statement of cash flows. 
In the 2014 financial year the Group had an exceptional income of €6.3 million from the following: 
E €6.3 million settlement was received from the credit card acquirer of one of the entities of the Group. 
The settlement relates to incorrectly calculated interchange fees paid in prior years. The amount of the 
settlement was agreed between the parties during 2014 and this income decreased the distribution and 
marketing expenses in the statement of comprehensive income in 2014. Out of the €6.3 million agreed, 
€5.3 million was received in cash by the Group during the 2014 financial year and the remaining €1.0 
million during the 2015 financial year. These are presented as exceptional operating cash inflows in the 
statement of cash flows. The Group does not expect a similar adjustment to occur in the future. 
These items were used by management in the determination of the non-GAAP underlying profit measure for 
the Group – see below.

Sum of adjustments  (37.0) (0.2) 
Underlying profit after tax  146.2 87.5 
 
On top of the exceptional items listed above unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses are also excluded 
from the calculation of underlying profit. These are non-cash translation differences that arise primarily on 
the revaluation of the significant net US Dollar monetary asset position of the Group. This had material 
impact particularly in the 2015 financial year due to the significant strengthening of the US Dollar against the 
Euro in the period. 
The tax effects of the adjustments made above are insignificant.

Interest income and expense contain interest on financial instruments and the effect of the initial discounting 
of long-term deposits and the later unwinding of such discounting. Interest expense includes also 
withholding tax paid in Switzerland on the interest accrued on convertible loans. This withholding tax for 
these instruments is the liability of the Group according to the terms of the respective loan agreements.  
For the year ended 31 March 2015 the net realised foreign exchange loss of €11.6 million was primarily driven 
by the devaluation of the Ukrainian Hryvnia and by the strengthening of the US Dollar against the Euro. The 
net unrealised foreign exchange gain of €27.8 million was primarily driven by the strengthening of the US 
Dollar against the Euro, impacting through the net US Dollar monetary asset position of the Group. 
The net unrealised foreign exchange loss of €6.1 million for the year ended 31 March 2014 was primarily 
driven by to the devaluation of the Ukrainian Hryvnia and, to a lesser extent, the US Dollar, against the Euro 
during the financial year.

Basic earnings per share 14.43 10.04 
 
There were also 48,830,503 convertible shares in issue at 31 March 2015 (see Note 29). These shares are non-
participating, i.e. the profit attributable to them is €nil. Therefore these shares are not included in the basic 
earnings per share calculation above. 
Diluted earnings per share 
Diluted earnings per share has been calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of Ordinary 
Shares in issue with the number of Ordinary Shares that could have been issued in the respective year as a 
result of the conversion of various convertible instruments. In this respect the period prior to IPO (in March 
2015) and post IPO have different characteristics, as follows: 
Period prior to IPO: 
- Convertible notes and loans: Not all of the shares which would have been issued on full conversion 
of the convertible debt instruments have been included in the diluted earnings per share calculation 
as there were contractual restrictions limiting the number which could be converted. This 
restrictions were in place to ensure that the Group remains owned and controlled by a majority of 
EU nationals.  
- Employee share options: Conversion of employee share options was not assumed because the 
completion of an IPO by the Company was one of the vesting conditions, that was not met before 
March 2015 – see Note 28 for further details.  
Period post IPO: 
- Convertible shares: The convertible shares that were issued on the IPO as a result of the conversion 
of some of the convertible loans and notes were included in the diluted earnings per share 
calculation. 
- Convertible notes remaining after IPO: These can be converted at the option of the holder into 
Ordinary Shares although these might be subject to restrictions on voting and dividend rights.  
- Employee share options: Vested share options included in the calculation. There is no further criteria 
in place that would limit the exercisability of vested share options. 
The profit for the year has been adjusted for the purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share in respect 
of the interest charge relating to the debt which could have been converted into shares.

Proforma earnings per share 
The proforma earnings per share is a fully diluted non-IFRS measure defined by the Company, calculated as 
follows: 
  2015  2014 
Underlying profit for the year, €million 146.2 87.5 
Interest expense on convertible debt, €million 
(1)
 4.5 6.9

 1,117 - 
Fully diluted number of shares for proforma earnings per share (thousands) 126,475 106,595 
Proforma earnings per share, EUR 1.19 0.89 
 
(1) Interest expense is lower in 2015 because (i) it does not include the €2.5 million exceptional charge 
arising on the extension of debt in August 2014, (2) interest rate was reduced during 2015, (iii) part of 
the debt was converted into shares on IPO in 2015. 
(2) For 2015 the issued share number includes also the 48.8 million convertible shares issued in Mar 2015. 
See Note 29 for share capital. 
(3) Interest outstanding on convertible notes in issue at year-end is not included because it is more likely to 
be paid in cash than converted into shares (in fact the interest outstanding at March 2014 was paid in 
cash in February 2015). 
(4) For employee share options only those are included that the holder had the right to exercise as at year 
end. This means that for 2014 none of the share options in issue were included because none were 
exercisable at the time – although due to the IPO most of these became exercisable and were actually 
exercised in 2015. 
The calculation of the proforma underlying EPS is different from the calculation of the IFRS diluted EPS 
measure in the following: 
E For earnings the underlying profit for the year was used (see Note 10), as opposed to the statutory 
(IFRS) profit for the year. 
E For the fully diluted number of shares, (i) year-end position was taken rather than the weighted average 
for the year, (ii) all convertible debt were taken into account for their dilution impact as at the year end. 
By contrast, the IFRS diluted EPS measure takes a weighted average position for the year and includes 
only those convertible debt instruments that could be converted by the holder without any restriction. 
The proforma EPS measure was introduced by the Company to better reflect the underlying earnings and 
the underlying equity structure, particularly to remove the distortion that was caused by the special 
conversion restrictions existing for convertible debt until the IPO in March 2015.

Unrecognised deferred tax assets 
Until 31 March 2010 Wizz Air Hungary was Hungarian tax resident and up to this date had accumulated 
€30.0 million tax loss in Hungary. This balance remained unchanged at 31 March 2014. This loss can be 
utilised only to offset profits generated under Hungarian tax residency. The Group does not expect to have 
profit generated under Hungarian tax residency in the foreseeable future and therefore no deferred tax asset 
is recognised in this respect. 
As at 31 March 2015 there was an unrecognised deferred tax asset related to Wizz Air Ukraine Airlines LLC of 
€1.4 million (2014: €2.5 million). It comprises accumulated tax losses, cash-taxed revenues and cost 
accruals/provisions that are not yet deductible for tax purposes. Given the decision in March 2015 to cease 
the operations of Wizz Air Ukraine Airlines LLC there is no basis for a deferred tax asset to be recognised for 
this subsidiary.

In March 2015 the Group announced its plan to discontinue the airline operations of Wizz Air Ukraine Airlines 
LLC, which happened in April 2015.  
Dnieper Aviation LLC and Wizz Air Ukraine Airlines LLC have a financial year end different from the Group’s 
financial year due to the requirements of local legislation.

21. Derivative financial instruments continued 
The derivative financial instruments represent cash flow hedges (see also Note 3). The full value of a hedging 
derivative is classified as a current asset or current liability if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is 
less than twelve months. 
The cash flow hedges expiring in 2015 had an ineffective portion of €0.8 million (2014: €nil). 
The net position in 2015 does match the cash flow hedging reserve (€46.1 million credit) in the statement of 
financial position because the net position includes also cash deposits paid in relation to fuel caps (purchase 
options) open at the end of the year.

Total deferred interest 8.9 8.4 
Deferred interest expense represents the deferred initial discount adjustments calculated for non-current 
receivables. 
Deferred PDP interest is the deferred part of pre-delivery payment (PDP) interest expenses incurred on 
leased aircraft or spare engines. Such interest relates to aircraft or spare engine PDP payments financed by 
third parties, and is initially recognised under property, plant and equipment (advances paid for aircraft). 
When the leased aircraft or spare engine is delivered, PDP interest is reclassified to deferred interest 
expense. It is then amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term of the respective asset and the 
amortisation charge is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as aircraft rental expense.

other restrictions in place governing the use of that cash, resulting from agreements with aircraft lessors or 
other business partners. Restricted cash is excluded from cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow 
statement. 
These deposits mainly comprise US Dollar deposits. All of them are interest bearing and the interest rates 
represent publicly available commercial interest rates (in a range of 0.2 per cent. to 0.5 per cent. per annum).

The balance of convertible debt decreased in 2015 because during the year part of the debt was converted 
into shares of the Company. The majority of the balance, related to the principal amount, is now classified as 
current liability because the term of the remaining (non-converted) debt was extended until 2022.  
Contractual terms of the convertible debt instruments held by the Group in the period: 
E convertible loans:  
Issued in August and December 2004, with a ten year term and a coupon rate of interest of 12 per cent. 
with compound interest payable on expiry. The loans were extended in August 2014 by five years, i.e. 
until August 2019, with interest payable in cash with a coupon rate of interest of 8 per cent. As a result of 
recalculating the fair value of loans due to the extension the Company recognised additional interest 
cost of €0.4 million in the 2015 financial year. In March 2015, linked to the listing of the Company’s shares 
on the London Stock Exchange, all convertible loans (including accrued interest) were converted into 
shares of the Company. Therefore there were no convertible loans outstanding at 31 March 2015; and 
E convertible notes:  
Issued in February 2005, March 2006 and June 2006, with a four to five year term and with a coupon 
rate of interest of 5 per cent. to 10 per cent. The notes were extended with an additional five years first in 
2009, with an interest of 10 per cent. They were further extended in August 2014, for the period 
between February 2015 and August 2019, with interest payable in cash with a coupon rate of interest of 
8 per cent. As a result of recalculating the fair value of notes due to the extension the Company 
recognised additional interest cost of €2.1 million in the 2015 financial year. In March 2015, linked to the 
listing of the Company’s shares on the London Stock Exchange, certain convertible notes (including 
accrued interest) were converted into shares of the Company.  
The remaining notes were further extended to 31 March 2022 with interest now payable twice a year in 
February and August. No gain or loss was recognised as a result of this extension. All these remaining 
notes are held by Indigo. 
Principal and any accrued interest on the remaining convertible notes are convertible into Ordinary Shares in 
Wizz Air Holdings Plc at conversion factors in the range of €1.0–1.5 for one share. 
Convertible notes are guaranteed by Wizz Air Hungary Kft; see Note 32.

and free aircraft components) received from aircraft and certain component suppliers for nil consideration, 
that will be recognised as a credit (an aircraft rentals expenses decreasing item) on a straight-line basis over 
the lease term of the respective asset. 
Current deferred income represents the value of tickets paid by passengers for which the flight service is yet 
to be performed and the current part of the value of assets received for nil consideration.

Vesting period 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years 
Termination 10 years 10 years 10 years 10 years 
 
There are no individual performance conditions set for the employees to exercise their options after the 
three-year vesting period other than that the employees must be in employment with one of the Group 
entities until and on the date of exercise of the options. 
The ESOP defined also the occurrence of certain equity events as a condition to exercise. This condition was 
met only with the IPO of the Company in March 2015. However, until 2015 this restriction was considered 
both in the valuation of the options at grant date as a market based condition and in determining the 
“effective vesting period” after which the options become exercisable without any further conditions.  
The fair value of the options granted was determined by using a combination of the Binomial and the Black-
Scholes models. The following key inputs (other than the contract terms) were used in the model for the 
options issued during the financial year: 
 2015/A 2015/B  2014/A 2014/B  
Exercise price of the options 20,000 220,000 €3.10 €7.23

Risk free interest rate 1.76% 1.76% 1.30% 1.76% 
Fair value of each share option  €2.84 €4.40 €0.16 €2.16 
The expected volatility is based on the historic volatility of listed peer companies in the low-cost airline 
industry segment during the years 2004 to 2011.

Share options issued during the financial year continued 
The fair value of the underlying equity shares of the Company as at the grant date of the options was 
determined based on the average of EV/EBITDAR multiples of Ryanair and easyJet. The expected life of the 
options was determined based on management’s estimate about the future exercise behaviour of the 
relevant employee groups. 
The Binomial model was selected to value the options, as a calculation method capable of incorporating the 
probabilities of reaching the threshold for the equity value of the Group, which was the market based 
condition related to the exercise of the options until the IPO happened. The basis of the Binomial calculation 
was the estimation of the probability of reaching this threshold Group equity value within the period until the 
(that time) estimated date of an IPO, by utilising the historic volatilities of comparable companies in the 
industry. Where the outcome of the Binomial calculation was that the expected market value of the Group 
does not reach the threshold by the estimated date of an IPO, the model assumed that the option would not 
vest with the employees.  
The options are classified as equity-settled share based payments because the Company will issue new 
shares for any option exercised in the future, irrespective of the method of exercise.  
The fair value of the options is recognised as an administrative expense over the estimated vesting period 
with a corresponding charge to equity.

At the end of the 2015 financial year the estimates for the number of share options expected to vest were 
updated based on actual employee turnover figures.  
Including the impact of this year-end true-up, the total expense recognised for the year arising from all share 
options was €148,000 expense (2014: €12,000 credit) for the Group.

until an IPO, whichever is later.  
In addition the shares would be forfeited if a Director ceases to be a Director by reason of voluntary 
resignation or by removal pursuant to the articles of association of the Company before the end of the three-
year vesting period, though the Remuneration Committee of the Board has the discretion to grant 
exemption from this rule on an individual basis. The fair value of such awards is equivalent to the fair value of 
the shares as at the measurement date as the expected dividends are €nil.

The share awards are classified as equity-settled share based payments. 
The fair value of the shares granted is recognised as an expense over the three year vesting period with a 
corresponding charge to equity.  
The total expense recognised for the year arising from share awards is €122,000 (2014: €120,000) for the 
Group. 
Under the terms of the programmes all taxes payable on share options and awards are the liability of the

convertible loans and notes (including accrued interest) were converted into non-voting non-participating 
“convertible shares” of the Company. There were 48,830,503 convertible shares in issue at 31 March 2015, all 
fully paid. The convertible shares are held by Indigo and can be converted into Ordinary Shares of the 
Company by Indigo on the condition of meeting certain criteria post conversion regarding the overall 
shareholding structure of the Company.

Capital reserves 
Share premium 
Share premium has two main components. €207.0 million was recognised as a result of the Group 
reorganisation in October 2009. It represents the estimated fair value of the Group at the date of the 
transaction. The remaining €168.1 million was recognised in 2015 as a result of new share issues. These new 
share issues comprised the primary offering on the initial public offering of the Company’s shares on the 
London Stock Exchange in March 2015, the conversion of some of the convertible debt instruments into 
shares and the conversion of certain employee share options into shares. 
Reorganisation reserve 
Reorganisation reserve was recognised as a result of the Group reorganisation in October 2009. It is equal to 
the difference between the fair value of the Group at the date of reorganisation (€209.0 million) and the 
share capital of the Group at the same date (€16.0 million). 
Equity part of convertible debt 
The equity part of convertible debt in equity comprises the equity component of compound instruments 
issued by the Company. The amount of the convertible debts classified as equity of €8.3 million (2014 
(restated – see note 5): €11.1m) is net of attributable transaction costs of €0.5 million. 
Share based payment charge 
The share based payment balance of €1.7 million credit (2014: €1.4 million credit) corresponds to the 
recognised cumulative charge of share options and share awards provided to the employees and Directors. 
This balance is recognised directly in retained earnings. 
Cash flow hedging reserve 
The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative unrealised net change in the fair value 
of cash flow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred. 
Impact of the IPO 
The IPO impacted the share capital related lines of the primary financial statements as follows: 
   2015

30. Provisions for other liabilities and charges continued 
Non-current provisions relate to future aircraft maintenance obligations of the Group on leased aircraft and 
spare engines. Current aircraft maintenance provisions relate to heavy maintenance obligations expected to 
be fulfilled in the coming financial year. The amount of provision reflects management’s estimates of the cost 
of heavy maintenance work that will be required in the future to discharge obligations under the Group’s 
operating lease agreements (see Note 4). Maintenance provisions in relation to engines covered by FHA 
agreements are netted off with the FHA prepayments made to the engine maintenance service provider in 
respect of the same group of engines. 
Other provisions relate to future liabilities under the Group’s customer loyalty programme, all within one 
year.

517.8 514.7 161.1 158.3 
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (such as long-term deposits 
among the non-current other receivables) is determined by estimated discounted cash flows. 
The carrying value less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate 
their fair values due to the short-term nature of trade receivables and payables. Long-term financial assets 
and liabilities which are classified as fair value through profit and loss are recognised on fair value. 
The fair value of deposits due after more than one year is determined by discounting at a rate of interest of 
three months’ USD LIBOR rate prevailing on the last day of the financial year.  
The fair value of long-term other assets is determined by discounting at a rate of interest of four years’ USD 
swap rate prevailing on the last day of the financial year. 
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is based on their actual mark-to-market evaluation of the 
financial institutions. 
During the year €7.2 million loss (2014: €2.1 million loss) was realised on derivative financial assets and 
liabilities in the income statement. 
During the year €26,000 gain (2014: €nil) has been realised on financial assets available for sale.

Interest earning financial assets 
The Group invests excess cash in a conservative way, primarily in AAA-rated money market funds and also in 
short-term time deposits on market rate. 
32. Financial guarantees  
The Company has provided parent guarantees to certain lessors of its aircraft fleet, to guarantee the 
performance of its airline subsidiaries under the respective lease contracts.  
The Company has provided parent guarantees to certain hedging counterparties, to guarantee the 
performance of Wizz Air Hungary Kft, under the respective hedge contracts. 
The convertible notes are secured through a deed of guarantee between Wizz Air Hungary Kft (as 
guarantor) and Indigo Hungary LP (as security agent), pursuant to which Wizz Air Hungary Kft, inter alia, 
guarantees to Indigo Hungary LP the punctual performance by, inter alia, the Company of its obligations the 
current note purchase agreement. 
33. Lease commitments 
The total future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating lease rentals are as follows: 
 2015 2014  
 € million € million 
Payments due:   
Within one year 218.7 141.8 
Between one and five years 817.7 600.6 
More than five years 455.8 426.4 
Total operating lease commitments 1,492.2 1,168.8 
The above table includes also the lease costs of those aircraft that are not yet delivered but for which the 
lease contract was already signed before the statement of financial position date. 
The lease payments are not subject to future escalation, but five of the lease contracts are on floating rate 
and thus the lease payments for these vary with the USD market rates of interest. 
In December 2012 the Group signed an agreement with a third party to open a new crew training centre in 
Budapest in April 2013. The new Wizz Air training centre, operated by the third party, features a modern 
A320 full flight simulator, aircraft cabin mock-up facilities and a fire fighting trainer. The contract includes a 
commitment for the Group to pay a rent to the operator of the centre during the ten-year term of the 
contract. 
Part of the commitment has been classified as finance lease and the remainder as operating lease. The 
amount of commitment that relates to the operating lease is included in the figures above.

34. Capital commitments 
At 31 March 2015 the Group had the following capital commitments: 
E commitment to purchase 56 Airbus aircraft of the A320 family in the period 2015–2018. The 
commitment is valued at USD 5.9 billion (€5.5 billion) at list prices in 2015 USD terms (as at 31 March 
2014: USD 6.9 billion (€5.0 billion), valued at 2014 list prices). As at the date of approval of this 
document seven of the 56 aircraft are covered by sale and leaseback agreement; and 
E commitment to purchase seven IAE aircraft spare engines in the period 2015–2018. The commitment is 
valued at USD 74.6 million (€69.6 million) at list prices in 2015 USD terms (as at March 2014: USD 72.6 
million (€52.8 million), valued at 2014 list prices). As at the date of approval of this document the seven 
engines are not yet financed. 
35. Contingent liabilities 
Legal disputes 
The European Commission started an in-depth investigation into Wizz Air Hungary’s (WAH) contractual 
arrangements with Timisoara airport (TSR) in May 2011. The European Commission’s preliminary decision, 
published in September 2011, considered that these contracts might involve an element of state aid. WAH 
then made a detailed submission to the European Commission, supported by expert economic analysis, 
which showed that its contractual arrangements were legitimate commercial arrangements that were 
justified both from a legal and economic perspective.  
Independently, during 2012 and 2013 Carpatair initiated a number of court cases against TSR in the 
Romanian domestic courts, alleging (amongst other things) state aid in favour of WAH as a result of the 
published airport charges which provide for volume discounts. WAH is intervening as an interested party in 
each of these cases and is submitting its own defence in support of TSR. Crucially, WAH believes that other 
operators at TSR would have been able to take advantage of the same scheme of discounts but that this was 
not taken into account. One of these cases made a finding of state aid, without the benefit of any evidence. 
Given that the courts did not consider any expert economic evidence, the courts as yet have been unable to 
quantify the amount of the alleged but disputed state aid. 
Management estimates that the maximum potential exposure could be in the region of €9.0 million. No 
provision has been made by the Group in relation to these issues because there is currently no reason to 
believe that the Group will incur charges from these cases. 
36. Subsequent events 
There were no matters arising, between the statement of financial position date and the date on which these 
financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors, requiring adjustment or disclosure in 
accordance with IAS 10, ‘Events after the reporting period’, other than the following:  
The Company announced in March 2015 that it will discontinue the operations of its Ukrainian airline 
subsidiary, Wizz Air Ukraine Airlines LLC. Wizz Air Ukraine Airlines LLC stopped flying from 20 April 2015 
and its two aircraft are being de-registered from the Ukrainian operating licence and are being registered to 
the Hungarian operating licence of Wizz Air Hungary. Consequently Wizz Air Ukraine Airlines LLC will lose its 
airline operating licence. 
37. Related parties 
Identity of related parties 
Related parties are:  
E Indigo Hungary LP and Indigo Maple Hill LP (collectively referred to as “Indigo” here), because it 
appointed four directors to the Board of Directors (of these, three were in service at 31 March 2015); 
E DCII (Malta) Limited, because it appointed one Director to the Board of Directors (not in service at 31 
March 2015); and 
E key management personnel (Directors and officers). 
These related parties held 20.5 per cent. of the voting shares of the Company at 31 March 2015 (2014: 69.8 
per cent.).

Transactions with related parties 
There were no transactions with related parties during the fiscal year except as indicated below.  
Transactions with Indigo 
At 31 March 2015 Indigo held 6,740,633 of Ordinary Shares (equal to 12.9 per cent. of the Company’s issued 
share capital) and 48,830,503 of Convertible Shares of the Company (2014: nil). 
Indigo has interest in convertible debt instruments issued by the Company (see Note 25). The Company’s 
liability to Indigo, including principal and accrued interest, was €27.3 million at 31 March 2015 (2014: €37.7 
million). 
During the year ended 31 March 2015 the Company entered into transactions with Indigo as follows: 
E Indigo converted into the Company’s Ordinary Shares all of their convertible loans and convertible 
notes, with the exception of convertible notes with a principal amount of €26.3 million that remained 
outstanding. As a result of these conversions Indigo acquired 10,244,633 of Ordinary Shares and 
48,830,503 of Convertible Shares of the Company. 
E The Company recognised interest expense on convertible debt instruments held by Indigo in the 
amount of €3.9 million (2014: €5.2 million); and 
E Fees of €0.1 million (2014: €0.1 million) were paid to Indigo in respect of the remuneration of Directors 
who were delegated by Indigo to the Board of Directors of the Company. 
E The Company entered into a relationship agreement with Indigo dated 24 February 2015. The key terms 
of this relationship agreement are set out in the governance section on pages 34 to 35. 
Transactions with key management personnel 
Officers (members of executive management) and Directors of the Board are considered to be key 
management personnel. The compensation of key management personnel, including Non-Executive 
Directors, is as follows: 
 2015 2014 
 € million € million 
Salaries and other short-term employee benefits  6.0 5.1 
Social security costs 3.2 0.6 
Share based payments 0.2 0.1 
Amounts paid to third parties in respect of Directors’ service 0.2 0.2 
Total key management compensation expense 9.6 6.0 
Social security costs increased primarily because of the vesting of the share options held by the Officers, and 
the exercise of most of these options. These costs were not accrued earlier during the vesting period of the 
options because until 2014 it was not assumed that Swiss social security would apply to the exercise of most 
of these options. 
During 2015 the Company and one of its subsidiaries provided loans to four out of the six Officers of the 
Group, including to the Chief Executive Officer. The purpose of the loans was to enable these employees to 
exercise their share options by buying the respective shares before the end of 2014, so that they can take 
advantage of preferential tax rules last available in Switzerland in 2014.  
The amount of the loans provided to Officers was €8.5 million, secured by the shares purchased. The loan 
tranches were provided between December 2014 and February 2015 and repaid in March 2015. The interest 
rate on the loans was 1.50% per annum that was considered to be the market rate of interest in Switzerland 
for similar loans. Altogether €22,000 interest was paid by the Officers on repayment.

38. Ultimate controlling party 
In the opinion of the Directors there is no individual controlling party in relation to the Company's issued 
Ordinary Shares. 
As at 21 April 2015 approximately 58% of the Ordinary Shares in the Company were owned by Qualifying 
Nationals. Shareholders and potential investors are reminded that the Group’s Hungarian operating licence 
depends, inter alia, on Qualifying Nationals owning more than 50 per cent. of the Ordinary Shares. The 
Company’s articles of association enable the Directors to take action to ensure that the amount of Ordinary 
Shares held by Non-Qualifying Nationals does not reach a level which could jeopardise the Group’s 
entitlement to continue to hold or enjoy the benefit of any operating license which benefits the Group.  
Qualifying Nationals include: (i) EEA Nationals, (ii) nationals of Switzerland and (iii) in respect of any 
undertaking, an undertaking which satisfies the conditions as to nationality of ownership and control of 
undertakings granted an operating licence contained in Article 4(f) of the Air Services Regulation, as such 
conditions may be amended, varied, supplemented or replaced from time to time, or as provided for in any 
agreement between the EU and any third country (whether or not such undertaking is itself granted an 
operating licence). 
A Non-Qualifying National is any person who is not a Qualifying National in accordance with the definition 
above.

Chairman’s Statement
IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2009 3
Our focus on sales growth, optimising
our cost base and efficiently utilising the
cash we generate, has enabled us to drive
growth and deliver volume and market share
gains in many markets across our regions.
Whilst tobacco is not immune from the
current difficulties affecting the global
economy, we have a successful strategy
and a resilient business.
Earnings and Dividends
Our adjusted profit from operations
increased by 32 per cent to £2.9 billion,
while reported profit from operations
grew by 59 per cent to £2.3 billion. Our
performance reflects a full year’s contribution
from Altadis compared with eight months
in 2008, good organic growth, synergy
benefits and currency translation gains.
A YEAR OF CONSIDERABLE
ACHIEVEMENT
Iain Napier
Chairman
“We have delivered another strong operational
and financial performance, further building on

Chairman’s Statement continued
4 IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2009
Our adjusted earnings per share have
risen by 18 per cent to 161.8 pence. Basic
earnings per share were 65.5 pence (2008:
50.6 pence). The Board recommends a
final dividend of 52.0 pence per share,
bringing the total dividend for the year to
73.0 pence per share
1
(2008: 63.1 pence,
adjusted for the bonus element of the
rights issue in June 2008). This represents
growth of 16 per cent.
Altadis Synergy Delivery
We have made considerable progress with
the integration of Altadis during the year.
We delivered €147 million synergies in our
current financial year, bringing the total to
€190 million to date, €10 million ahead of
our target. We remain very confident of
achieving our previously announced target
of €400 million cumulative synergies by
the end of our 2012 financial year and our
net revenue synergy target of €60 million
by 2011.
Operational Performance
These results again demonstrate the
strength of our versatile brand and product
portfolio and wider geographic reach.
Our powerful portfolio spans all tobacco
product categories and price points and
enables us to quickly align with local
market consumer preferences.
Our particular strength in value cigarettes
and our world leadership in fine cut
tobacco has enabled us to capitalise on
consumer downtrading and is an advantage
in the current economic climate.
We have focused on building sales of our
international premium and mainstream
cigarette brands, Davidoff and
Gauloises Blondes.
We have made great advances in a
number of emerging markets including
Asia, Eastern Europe, Africa and the
Middle East. We also continued to
strengthen our position in mature markets,
with good financial results in the UK,
Germany, Spain and France.
We took steps to improve the competitive
position of our world leading cigar business
through cost optimisation and portfolio
rationalisation initiatives.
Strengthening our balance sheet is a
priority and we made excellent progress
during the year. Strong cash generation
has been a consistent hallmark of Imperial
Tobacco. We have delivered a cash
conversion rate of 128 per cent reflecting
£1 billion in working capital improvements.
As a result we have reduced our adjusted
net debt by over £2 billion, excluding the
impact of foreign exchange movements.
We also raised £3.9 billion in the year
through bond issues such that we now
have no refinancing requirements until 2012.
Corporate Governance
Our stakeholders rightly expect us to act
in a fair and responsible manner and our
commitment to high standards of conduct
and performance is as strong as ever.
Our Corporate Governance and internal
control procedures include appropriate
policies and procedures in place to meet
the high standards expected of us.
Board Changes
In November we announced that Gareth
Davis, Chief Executive Officer, will retire
in May 2010 and will be succeeded by
Alison Cooper, currently Chief Operating
Officer. Gareth and Alison will continue to
work closely together to ensure an orderly
handover during the next six months.
Gareth was appointed Chief Executive
Officer in 1996 and under his leadership
Imperial Tobacco has developed from a
predominantly UK business into one of
the world’s leading international tobacco
companies. He has made an outstanding
contribution to our success and on behalf
of the Board and our employees I would like
to express our gratitude for his tremendous
commitment, drive and dedication.
I am delighted that Alison will succeed
Gareth. She has an exemplary track record
in our business and has played a key role
in driving our international expansion. Alison
has held a number of senior positions
in the business as part of her ongoing
development and was appointed Chief
Operating Officer in March. Her leadership
capabilities and strategic vision will ensure
that Imperial Tobacco continues to evolve
and maximise growth opportunities.
In September, Bruno Bich resigned as
a consequence of his overall business
commitments. I would like to thank him
for his contribution to the Company since
his appointment to the Board last year
and wish him well for the future.
Finally, my thanks to our employees
who have worked hard to drive the
performance of the business in a
challenging operating environment.
Our focus on sales growth, underpinned
by our diligent approach to cost and cash
management, enables us to look to the
future with confidence and leaves us
well positioned to continue to create
sustainable value for our shareholders.

Chief Executive’s Review
6 IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2009
Performance Overview
During another successful year for Imperial
Tobacco we have grown profits in our
mature markets and made great advances
in emerging markets with volume, profit
and market share gains.
We increased our overall cigarette volumes
by 10 per cent to 322 billion, including a full
year contribution from Altadis and many
good brand and market performances.
Our focus on building sales has delivered
5 per cent organic growth in tobacco net
revenues and 7 per cent organic growth in
adjusted profit from operations, at constant
currency and before synergy benefits in the
second half of the year, the first reporting
period to offer a true comparison post the
Altadis acquisition.
Our total tobacco portfolio ensures we
can be flexible and agile in responding to
changing consumer and market dynamics.
Understanding the evolving nature of
consumers and aligning our local market
portfolios to match their preferences is
an increasingly important element of our
sales strategy.
We have delivered excellent growth from
our leading international cigarette brands.
In the premium segment, we grew
Davidoff by 12 per cent with particularly
strong growth in our Rest of the World
region. Within the mainstream segment,
Gauloises Blondes was up by 1 per cent
and JPS, a key brand in our value
portfolio, grew volumes by 11 per cent
with growth in all regions in which it is
sold. This was complemented by excellent
results from a number of our regional and
local brands.
We continue to leverage our strength in
value cigarettes and fine cut tobacco to
respond to ongoing consumer downtrading.
We have also grown our fine cut tobacco
volumes in the UK, Spain, Germany and
Central Europe.
We are world leaders in cigars and in
spite of challenging trading conditions,
we have further improved profitability and
strengthened our competitive position.
Our tobacco logistics business performed
robustly including a particularly good
performance in France. Whilst our other
logistics operations have been affected
by current economic conditions, we have
maintained our profitability through cost
saving initiatives.
LEVERAGING OUR STRENGTHS
Gareth Davis
Chief Executive
“On an organic basis, we delivered growth of 5 per cent in tobacco net revenue and
7 per cent in adjusted profit from operations in the second half of the year, offering
a true comparison post the Altadis acquisition.”
1849 Black Sun ImpTob p6_p7:Layout 1 30/11/09  20:36  Page 6 IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2009 7
From a financial perspective, we have
delivered significant working capital savings
which have improved our strong cash
generation and enabled us to make a
considerable reduction in our debt levels.
Integration
We made excellent progress with the
integration of Altadis during the year.
We completed consultations with trade
unions and works councils and implemented
our major European integration projects,
including merging our sales and marketing
teams, enabling us to deliver a more
comprehensive service to our customers.
A number of manufacturing restructuring
projects in Europe were also progressed.
In addition, we closed two cigar factories in
the USA and continued to align processes,
systems and standards across our
manufacturing operations.
Regrettably, these projects have impacted
our employees and we continue to assist
all individuals affected with a comprehensive
range of support measures.
Regulation
The tobacco industry has been subject to
increasing regulation for many years and
we are confident of being able to continue
to successfully develop our business in
this environment.
We believe that adults should have the
freedom to enjoy smoking whilst being
aware of the associated risks to their health.
We support reasonable regulation of
tobacco products but will continue to
challenge disproportionate and unnecessary
regulation that undermines the principles of
adult choice and the freedom of competition.
This type of regulation stigmatises smokers
and denormalises smoking and we strongly
believe that adult consumers and smoking
should not be treated in this way.
Corporate Responsibility
Our Corporate Responsibility strategy is
integral to our overall business strategy
and is embedded throughout the Group.
It is gratifying that our progress has
been recognised again, with a Bronze Class
rating from Sustainability Asset Management,
which analyses companies on behalf of the
Dow Jones Sustainability Index.
An overview of this year’s progress is
provided on page 20 of this report. More
detail will be available in our Corporate
Responsibility Review, to be published
in early 2010.
Our People
Key to delivering sustainable shareholder
value is the continued development of our
people who once again have delivered
these excellent results.
Looking around the Group today, I am very
encouraged by our significant and growing
pool of talented employees. Our leadership
and development programmes are designed
to support employees at all levels, from
senior managers to those who are at an
early stage of their career.
We are committed to ensuring our
employees continue to fulfil their potential
and share in the success of the Group.
Outlook
In conclusion, we have made significant
operational and financial progress in a
challenging environment.
Our strong business fundamentals and
successful growth strategy are the basis
of our long-term sustainability.
We will continue to drive further organic
growth, leveraging our enhanced
geographic footprint and our total
tobacco portfolio.
Further enhancing our focus on sales,
whilst optimising our cost base and
effectively managing our cash, will ensure
we continue to create sustainable
shareholder value.

Adjusted profit from operations grew by 32

from Altadis, operational progress and
currency gains. Reported profit from
operations was up 59 per cent to £2,337

STRONG FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
1849 Black Sun ImpTob p8_p11:Layout 1 30/11/09  20:38  Page 8 Amortisation of acquired intangibles rose
from £309 million to £451 million reflecting
a full year’s charge for Altadis.
The Group hedges underlying interest rate
and foreign exchange rate exposures in
an efficient, commercial and structured
manner. However, the strict requirements
of IAS 39 lead to some commercially
effective hedge positions not qualifying for
hedge accounting. As a result we recognise
movements in the fair value of some of the
derivative financial instruments providing
commercial hedges in net finance costs,
rather than directly in reserves under IAS
39 hedge accounting.
We therefore exclude fair value gains and
losses on derivative financial instruments
providing commercial hedges from
adjusted net finance costs.
IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2009 9
Significant movements in foreign exchange
and interest rates have led to fair value
losses on derivative financial instruments
included in net finance costs of £660
million (2008: £272 million). Previously an
element of fair value gains and losses was
included in profit from operations rather
than net finance costs. This presentation
has been amended to show all fair value
gains and losses in net finance costs. This
change in presentation is explained in more
detail in our Accounting Policies on page
77 and has no effect on adjusted earnings.
The net financing cost of post-employment
benefits amounted to £32 million compared
with income of £45 million in 2008 and is
excluded from adjusted net finance costs.
Restructuring costs amounted to £145
million compared with £463 million in 2008.
Our 2008 results included a gain of £174
million on the sale of a number of fine cut
and pipe tobacco brands to Philip Morris
International. They also included one-off
acquisition accounting adjustments relating
to the valuation of inventory and the timing
of recognition of profits on transactions
between Imperial Tobacco and Altadis,
which had no impact on the performance
of the business or on cash flow.
Results have been adjusted in line with our normal practice and a reconciliation is provided below.

Financial Review continued
Geographic Analysis of Tobacco
UK net revenue increased by 3 per cent
to £893 million and adjusted profit from
operations rose 3 per cent to £601 million.
These results reflect price increases, a
stable duty paid cigarette market and
growth in fine cut tobacco volumes.
Growth in German net revenue was largely
attributable to a full year’s contribution from
Altadis, price increases and growth in fine cut
tobacco volumes. Net revenue rose by 24
per cent to £826 million and adjusted profit
from operations by 30 per cent to £403
million. Some £48 million of the increase in
adjusted profit from operations related to
strengthening of the euro against sterling.
Net revenue in Spain increased by £199
million to £610 million and adjusted profit
from operations by £125 million to £275
million reflecting a full year’s contribution
from Altadis and increased prices. £36
million of the increase in adjusted profit
from operations related to strengthening
of the euro against sterling.
In the Rest of EU, a good performance in
France and in many of our other markets
across the region was mainly offset by
volume declines in travel retail and a bad
debt write-off of £17 million in the
Netherlands. Net revenue rose by 19 per
cent to £1,490 million and adjusted profit
from operations by 15 per cent to £566
million. Adjusted profit from operations
includes a benefit of some £66 million
related to strengthening of the euro and
other currencies against sterling.
In the Americas, despite volume declines
in the USA, net revenue increased by
£319 million to £861 million and adjusted
profit from operations by £122 million to
£288 million as a result of price increases
and a good operational performance in
the USA, as well as the inclusion of a full
year’s contribution from the Altadis cigar
business. The strengthening of the US
dollar against sterling accounted for
£58 million of the increase in adjusted
profit from operations.
In the Rest of the World, we delivered a
strong performance with improvements
in the majority of markets. Net revenue
increased by 42 per cent to £2,138 million
and adjusted profit from operations by
53 per cent to £617 million. Currency
movements accounted for £83 million of the
increase in adjusted profit from operations.

GEOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS OF TOBACCO
More details on our operational
performance are included on pages
21 to 32 of this report.
Restructuring and Synergies
Profits also benefited from incremental
synergies from the Altadis acquisition
of €147 million or £128 million which
we delivered this year. Our cumulative
synergies to date are €190 million. There
was an additional restructuring charge
of £145 million mainly in respect of the
additional European integration projects
and the closure of our Tampa factory in
the USA.
Logistics adjusted profit from operations
was £177 million compared with
£121 million for the eight months to
30 September 2008. This segment has
been impacted by economic conditions,
partly offset by cost initiatives.
1849 Black Sun ImpTob p8_p11:Layout 1 30/11/09  20:38  Page 10 Net Finance Costs
Adjusted net finance costs were £700 million
(2008: £623 million). On an adjusted basis,
our interest cover was 4.2 times (2008:
3.6 times). Reported net finance costs of
£1,392 million (2008: £850 million) include
post-employment benefits net finance
expense of £32 million (2008: income
£45 million) and fair value losses on
derivative financial instruments providing
commercial hedges of £660 million
(2008: £272 million).
Taxation
The adjusted tax charge for the period
was £581 million (2008: £426 million)
representing an adjusted effective tax
rate of 26.0 per cent (2008: 26.5 per cent).
The reported tax charge was £268 million
(2008: £180 million).
Foreign Exchange
Tobacco net revenue benefited by £754
million due to currency effects, mainly as
a result of the appreciation of the euro and
the US dollar against sterling. Logistics
distribution fees were increased by £122
million as a result of currency effects. Group
adjusted profit from operations benefited
from currency effects of £306 million. In
calculating the impact of foreign exchange
movements, we adjust for the translation
impact and also the transactional impact
on leaf costs.
Dividends
The Board has proposed a final dividend
of 52.0 pence per share such that the total
dividend for the year is 73.0 pence. This
represents growth of 16 per cent, as
adjusted for the bonus element of the rights
issue in June 2008. Subject to approval by
shareholders this dividend will be paid on
19 February 2010 to those shareholders
on the register at close of business on
22 January 2010.
Cash Flow and Financing
Our business remains highly cash
generative and we converted 128 per
cent of our adjusted profit from operating
activities after net capital expenditure into
cash, as a result of significant working
capital savings of £985 million. This
excellent improvement was delivered
through various group wide initiatives
focused on optimising our finished goods
and tax stamp inventories and reducing
our trade receivables.
Strong cash flows from operating activities
complemented by working capital savings
have offset the significant increase in our
debt due to the strengthening of both the
euro and the US dollar against sterling.
Excluding the impact of foreign exchange
we reduced our adjusted net debt by
over £2 billion.
Our adjusted net debt was £10.8 billion
(30 September 2008: £11.5 billion;
31 March 2009: £14.0 billion).
The denomination of our closing adjusted
net debt was 56 per cent euro, 31 per
cent US dollar and 13 per cent sterling.
Our all-in cost of debt was stable at
5.5 per cent (2008: 5.5 per cent).
At 30 September 2009, our reported
net debt which includes accrued interest,
the fair value of derivatives providing
commercial cash flow hedges and finance
lease liabilities had increased to £12.0 billion
from £11.7 billion at 30 September 2008.
Our reported net debt was £15.2 billion
at 31 March 2009.
During the year we successfully raised
£3.9 billion through the capital markets
which coupled with the working capital
reduction and ongoing cash generation
leaves us with no refinancing requirements
until July 2012.
At 30 September 2009, we had committed
financing facilities in place of around
£15 billion.
Pensions
Our net retirement benefit liabilities
increased during the year from £105 million
to £794 million, mainly due to the effects
of revised actuarial assumptions, including
a significantly lower discount rate in line
with movements in bond markets.
Additions and Fixed Asset Disposals
Our cash outflows included gross capital
expenditure of £253 million (2008: £226
million), the increase reflecting disciplined
investment in machinery and equipment
across our expanded footprint. Disposal
of surplus Altadis properties contributed to
an increase from £34 million to £69 million
in proceeds from the sale of fixed assets.

Strategic Review
12 IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2009
MAXIMISING OUR
GROWTH POTENTIAL
Alison Cooper
Chief Operating Officer
Our strategy is underpinned by three
core objectives – sales growth, cost
optimisation and effective cash utilisation.
These are the building blocks of our
business and we are committed to
delivering a strong performance in each
of these areas. Our enhanced focus on
sales is a key driver in creating value for
our shareholders and strengthening the
long-term sustainability of our business.
As a global tobacco company we recognise
the importance of manufacturing, marketing
and selling our products responsibly. This
underpins our growth strategy and is an
integral part of how we do business.
Our overall strategic Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
are total shareholder return and adjusted earnings
per share.
Sales growth
We are a sales led business, with strong
positions in both mature and emerging
markets and sales in over 160 countries.
Our balanced operating platform
provides stability and creates future
growth opportunities.
We have invested strategically to create a
comprehensive and balanced brand and
product portfolio, in turn facilitating a total
tobacco focus, which considerably
enhances our growth potential.
Our international strength in cigarette is
complemented by world leadership in cigar,
fine cut tobacco, papers and tubes and a
small but growing snus business.

“Our track record of creating sustainable shareholder
value has been impressive over many years and
has been driven by the consistent application of
our strategy.”

1849 Black Sun ImpTob p12_p13:Layout 1 30/11/09  20:39  Page 12 IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2009 13
We have strong local, regional and
international brands with representation
across the key price segments within
individual markets.
These portfolio strengths, combined with
our focus on trade marketing and on our
consumers, are key to sales development.
We ensure that individual markets have the
flexibility to align local portfolios to specific
local market and consumer dynamics,
within a Group strategic framework.
We seek to be agile in responding to
changing market dynamics ensuring our
brands and products remain relevant to
evolving consumer preferences enabling
our highly skilled sales forces to drive
growth across our portfolio.
Our sales growth KPIs are cigarette volumes and
tobacco net revenue.
Cost optimisation
Cost optimisation is a hallmark of our
business. We seek maximum returns
from our investments and seek efficiency
improvements without compromising our
focus on quality and innovation. We have
a long history of value creating acquisitions
and are renowned for our ability to integrate
new businesses swiftly and efficiently.
This year we have delivered our integration
synergy targets whilst driving business
initiatives and improvement across
the Group.
Our cost optimisation KPI is tobacco adjusted
operating margin.
2
Cash Utilisation
We are highly cash generative. We focus
on managing capital expenditure, working
capital, tax and interest costs to optimise
our cash flows and ensure that the cash
we generate is used effectively.
Our short-term focus is on debt reduction
following the acquisition of Altadis. We also
continue to make disciplined investments
across the business to enable us to
continue to deliver sustainable growth.
While debt reduction will remain a priority,
given our very strong cash flows, we
believe we will have scope for further value
creating acquisitions and strategic alliances
within a reasonable timeframe.
Cash conversion is an essential prerequisite to cash
utilisation, therefore our cash conversion rate is the KPI.

Industry Overview
The world cigarette market is broadly
stable with around six trillion cigarettes
consumed globally each year, including
China which accounts for around a third
of total global consumption.
Excluding China, the four largest
international tobacco companies, Philip
Morris International, British American
Tobacco, Japan Tobacco and Imperial
Tobacco, hold 69 per cent of the total
cigarette market.
Smoking incidence is expected to
continue to decline in developed mature
markets, as the percentage of smokers
within total populations reduces. However,
this is offset by growth in emerging
market regions, as the number of adults
in those regions is expected to grow.
World Tobacco Market
Measuring our Strategy:
Key performance indicators are the
principal measures used by the Board to
assess performance against our strategy.
On pages 14 and 15 we highlight how
we measure each of our core objectives.
Risk Management:
A detailed assessment of strategic
risks within our operating environment
is undertaken by management and is
embedded across the Group.
On pages 16 and 17 we provide an update
on the principal risks that may impact on
our business and the management controls
we have put in place to mitigate them.
Leveraging our Assets:
Our total tobacco focus on pages 18
and 19 demonstrates how we grow sales.
On pages 29 and 30 we highlight how
we are continuing to develop our business
in Morocco.
Corporate Responsibility:
We manage our business to ensure we
maintain the high standards of conduct
and performance expected of an
international company.
On page 20 we give an overview of our
progress during the year with more detail
in our CR Review, due to be published on
our website in early 2010.
Consumer demand will continue to
evolve, with ongoing downtrading in
mature markets as well as uptrading
in emerging markets.
The last decade has been characterised by
increasing regulation, particularly in mature
western markets where legislation on
tobacco advertising, health warnings and
smoking in public places is commonplace.
Regulation is also rapidly developing in
emerging markets.
Excise duties have also increased,
especially in developed markets and, as
prices have increased, consumers seeking
value have downtraded to value brands
both within cigarette and into other
tobacco products. As a result, the other
tobacco products sector has grown and
this trend is expected to continue.
The cigar market is broadly stable and is
concentrated in the developed markets
of Western Europe and the USA, with
growth in the emerging markets of
Eastern Europe and Asia.
Industry Growth Opportunities
While the tobacco industry is mature,
we believe that there are still many
opportunities to grow profits organically
and potential further bolt-on acquisitions.
Organic growth opportunities include
volume development across emerging
markets and product categories, market
share gains from competitors, entry into
new markets, new brand launches and
the introduction of additional products in
existing markets. In the context of broadly
stable global market volumes and subject
to specific market dynamics, we
anticipate that price increases will
increase industry revenues and profits.

the principal measures used by the Board to assess performance and
continuous improvement in line with our strategy. Certain of these are
linked to executive remuneration.
Our Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
DIRECTORS’ REPORT: BUSINESS REVIEW: STRATEGIC AND FINANCIAL REVIEW
Strategic Review continued
Our focus on sales growth, cost optimisation and
effective cash and tax management has enabled us to
deliver 18 per cent growth in adjusted earnings per share.
Over the past ten years, our adjusted earnings per share
has grown by 15 per cent on a compound annual basis.
Definition
Adjusted earnings per share is adjusted profit after tax attributable to the
equity holders of the Company divided by the weighted average number
of shares in issue during the period excluding shares held to satisfy
employee share plans and shares purchased by the Company and
held as Treasury shares.
In 2009, we underperformed the FTSE All-Share
Index by 6 per cent however, over the past 10 years we
have outperformed by 286 per cent and over three years
we have outperformed by 33 per cent.
With dividends reinvested, £100 invested in
Imperial Tobacco 10 years ago would now be worth
£517, compared to just £134 invested in the FTSE
All-Share Index.

Tobacco net revenue comprises revenue less duty and similar items.
We consider this an important measure in assessing the profitability
of Tobacco operations.
Our focus on optimising our cost base balanced with
targeted investments has enabled us to achieve a tobacco
operating margin of 40.3 per cent.
Our operating margins were impacted by the change in
business mix following the Altadis acquisition in early 2008.
In the first comparable reporting period, our tobacco
adjusted operating margin was up in the second half of
2009 to 40.6 per cent compared to 38.9 per cent in the
second half of 2008.
Definition
The tobacco adjusted operating margin is the adjusted profit from
operations for the Tobacco segment divided by net revenue for the
Tobacco segment.

KPI: Sales Growth
Strong cash generation has been a consistent hallmark of
Imperial Tobacco and remains a key priority for the Group.
Our long-term target is to convert around 100 per cent of
our adjusted operating profit after net capital expenditure
into cash.
We delivered a cash conversion rate of 128 per cent.
Strong operational cash flows were enhanced by working
capital savings of £1 billion in the year, taking both our
three and five year averages to over 100 per cent.

16 IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2009
Our principal risks and
uncertainties may be
categorised as follows:
– Regulation
– Excise Duty and
Illicit Trade
– Key Market
Dependency
– Competition Law
– Tobacco-Related
Litigation
– Financing
Each area of the business is required to
formally review its principal areas of risk
and uncertainty so that major risks are
reviewed at all levels across the Group.
This is an ongoing process, ensuring there
are clear and consistent procedures for
monitoring, updating and implementing
appropriate controls to manage the
identified risks.
This process is supplemented by the
Risk Co-ordination Committee which
assists the Chief Executive’s Committee
and the Audit Committee in overseeing the
management of material risks. The Board
has responsibility for the Group’s systems of
internal control. A more detailed description
of these systems is set out in our Corporate
Governance report.
We are subject to the same general risks
and uncertainties as any other business;
for example, the political stability in the
countries in which we operate and source
our raw materials, the impact of natural
disasters and changes in general economic
conditions including currency and interest
rate fluctuations, changes in taxation
legislation, the cost of our materials and
the impact of competition.
Outlined below is a description of the
principal risks and uncertainties that are
specific to and may impact our business.
Not all these factors are within the Group’s
control. There may be other risks and
uncertainties which are unknown to the
Group or which may not be material now
but could be material in the future.
Regulation
Overview
The tobacco industry is subject to
substantial and increasingly restrictive
regulatory practices worldwide.
In many of the countries in which we
operate, there are regulatory restrictions
affecting a wide range of matters including
where tobacco products can be smoked
and their development, content,
manufacture, packaging and labelling,
testing, data reporting, sale, distribution,
display, marketing and advertising.
It is expected that further regulation
will be implemented.
The Group along with all other tobacco
manufacturers is often excluded from
engaging with regulators on these
regulatory proposals. Any future increases
in regulation of the tobacco industry could
have an adverse effect on the demand for
our products or increase the costs related
to compliance and could contribute to
an increase in illicit trade.
Mitigation
We employ a number of senior and
experienced Corporate Affairs specialists
to manage regulatory risk and where
possible engage with regulators. We monitor
proposals for new measures globally and
analyse them to identify their potential
impact on the Group and its products.
External experts are consulted where
necessary to provide advice and guidance
regarding any impact. Active membership
of industry bodies assists us in clearly
understanding the implications of any
change in regulation and helps to make
engagement on key issues consistent
so that opportunities are maximised.
We develop Company positions and
toolkits and provide training and guidance
for our markets to comply with regulation.
Excise Duty and
Illicit Trade
Overview
Increasing levels of excise duty are likely
to encourage consumers in affected
markets to switch from premium-priced
cigarettes to lower-priced cigarettes
and fine cut tobacco, or to turn to
illicit sources.
Tobacco products are subject to excise
duty which, in many of the markets in
which we operate, represents a substantial
percentage of the retail price and has been
steadily increasing in recent years.
Substantial increases in excise duty and
any significantly unfavourable change in the
tax treatment of fine cut tobacco, if widely
adopted, may have an adverse effect on
the size of individual duty paid markets
for our products.
Excise duty increases also encourage both
legal and illegal cross-border trade from
countries with lower levels of duty in the
form of genuine product smuggled illegally,
cheap whites (whereby a small manufacturer
produces product paying minimal tax, for the
purposes of smuggling) and the production
of counterfeit tobacco products.
Illicit trade creates a market that is
uncontrolled and unaccountable. As a result,
children can more easily obtain tobacco
products, governments are deprived of tax
revenues and the livelihoods of independent
tobacco retailers are threatened.
A detailed assessment of strategic
risks within our operating environment
is undertaken by management and is
embedded across the Group.
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
1849 Black Sun ImpTob p16_p17:Layout 1 30/11/09  20:44  Page 16 IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2009 17
Moreover, illicit trade may lead to erosion
of our brand integrity, loss of potential
earnings, undermine supply chain
distribution investments and potentially
impact our reputation.
Within such an environment there is a risk
that we and/or our employees may be
subject to investigation or other proceedings
by customs or other authorities.
Although we have implemented procedures
to detect and control illegal trading of our
products, such procedures can provide
only reasonable and not absolute assurance
of detecting non-compliance by managing
rather than eliminating risk.
Further information regarding certain
investigations initiated in January 2003
in relation to alleged foreign trading and
related violations by a number of people,
including former Reemtsma employees,
during a period prior to our 2002 acquisition
of Reemtsma, is included in our Corporate
Governance Report on page 53.
Mitigation
We are committed to working with
government authorities and international
organisations around the world and we
continue to invest considerable resources
in working to counter the illicit trade in
tobacco products.
We apply stringent controls to our
customers in the form of our Group policies
and standards, Code of Conduct and
product supply compliance processes
and procedures.
Our dedicated brand protection and
security specialists operate internationally in
conjunction with governments and customs
and excise authorities to disrupt the supply
and sales of illicit product. These controls
are supported by sophisticated information
collection and analysis practices and
tracking and tracing, product authentication
and volume verification solutions.
As part of our corporate planning process
and at an individual market level we conduct
regular reviews of our product portfolio to
ensure it is aligned to consumer preferences
in the context of increases in excise duty.
Key Market Dependency
Overview
Any material decline in the performance
of our key markets may impact on our
future profit development.
The continued growth of the business is
underpinned by our key markets including
the UK, Germany and Spain. Negative
development in any of our key markets
could have a material adverse impact
on the Group’s revenue or profits.
Mitigation
Our international footprint and brand and
product portfolio have been considerably
strengthened following the Altadis
acquisition. Our extended footprint
provides a more balanced exposure to
mature and emerging markets, while our
enlarged portfolio includes international
strength in cigarette and world leadership
in fine cut tobacco, cigars, rolling papers
and tubes. We also have a leading logistics
platform in Europe. This provides us with
enhanced growth opportunities and
has resulted in individual key markets
contributing a lower percentage of the
Group’s adjusted profit from operations.
The performance of our key markets is
reviewed as part of our regular business
review process whereby senior executives
responsible for the key markets present
an in-depth analysis of performance to
members of the Chief Executive’s Committee.
Competition Law
Overview
We have significant market positions
in certain countries.
As a result, we may be subject to enhanced
regulatory scrutiny in these countries, which
could result in investigations and adverse
regulatory action by relevant competition
authorities, including the potential for
monetary fines, and negative publicity.
Further information regarding an enquiry
by the UK Office of Fair Trading is included
in our Corporate Governance Report on
page 53.
Mitigation
The Group’s policies and standards,
including our Code of Conduct, mandate
that all employees must comply with
competition laws in the countries in which
we operate.
We employ experienced internal and
external lawyers specialising in competition
laws to provide advice and guidance
regarding interpretation and compliance
with competition laws.
In addition, we provide training and
guidance to relevant employees detailing
the obligations and requirements of
competition laws.
Tobacco-Related Litigation
Overview
Tobacco litigation claims are pending
against the Group in a number
of countries.
More claims are likely to be brought in the
future including claims for personal injury
and claims to recover the alleged costs
of providing medical care to individuals
with diseases associated with smoking.
To date, no tobacco litigation claim brought
against the Group has been successful
and/or resulted in the recovery of damages.
However, if any claim were to be successful,
it may result in a significant liability for
damages, and may lead to further claims
against us. Regardless of the outcome of
pending litigation, the costs of defending
such claims can be substantial and may
not be fully recoverable.
Further details on market specific litigation
claims against Group companies are
outlined on page 54.
Mitigation
We employ internal and external lawyers
specialising in the defence of product
liability litigation, to provide advice and
guidance on defence strategies and to
direct and manage litigation risk and
monitor potential claims around the Group.
Financing
Overview
The Group has significant borrowings
which may impair operational and
financial flexibility and performance.
The Group’s indebtedness could potentially
cause us to dedicate a substantial portion
of cash flow from operations to payments
to service debt depending on the level of
borrowings, prevailing interest rates and
exchange rate fluctuations, which would
reduce the funds available to the Group
for working capital, capital expenditure,
acquisitions, dividends, and other general
corporate purposes. It could also limit the
Group’s ability to borrow additional funds
for these purposes and limit flexibility in
planning for, or reacting to, changes in
technology, customer demand, competitive
pressures and the industry in which the
Group operates.
This could place the Group at a competitive
disadvantage compared to its competitors
that are less leveraged, and increase our
vulnerability to both general and industry
specific adverse economic conditions.
Our credit ratings may be adversely affected
if this happens and/or if conditions in credit
markets are unfavourable at a time when we
are looking to refinance our current sources
of financing, and as a result we may not
be able to obtain new sources of financing
or only be able to do so at higher costs.
Mitigation
The Group has established a centralised
treasury function, which is responsible for
the management of the financial risks of
the Group, together with its financing and
liquidity requirements.
Further details of the Group’s treasury
operations and the approach to managing
these risks can be found in Note 16 to the
Financial Statements on pages 98 to 111.

Portfolio Strength
Our comprehensive brand and product
portfolio considerably enhances our growth
opportunities. We have strong local, regional
and international brands across all key
price segments within individual markets
allowing us to meet changing consumer
needs. This portfolio strength, combined
with trade marketing excellence and our
agility in anticipating and responding to
changing market dynamics and consumer
preferences drives sales growth.
Cigarettes
Our success with Davidoff and JPS in
recent years has been particularly pleasing.
These brands operate at opposite ends of
the cigarette price spectrum and both have
seen consistent volume increases year
on year.
We have grown global volumes of Davidoff,
our key international premium cigarette
brand by 27 per cent over the past 5 years,
achieving particular success in the Middle
East, Eastern Europe, Taiwan and Greece.
Saudi Arabia, the largest individual market
for Davidoff worldwide, accounts for 16
per cent of global Davidoff volumes, with
compound annual growth of 43 per cent
in the past five years. In Greece, with
successful line extensions, we have grown
Davidoff to become the leading brand in
the premium segment.
Whilst building sales of Davidoff in our
emerging markets we have focused on
growing our value brands in mature
markets, where consumer downtrading
is a key dynamic.
We have achieved tremendous success
with JPS in Western Europe and further built
on the brand’s successful track record in the
year, improving volumes by 11 per cent.
Our performance in Germany has been
exceptional, growing JPS sales consistently

over a five year period to establish it as
the second largest cigarette brand in the
country, with a market share of 8.5 per cent.
To maximise the brand’s growth potential
and strengthen our German portfolio
we also introduced JPS make your own,
roll your own and eco-cigarillo products,
capturing 7.6 per cent market share
of the other tobacco products sector.
A Portfolio Approach:
Other Tobacco Products
Our other tobacco products business
complements our cigarette portfolio and
ensures a total tobacco focus across the
Group. We are world leaders in cigars
and fine cut tobacco, papers and tubes.
We also have a small but fast growing
snus business.
Fine Cut Tobacco
Downtrading from cigarettes into fine
cut tobaccos, such as roll your own and
make your own products is common in
developed Western European markets,
where fine cut tobacco consumption is
largely concentrated. Downtrading within
fine cut tobacco from premium to value
brands is also increasing.
We have built strong positions across
Western Europe and are growing our
presence in Central Europe and in the
USA. Our premium brands, Golden Virginia
and Drum, underpin our world leadership.
However, to ensure our fine cut tobacco
portfolio is well suited to changing consumer
preferences, our portfolio development
initiatives have increasingly focused on
strengthening our position in the value
segment and developing fine cut tobacco
variants of cigarette brands.
Cigars
We have a unique portfolio of cigar brands
and products. Through Habanos, our
Cuban joint venture, we have a number
of prestigious cigar brands including
Cohiba, Montecristo and Romeo y Julieta.
These are supported by our local brands
which hold strong domestic positions in our
key markets of the USA, Spain and France.
Increasing smoking restrictions and the
current economic climate have impacted
cigar volumes, particularly in the premium
segment. We have also seen a trend
towards smaller cigar formats with growth
in mass market cigars as consumers
downtrade. We are focused on improving
the profitability of our cigar business
through cost management and using
our broad product portfolio and our
innovation capabilities to adapt to the
changing environment.
Papers, Tubes and Snus
Our rolling paper brands account for more
than a third of global paper volumes and
are sold in more than 50 markets worldwide.
Rizla is the world’s leading papers brand
and number one in the UK, Belgium,
Greece, Italy and Finland.
Our filter tubes brands are available in around
30 countries, principally in Western Europe
and North America, and our key filter tubes
markets include Germany and the USA.
Our snus business is in Sweden, where
the product is exempt from an EU wide
ban, and in Norway, although we continue
to evaluate the potential for expanding into
other markets.
Our involvement in snus, a moist oral
tobacco product that is placed under
the upper lip, began in September 2005,
through the purchase of a 43.1 per cent
stake in the Swedish company Skruf.
In 2008 we increased our stake to 100
per cent.
In 2006, we extended our snus portfolio
beyond the flagship Skruf premium brand
with our value brand Knox. We have
achieved excellent results, particularly
in Norway where we have an 18 per cent
market share.

Corporate Responsibility
Overview
Building trust with our stakeholders and
acting with integrity at all times is critical to
our success, our global reputation and our
long-term sustainability.
Key issues managed within our CR strategy
include business conduct and accountability,
product stewardship and assessment,
responsible sales and marketing, fairness
and respect for employees, occupational
health and safety, supplier sustainability,
environmental impact and community
involvement. Details of our performance
in each of these areas are available in our
Corporate Responsibility Review.
In 2007 we identified five particular areas
of focus for the next five years:
– further increasing transparency in how
we adhere to our Group policies
– empowering local management to
better address CR issues
– product portfolio balance
– supplier sustainability
– better carbon management.
Following the acquisition and integration
of Altadis we are now planning a further
review of these issues to ensure that we
have the right CR framework in place for
the enlarged business.
The review will also take into account the
views of our new Stakeholder Panel,
which was convened this year to critically
appraise our performance. The panel
includes representatives from our main
stakeholder groups including consumers,
customers, suppliers and employees.
A summary of our 2009 achievements in
our five focus areas is outlined below.
Policies, Standards and Management
Accountability
We continually review and communicate
our policies and standards so they are
aligned with our developing business and
universally understood by our employees.
We updated a number of our corporate
documents in the year, including our
International Marketing Standards which
are published in full on our corporate
website, as well as policies covering
employment, fairness at work and
employee engagement, wellbeing and
health. In addition, we provided training
and held a number of workshops to
improve the business knowledge and
understanding of our employees, with
a particular focus on occupational health
and safety, product supply compliance
and science and stewardship.
During the year we also began an extensive
review of our Code of Conduct, which sets
out the responsible behaviours we expect
from our employees. The review will be
completed in 2010 and the updated
code will be communicated throughout
the Group.
Product Portfolio Balance
We continually review our product portfolio
for unnecessary complexity ensuring that
we meet the needs and preferences of our
consumers whilst recognising increasing
product stewardship and regulatory
demands. Reducing the complexity of our
portfolio by rationalising or re-specifying
brand variants and improving systems and
processes is being managed by a newly
established cross-functional team. A new
approach to complexity evaluation and
reduction will be rolled out in 2010.
Supplier Sustainability
We work with our suppliers to safeguard
future supplies and improve social,
environmental and economic standards
in the supply chain. The scope of our
commitment covers tobacco, non-tobacco
materials and sales and marketing-related
items. Our 2009 focus has been on
reviewing our procurement activities in
order to further improve supplier practices.
We continue to work with the Social
Responsibility in Tobacco Production
programme to monitor the performance
of our tobacco suppliers. We are also a
Board member of the Eliminating Child
Labour in Tobacco Foundation and
encourage supplier compliance with
international standards on child labour.
Climate Change and Carbon
Management
We remain committed to minimising our
environmental impacts and regularly review
our policy and performance at Board level.
Our environmental management systems
are based on ISO 14001. Analysing energy
consumption and CO 2 emissions throughout
the Group has been a key task for us during
the year and we remain on course to meet
our 2010 reduction targets relative to
tobacco production for energy consumption,
waste and waste to landfill and for absolute
reduction in CO 2 emissions.
Employees
As a responsible business we take care
of our employees’ health and safety and
treat our people with fairness, dignity
and respect. Employee engagement is
fundamental to our success and we
actively promote two-way dialogue.
Social plans related to the integration of
Imperial Tobacco and Altadis and agreed
with European trade unions and works
councils have included comprehensive
employee support measures.
The occupational health and safety of our
employees is of paramount importance to
us and is monitored by the Board. Our
ongoing programme of employee training
and performance reporting is designed to
reduce work-related injury and ill health,
and has been a key area of focus during
this period of organisational change.
Our Corporate Responsibility Review will
be published in early 2010. Data will be
independently verified by SGS United
Kingdom Limited. The accuracy and
reliability of our CR progress has been
reported on by Corporate Citizenship.

HOW WE HAVE PERFORMED
We have strong positions in both
mature and emerging markets. This
geographic balance provides stability
and creates a strong operating platform
from which to maximise the potential of
our brands and drive sales.
In our mature markets we have strength
across our product categories and a focus
on profitability. We are the second largest
cigarette company in the European Union
and are market leader in the UK and
Spain with a strong number two position
in Germany and France. These core profit
centres account for around half of our
Group profit.
Last year in the EU we sold over 134
billion cigarettes, 23,000 tonnes of fine cut
tobacco and nearly a billion cigars, growing
net revenues by 19 per cent to £3.8 billion
and profits by 20 per cent to over £1.8 billion.
In the USA we are investing to further
develop our established cigarette, fine
cut tobacco and cigar positions and our
businesses in Australasia consistently
deliver high margins and profit growth.
We are growing our volumes in emerging
markets which account for 51 per cent
of our overall cigarette business. With
investment priorities in Eastern Europe,
Africa and the Middle East our focus is
on organic sales growth.
In all our markets, local insight is key to
maintaining our growth momentum and we
continually seek to align our local portfolios
with evolving consumer preferences in
order to maximise our sales potential.

The UK’s two best selling brands,
Lambert & Butler and Richmond continue
to hold over 30 per cent of the overall
cigarette market.
In fine cut tobacco we have grown volumes
by 13 per cent. However, our premium
brands Golden Virginia and Drum remained
under pressure as a result of downtrading,
impacting our market share which was
58.0 per cent (2008: 61.6 per cent).
In the growing fine cut tobacco value
segment, Gold Leaf has continued to
benefit from downtrading with market
share up to 3.8 per cent (2008: 2.6 per
cent). We launched Golden Virginia Yellow
in March to further strengthen our position
in the value segment, with encouraging
initial results.
Outlook
We expect a more normal rate of decline
in duty paid cigarette volumes of around
2 per cent in the coming year and
further growth in duty paid fine cut
tobacco volumes.
We believe the diversity of our brand and
product portfolio along with our commitment
to sales excellence should provide further
opportunities to grow our profits within
a downtrading environment.
We remain focused on balancing our
market leading shares with sustainable
profit growth.
United Kingdom
Market Dynamics
We estimate that the duty paid cigarette
market was broadly stable at 45.3 billion
cigarettes (2008: 45.5 billion) benefiting
from fewer purchases of UK brands
abroad, as a weaker economy and sterling
exchange rate reduced overseas travel.
Downtrading has continued to be the major
dynamic in the UK tobacco market with
strong growth in the economy cigarette
segment. This segment now accounts for
15 per cent of the total cigarette market
(2008: 11 per cent).
As a result of downtrading and reduced
overseas travel, the fine cut tobacco
market continued its strong growth trend,
up by 19 per cent to 4,450 tonnes (2008:
3,750 tonnes).
In January, we increased our prices and in
April the Chancellor raised tobacco duties
by 7 pence per pack of 20 cigarettes.
We were disappointed that MPs voted to
ban the display of tobacco products when
debating the Government’s Health Bill.
There is no compelling evidence which
shows that tobacco display restrictions
have reduced either the consumption of
tobacco products or youth smoking
initiation in the few countries where
they have been introduced. We remain
concerned that such legislation places
an unnecessary burden on retailers and
exacerbates illicit trade. We support practical
initiatives that will reduce youth smoking
but will continue to oppose disproportionate
and unnecessary regulation.
Our Performance
In the UK, net revenue was £893 million
(2008: £869 million), with adjusted profit
from operations of £601 million (2008:
£584 million).
We continued to focus on our strategy
of balancing profit and market share
in the UK where we are the leading
tobacco company.
Our overall cigarette market share was
45.3 per cent (2008: 45.9 per cent).
We continue to increase our share of
the economy segment up to 31 per cent
(2008: 29 per cent), as a result of growth in
JPS Silver. Launched in November 2008,
JPS Silver has delivered excellent results
with a market share of 3.3 per cent in
September. Since we repositioned Windsor
Blue in July to capitalise on the growing
economy segment its share has improved.

Market Dynamics
We estimate that duty paid cigarette
market volumes were down by 2 per cent
to 85.8 billion cigarettes (2008: 87.8 billion).
Downtrading remains a key dynamic in
Germany, with the low price branded
cigarette sector continuing to grow,
accounting for 27 per cent of the total
cigarette market (2008: 24 per cent).
In June, we increased prices of our
cigarette brands and our traditional fine cut
tobacco products, including a 20 euro cent
increase on all packs of 17 cigarettes.
In July, the minimum pack size for cigarettes
increased from 17 to 19 cigarettes and we
raised prices proportionately at that time.
We estimate that the overall other tobacco
products market was up by 9 per cent to
24,500 tonnes (2008: 22,550 tonnes), with
strong growth in private label make your
own products.
Our Performance
In Germany, net revenue was £826 million
(2008: £664 million) with adjusted profit
from operations up to £403 million (2008:
£309 million).
We delivered a strong performance with
our value brand JPS up to 8.5 per cent
(2008: 7.8 per cent), further consolidating its
position as the number two cigarette brand.
Our premium brands performed robustly,
with Davidoff, Gauloises Blondes and
R1 maintaining market share. We have
introduced West maxi-packs and soft packs
to further support the brand franchise.
These brand performances ensured our
overall cigarette market share was broadly
stable at 27.3 per cent (2008: 27.4 per cent).
We are market leaders in the other tobacco
products sector. We increased our volumes
as a result of a strong performance from
Route 66, growth in JPS and additional
private label contracts which began in
October last year. However, our overall
market share declined to 19.6 per cent
(2008: 19.9 per cent).
Outlook
As in the UK, our strategy in Germany is
to continue to balance market share and
profit growth.
We will continue to align our versatile
brand and product portfolio with
consumer preferences, and believe we
are well positioned to capitalise on the
downtrading trends.
In addition, Gauloises Blondes will be
incorporated into our distribution network
from April 2010.

Spain
Market Dynamics
Economic conditions have been particularly
challenging in Spain, with unemployment
levels at almost 20 per cent.
We estimate that the duty paid cigarette
market was down by 7 per cent to 83.6
billion cigarettes (2008: 89.6 billion).
This was mainly due to declining travel
retail volumes and further downtrading
into fine cut tobacco. The fine cut tobacco
sector grew strongly by 43 per cent to
5,150 tonnes (2008: 3,600 tonnes).
The Spanish cigarette market comprises
both blonde or American blend cigarettes,
which account for around 90 per cent
of the market, and dark cigarettes which
account for 10 per cent of the market.
Cigar market volumes were down by 5
per cent, impacted by the sensitivity of this
product category to economic conditions
and restrictions on smoking in public places.
In June, specific taxes were increased
on all tobacco products. In addition, the
minimum incidence of duty was increased
for cigarettes and introduced on fine
cut tobacco.
Our Performance
In Spain, net revenue was £610 million
(2008: £411 million) and adjusted profit
from operations was £275 million (2008:
£150 million).
As a result of lower travel retail sales,
due to reduced tourism in Spain and a
declining dark cigarette segment, our
overall cigarette market share was down
to 36.4 per cent (2008: 37.2 per cent).
In the blonde cigarette segment, a slight
decline in Fortuna was largely offset by
further growth from Nobel and Ducados
Rubio, with our domestic blonde cigarette
market share at 30.6 per cent (2008: 30.8
per cent).
We increased prices in January and the
duty increases in June were passed on
to consumers in almost all cases. At the
same time, we further increased the prices
of most of our cigarette brands.
In fine cut tobacco, we consolidated
our market leading position growing our
volumes by 52 per cent. Our overall market
share was 42.6 per cent (2008: 49.1 per
cent), impacted by reduced travel retail
brand sales and a number of new market
entrants. We launched a new brand
Origenes in October 2009 to capitalise
on particularly strong growth in the natural
fine cut tobacco segment.
In cigar, in a challenging market environment
we continued to lead the market with
particular strength in large cigars with our
best selling brand, Farias, accounting for
over 40 per cent of this category.
During the year we merged the three
sales forces of Imperial Tobacco, Altadis
cigarettes and Altadis cigars into one
unified team, which has enabled us to
deliver a more comprehensive service
to our customers, focusing on trade
marketing excellence.
Outlook
We anticipate that challenging economic
conditions will persist in Spain, fuelling
further downtrading. We expect that the
cigarette market will continue to decline
with downtrading both within cigarettes
and into fine cut tobacco.
The breadth of our brand and product
portfolio includes strength in value
cigarettes and fine cut tobacco, such
that we are well positioned to respond
to ongoing consumer shifts in the market.

26 IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2009
Market Dynamics
We estimate that regional cigarette
volumes declined by 4 per cent to 370.4
billion cigarettes.
This rate of decline is mainly due to excise
driven price increases in Poland and in
the Czech Republic which have led to
growing cross-border flows. Excluding
Poland and the Czech Republic regional
cigarette volumes were down 2 per cent.
We increased prices during the year
including in the Netherlands, Greece and
Italy and in November 2009 in France.
In France we estimate the cigarette market
was up by 3 per cent to 55.0 billion
cigarettes (2008: 53.6 billion) due to a
reduction in EU cross-border flows. Market
volumes of fine cut tobacco in France were
stable at an estimated 7,500 tonnes.
Our Performance
In the Rest of the EU, net revenue was
£1,490 million (2008: £1,250 million) and
adjusted profit from operations was £566
million (2008: £494 million).
In France, our domestic blonde cigarette
market share was up to 23.9 per cent as a
result of good performances from Gauloises
Blondes, Fortuna, JPS and News. We are
market leaders in the dark cigarette
segment which continued its declining
trend, impacting our overall share which
was 28.8 per cent (2008: 29.3 per cent).

With the trend towards fine cut tobacco
variants of cigarette brands, JPS and News
grew market share in this sector.
We are market leaders in the Netherlands,
the largest fine cut tobacco market in the
region. We made gains with our value
brands Evergreen Maxx, Drum Economy
and West make your own tobacco.
However, downtrading has impacted our
premium brands, resulting in our overall
share declining slightly to 50.5 per cent
(2008: 50.7 per cent).
We grew our cigarette share in a number of
markets including Austria, Czech Republic,
Greece and Portugal. JPS performed well
in Ireland, Portugal and Austria. Additional
cigarette brand highlights include Davidoff
in Greece and the Czech Republic.
In Scandinavia, as well as growing our
cigarette shares we delivered excellent
results from our snus brands Skruf and
Knox with our overall snus volumes
growing by 35 per cent.
In Central Europe as excise duties have risen
and consumers continue to seek value,
demand for fine cut tobacco products has
grown. We have anticipated these changing
dynamics and delivered 31 per cent growth
in our volumes across the region.
Outlook
We expect continued moderate
cigarette volume declines and modest
growth in fine cut tobacco, with further
consumer downtrading.
In this environment our versatile brands
and products, combined with our total
tobacco approach, provide future
growth opportunities.
Our focus is on driving sales across our
portfolio to build on our cigarette and fine
cut tobacco positions.

Market Dynamics
The main focus of our operations in the
region is the USA, where there were two
important regulatory changes to the market
during the year.
On 1 April 2009, a significant increase
in Federal Excise Taxes (FET) was levied
across all tobacco products. This has
impacted the market, with consumer prices
rising by approximately 35 per cent during
2009. Ahead of this increase, we saw
wholesalers and retailers reduce their stocks
and in the second half of the year we saw
increased competitor promotional activity.
The Food and Drug Administration
assumed regulatory control of the USA
tobacco industry under the Family Smoking
Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, which
became law in June. We want to work
constructively with the FDA but many of
the provisions within the Act violate our
constitutional rights, and as a result we
have joined with a number of other
companies in filing an action in the Federal
Court challenging the constitutionality
of certain provisions of the Act.
We estimate the USA cigarette market
declined by 8 per cent to 326.5
billion cigarettes.
In the fine cut tobacco market some
manufacturers, including Imperial Tobacco,
have moved production to expanded
tobacco. In cigar, current economic
conditions and the substantial FET
increases have reduced total market
volumes by 7 per cent.
Our Performance
Our Americas net revenue was £861 million
(2008: £542 million) with adjusted profit
from operations of £288 million (2008:
£166 million).
Our USA cigarette volumes were
12.6 billion (2008: 14.2 billion), with our
cigarette market share stable at 4.2 per
cent, a pleasing performance given current
market challenges. Our main brands USA
Gold and Sonoma continue to be well
positioned in the discount sector, with their
market shares at 2.4 per cent and 1.6 per
cent respectively and we further extended
distribution of Fortuna.
In fine cut tobacco, we are extending
our portfolio range in response to the
dynamic environment.
We have expanded our cigarette sales
force, which has improved our national
distribution capabilities so that we can
realise the opportunities that our versatile
multi-product portfolio offers.
In cigar, trading conditions have been
challenging. We have continued to perform
well with our premium and natural wrapper
brands but the rest of our homogenised
wrapper portfolio has been under pressure
and we have actively managed our cost
base. The closure of our cigar factories in
Florida and Alabama has been regrettable
but necessary to enable us to maintain
our profitability.
Outlook
The USA tobacco market is in a state
of transition following the FET increases
but our portfolio leaves us well positioned
to further grow sales in this key market.
Our focus is on improving our profitability,
by enhancing our cigarette presence,
building on our position in fine cut tobacco,
while improving our competitive position
in our cigar business.
Given our experience of operating in
regulated markets, we are confident of
continuing to successfully develop our
USA business.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT: BUSINESS REVIEW: OPERATING REVIEW
Rest of the World
Regional Review
This diverse region offers considerable
development opportunities given the broad
range of countries it encompasses.
Whilst building on our strong profit base in
mature markets, we are improving sales in
the emerging markets of our Rest of the
World region. As in all our markets, local
insight is key to maintaining our growth
momentum, and we continually ensure
that our local portfolios reflect consumer
preferences in order to maximise our
sales potential.
Our Performance
In the Rest of the World, net revenue
was £2,138 million (2008: £1,502 million),
with adjusted profit from operations of
£617 million (2008: £404 million).
We delivered strong results in Africa,
increasing market shares in many markets
with Excellence and Fine continuing to
build on their positive momentum.
In Morocco, we consolidated our market
leading position ahead of the monopoly
in tobacco manufacture and distribution
ending in 2010. We continued to lead the
market with Marquise and with uptrading
into international brands ongoing, we
grew market share of Gauloises Blondes.
A detailed review of our Moroccan business
follows on pages 29 and 30.
In the Middle East, we grew market shares
in all our major markets. Davidoff has
grown significantly across this region and
has benefited from a number of special
editions. We have improved our route to
market and increased our distribution. In
addition, Gauloises Blondes has performed
well, growing volumes.
Davidoff also performed strongly across
Eastern Europe achieving volume gains
of 16 per cent, with excellent results in
Ukraine, Azerbaijan and Serbia.
In Russia, our market share was broadly
stable at 8.6 per cent, with a good
performance from Maxim and Classic.
In an environment of significant price
increases in Ukraine, we grew market
share of Classic in the value sector and
Davidoff in the premium sector.
In Australia, we repositioned Horizon
stabilising the brand and launched JPS
with positive results to date. We grew our
market share in New Zealand to 18.3 per
cent (2008: 17.5 per cent), with an
excellent performance from JPS.
In Taiwan, with our new factory now fully
operational we have improved profitability
and our competitive position. Despite a
declining premium segment, Davidoff
continued to grow volumes. Our overall
market share was up to 9.9 per cent
(2008: 9.7 per cent), also reflecting growth
from Boss in the value segment.
We also grew market share in a number
of other markets in Asia Pacific including
in Cambodia and Laos.
In common with most luxury goods,
our overall Habanos cigar volumes were
impacted by the current economic climate
resulting in both destocking and lower
consumption. We have mitigated this
through price increases across the
portfolio and volume gains in Asia, most
of Eastern Europe and in some markets
in Western Europe.
Outlook
We believe this region offers us
considerable growth opportunities.
As part of the ongoing development of
our Africa and Middle East business we
have been restructuring certain distribution
arrangements in the region, which we
anticipate will result in a short term volume
reduction but with minimal impact on
Group profit.
Strategic investments in key markets
and our focus on sustainable sales
growth will enable us to further develop
our business with our versatile brand and
product portfolio.

We acquired our presence in Morocco as a result
of the Altadis acquisition and continue to develop
our operations in this important market.
Market Overview
Morocco is an evolving market. Consumers
are increasingly uptrading from traditional
dark cigarette brands, positioned in the
economy or low price segments, to
cigarettes in the blonde or American
blend mid-price range.
Total cigarette consumption is broadly stable
at around 14.6 billion cigarettes and around
18 per cent of the adult population smoke.
Tobacco regulation also continues to
evolve. Although not yet ratified, Morocco
is a member of the Framework Convention
on Tobacco Control, the world’s first global
tobacco treaty.
A new anti-tobacco law including a ban
on smoking in public places, larger health
warnings and advertising restrictions has
recently been passed by Parliament.
Legislation is also in place prohibiting price
reductions and any new brands must be
introduced at a price above the minimum
official price.
A Growing Business
In 2003, Altadis acquired 80 per cent of
the Moroccan Government owned tobacco
business, with the remaining 20 per cent
acquired in 2006. The acquisition included
the exclusive right for the manufacture and
distribution of tobacco products in Morocco
until the end of 2010.
We are market leader with a cigarette
share of 85 per cent. Our key local blonde
cigarette brand Marquise holds around
61 per cent share and is positioned in the
economy price segment. This segment
has grown in almost direct proportion to
the decline in dark cigarettes which are
priced in the same segment. However, as
uptrading into international brands such as
Fortuna and Gauloises Blondes increases,
the growth in the economy segment has
slowed and is starting to reverse.

Case Study continued

We expanded our portfolio with the
launch of Fortuna in 2003 and Gauloises
Blondes in 2004 and have since grown
market shares to 5.0 per cent and
6.6 per cent respectively.
We further strengthened our position,
extending our Moroccan portfolio with
the launch of Davidoff in 2008 and West
in 2009 in the premium and mid-price
cigarette segments respectively.
We have also been growing our range of
other tobacco products such as cigars,
cigarillos and fine cut tobacco.
In 2003, we considerably improved our
premium cigar offerings, with significant
investment in developing cigar speciality
outlets. In addition, we introduced mass
market cigars or cigarillos and have doubled
market volumes since 2003, principally led
by our Fleur de Savane range.
We have two factories in Morocco
and a threshing plant to process locally
grown tobacco, and continue to focus
on enhancing our distribution and
manufacturing capabilities.
In February 2009, we signed a long-term
agreement with Philip Morris International for
the manufacturing, import, distribution and
merchandising of their brands in Morocco.
There are three primary routes to market;
supermarket-style shops, van sales and
truck sales which are focused on sales
in rural areas.
To improve efficiency, customer service
and to optimise costs, we are increasingly
focusing our route to market on van and
truck sales and also improving our telesales
operations to enhance delivery capacity
and improve distribution efficiency.
The monopoly in distribution ends in 2010
and with our market leading position we
are positioned well to meet the demands
of increased competition.
Our broad product portfolio and
competitive pricing ensures that we are
able to cover all aspects of the tobacco
market enabling us to continue to take
advantage of evolving market dynamics.
By aligning our local portfolio to evolving
consumer preferences we will seek to further
enhance our profits in this key market.

Manufacturing
Integration Progress
Our key priority during the year has been
integrating the Imperial Tobacco and
Altadis manufacturing operations and
implementing standard systems and
processes throughout our 56 factories.
Following an extensive review of our
manufacturing capacity we have progressed
a number of European restructuring initiatives
to improve our competitive position and
address the significant overlap in our
operations following the Altadis acquisition.
In addition, we have strengthened our
USA cigar business by closing our factories
in Alabama and Florida.
We reallocate and re-use our surplus
manufacturing equipment within the
Group, giving benefits on product quality,
overheads, productivity and waste reduction.
Our Performance
We have been focused on reducing our
working capital across our manufacturing
operations, and have delivered further
cost savings.
In line with our business simplification
strategy, we delivered additional
improvements with the number of blends
decreasing by 9 per cent.
We have invested in our operations to
support productivity improvements and
innovation. Investment has been focused in
two main areas, in primary and secondary
processing and in our supply chain to support
flexibility, process standardisation, and the
continued delivery of our synergy targets.
In January, our factory in Taiwan started
full production. Our ability to manufacture
in market is contributing to the continued
development of our value portfolio.
In Germany, to support increased capacity
at our Langenhagen factory we have begun
the construction of a warehouse and
secondary extension.
In addition, in Reidsville, North Carolina,
the upgrading of our cigarette and fine
cut tobacco facilities acquired with
Commonwealth Brands is also
nearing completion.
Our quality management systems address
continual improvement. This year 30 of
our 56 factories (58 per cent) were ISO
9001 certified, with projects underway
to implement the standard in eight others.
We are constantly looking at the
processes for controlling and improving
our environmental performance, and apply
the ISO 14001 international standard to our
operations. Thirty seven of our 56 factories
(68 per cent) were ISO 14001 certified, with
our factory in Taiwan the latest to achieve
this standard.
Outlook
Our current focus is on completing our
integration projects in Europe, whilst driving
improvements across our manufacturing
portfolio without compromising quality
and our innovation capability. In addition,
we expect our productivity to improve as
the benefits of integration continue to
be realised.
We are seeking to manage the impact
of increasing leaf costs, which are being
driven by underlying pricing pressure
and the currency translation impact of a
commodity priced primarily in US dollars.
We operate in a dynamic, competitive
industry and constantly keep our
operations under review.
Our key priority has been integrating the Imperial
Tobacco and Altadis operations and extending best
practice across our manufacturing footprint.

Overview
Our logistics business is one of the largest
of its kind in Europe, delivering to around
300,000 outlets across Europe.
It is divided into two segments: Tobacco
Logistics and Other Logistics.
Tobacco Logistics delivers products for
the international manufacturers, including
Imperial Tobacco, to tobacconists and
other sales outlets. The business is run on
an operationally neutral basis ensuring all
customers are treated equally. We have in
excess of 90 per cent market share in the
distribution of tobacco in Spain, France
and Italy.
Other Logistics provides specialised services
for clients in the pharmaceutical, publishing,
transportation and telecommunications
industries, as well as general transport and
courier services, principally in Spain, Portugal
and France.
Our Performance
Distribution fees were £964 million (2008:
£607 million), with adjusted profit from
operations £177 million (2008: £121 million).
Our Tobacco Logistics business has
been resilient in spite of volume declines.
We delivered a good performance in France
with results ahead of our expectations.
In addition, we recently renewed our
French contracts with British American
Tobacco and Japan Tobacco International.
In Spain, despite market volume declines,
our results benefited from price increases
in January and June. We have also
renewed our distribution contract with
Philip Morris International.
In our Other Logistics business current
economic conditions have made trading
conditions challenging and we have
focused on maintaining our profitability.
We are rationalising our Other Logistics
operations whilst looking for further
opportunities to profitably leverage our
logistics expertise.
In Spain, Logista recently formed a joint
venture with a gaming company to provide
a range of services to support one of the
Spanish lotteries, including distribution
and marketing. The contract runs until 2020
and will significantly extend the lottery’s point
of sale network and improve our profits.
We have increased our market shares in
our French wholesale operations and within
our pharma division, where we are
increasing our services to our current
customers and focusing on distribution
to pharmacies.
We have been able to largely offset the
impact of economic conditions through
the successful implementation of cost
saving initiatives.
Outlook
Our logistics business is highly cash
generative and we remain focused
on maintaining profits in challenging
market conditions.
We are exploring a number of further cost
saving initiatives and are further increasing
our focus on our core profitable operations.

Chairman’s Introduction
34 IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2009 34 IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2009
The current difficulties facing the global economy have brought
considerable focus on governance and companies’ remuneration
policies. We are confident that our long established and
embedded Corporate Governance practices, internal controls
and remuneration policy, which in principle comply with the
recommendations in the Walker Review, support our strategy
of creating sustainable shareholder value and ensure that we
remain in a position to deliver this strategy.
Our Corporate Structure Explained
During the year we made considerable progress with the
integration of Altadis into our corporate structure. Following this
integration we have two main business activities: tobacco and
logistics. Our tobacco segment comprises the manufacture,
marketing and sale of tobacco and tobacco-related products. Our
logistics segment comprises the distribution of tobacco products
for major tobacco manufacturers, including Imperial Tobacco,
as well as a wide range of non-tobacco products and services.
Both business segments are managed within our Corporate
Governance framework and are subject to our policies and
control procedures. However, we run our logistics segment on an
operationally neutral basis in order to ensure that all its customers
are treated equally.
How We Actively Manage Our Business
Our Executive Directors have a wealth of experience in the tobacco
industry, complemented and supplemented by the wide range of
business and financial experience of our Non-Executive Directors.
They are collectively responsible to our stakeholders for ensuring
the Group is managed within its governance framework, setting
our corporate strategy and providing an environment in which
the corporate strategy can be delivered.
Our corporate strategy is supported by our remuneration policy
which focuses on performance related reward, with long-term
targets designed to incentivise the creation of sustainable
shareholder value. Performance against our corporate strategy
is further incentivised by our annual bonus and other performance
targets which support our key performance indicators (page 14)
and the management of the key strategic risks of the business.
Managing Risk
The Group faces a number of risks, similar to those faced by
many multinational companies, which may impact on our financial
position or prevent us from achieving our corporate strategy.
Successful management of these risks is fundamental to our
sustainable profitability and future growth.
HIGH STANDARDS OF CORPORATE
GOVERNANCE SUPPORT OUR STRATEGY
“We recognise it is critical to
constantly review and manage our
governance processes to ensure
our long-term sustainability.”
ACHIEVEMENTS IN 2009:
– Appointment of Chief Operating Officer
– Considerable Progress with Integration
– Refining Corporate Strategy
– Development of the Risk Co-ordination Committee
– Significant Refinancing
– Compliance with the Continuing Implementation
of the Companies Act 2006
PRIORITIES FOR 2010:
– Management Succession
– Further Progress on Integration
– Ongoing Enhancement of our Risk Management
Processes led by the Risk Co-ordination Committee
– Enhancement of our Anti-illicit Trade Activities
– Further Embedding and Enhancing Internal Controls

Our business and the risks we face are constantly changing.
We, therefore, regularly review our policies and risk management
procedures to ensure they are up-to-date and continue to protect
our stakeholders.
It is impossible to eliminate every risk. However, through our
Risk Co-ordination Committee we analyse risks by reference to
the likelihood of them occurring and their potential impact. This
‘top down’ process supports our long established risk management
controls embedded across the business. Further information
relating to the management of risk during the year is set out
on pages 45 to 48.
We also encourage staff to raise concerns they may have including
anything they believe to be wrong or dangerous. Our Public Interest
Disclosure Policy allows employees to do this safe in the knowledge
that they will not suffer any detriment as a consequence.
Succession Planning
We regularly review the composition of the Board and the Chief
Executive’s Committee to ensure a continuous provision of the most
effective leadership for the Group’s development and sustainability.
Our annual talent review process is designed to identify the most
capable successors for critical roles at all levels in our business.
It is a bottom up process initiated by our major market management
teams and rolled up through our regions and business units.
This culminates in a final talent review meeting conducted by the
Chief Executive’s Committee, the outputs of which are presented
to the Board for review and challenge. This is a practice that is
embedded across the Group and seeks to ensure a continuous
talent pipeline.
Key Achievements in 2009
As a further step in ensuring our Board structure is aligned with
the ongoing international development of our enlarged business,
Mrs A J Cooper was appointed to the position of Chief Operating
Officer in March 2009.
We made considerable progress with the integration of Altadis,
including rolling out our internal controls and Group policies and
procedures. In addition, we refined our corporate strategy to
ensure we capitalise on the opportunities offered by the
enlarged business.
To ensure that maturing financing facilities were effectively
managed we successfully raised £3.9 billion through the capital
markets and have no refinancing requirements until July 2012.
Key Priorities for 2010
In addition to our ongoing management succession planning,
our priorities for 2010 include further consolidation of the Altadis
business and the continued embedding and enhancement
of our processes and internal controls in the wider Group,
including in relation to Occupational Health, Safety and
Environmental processes.
We will also focus on further enhancement of our risk
management and anti-illicit trade processes.
Our governance processes support and underpin our strategy
and its underlying objectives of sales growth, cost optimisation
and cash utilisation, and we will continue to drive these during
the year. We will also continue to support reasonable regulation
of tobacco products but will challenge regulation that undermines
the principles of adult choice and the freedom of competition.

We remain committed to maintaining
high standards of corporate
governance, which we see as the
cornerstone of managing the business
affairs of the Group and a fundamental
part of the Board discharging its
stewardship responsibilities.
Corporate Governance Report
Introduction
The Board recognises that it is accountable to shareholders
for our standards of governance. This report, together with
the Directors’ Remuneration Report, seeks to explain how in
practice we apply the principles of good governance, advocated
by the Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the Code).
The Code sets out governance rules and best practice
provisions which apply to UK listed companies. Companies must
either comply with these provisions or provide an explanation for
areas of non-compliance. The Code is publicly available on the
Financial Reporting Council’s website www.frc.org.uk.
It is the Board’s view that the Company has been fully compliant
with the Code throughout our 2008/2009 financial year.

Corporate Governance Report continued
40 IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2009
our Non-Executive Directors play a valuable role by critically
reviewing and, where appropriate, challenging strategies proposed
by management to further develop our business, effectively use
our resources and our standards of conduct. This ensures we act
in the best long-term interests of our shareholders, while taking
account of the wider community of interests represented by our
employees, customers and suppliers. Where appropriate, papers
presented to our Board cover environmental, community, ethical
and reputational issues, thereby fully integrating them into our
decision making and risk assessment processes.
During the year matters considered by the Board included the
evolving strategic direction of the business, review of Group
funding arrangements (specifically refinancing through Bond
issues), the change in role of Mrs A J Cooper to Chief Operating
Officer, the potential effect of the recession including mitigating
recessionary pressures and the ongoing integration of the
Altadis business.
At its June 2009 meeting, Senior managers from across the
business presented to the Board on key strategic issues.
During the year the Board also considered and approved
annual and medium-term plans and operating results.
By reviewing the Group’s results at each Board meeting we
ensure Board members are kept informed on our progress.
Between Board meetings, Board members are supplied with
monthly performance reports, including detailed commentary
and analysis. To ensure Board members are fully informed on
all Committee matters they receive reports and minutes from the
chairmen of the Board Committees. Our Non-Executive Directors
also meet regularly, outside of scheduled Board meetings.
The main item discussed at such meetings during the year
was succession planning.

Board and Board Committees
Board Structure
The Board met six times during the year (with two of the meetings
having a duration of two days) and is scheduled to meet five times
in the 2010 financial year.
Our Directors for the year to 30 September 2009 are shown
on pages 36 and 37. Their biographies demonstrate a detailed
knowledge of the tobacco industry and the wider fast moving
consumer goods (FMCG) sector. This is supported with a wide
range of international business and financial experience which is
vital to our ongoing development and long-term sustainability. Their
biographies also include details of any other major directorships.
Board Operations
The Board is our principal decision making forum and manages
overall control of the Group’s affairs. Key to this control is the
schedule of matters on which the Board alone may make decisions.
These include approving our commercial strategy, corporate plans,
major corporate activities and our financial statements, together
with dividends. In addition, it is only the Board who can appoint
and remove Directors and our Company Secretary.
To ensure the effective operation of our Board, the Company
Secretary provides advice on all governance and regulatory
matters. He also assists the Chairman and Chief Executive
in setting the agenda for Board meetings.
All Directors are equally accountable to our shareholders for
the proper stewardship of our affairs and the success of the
Company. By using their judgement, experience and independence,

are considered below, together with a record of each Director’s
attendance at Board and Committee meetings during the year.
To ensure Directors are kept up-to-date on developing issues and to
enhance the overall effectiveness of the Board and its Committees,
our Chairman and chairmen of the Committees communicate
regularly with the Chief Executive and other members of the Chief
Executive’s Committee on an ongoing basis.
In order for our Directors to fulfil their duties they can seek both
independent professional advice, at our expense, and the advice
and services of the Company Secretary and other employees.
Chief Executive’s Committee
To ensure the effective implementation of Group strategy and
policy our Board delegates authority of the day-to-day operation
of the business to our Chief Executive and Chief Executive’s
Committee. This delegation is, however, subject to the schedule
of matters on which the Board alone can decide and those which
can only be decided by our shareholders.
The Committee, which met 20 times during the year, comprises
the Executive Directors, the Manufacturing Director, the Chief
Operating Officer Cigar, the Group Human Resources Director,
together with the Company Secretary.
In addition to implementing our strategy, the Committee oversees
all the Group’s activities, forecasts, policies and operations, to
ensure that the use and level of the Group’s resources are optimised
and effectively managed. As part of this ongoing review process
the Committee develops and recommends to the Board any
changes in strategy to enable us to achieve our overall objective
of creating sustainable shareholder value.

Chairman and Chief Executive: How do
we ensure no one individual has unfettered
powers of decision?
Our Chairman and Chief Executive have clearly defined and
separate responsibilities, however, they retain a close working
relationship and meet regularly between formal Board meetings
to ensure a full understanding of evolving issues and facilitate
swift decision making. They are responsible to our shareholders
for the successful and profitable delivery of our strategy.
Our Chairman is responsible for the effective leadership of the
Board, ensuring all Directors are able to fully contribute to
discussions and we benefit from their wide range of skills and
experience. Supported by the Deputy Chairman and Senior
Independent Non-Executive Director, he is also responsible for
ensuring effective communication with shareholders and ensuring
they can raise any concerns.
Our Chief Executive, supported by the Chief Executive’s
Committee, is responsible for the day-to-day leadership of
the Group and ensuring the successful implementation of the
strategies and objectives set by the Board.
Board balance and independence:
How do we ensure a sensible balance of
Executive and Non-Executive Directors?
We see having a Board with the right skill set as vital to our
ongoing success and expansion. Our Executive Directors are all
experts in their specific roles and, in addition, have a wealth of
experience in the wider tobacco industry. This is complemented
and supplemented by the wide range of business and financial
experience of our Non-Executive Directors who have been
appointed to bring specific skills to the Board, for example
their expertise within the wider FMCG sector, financial and
legal expertise and, as we expand geographically, specific
regional knowledge.
We believe the Board is well balanced and, notwithstanding the
resignation of Mr B F Bich, remains appropriately constituted.
The Board currently has 13 Directors: our Non-Executive Chairman,
four Executive Directors, seven independent Non-Executive
Directors and one Non-Executive Director (Mr J-D Comolli)
who we do not classify as independent when determining the
composition of our Board and its Committees.
We do not classify Mr Comolli, for the purposes of the Code,
as independent due to his ongoing Chairmanships of certain
subsidiaries within our Group and his provision of certain
consultancy services to us. Mr Comolli will cease to provide
consultancy services to us with effect from the end of the
2009/2010 financial year.
BALANCE OF EXECUTIVE AND
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Executives
Non-executives
2
3
Mr Comolli is our Deputy Chairman and Dr P H Jungels is
our Senior Independent Non-Executive Director to whom
we encourage shareholders to raise any concerns.
Following its annual evaluation (page 43) and review of potential
conflicts of interest, the Board concluded at its meeting in
September 2009 that all our Non-Executive Directors continue
to contribute effectively and constructively to Board debate. They
also continue to challenge effectively and question management
objectively and robustly and at all times have the best interests
of our stakeholders in mind. We, therefore, confirm that, with the
exception of Mr Comolli and our Chairman (as required by the
Code) our Directors remain independent as defined in the Code.
In compliance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006
(the Act) relating to Conflicts of Interest, revised Articles of
Association were adopted at our Annual General Meeting
(AGM) in January 2008. These provisions became effective
on 1 October 2008.
These Articles of Association allow the Board to authorise
situations in which a Director has, or may have, a direct or
indirect interest that conflicts or may conflict with the interests
of the Company. These are known as situational conflicts.
The Act also requires Directors to declare any interest in a
proposed transaction or arrangement with the Company.
These are known as transactional conflicts.
Our procedures require Directors to give notice of any potential
situational and/or transactional conflicts. This includes prior approval
of external directorships. Any notifications are considered at the next
Board meeting and, if considered appropriate, authorised. We do
not let any Director participate in the discussion, or vote regarding
their own conflicts. If authorised, any conflicts are entered in our
Conflicts Register.
We reviewed and reconsidered all conflicts entered in our Conflicts
Register at our Board meeting in September 2009. We intend to
perform this review and reconsideration annually.
This process allows the Board to be satisfied there is no
compromise to the independence of those Directors who have
board appointments or relationships with companies outside the
Group. In order to underpin his independence, we entered into
an agreement with Mr B Setrakian on 25 June 2008 to minimise
the risk of any conflict of interest between, inter alia, the law firm
Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP , of which he is a partner, and the Company.
Following a review of compliance with the terms of the agreement
the Board confirms his ongoing independence. IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2009 43
Information and professional
development: How do we induct and
regularly inform our Board?
We have a detailed induction and briefing programme for
Directors on appointment to the Board. We tailor this programme
to each Director’s needs taking into account their individual
qualifications and experience.
For example, Mr B Setrakian’s induction programme, completed
during the year, included meetings with our advisers and key
employees from our major functions together with site visits.
These meetings also included briefings on corporate responsibility
and corporate affairs issues, legal matters, product stewardship,
environmental management, social impact, scientific and
regulatory affairs and commercial risk management.
Ongoing training is available to all Directors to meet their individual
needs. We also provide regular briefings to Directors on relevant
issues such as legislation and regulation changes and corporate
governance developments. For example, during the year our
Auditors gave a presentation to the Board in respect of fraud
and corruption risk.
During our September 2009 Board meeting Directors visited our
Logistics operations in Spain where they met senior managers
and received detailed presentations on our Logistics business.
The Audit and Remuneration Committees also received
briefings from our Auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ,
and remuneration adviser Hewitt New Bridge Street respectively
to ensure they remain up-to-date with current regulations
and developments.
Performance evaluation: How do
we formally evaluate our Board and
Committees’ performance annually?
During the year, with the assistance of an external consultant, our
Board formally reviewed and evaluated its performance, together
with the performance of its Committees and individual Directors.
Feedback from each Director was obtained through detailed
questionnaires which were used as the basis for the overall
evaluation of the Board and its Committees and feedback
discussions between each Director and the Chairman. The results
were discussed by the Board at its meeting in September 2009.
Our Senior Independent Director met with the Non-Executive
Directors and the Board, without the Chairman present, to
consider the performance of the Chairman.
After taking account of the results of the Chairman’s formal
performance evaluation our Senior Independent Director provided
feedback to the Chairman on a one-to-one basis.
“We are confident in
the strength of our
internal controls.”

NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE
Overview
The Nominations Committee comprises all our Non-Executive
Directors and meets as required. During the financial year the
Committee met once. We evaluated the performance of the
Committee as part of the Board performance evaluation process.
Responsibilities
The responsibilities of the Committee include:
– the evaluation of the balance of skills, knowledge and
experience of our Board;
– the development of role specifications;
– the formulation of succession plans; and
– the making of recommendations to the Board with regard
to the appointment of Directors.
How the Nominations Committee Met its Responsibilities
During the Year
In addition to the Nominations Committee’s formal meeting, which
recommended to the Board the appointment of Mrs A J Cooper
to the position of Chief Operating Officer, the Non-Executive
Directors held a number of meetings and discussions during
the year concerning Board succession planning.
Board Changes
We continually review the composition and balance of our Board
to ensure that we have the right structure, skills and expertise in
place for the effective management of our multinational business.
This has been particularly important following the Altadis
acquisition in January 2008.
Following approval by our Board on 24 March 2009,
Mrs AJ Cooper was appointed to the new role of Chief
Operating Officer.
Mrs Cooper’s appointment to this role is a further step in ensuring
that our Board structure is aligned with our ongoing international
development and by focusing on driving the operational performance
and strategic direction of the business will enhance our long-term
future growth potential.
On 16 September 2009 our Board accepted Mr B F Bich’s
resignation as a consequence of his overall business commitments.

Corporate Governance Report continued
44 IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2009
The Chairman held meetings exclusively with the Non-Executive
Directors to consider, amongst other things, succession issues
and the performance of the Executive Directors.
Informed by the evaluation and these reviews the Board and its
Committees are satisfied they are operating and performing
effectively. There were no significant issues or training needs
identified and the process confirmed that each of our current
Directors has sufficient time, knowledge and commitment to
contribute effectively to our Board and its Committees.
The key theme which emerged from this year’s evaluation was
the introduction of the Risk Coordination Committee, which has
strengthened our Board’s confidence in our internal controls and
risk management processes. The Committee provides a more
structured and formal approach to risk identification and
management which is appropriate given the nature of the
business and the current economic climate.
The key theme identified as requiring ongoing Board attention
is management succession planning. In order to assist with
Executive Director succession planning, senior managers attend
a number of strategy days, Board meetings and Board dinners.
Succession planning was also discussed at Non-Executive
Director meetings held during the year.
Following the 2008 Board evaluation, and to further enhance the
independence of our Remuneration Committee, we added a
standing item to the Committee’s agenda allowing the members
of the Committee to meet without the Company Chairman, any
Executive Director or other manager being present.
The Board plans to continue to conduct evaluations annually. In
order to obtain maximum value from the evaluations and to benefit
from the varying skills and focuses of alternative facilitators, we
may consider alternative facilitators, formats and approaches in
future years. This will ensure our evaluations remain appropriate
for the requirements of the Chairman and Board.
Re-election: How do we ensure planned
and progressive refreshing of the Board?
Following a rigorous selection process and recommendation
by the Nominations Committee, Directors are appointed by the
Board. They must, however, submit themselves for election by
shareholders at the AGM following their appointment. Thereafter
our Articles of Association require all Directors to stand for
re-election at least every three years. In addition, we have a policy
that any Non-Executive Director, including our Chairman, having
been in post for nine years or more, or who is non-independent
for any reason, is subject to annual re-election. The performance
of each Director is considered as part of the Board evaluation,
before recommending such election or re-election. Following
this evaluation the Board recommends that Dr K M Burnett,
7
Mr J-D Comolli, Mr R Dyrbus, Mr C F Knott and Mr I J G Napier
stand for re-election at our 2010 AGM.
In order to facilitate smooth Board refreshment our Nominations
Committee regularly reviews the composition, skill set and balance
of our Board, together with the length of service of each Director
and thereby identifies the skills required of future directors.
B. Remuneration
The level and make-up of remuneration:
What is our approach to remuneration and
how do we link it to performance?
We ensure that our remuneration policy drives our employees
to enhance our performance by focusing remuneration towards
long-term performance and providing employees with the
opportunity to participate in our bonus arrangements and share
plans. Our overall policy is to provide remuneration at the median
level of our comparator group and provide executives with the
opportunity to earn upper quartile total compensation on
achievement of superior business performance.
Our Remuneration Report, on pages 55 to 70, approved by our
Remuneration Committee and Board, outlines our remuneration
strategy and policy and its links to our key performance indicators.
The Report details the Committee’s activities over the financial
year and contains full details of Directors’ emoluments.
We evaluated the performance of the Committee as part of the
Board performance evaluation process described above.
Procedure: What is our formal
procedure for developing policy on
executive remuneration?
Our Remuneration Committee, which comprises solely
independent Non-Executive Directors, operates under clear terms
of reference and is responsible for developing policy on executive
remuneration and overseeing our overall remuneration policy. Full
details of our procedure for developing remuneration policy and
its links to strategy and risk management are given in our
Remuneration Report on pages 55 to 70.
Our Chairman, Mr I J G Napier, will, at our AGM in 2010, have
served for nine years concurrently with two Executive Directors.
To ensure we continue to comply with best practice, specifically
that the independence of the Committee is maintained, he
stepped down from the Remuneration Committee at its meeting
in September 2009. Mr Napier will only attend future meetings
by invitation.

C. Accountability and audit
Financial reporting: How do we
ensure we present a clear and balanced
assessment of the Company’s position?
Our Board members recognise their responsibilities to ensure that
the statutory requirements to deliver balanced and understandable
assessments of the Company’s position are met. The Board is
satisfied that these responsibilities are met by using the financial
systems and applying the regulations described below, supported
by our system of internal control.
This was achieved by:
– using an appropriate system of accounting records, capable
of operating with reasonable accuracy and in compliance with
local and international financial and legal reporting
requirements. The basis used to prepare our Group financial
statements is International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. Our parent
company financial statements and our Directors’ Remuneration
Report are prepared in accordance with applicable law and
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Standards;
– using IFRSs to ensure a true and fair view of the state of affairs
of the Group is given, including our profit or loss for the period;
– deploying appropriate accounting policies within the framework
of IFRSs and ensuring these are consistently applied;
– making judgements and preparing estimates that are
reasonable and prudent;
– operating within the guidelines of all the disclosure advice
provided by UK and international statute;
– disclosing the business is a going concern;
– maintaining robust assurance processes and controls over our
financial reporting procedures, including Disclosure Committee
and Board review; and
– extending these principles to half yearly reports and other
reports in the public domain.
Internal control: What does our
Board do to maintain a sound system
of internal control?
Overview
Several ongoing activities, which satisfy the requirements of the
Code, reassure our Board that a sound and robust system of
internal control exists throughout our Group.
2
1
The Board recognises that we operate in an environment with
some unavoidable risks (see pages 16 and 17) and undertakes to
ensure these risks are properly understood and suitably managed,
either directly or by exercising oversight of the internal control
framework detailed below. The analysis of risk and oversight of
the resulting internal control measures taken to mitigate the effects
of such risks are essential in enabling the Board to discharge its
responsibilities to safeguard shareholders’ investments, protect
our assets and provide reliable financial information. However,
given the size and complexity of the Group such systems can
provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance of meeting
our internal control objectives as they manage rather than
eliminate risk. They can, therefore, only provide reasonable and
not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Control Environment
The Board has established a robust control environment, the key
features of which are:
– the terms of reference of the Board, including the matters on
which only the Board can decide, and each of the committees
it has established (see page 46);
– establishing an appropriate organisational structure with clear,
appropriate and documented delegation of authority from the
Board to the Chief Executive’s Committee and executive
management (see page 46);
– maintaining our Corporate Documents which set out risk
management and behavioural standards for our operations
worldwide and provide a method for employees to raise
matters of genuine concern (see page 46);
– The Risk Co-ordination Committee and Risk Assessment
Summaries detailing the risk and risk mitigation identified
by each area of the business (see page 46);
– Our year end certification processes (see page 46);
– Internal Control Questionnaires detailing the existing control
processes within each area of the business (see page 46);
– Group Finance who manage our financial reporting processes
(see page 47);
– The Disclosure Committee who review all our major financial
disclosures (see page 47);
– Group Compliance who monitor and review our internal
controls (see page 47); and
– Remuneration linked to long-term performance to discourage
excessive risk taking.

Terms of Reference
The Board, which operates within clearly defined terms of reference,
reserves certain matters for its own consideration and decision. It
has established appropriate committees which also operate within
clearly defined terms of reference to oversee our control activities.
These committees include an Audit Committee, Disclosure Committee
and Risk Co-ordination Committee. Our Board and Committee
processes, together with those embedded in the business, are
fundamental to the effectiveness of our internal control measures
and the delivery of the appropriate degree of control.
Organisational Structure
The Board regularly reviews the Group’s organisational structure
to seek to ensure that clearly defined lines of responsibility with
appropriate delegation of authority and segregation of duties exist,
with personnel of the necessary calibre in place to fulfil their roles.
The aim of such delegated authority is that decisions, significant
either because of their value or impact on other parts of the
Group, are taken at an appropriate level as defined within the
Board’s terms of reference and our Corporate Documents.
Corporate Documents
The Board has established a framework of policies and procedures
with which employees are expected to comply. These cover key
issues such as acceptable business practices, authorisation levels,
segregation of duties, ethical compliance matters and legislation,
physical and data security as well as regulatory, governance and
health, safety and environmental issues.
Our framework of control documents includes our Code of
Conduct, policy documents and supporting guidance and
instruction. These documents, revised and updated during 2009,
set out the corporate standards which we strive to achieve
regardless of local regulations.
Following a review of our framework of control documents by
a cross-functional project team, a new corporate documents
intranet site has been created in order to provide improved clarity
on the purpose of this framework and how the various documents
are connected, maintained and used by the business.
The next phase of this ongoing review project will be the roll-out
of enhanced guidance and training for our revised and updated
control document framework. This will further support our
employees regarding the behaviour that is expected of them
and particularly in respect of their business decisions.
In order to further improve this framework so that it continues to
provide the appropriate control guidance for the enlarged Group,
our Group Code of Conduct is being reviewed. It is planned that
the revised Code of Conduct will be rolled-out in 2010, with
appropriate support and training. It is also anticipated that
the Code of Conduct will be made available on our corporate
website www.imperial-tobacco.com.
There are well defined procedures for appraisal, approval,
control and review of capital and strategic expenditure
including acquisitions.
The Board regularly reviews the Group’s Treasury, Tax and
Occupational, Health, Safety and Environmental policies. The
Group’s Treasury function operates within a well defined policy
and framework designed to manage the Group’s financing and
liquidity arrangements and to manage its exposure to, among
other treasury risks, interest rate and foreign exchange risks.
Our public interest disclosure (whistleblowing) policy encourages
employees to raise concerns about something seriously wrong
or dangerous on a confidential basis, such that proportionate and
independent investigation of such matters can be undertaken.
Risk Co-ordination Committee and Risk
Assessment Summaries
Overview
To supplement our existing risk management processes, the
Group has established a Risk Co-ordination Committee (RCC).
The RCC assists the Chief Executive’s Committee and the Audit
Committee in overseeing the management of material risk to the
Group. The RCC comprises senior managers representative of
the Group’s functions.
Responsibilities
The responsibilities of the RCC include:
– establishing a consistent methodology for identifying, assessing
and ranking material risks;
– the identification and assessment of existing measures in place
to manage and mitigate risks; and
–focusing and, where relevant, enhancing risk management and
mitigation activities, processes and procedures across the Group.
How the Risk Co-ordination Committee Met its
Responsibilities During the Year
During the course of the year the RCC has developed a
comprehensive risk register to identify, assess and monitor the
key risks we face and how they are mitigated and managed.
This top down approach is supported by a bottom up approach
requiring individual markets, factories, regions and functions
across the Group to produce annual risk assessment summaries
which are compared to the Group risk register. These ongoing
risk assessment summaries identify major areas of business risk,
including specific local risks and how they are mitigated and
managed by controls embedded in business processes.
Year End Certification
Our year end certification process requires each of our business
entities to confirm compliance with our policies, fraud prevention
processes and that risk mitigation controls have operated
effectively throughout the year. All our senior managers are
also required to certify that there have been no related party
transactions within their areas of control.
Internal Control Questionnaires
Each of our business entities is required to maintain a suite
of internal control questionnaires (ICQs) based on templates
produced by Group Compliance. Management of each business
entity is required to complete the templates detailing the internal
control processes in operation within that entity. These ICQs are
then reviewed by Group Compliance to ensure appropriate
controls are in place and have operated effectively.

The suite of ICQs comprises the most significant business
activities relevant to that entity (for example, the control of fixed
assets) and confirms that appropriate controls exist and the
processes supporting the controls are subject to frequent checks
to ensure they are effectively implemented.
These ICQs form the basis of periodic reviews by Group
Compliance who ensure the controls are operating in practice and
provide the appropriate protection for the business.
Group Finance
Our Group Finance Department manages our financial reporting
processes to ensure the information which enables our Board to
discharge its responsibilities, including the production of our Half
Year and Annual Accounts, is provided on a timely basis. It is
supported by a network of finance managers throughout the
Group who have the responsibility and accountability to provide
information in keeping with our policies, procedures and internal
best practices as documented internally in our Finance Manual.
Monitoring of our financial position is based on our strategic and
operational plans (the Plan) which we use to identify specific
targets and objectives.
Throughout the year we produce ‘latest estimates’ to predict the
likely year end position. The latest estimates are compared with
the Plan and enable us to monitor and check our performance
and, where appropriate, challenge sections of the business if
actual or anticipated performance varies from the Plan.
Overview
The Disclosure Committee comprises senior management from
across our business and meets as required to consider our major
financial disclosures.

Responsibilities
The responsibilities of the Committee include:
– ensuring appropriate procedures exist to confirm the accuracy,
completeness and timeliness of our public financial
disclosures; and
– assisting our Chief Executive and Finance Director (Senior
Officers) in determining all major financial disclosures are
accurate, complete and contain all necessary disclosures and,
therefore, provide a fair and accurate view of our performance.
How the Disclosure Committee Met its Responsibilities
During the Year
The Disclosure Committee reviews all major financial disclosures.
During the year these included Trading Updates, Interim
Management Statements, Half Year Report, Annual Report
and Accounts and bond issue documentation.
To meet its responsibilities when reviewing these major financial
disclosures the Committee members make enquiries into all
aspects of our business which, together with their business
knowledge, ensure disclosures are complete with no material
issues omitted. The Committee reports on its reviews to our
Senior Officers and where appropriate our Audit Committee.
The terms of reference of the Disclosure Committee were
reviewed during the year to ensure that they continued to
be appropriate.
Group Compliance
Our Group Compliance function monitors and measures the
mitigation of risks across the Group. During the course of each
year it undertakes targeted scheduled and ad hoc reviews
throughout our businesses. The reviews are based on our Internal
Control Questionnaires. Each review results in a report to the
management of the business entity identifying any potential
control weaknesses which the business entity is responsible for
remediating. The most significant potential weaknesses are also
elevated to the Chief Executive’s Committee to monitor the
remediation proposed and undertaken by management of the
business entity. At the year end Group Compliance also conducts
a review of risk assessments submitted by all markets, factories,
regions and functions across the Group and obtains certificates
of confirmation from local management teams that appropriate
internal controls and processes have been operating within their
businesses throughout the year.
To support the Audit Committee and the Board in assessing the
effectiveness of internal controls, Group Compliance formally
reports to the Audit Committee on the outcome of its ongoing
activities, including its programme of compliance reviews and any,
more general, business reviews. This process ensures that the

Audit Committee remains satisfied that the Group’s exposure to
major business risks is minimised and the levels of retained risk
are acceptable. Group Compliance has a programme of reviews
covering all our business entities on an annual, three or five yearly
cycle dependent on materiality and perceived risk.
The above processes, together with reports from Group
Compliance, enable the Board, either directly or through the
Audit Committee, to regularly review the effectiveness of the
key procedures which have been established to provide
internal controls.
The Board confirms that an ongoing process for identifying,
evaluating and managing the Group’s significant risks operated
throughout the year and up to the date of the approval of this
Annual Report and Accounts in accordance with the requirements
of the Code and Turnbull guidance.
Audit Committee and Auditors: How do
we formally apply financial reporting and
internal control principles?
Overview
The Audit Committee oversees our financial reporting and internal
controls and provides a formal reporting link with our Auditors.
Structure
The Audit Committee comprises five Independent Non-Executive
Directors. In line with the Code and our Audit Committee’s terms
of reference, available on our website www.imperial-tobacco.com,
it is a requirement that at least one Committee member is a
financial expert. Messrs M D Williamson and C F Knott are both
qualified accountants and, therefore, meet this requirement.
The Finance Director, the Director of Accounting, Forecasting
& Tax, the Head of Group Compliance, the Deputy Company
Secretary and other financial managers are invited to attend each
meeting of the Committee. The Head of Group Compliance meets
formally with the Committee without any Executive Director or
other manager being present at each Committee meeting.
To provide a direct line of communication between our Auditors
and Non-Executive Directors, our Auditors attend each Committee
meeting and have the opportunity to meet Committee members
without any Executive Director or other manager present.
The performance of the Committee was evaluated as part of the
Board performance evaluation process.
How the Audit Committee Met its Responsibilities During
the Year
During the year and up to the date of approval of this Annual
Report and Accounts, our Audit Committee achieved its
responsibilities by working with a structured agenda of matters
focused to coincide with key events of our financial reporting
cycle, together with standing items that the Committee is required

to consider at each meeting. The Audit Committee met its
responsibilities by:
– approving our accounting policies;
– monitoring and reviewing the integrity of our financial statements
and any announcements or judgements they contain including
our Half Year Report and Annual Report and Accounts and
recommending that these be approved by our Board;
– receiving reports from, and questioning, members of Group
Compliance, Group Finance and other functions. This provides
the Committee with the information required to oversee our
systems of internal control over financial reporting, overall
internal control policies, corporate governance procedures,
the system of risk management and to assess the review and
mitigation of associated risks;
– reviewing the Auditors’ presentation of their proposed audit
plan, fee proposal, and confirmation of their independence.
This, together with management’s assessment of the Auditors’
effectiveness and independence, allows the Committee to
establish the scope, effectiveness, independence and
objectivity of our Auditors and recommend their re-appointment
to the Board;
– receiving and, after due consideration, approving Group
Compliance’s proposed work plan and compliance programme.
Reports from Group Compliance are then used to monitor
the performance and effectiveness of controls operating
throughout the business;
– ensuring communication of our public interest disclosure policy
by receiving reports of its distribution through our non-financial
reporting system;
– consideration of management’s report that there were no
material related party matters; and
– consideration of the accounting treatment relating to ongoing
enquiries detailed on pages 43 and 44.
Going Concern
In order to satisfy themselves that we have adequate resources
for the future, the Committee and subsequently the Board
reviewed the Group’s committed funding and liquidity positions
and its proven ability to generate cash from trading activities.
Our performance, as described in this Report, our future plans
and the risks we face, see pages 16 and 17, were also reviewed.
These reviews provided the Committee with the confidence to
recommend to the Board that the Group and Company, have
adequate resources to meet their operational needs for the
foreseeable future. For this reason the Board continues to adopt
the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Auditor Independence Policy
In order to ensure the independence and objectivity of
our Auditors we maintain and regularly review our Auditor
Independence Policy. This policy provides clear definitions of
services that our Auditors can and cannot provide. Our Auditors
may only provide non-audit services where those services do not
conflict with their independence, for example tax compliance
work. It also establishes a formal authorisation process, including
the tendering for non-audit services expected to generate fees in
excess of £100,000 and pre-approval by the Audit Committee for
allowable non-audit work that they may perform. Our policy also
establishes guidelines for the recruitment of employees or former
employees of our Auditors and for the recruitment of our
employees by the Auditors.
To ensure compliance with this policy our Audit Committee carried
out two reviews during the year of the remuneration received by
our Auditors for audit services, audit-related services and non-audit
work. These reviews ensure a balance of objectivity, value for
money and compliance with this policy. The outcome of these IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2009 49
reviews was not only that performance of the relevant non-audit
work by our Auditors was the most cost-effective way of conducting
our business but also that no conflicts of interest existed between
such audit and non-audit work. The fees for such non-audit
work within the financial year were principally related to tax
advisory work.
These reviews enabled the Audit Committee to confirm that
we continue to receive an efficient, effective and independent
auditservice.
Statement of Auditors’ Responsibilities
Our statutory Auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , are
responsible for forming an independent opinion on the financial
statements of the Group and on the financial statements of the
Company as presented by the Directors, on other elements
of the Annual Report and Accounts as required by legislation
or regulation and for reporting their opinion to members (page 73).
D. Relations with shareholders
Dialogue with institutional
shareholders: How does our Board
ensure that a satisfactory dialogue
with shareholders takes place?
Dialogue with our shareholders is given the highest priority. During
the year we appointed a Director of Investor Communications to
help further ensure the Group meets its commitment to keep
shareholders fully informed.
Communication with Shareholders
The primary means of communication with shareholders is via
the Annual Report and Accounts and Half Year Reports and our
corporate website. In addition, we provide Interim Management
Statements and Trading Updates. We have attended numerous
conferences, where we presented various aspects of the business
to shareholders and potential shareholders. In addition, our
Executive Directors and investor relations team regularly meet with
investors after results announcements, as part of conferences and
on an ad hoc basis and provide a point of focus for investors who
wish to raise queries or concerns.
Our Chairman met with a number of key shareholders during
the year and our Senior Independent Non-Executive Director
is also available to meet key investors. All Directors made
themselves available to meet shareholders at our AGM after the
formal business of the meeting. Together the Chairman, Chief
Executive, Finance Director, Chief Operating Officer and Director
of Investor Communications ensure the Board is fully briefed on
shareholders’ views such that any issues or concerns are fully
understood and considered by the Board.
We regularly meet with shareholder representative bodies on
significant issues of interest and meet with Corporate Governance

PROACTIVELY ENGAGING SHAREHOLDERS
In July 2009 a number of key investors and analysts attended a
three day visit to our Moroccan operations where they had the
opportunity to meet members of the senior management and
Board. Topics discussed included Group strategy, the USA
cigarette business, the Africa & Middle East business and the
Group’s manufacturing operations. All the presentations are
available on the Group’s website.

representatives of investors when requested. Through an external
consultancy we annually perform a perception study of institutional
investors’ views of our business.
Constructive use of the AGM:
How does the Board effectively use the
AGM to engage with investors?
We took full advantage of the provisions of the Companies
Act 2006, allowing us to communicate with our shareholders
electronically. As a result, the primary means of communication
with the majority of our shareholders, who have not requested
paper copies of our documentation, is through our corporate
website www.imperial-tobacco.com. To ensure our shareholders
have time to consider our Annual Report and Accounts and
Notice of the AGM and lodge their proxy votes they were mailed
more than 20 working days prior to the meeting.
We offer all our shareholders the choice of submitting proxy votes
either electronically or in paper format. We also offer them the
ability to abstain.
In addition, our AGM provides a valuable opportunity for
shareholders to meet and question our Directors. At the AGM
our Chairman and Chief Executive give presentations on our
performance and current business activities.
To ensure compliance with the Code, separate resolutions are
proposed on each discrete subject and all resolutions are put to
a poll. The number of proxy votes for, against and withheld for
each resolution are displayed at the meeting. The final results are
published through a Regulatory Information Service and on our
website following the AGM.
At our 2009 AGM we received votes representing approximately
74 per cent of our issued share capital (excluding shares held
in treasury).
Full details of our AGM to be held on Tuesday 2 February 2010,
together with explanations of the resolutions to be proposed,
are contained in the Notice of Meeting available on our website
www.imperial-tobacco.com and posted with this Report.

note 4 to the accounts and in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
Significant Agreements That Take Effect, Alter or
Terminate on Change of Control
The following agreements, which are summarised below, are
those which we consider to be significant to the Group as a whole
and which contain provisions giving the other party a specific right
to terminate them if we are subject to a change of control following
a takeover bid.
Some companies within the Group entered into a credit facilities
agreement (the Agreement) on 18 July 2007 under which certain
banks and financial institutions (the Lenders) made available to
Imperial Tobacco Finance PLC and Imperial Tobacco Enterprise
Finance Limited committed and uncommitted credit facilities. The
Agreement provides that, unless the Lenders otherwise agree, if
any person or group of associated persons acquires the right to
exercise more than 50 per cent of the votes at a general meeting
of the Company, Imperial Tobacco Finance PLC and Imperial
Tobacco Enterprise Finance Limited must repay each loan utilised
by them under the Agreement and the total commitments under
the Agreement will be immediately cancelled.
Some companies within the Group entered into a letter of credit
facility agreement (the Letter of Credit) dated 12 December 2007
under which the Lenders made available to Imperial Tobacco
Limited a Letter of Credit. The Letter of Credit provides that,
unless the Lenders agree, if any person or group of associated
persons acquires the right to exercise more than 50 per cent of
1849 Black Sun ImpTob p38_p54:Layout 1 30/11/09  21:32  Page 50 IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2009 51
the votes at a general meeting of the Company, Imperial Tobacco
Limited must repay the letter of credit utilised by it under the Letter
of Credit and the total commitments under the Letter of Credit will
be immediately cancelled.
Imperial Tobacco Finance PLC (the Issuer) has issued bonds
under the €10,000,000,000 Debt Issuance Programme (as noted
below). The Company acted as guarantor. The final terms of this
series of notes contain change of control provisions under which
the holder of each note will, subject to any earlier exercise by
the Issuer of a tax call, have the option to require the Issuer
to redeem or, at the Issuer’s option, purchase that note at its
nominal value if: (a) any person, persons acting in concert or on
behalf of any such person(s) becomes interested in: (i) more than
50 per cent of the issued or allotted ordinary share capital of the
Company; or (ii) such number of shares in the capital of the
Company carrying more than 50 per cent of the voting rights
normally exercisable at a general meeting of the Company; and
(b) as a result of the change of control, there is either: (i) a reduction
to a non-investment grade rating or withdrawal of the investment
grade rating of the notes which is not raised again; reinstated to
or replaced by an investment grade rating during the change of
control period specified in the final terms; or (ii) to the extent that
the notes are not rated at the time of the change of control, the
Issuer fails to obtain an investment grade credit rating of the
notes within the change of control period as a result of the
change of control.
The bonds issued in such manner are as follows:
– 15 September 2008 £600,000,000 8.125 per cent guaranteed

Charitable and Political Donations
We have continued to support the communities in which we
operate by donating £3.3 million (2008: £3.0 million) to charitable
causes of which £1.9 million (2008: £0.2 million) was in respect
of the UK through the Charities Aid Foundation.
No political donations were made by Imperial Tobacco Group
to EU political parties, organisations or candidates (2008: Nil).
Creditor Payment Policy
Our current policy concerning the payment of the majority of our
trade creditors is to follow the CBI’s Prompt Payers Code (copies
are available from the CBI, Centre Point, 103 New Oxford Street,
London WC1A 1DU). For other suppliers, our policy is to:
– agree the terms of payment with those suppliers when
agreeing the terms of each transaction;
– ensure that those suppliers are made aware of the terms of
payment by inclusion of the relevant terms in contracts; and
– pay in accordance with our contractual and other
legal obligations.
This policy applies to all payments to creditors for revenue
and capital supplies of goods and services without exception.
Wherever possible UK subsidiaries follow the same policy and
international subsidiaries are encouraged to adopt similar policies
by applying local best practices.
To demonstrate our commitment to our creditor payment policy,
during the year we have become an approved signatory of the
Prompt Payment Code sponsored by the UK Department for
Business Enterprise & Regulatory Reform.
The amount of trade creditors outstanding as at 30 September 2009
was equivalent to 44 days (2008: 46 days) of trade purchases.
Research and Development
We recognise the importance of investing in research and
development, which brings innovative improvements to the
Group, both in the products supplied to the consumer and in
production and marketing techniques.
Auditors and Disclosure of Information to Auditors
Each of the Directors in office at the date of approval of this
Annual Report and Accounts confirms that:
– so far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit information
(that is information needed by the Company’s Auditors in
connection with preparing their report) of which the Company’s
Auditors are unaware; and
– they have each taken all the steps that he/she ought to have
taken as a Director in order to make himself/herself aware
of any relevant audit information and to establish that the
Company’s Auditors are aware of that information.
A resolution to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as
Auditors to the Company will be proposed at the AGM.

Directors’ Report: Other Information continued
52 IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2009
Disclosure and Transparency Rules
The Directors confirm that to the best of their knowledge:
– the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or
loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the
consolidation taken as a whole; and
– the Business Review on pages 6 to 32 includes a fair review
of the development and performance of the business and the
position of the Company and the undertakings included in the
consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description
of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report,
the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Group and the parent
Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors
have elected to prepare the Group financial statements in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, and the parent
Company financial statements in accordance with United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United
Kingdom Accounting Standards and Applicable Law). Under
company law the Directors must not approve the financial
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair
view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of
the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these
financial statements, the Directors are required to:
– select suitable accounting policies and then apply
them consistently;
– make judgements and accounting estimates that are
reasonable and prudent;
– state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed,
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained
in the Group and parent company financial statements
respectively; and
– prepare the financial statements on going concern basis unless
it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue
in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time
the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable
them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’
Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006
and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of
the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding
the assets of the Company and the Group and hence taking
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and
other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity
of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on
pages 36 and 37 confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
– the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of
the group; and
– the Directors’ Report includes a fair review of the development
and performance of the business and the position of the
Group, together with a description of the principal risks and
uncertainties that it faces.
Employees
Our employees are key to our ongoing success. Our employment
policies aim to attract the very best people. By applying universally
accepted standards for human rights we ensure they are treated
with fairness, dignity and respect. This is reinforced through
offering equal opportunities and fair consideration to applications
for employment, career development and promotion, without
having regard to an employee’s gender, race, religion, age or
disability. These policies also cover the continuation of employment
and appropriate training for employees who become disabled
during their employment.
To ensure employees can share in our success we offer
competitive pay and benefit packages linked, wherever possible,
to performance. Employees are encouraged to build a stake in
the Company through ownership of shares, with a number of
employee share plans offered during the year.
We encourage all areas of our business to keep employees
informed of the financial and economic factors affecting our
performance. We brief employee representatives on pan-European
issues through a European Employee Forum and the Altadis
European Works Council.
Pension Fund
Our main pension fund, the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund, is
not controlled by the Board but by a trustee company, the board
of which consists of five directors nominated by the Company;
one director chosen by employees and two by current and
1849 Black Sun ImpTob p38_p54:Layout 1 30/11/09  21:32  Page 52 IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2009 53
deferred pensioners. This trustee company looks after the
assets of the pension fund, which are held separately from those
of the Group and are managed by independent fund managers.
The pension fund assets can only be used in accordance with
the fund’s rules and for no other purpose. Further details are
contained in our Remuneration Report on pages 55 and 70.
Business Review
A review of the Group’s activities and future developments is
included in the Business Review section on pages 6 to 32. This
review fulfils the requirements of the Business Review contained
in section 417 of the Companies Act 2006, including the financial
performance during the year on pages 8 to 11, key performance
indicators on pages 14 and 15 and a description of the principal
risks and uncertainties facing the Group on pages 16 and 17.
The purpose of the Annual Report and Accounts is to provide
information to the shareholders of Imperial Tobacco Group PLC.
The Company, its Directors, employees, agents and advisers do
not accept or assume responsibility to any other person to whom
this document is shown or into whose hands it may come and
any such responsibility or liability is expressly disclaimed. The
Annual Report and Accounts contain certain forward-looking
statements with respect to the operations, performance and
Financial condition of the Company and the Imperial Tobacco
Group as a whole. By their nature, these statements involve
uncertainties since future events and circumstances can cause
actual results to differ materially from those anticipated and
no reliance should be placed on them. The forward-looking
statements reflect knowledge and information available at the
date of preparation of this Annual Report and Accounts and
the Company undertakes no obligation to update these forward-
looking statements. Nothing in this Annual Report and Accounts
should be construed as a profit forecast.
The principal operating subsidiaries within the Group are shown
on pages 131 and 132.
Insurance
We have purchased and, throughout the year, maintained
appropriate insurance cover in respect of Directors’ and Officers’
liabilities. The Company has also entered into qualifying third
party indemnity arrangements for the benefit of all its Directors,
in a form and scope which comply with the requirements of the
Companies Act 2006 and the transitional arrangements in respect
of the Companies Act 1985. These indemnities were in force
throughout the year and up to the date of this Report.
Update on Ongoing Enquiries
German Investigations
Certain investigations were initiated by German authorities in
January 2003 into alleged foreign trading and related violations
by a number of people, including Reemtsma employees, during
a period prior to its acquisition by Imperial Tobacco Group in
May 2002. A Board Committee established in 2003 remains
in place to monitor the progress of the investigations and the
Group’s responses on behalf of the Board.
In the course of 2005, parts of the investigations into certain of
the individuals were terminated on terms agreed by the individuals
with the authorities and settlement was made of any duty payable
as a result of certain of the activities being investigated at no cost
to the Imperial Tobacco Group. In 2006 and 2007, investigations
against some of the other individuals were terminated for lack
of evidence.
In September 2006, charges relating to smuggling were brought
in connection with one of the investigations against 18 individuals,
one of whom is a former Reemtsma employee. In October 2008,
the German court agreed to open trial in relation to these charges,
but no hearing date has been set.
In November 2006, in connection with a separate investigation,
charges relating to violations of the German foreign trade act
were brought against four other former Reemtsma employees.
The German court has not yet made a decision as to whether to
open trial in relation to these charges. The authorities have applied
for financial penalties to be imposed on Reemtsma in relation to
these latter charges. Such penalties could be imposed if the
former employees who have been charged are ultimately found
to have committed offences. In those circumstances, the Imperial
Tobacco Group would seek recovery of any losses under
arrangements made on the acquisition of the business.
Office of Fair Trading
As previously reported, in October 2003 the UK Office of Fair
Trading (OFT) commenced an investigation under the Competition
Act 1998 into the operation of the UK tobacco supply chain.
On 24 April 2008, the OFT issued a Statement of Objections
(SO) which set out the OFT’s allegations against tobacco
manufacturers, Imperial Tobacco Group and Gallaher, and 11
retailers. The OFT alleges that these tobacco manufacturers and
retailers variously engaged in one or more unlawful practices in
relation to retail prices for some or all of a number of tobacco
products in breach of Chapter I of the Competition Act 1998.
Following the issue of the SO, the OFT invited recipients of the
SO to enter into settlement discussions on a ‘without prejudice’
basis to reach ‘early resolution agreements’ with the OFT.
On 11 July 2008, the OFT announced that six of the parties
subject to the SO had reached early resolution agreements with
the OFT, agreeing to pay a combined figure of some £132.3
million if all leniency and early resolution discounts are taken into
account. Other than Imperial Tobacco Group, the parties which
have also not settled with the OFT and are therefore contesting
the OFT’s allegations, are the Co-operative Group, Morrisons
(including Safeway), Shell and Tesco.
1849 Black Sun ImpTob p38_p54:Layout 1 30/11/09  21:32  Page 53 DIRECTORS’ REPORT: GOVERNANCE
Directors’ Report: Other Information continued
54 IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2009
Imperial Tobacco Group’s detailed written response to the SO was
submitted to the OFT on 15 August 2008 and Imperial Tobacco’s
representatives made submissions to the OFT in defence of the
allegations at an oral hearing on 3 December 2008.
The OFT indicated in a letter dated 12 October 2009, that it
currently intends to notify the parties of its ‘final’ decision in the
investigation in the first quarter of 2010. We have no indication
of whether that will be an infringement decision, a file closure
decision or some other form of decision.
If the OFT proceeds to an infringement decision, it may impose a
fine. The maximum amount of any fine, under the statutory regime
we believe that the OFT will apply, is 10 per cent of a company’s
UK turnover for up to three years (although the actual amount may
be less). By way of example, in the three years to 30 September
2003, Imperial Tobacco Group’s aggregate net UK turnover was
£2,215 million. The applicable turnover on which the amount of
a fine is based expressly excludes VAT and other taxes directly
related to turnover, which Imperial Tobacco Group has been
advised would also exclude duty. In addition, if the OFT were to
make an infringement finding, it could issue orders prohibiting that
activity in the future, whilst the infringing company might face the
prospect of damages actions from third parties. If the OFT were
to make an infringement decision, Imperial Tobacco Group would
be able to appeal the OFT’s decision to the Competition Appeal
Tribunal, and ultimately, on a point of law to the Court of Appeal.
Update on Tobacco-Related Litigation
We are not facing any tobacco-related litigation in the UK. In the
Republic of Ireland, the number of tobacco-related claims has
fallen from 307 in 1997, to 11. Ten of these claims are subject
to dismissal motions. The other claim is inactive. The dismissal
motion in respect of one claimant was heard by the Dublin High
Court in 2006. In April 2007, the court ruled that this claim should
be dismissed. This decision has been appealed and the dismissal
motions in respect of the nine other active claims have been stayed
pending the appeal. No date has been set for the appeal hearing.
Following our acquisition of Altadis in January 2008, we are
currently facing two claims in Spain brought on behalf of the
Regional Government of Andalucia each arising out of the same
allegations. The first claim has been dismissed and an appeal has
been rejected by the Spanish Supreme Court. The Regional
Government could, theoretically, make a further appeal to the
Supreme Court. The second claim was filed in May 2009 and
preliminary objections were filed by Altadis and the other tobacco
company defendants in September 2009. We are not facing any
claims in France. Following our acquisition of Logista in May 2008,
we are currently facing two claims in Italy. One is at an initial stage
and the other has been dismissed but appealed.
We understand that a claim was filed against us (and other
tobacco companies) in Bulgaria in March 2008 but we have not
yet been formally served with any court documents. We further
understand that in December 2008, the Sofia City Court partially
rejected the claim and the claimant has appealed this decision
to the Supreme Court of Cassation.
In September 2009 an individual claim was brought against us
(and others) in Turkey. We filed a statement of defence at a
preliminary hearing on 3 November 2009.
Following our acquisition of Commonwealth Brands in April 2007,
we are currently facing one claim brought by an individual in the
United States. A motion for summary judgment was filed by
Commonwealth Brands in October 2005 and remains pending.
In Australia, a claim was filed in January 2009 against Imperial
Tobacco Australia Limited and other tobacco companies. The
claim was discontinued in October 2009.
We understand that the Saudi Ministry of Health has issued
legal proceedings against distributors for international tobacco
companies to recover the alleged costs of providing medical care
to individuals. No Imperial Tobacco Group company has been
served with any court documents in relation to this claim.
To date, no action has been successful or settled in favour of any
claimant in any tobacco-related litigation against Imperial Tobacco
or any of its subsidiaries. Imperial Tobacco has been advised by
its lawyers that it has meritorious defences to the legal proceedings
in which damages are sought for alleged tobacco-related health
effects. We will continue to vigorously contest all such litigation
against us.

IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2009 55
Introduction
We have prepared this Report in accordance with the Companies
Act 2006, Statutory Instrument 2008/410 The Large and
Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports)
Regulations 2008 (the Regulations) and to meet the requirements
of the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority. We describe
how the principles of good governance relating to directors’
remuneration set out in the Combined Code on Corporate
Governance (the Code) are applied in practice.
The Regulations require our Auditors to report to shareholders
on the audited information within this Report and to state whether,
in their opinion, those parts of the Report have been prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 2006. The Auditors’ opinion
is set out on page 73 and we have clearly marked the audited
sections of the Report.
This Report covers the following:
the Committee’s objectives, membership and main activities
in 2009;
Directors’ emoluments and share interests;
a review of Imperial Tobacco Group’s remuneration policy
and practice;
service agreements;

Responsibilities
The responsibilities of the Committee include:
– determination of the Remuneration Policy for Executive
Directors and members of the Chief Executive’s Committee;
– recommendations to the Board in respect of the
Chairman’s remuneration;
– determination of targets for performance related pay elements;
– policy for Directors’ pensions and contracts;
– oversight of the overall policy for senior
management remuneration;
– oversight of disclosures in the Remuneration Report; and
– oversight of the Group’s employee share plans.
Overview
The Group’s remuneration policy is intended to attract and
retain high quality employees throughout the organisation,
encourage loyalty and motivate them to achieve a high level
of corporate performance in an increasingly competitive and
international environment.
Performance related rewards reflect the business performance
delivered by the Board and senior management in a year of
significant achievement that included the integration of our
Altadis acquisition and growth in mature and emerging markets.
For the financial year ending 30 September 2010 the overall
structure of the Group’s remuneration policy will remain
unchanged. However, to further motivate the achievement
of strategic objectives the potential maximum bonus has been
increased subject to the achievement of stretching, measurable
strategic objectives as discussed below.

The Committee’s Objectives,
Membership and Main Activities
The Remuneration Committee operates under clear written
terms of reference, which can be found on our website
www.imperial-tobacco.com. The Remuneration Committee
formally confirms that throughout the year it has complied with
the governance rules and best practice provisions relating to
remuneration as set out in section 1 of the Code.
The Committee’s key objectives are to:
– ensure the Group’s remuneration arrangements align with
our values, support our corporate strategy and enhance
performance as measured by our key performance indicators
(KPIs), see pages 14 and 15;
– maintain a competitive remuneration package appropriate to
the business environment in the countries in which we operate
so we can attract, develop, retain and motivate a high quality
pool of talented employees at all levels, whilst ensuring a clear
link between reward and performance;
– ensure that the remuneration policy motivates employees at all
levels to enhance our performance without encouraging them
to take undue risks; and
– align senior executives’ remuneration with the interests of
shareholders and other stakeholders, including customers
and employees.
Membership
The Remuneration Committee, which met four times during
the year, comprises five independent Non-Executive Directors
together with the Company Chairman, Mr I J G Napier. Mr Napier
is specifically excluded from any matter concerning the details
of his own remuneration or conditions of service. The Committee
members have no personal financial interest in the matters
discussed other than as shareholders.
To reinforce the independence of the Committee, a standing item
at each meeting allows the members of the Committee to meet
without the Company Chairman, any Executive Director or other
manager being present. As Mr Napier is approaching the ninth
anniversary of his election to the Board, in line with corporate
governance best practice, he stepped down from the Committee
on 7 September 2009.
Advice and Support
The Committee is provided with the following internal and external
advice and support:
Internal
During the year Mr G Davis (Chief Executive) and Mr R Dyrbus
(Finance Director) were invited to attend Remuneration Committee
meetings to answer questions. Mr M R Phillips (Company Secretary)
also attended meetings as secretary to the Committee. They were
all specifically excluded from any matter concerning the details
of their own remuneration or conditions of service.
Mrs K A Turner (Group Human Resources Director), the Group
Compensation and Benefits Manager and the Deputy Company
Secretary also provided internal support and advice on market
and regulatory developments in remuneration practice and our
employee share plans.
External
To assist the Remuneration Committee in setting the remuneration
package for each Executive Director and member of the Chief
Executive’s Committee advice is provided by remuneration
consultants Hewitt New Bridge Street and Towers Perrin, both
of whom are engaged by the Committee as required. Both are
signatories to the draft Code of Conduct for Remuneration
Advisers. Neither provides any services to the Group other
than those explained below.
1 Hewitt New Bridge Street also reviews the Group’s remuneration
principles and practices against corporate governance best
practice and helps ensure adherence to the Group’s Executive
Directors’ Remuneration Policy.
Executive remuneration data provided by Towers Perrin and
Boardex was also used to assist in benchmarking to ensure the
consistent application of our executive Remuneration Policy.
To ensure Committee members are fully aware of new
developments and evolving remuneration best practice,
Hewitt New Bridge Street presented a review of developments
in UK corporate governance, focusing primarily on executive
pay governance.
Solicitors Allen & Overy LLP are retained by the Company and
provide legal advice on our employee share plans. Allen & Overy
LLP and Ashurst LLP also provide services to the Committee as
and when required. Both Allen & Overy LLP and Ashurst LLP
provide other legal services to the Group.
The Company has appointed Alithos Limited to undertake total
shareholder return (TSR) calculations and provide advice on all
TSR related matters, including advice in respect of the bespoke
comparator group. Alithos Limited provides no other services for
the Group.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , our Auditors, perform agreed upon
procedures on earnings per share (EPS) calculations used in our
employee share plans to assist the Committee in determining the
level of awards vesting.
Main Activities – How the Committee met its Objectives
The Board is ultimately accountable for executive remuneration
but delegates responsibility to the Remuneration Committee.
Our Remuneration Committee addressed the following main
issues during the year:
– recommending that our Remuneration Policy for Directors
remains unchanged;
– the annual review of the Chairman’s, Executive Directors’ and
Chief Executive’s Committee (CEC) members’ remuneration;
– reviewing the executive bonus arrangements and targets;
– reviewing CEC members’ contracts;
– overseeing Remuneration Policy for senior management and
employees and our employee share plans;
– undertaking the annual review of the Committee Terms
of Reference; and
– the disclosures in this Report.

A Review of Imperial Tobacco Group’s Remuneration Policy and Practice
Remuneration Strategy
We operate in a highly competitive, international environment. Our remuneration strategy is to ensure that the level of remuneration and
benefits offered attracts, develops, retains and motivates our talented employees at all levels across the Group, while ensuring a clear
link between reward and performance. We set out to provide competitive remuneration to all employees, appropriate to the business
environment in the countries in which we operate.
Our remuneration arrangements align with and support our corporate strategy. We continue to assign employees internationally
to achieve the optimum balance of experience within the Group and facilitate employee development. We have a cohesive reward
structure in place to ensure all our employees engage with our strategic goals and strive to achieve them.
We align the interests of shareholders and employees at all levels by giving our employees the opportunity to build a shareholding in
Imperial Tobacco Group through a number of employee share plans. This alignment is reinforced further through the Group’s executive
share retention policy discussed on page 67. Where possible our employees were offered participation in one or more employee share
plans during the year, with in excess of 31 per cent of eligible employees participating in one or more of those plans.
Executive Remuneration Policy
We consider it critical to align the remuneration package for Executive Directors and members of the Chief Executive’s Committee with
the Group’s strategy and risk. In designing and reviewing the executive remuneration policy we aim to attract and retain high quality
executives, and induce loyalty and motivate executives to achieve a high level of corporate performance in line with the best interests
of shareholders. We also recognise the need for the overall remuneration package not to be excessive, particularly given the current
economic climate.
Our executive remuneration policy combines short-term and long-term rewards focusing on, and significantly weighted towards,
performance related pay elements that take into account individual, functional and corporate performance. This focus ensures executive
remuneration supports our strategy by linking the major elements of remuneration to performance criteria linked to our KPIs. The main
components are base salary, annual bonus, share matching scheme (SMS), long term incentive plan (LTIP) and pension benefits.
We continue to set base salary at around the median level of the comparator group of companies, whilst providing the Executive
Directors and Chief Executive’s Committee members with the capacity to earn upper quartile total compensation on achievement of
superior business performance. Our comparator group of companies remains the FTSE 50, excluding companies in the financial and
pharmaceutical sectors, with reference to the FTSE 30, excluding companies in the financial and pharmaceutical sectors.
To ensure our remuneration policy is firmly linked to our strategy and risk management, Executive Directors are required to build a significant
stake in the Company through our share retention guidelines and the mandatory deferral of elements of annual bonus in the form of shares.
This link is further supported through the setting of bonus and other targets that reflect key business imperatives, for example earnings per
share and profit growth, total shareholder return, debt reduction and volume growth.

DIRECTORS’ INTERESTS IN ORDINARY SHARES (BENEFICIAL, FAMILY AND ANY CONNECTED PERSONS
INTERESTS) (AUDITED) DIRECTORS’ REPORT: BUSINESS REVIEW: GOVERNANCE
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
60 IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2009
Service Agreements
Executive Directors’ Service Agreements
The service agreements for Mr G Davis and Mr R Dyrbus were entered into at the time of the demerger of the Company from the
Hanson Group. The provisions dealing with compensation on termination following a change of control in their service agreements
reflect that. The service agreements for the other Executive Directors reflect the Company’s established policy that Executive Directors
have service agreements which are terminable on no more than one year’s notice and that there is no entitlement to the payment of a
predetermined amount on termination of employment in any circumstances.
There are no liquidated damages provisions for compensation on termination within Executive Directors’ service agreements, except
for those set out in the table below. The Executive Directors’ service agreements do contain payment in lieu of notice provisions but
these are at the Company’s sole discretion. We are unequivocally against rewards for failure. Apart from the limited respects referred
to above, the circumstances of the termination and an individual’s duty and opportunity to mitigate loss are taken into account in every
case. Our policy is to stop or reduce compensatory payments to former Directors to the extent that they receive remuneration from
other employment during the compensation period and that any such payments would be paid monthly in arrears.
Under the Rules of the LTIP and SMS outstanding awards vest on termination for certain reasons, including death, retirement,
redundancy, the business or company in which the participant is employed ceasing to be part of the Group or on a change of control.
Awards vest on a time-related pro rata basis and are subject to satisfaction of relevant performance criteria. If, however, the termination
of employment is for a reason other than one of those specified in the relevant rules, an individual’s full awards lapse.

Mr R Dyrbus 21 August 1996 Terminable on 52 weeks’ notice Payment of a liquidated sum calculated

Mr G L Blashill 28 October 2005 Terminable on 52 weeks’ notice No provisions
Mrs A J Cooper 1 July 2007 Terminable on 52 weeks’ notice No provisions
Policy in Respect of Remuneration from External Board Appointments
We recognise that external non-executive directorships are beneficial for both the Executive Director concerned and the Company. At the
discretion of the Board, Executive Directors are permitted to retain fees received in respect of any such non-executive directorship. Each
serving Executive Director is restricted to one external non-executive directorship and may not serve as the chairman of a FTSE 100 company.
The Executive Directors who held such appointments during the financial year were Mr G Davis, who serves on the Board of Wolseley
plc and received fees of £71,800, and Mrs A J Cooper, who serves on the Board of Inchcape PLC and received fees of £10,000.
Remuneration Policy for Non-Executive Directors
During the year, fees for Non-Executive Directors, and chairmanship fees in respect of the Remuneration and Audit Committees, were
reviewed by the Board as a whole. The review took into account market practice with reference to the comparator group on page 59.
The Chairman’s remuneration was determined by the Board following recommendation from the Remuneration Committee. The
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors were not permitted to take part in discussions relating to their own remuneration. With the
exception of reimbursement of expenses incurred in connection with their directorship of the Company, Non-Executive Directors
receive no other material pay or benefits. They are not eligible to participate in the Group’s employee share plans, annual bonus
schemes and are not eligible for pension scheme membership. During the year Mr Comolli, however, received pension payments
relating to his former executive position within the Altadis Group.
To align further the interests of the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors with those of shareholders, a proportion of their fees is applied
to purchase shares in the Company. These shares are held by a nominee during the term of their directorship. Up to the date of his
resignation Mr Bich elected to apply his entire Director’s fees, after statutory deductions, to the purchase of shares in the Company.
The Company’s Articles of Association enable the Board to set the remuneration of Directors within the limits set by shareholders.
The current aggregate limit is £2.0 million and the aggregate amount paid in the financial year was £1.1 million. Executive Directors
are remunerated in respect of their executive appointments, under the terms of their service contacts, and receive no additional fees
for serving as directors.
Following his retirement from the Board in January 2006, Mr S Huismans remains a member of Supervisory Boards within the
Reemtsma group. He was also appointed as a Non-Executive Director of Altadis, S.A. upon its acquisition by the Group until
5 November 2008. Mr S Huismans receives additional remuneration for fulfilling such non-executive roles.
Non-Executive Directors’ Letters of Appointment
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors do not have service agreements with the Company but the terms of their appointment are
recorded in letters of appointment which are available for viewing at our registered office during normal business hours and prior to and
at the AGM.
In line with our annual review policy the Chairman’s and Non-Executive Directors’ terms of appointment were reviewed and confirmed
by the Board on 2 February 2009. Under the terms of our Articles of Association Non-Executive Directors stand for election at the first
AGM following appointment and are subject to re-election by shareholders every three years. There are no provisions regarding notice
periods in their letters of appointment which state that the Chairman and Non-Executive Director will only receive payment until the
date their appointment ends and, therefore, no compensation is payable on termination. The letters of appointment detail the time
commitment expected of each Non-Executive Director.

Remuneration Practices 5 DIRECTORS’ REPORT: BUSINESS REVIEW: GOVERNANCE
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
62 IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2009
Base Salary
The Remuneration Committee reviews base salary annually following detailed consideration of a number of factors including individual
responsibilities, performance, market value of the relevant executive and external market data. In line with our Remuneration Policy
base salary is set within a range around the market median of the comparator group. Base salary is the only element of the package
used to determine pensionable earnings.
When setting base salary the Remuneration Committee is provided with external benchmarking data compiled by Towers Perrin. The
Committee is also provided with data in respect of the executive’s overall package so it can be benchmarked against the comparator
group. This data also enables the Committee to review the effect of any change in base pay on the executive’s overall package.
Annual base salary increases for Executive Directors, effective 1 October 2009, were three per cent. In reviewing base salaries, the
Committee considered the current economic environment, salary data in respect of the FTSE comparator group, the levels of 2009
base salary inflation for executives within the tobacco and consumer goods sectors and the levels of base salary increase for our
other employees.
Annual Bonus
For the financial year ended 30 September 2009 the potential maximum bonus was 125 per cent of base salary for the Chief Executive
and Finance Director and 100 per cent for other Executive Directors. The performance targets for the year were based on a matrix
comprising adjusted earnings per share (EPS) and debt, together with stringent, quantifiable strategic objectives including volume
growth and criteria related to delivery of synergies from the Altadis integration. They are not disclosed as they are considered to be
commercially confidential.
During the year we delivered adjusted EPS of 161.8 pence up 18 per cent. In addition, the strategic targets were met in part resulting
in bonuses, as detailed in the table on page 58, being awarded to the Executive Directors. These payments represent 106.5 per cent
of the Chief Executive’s and Finance Director’s base salary and 84.8 per cent in respect of the other Executive Directors. Cash bonuses
were also earned by other senior managers for achieving relevant performance targets for the financial year.
Any bonus earned up to 100 per cent of base salary for the Chief Executive and Finance Director and 75 per cent for other Executive
Directors is paid in cash and is eligible for investment into the Share Matching Scheme as detailed below. Any bonus payable in excess
of this level is paid in ordinary shares which the Director is required to retain for a minimum of three years. These ordinary shares are
not eligible for investment in the Share Matching Scheme.
For the financial year ending 30 September 2010, the Committee has determined that the maximum annual bonus will increase to
150 per cent and 135 per cent of base salary for the Chief Executive and Finance Director respectively (both 125 per cent previously),
135 per cent of base salary for the Chief Operating Officer (previously 100 per cent) and 120 per cent for the Group Sales and
Marketing Director (100 per cent previously). Additional stretching and quantifiable performance targets, aligned to the Company’s
growth strategy, will accompany the change in maximum bonus opportunity. The bonus increment will be deliverable only in deferred
shares that the Executive Director must retain for at least three years. These deferred shares are non-matchable and are not eligible
for investment in the Share Matching Scheme. The higher bonus opportunity remains below the market norms for FTSE 50 companies
of similar size and complexity to Imperial Tobacco, which are generally in the range of 150 per cent to 200 per cent of base salary.
In support of the Group’s key performance indicators, as set out on pages 14 and 15, the Committee has determined that, for the
financial year ending 30 September 2010, up to 100 per cent of salary (85 per cent for the Group Sales and Marketing Director) can
be earned for achieving financial targets based on a matrix including growth in adjusted earnings per share and reduction of adjusted
net debt. The remainder of the annual bonus can be earned for performance against other stretching, quantifiable targets, in important
strategic areas such as volume growth.
No element of the bonus is guaranteed.
Share Matching Scheme (SMS)
Under the SMS, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, the Executive Directors and the majority of the Group’s
management are invited to invest any proportion of their gross bonus (capped at 100 per cent of base salary for the Chief Executive
and Finance Director and 75 per cent for other Executive Directors) in our shares. For the financial year ending 30 September 2010
the cap will be 100 per cent of base salary for the Chief Executive, Finance Director and Chief Operating Officer and 85 per cent for
the Group Sales and Marketing Director. The shares are held by a nominee administered by the Employee Benefit Trust. Provided the
shares lodged are left with the nominee for three years and the participant remains an employee within the Group, they will be matched
on a one for one basis. Employees can exercise their vote in respect of shares held in the nominee by giving written instructions to
the nominee.
In respect of investments made by Executive Directors under the SMS a performance criterion is applied such that matching only
occurs if the Group has achieved real average annual EPS growth in excess of three per cent after adjusting for UK inflation (Real
Annual EPS Growth) over the three year retention period. Measurement of the performance criterion is based on the same protocol as
that applying to the LTIP . There is no opportunity to re-test if the performance criterion is not met. In setting the performance criterion
for SMS awards, we have decided the EPS criterion reflects our strategy to create sustainable shareholder value. For the financial
year ending 30 September 2010 we have extended the performance criterion to apply to matching shares in respect of the Chief
Executive’s Committee.
Under the rules, should Imperial Tobacco Group PLC be acquired the performance period would end on the date of acquisition.
Any outstanding awards would vest on a time pro rata basis subject to the achievement of the applicable performance criterion.

There have been no changes in any Executive Directors’ contingent rights since 30 September 2009.
During February 2009 annual bonuses earned in the financial year to 30 September 2005 and lodged under the SMS for a three year
period matured, providing matched shares for participants on a one for one basis.
In respect of annual bonuses earned in the financial year to 30 September 2008 and paid in December 2008, the Executive Directors
elected, in February 2009, to invest their entire bonus in the form of our shares under the SMS. These will be matched on a one for one
basis provided they are left in the SMS for three years, the participant remains an employee within the Group and the Company has
achieved in excess of three per cent Real Annual EPS Growth over the retention period. This performance criterion and the award
policy and vesting schedules were reviewed by the Committee during the year and deemed to remain appropriate. These matched
shares are shown within contingent rights arising above.
It is anticipated that in February 2010 the Executive Directors will again invest their entire eligible annual bonus in the SMS.
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
Annual conditional awards are made under the LTIP to Executive Directors and other senior management. These awards vest three
years after grant and are subject to satisfying the appropriate performance criteria over the relevant three year performance period.
All grants are at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee and no employee has a right to receive an award.
Awards granted prior to November 2005 were equivalent to 75 per cent of base salary for all Executive Directors and at a lower level
for other senior management. Following the comprehensive remuneration review in 2004, and subsequent shareholder approval at the
2005 AGM, awards made in November 2005, November 2006, October 2007 and November 2008 were equivalent to 200 per cent
of base salary for the Chief Executive, 150 per cent for the Finance Director and 100 per cent for the other Executive Directors with
awards at a lower level for other senior management.
Current Structure
From November 2005 the performance criteria for all awards were split into three elements. The Remuneration Committee reviewed
the performance criteria at its meeting in September 2009 and were satisfied that they remain appropriate notwithstanding current
market conditions. The three elements are as follows:
First Element
Fifty per cent of the award has a performance criterion based on average growth in adjusted earnings per share based on an agreed
protocol (EPS), after adjusting for inflation over the period of the award. At the Remuneration Committee’s request, our Auditors
perform agreed upon procedures on the calculations. Twelve and a half per cent of this element (i.e. 6.25 per cent of the total award)

vests if Real Annual EPS Growth equals three per cent and 100 per cent of this element (i.e. 50 per cent of the total award) vests
if Real Annual EPS Growth equals or exceeds 10 per cent. Between these two points this element vests on a straight-line basis.
Second Element
Twenty five per cent of the award has a performance criterion based on total shareholder return (TSR) relative to the FTSE 100 Index
as described below.
The performance criterion for this element is based on a sliding scale depending on TSR achieved over the relevant period. No vesting
of this element occurs unless the Company’s TSR ranks it in the top 50 of the companies of the FTSE 100 Index.
At this performance threshold 30 per cent of this element (i.e. 7.5 per cent of the total award) vests. If the return ranks the Company
in the top 25 of the Index this element (i.e. 25 per cent of the total award) vests in full. Between these thresholds this element vests
on a straight-line basis.
Third Element
Twenty five per cent of the award has a performance criterion based on TSR relative to a bespoke comparator group as described below.
The performance criterion for this element is also based on a sliding scale depending on TSR achieved over the relevant period.
No vesting of this element occurs unless the Company’s TSR exceeds that of the bottom six companies constituting a comparator
group comprising 12 tobacco and alcohol companies as detailed below. At this performance threshold, 30 per cent of this element
(i.e. 7.5 per cent of the total award) vests. If the return ranks the Company in the top three of the comparator group, this element
(i.e. 25 per cent of the total award) vests in full. Between these thresholds this element vests on a straight-line basis.
The comparator group for the November 2009 award is:
AB InBev Altria Group Inc. British American Tobacco PLC Carlsberg A/S
Diageo PLC Heineken N.V. Imperial Tobacco Group PLC Japan Tobacco Inc.
Philip Morris International Inc. Pernod Ricard S.A. Reynolds American Inc. SABMiller PLC
During the year Hewitt New Bridge Street was instructed to review the methodology used in the TSR calculations and submit
recommendations for consideration. The review was undertaken to ensure that relative TSR is measured in a fair and equitable way
and, as far as possible, reflects the underlying performance of each company within the comparator group. In particular, the revised
methodology focuses on the bespoke comparator group which, due to its size, is highly sensitive to small differences in TSR.
The principal changes approved by the Remuneration Committee were:
– if a company within the bespoke comparator group is delisted during the performance period it will be replaced from the start of the
performance period, in an agreed order, by a substitute company from a pre-determined list of Lorillard Inc, Foster’s Group Limited
and Molson Coors Brewing Company;
– if any company in the comparator group undertakes a rights issue during the performance period a cash neutral approach of selling
a portion of rights to take up the balance of the rights (commonly known as ‘tail swallowing’) will be applied; and
– to remove the undue influence of changes in exchange rates, future TSR calculations will be measured in the currency in which each
company is listed.
These changes were deemed necessary to ensure our Executive Directors and senior managers are incentivised to drive our
underlying performance and to ensure that corporate actions or fluctuations in exchange rates do not unduly effect comparative
underlying performance.
The TSR calculations use share prices of each comparator group company averaged over a period of three months to determine the
initial and closing prices rather than those applying on a single day. It is assumed that the cash flow of dividend payments is recognised
on the date shares are declared ex dividend. This method is considered to give a fairer and less volatile result as improved performance
has to be sustained for several weeks before it effectively impacts on the TSR calculations.
The TSR calculations are performed independently by Alithos Limited.
Each element operates independently and is capable of vesting regardless of the Company’s performance in respect of the other elements.
During the year the Remuneration Committee reviewed the performance criteria, award policy, comparator group and vesting schedules
for LTIP awards and decided that, notwithstanding the current conditions in financial markets, the three elements remain the most
important measures that drive and measure sustainable improvement in shareholder value and support our longer-term KPIs discussed
on pages 14 and 15. The TSR criteria reflect comparative performance against the appropriate FTSE sector and the bespoke comparator
group of companies. The EPS criterion reflects a key part of the Group’s strategy to create sustainable shareholder value.
Awards Under the Historical Structure
For awards granted between December 2000 and November 2004, EPS growth was the sole performance criterion. This was seen as
focusing on the financial performance of the business, over which Executive Directors and senior management could exercise influence.
These awards vested on a sliding scale depending on average growth in basic EPS adjusted under the terms of the relevant protocol.
The EPS calculations were confirmed by the Auditors. For awards granted between 2000 and 2002 no vesting occurred unless the
Company’s Real Annual EPS Growth was positive. For awards granted in 2003 and 2004 no vesting occurred unless the Company’s
Real Annual EPS Growth exceeded three per cent. Full vesting occurred if Real Annual EPS Growth was equal to or exceeded 10 per
cent. Between these two points the awards vested on a straight-line basis.

Vesting of Awards
On vesting, a participant is granted an option to acquire the relevant number of shares. The option may be exercised at any time up
to the seventh anniversary of its date of grant. Within this framework the vesting process in a number of jurisdictions outside the UK
is amended to conform to local securities and tax legislation.
The performance periods are set prior to the granting of each annual award and there is no opportunity to re-test if any of the
performance criteria are not achieved.
Under the rules, should Imperial Tobacco Group PLC be acquired the performance period would end on the date of acquisition.
Any outstanding awards would vest on a time pro rata basis subject to the achievement of applicable performance criteria.
The Remuneration Committee has absolute discretion to vary, but not increase, the extent to which any awards vest. This ensures
awards only vest, and vest at an appropriate level, if there has been an improvement in the underlying financial performance of the
Company, including the maintenance of long-term return on capital employed.

In respect of the November 2006 – November 2009 award partial vesting occured on 10 November 2009. Based on EPS and TSR
performance to the end of the financial year, full vesting of the first and second elements and partial vesting of 76.7 per cent of the third
element vested. For illustrative purposes only, the share price on 6 November 2009, being the latest practicable date prior to publication,
was £18.23 valuing the awards as follows:

The value of any options exercised could vary significantly from that shown due to share price movements.
The Remuneration Committee regards the November 2007 – November 2010 and the November 2008 – November 2011 awards to
be too distant from maturity to be included in the value projected above.
However, in respect of the November 2007 – November 2010 award, based upon interim measurement calculations prepared as at
30 September 2009 full vesting of the first element, partial vesting of 93.9 per cent of the second element and 53.3 per cent of the
third element would occur if this performance were maintained over the relevant performance period.
In respect of the November 2008 – November 2011 award based upon interim measurement calculations prepared as at
30 September 2009 full vesting of the first element, no vesting of the second element and 53.3 per cent of the third element
would occur if this performance were maintained over the relevant performance period.

Share Options
The Company does not operate an executive share option scheme. Executive Directors are, however, eligible (along with all employees
of the Company and participating subsidiaries of the Group, where possible) to participate in our savings related Sharesave Plan.
Under this Plan options are granted to participants who have contracted to save up to £250 per month over a period of three or five
years at a discount of up of 20 per cent to the closing mid-market price of an Imperial Tobacco Group PLC ordinary share on the
London Stock Exchange on the day prior to invitation. In common with most plans of this type there are no performance conditions
applicable to options granted under this Plan.

There have been no changes in any Executive Directors’ share options since 30 September 2009.
Our middle market share price at the close of business on 30 September 2009, being the last trading day of the financial year, was

Full details of the Directors’ share interests are available for inspection in the Register of Directors’ Interests at our registered office.
Award Dates
Our policy is to grant awards under all our employee share plans on predetermined dates based on an annual cycle.
Executive Share Retention
To ensure the interests of management are aligned with those of shareholders, Executive Directors and senior managers are required to
meet minimum shareholding guidelines. Over a period of five years from appointment they are required to build a holding in the Group’s
shares to a minimum value broadly equivalent to three times base salary for the Chief Executive and Finance Director and twice base
salary in respect of the other Executive Directors. Other senior management are expected to invest at a level equivalent to between
once and twice base salary, dependent upon grade. Failure to meet the minimum shareholding requirement is taken into account when
determining eligibility for LTIP awards. All Executive Directors currently exceed their required shareholding.

Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
68 IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2009
Executive Directors’ Pensions
Since 6 April 2006 (‘A’ day) the Group’s UK pension policy, which applies to all current Executive Directors, provides the option to
maintain membership of or, in respect of new employees, join the UK Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund (the Fund) or receive a salary
supplement in lieu of membership of the Fund.
The Executive Directors are all members of the Fund, the principal defined benefit scheme operated by the Group. For members
who joined prior to 1 April 2002 the Fund is largely non-contributory with a normal retirement age of 60. The Fund allows members
to achieve the maximum pension of two-thirds of their salary at normal retirement age, usually after 32 years’ service. Pension
commutation to enable participants to receive a lump sum on retirement is permitted.
For death before retirement, a capital sum equal to four times salary is payable together with a spouse’s pension of two-thirds of the
member’s expected pension at retirement. For death in retirement, a spouse’s pension of two-thirds of the member’s pre-commutation
pension is payable. Dependant children will also receive allowances.
Pensions increase annually by the lesser of 10 per cent and the increase in the Retail Prices Index, together with an option under
the rules to surrender part of a pension in order for the annual increase to be in line with the increase in the Retail Prices Index to
a maximum of 15 per cent.
From 6 April 2006 a new tax regime was introduced by HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) which abolished most of the detailed limits
previously imposed on pension schemes and replaced them with a simplified approach. Each member now has a Lifetime Allowance
(LTA), £1.75 million for retirements in the tax year 2009/2010 and a tax, called the lifetime allowance charge, is levied at retirement
if the value of their pension benefit from all sources exceeds this amount. For any member whose total benefit value on 6 April 2006
exceeded the LTA, transitional arrangements allowed them to register the higher value so that they would not be subject to a large
retrospective LTA charge. To qualify for this enhanced protection the member was required to opt out of Fund membership in respect
of future service accrual in order to retain a final salary linked pension entitlement in respect of past service.
All Executive Directors earn benefits on the standard scale with a normal retirement age of 60. Other than Mrs A J Cooper, each of
the current Executive Directors has opted out of Fund membership in respect of future service accrual as a result of registering for
enhanced protection with HMRC. The detailed HMRC rules governing enhanced protection mean that it may not be permissible, in
some rare circumstances, for the full final salary linked pension based on service up to 6 April 2006 to be paid from the Fund. In this
event an additional pension will be paid by the Company through an unfunded unapproved retirement benefit scheme (UURBS) so
that the full accrued benefit may be provided.
Mr R Dyrbus is in receipt of a salary supplement of 35 per cent of salary, which is in lieu of future pensionable service accrual and
arises because his accrued pension on 6 April 2006 was well below the maximum pension of two-thirds of salary. Mrs A J Cooper
is also in receipt of a salary supplement. Prior to 6 April 2006 her pension benefits were limited by the effect of HMRC’s earnings cap.
Although this cap was removed as from 6 April 2006, the Fund did not disapply it in respect of past pensionable service but maintained
its own earnings cap going forward. For service from 6 April 2006 onwards and for pensionable salary in excess of the Fund’s earnings
cap, the standard Fund benefit is a pension at the lower accrual rate of 1/60ths with a 50 per cent spouse’s pension and member
contributions of 5 per cent of this top slice of salary are payable. As an alternative to extra pension accrual on this top slice of salary
through the UURBS, Mrs Cooper receives a salary supplement of 12 per cent of this amount.
In each case these salary supplements have been calculated by the independent actuaries to reflect the value of the benefits of
which they are in lieu and are discounted for early payment and for employer’s national insurance contributions. The supplements
are non-compensatory and non-pensionable.
The following table provides the information required by both the Listing Rules and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (the Regulations) and gives details for each Executive Director of:
– the annual accrued pension payable on retirement calculated as if he/she had left service at the year end (any potential UURBS
entitlement is included);
– the increase in accrued pension during the year, excluding any increases for inflation in respect of the disclosure required under
the Listing Rules; and
– the transfer value of the increase in accrued pension calculated in accordance with the Retirement Benefit Schemes – Transfer
Values (GN 11) published by the Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries and dated 6 April 2001.
None of the Executive Directors have made additional voluntary contributions.

Other Information
Employee Benefit Trusts
The Imperial Tobacco Group Employee and Executive Benefit Trust (the Executive Trust) and the Imperial Tobacco Group PLC 2001
Employee Benefit Trust (the 2001 Trust) (together the Employee Benefit Trusts) have been established to acquire ordinary shares and
American Depositary Shares (ADSs) in the Company by subscription or purchase. Funds to enable these acquisitions are provided by
the Group to satisfy rights to ordinary shares and ADSs arising on the exercise of share options and on the vesting of the SMS and
LTIP awards.
As at 30 September 2009, the Company held 51,481,000 ordinary shares in treasury which can be used to satisfy options and awards
under its employee share plans either directly by the Company or by the Company gifting them to the Employee Benefit Trusts.
Options and awards may also be satisfied by the issue of new ordinary shares.
Details of the shareholdings by the Employee Benefit Trusts are as follows:

Share Plan Flow Rates
Our policy has always been to satisfy all options and awards under employee share plans from market purchased ordinary shares through
the Employee Benefit Trusts or through treasury shares transferred to the Employee Benefit Trusts.
The Trust Deeds of the Employee Benefit Trusts and the rules of all our employee share plans contain provisions limiting awards to five
per cent in five years and ten per cent in ten years for all employee share plans with an additional restriction to five per cent in ten years
for executive share plans. Currently an aggregate total of 0.6 per cent of the Company’s issued share capital is subject to options and
awards under the Group’s executive and all employee share plans. The Employee Benefit Trusts have also been provided with ordinary
shares held by the Company in treasury in order to satisfy vesting options and awards.
Since demerger in 1996, the cumulative options and awards under all of the Company’s employee share plans totals 2.6 per cent of its
issued share capital. Following initial grants on demerger, subsequent annual grants have averaged 0.3 per cent of issued share capital.

Consultancy Agreement with Non-Executive
Deputy Chairman
In addition to his appointment as Non-Executive Deputy
Chairman, Mr Comolli entered into an agreement with Imperial
Tobacco Limited, the Group’s principal operating company.
Under this agreement he provides consultancy services to the
Group and receives fees up to a maximum of €850,000 per annum.
The agreement terminates on 31 January 2010 but may be
renewed by mutual consent for further one year periods. In the
event that Mr Comolli ceases to be Non-Executive Deputy
Chairman, the agreement terminates with immediate effect but
Mr Comolli would receive fees for the remainder of the relevant
one year period.
It has been agreed that the annual consultancy agreement will
not be renewed on 31 January 2010, but will be replaced with
an eight month agreement paid at the rate of €20,000 per month.
The agreement will terminate at the end of September 2010 at
which time Mr Comolli will cease to provide consultancy services
to the Group. These changes do not have any impact on
Mr Comolli’s appointment as Non-Executive Deputy Chairman.
Remuneration Arrangements for Former
Executive Directors
Mr D Cresswell
Following his retirement from the Board in December 2007,
Mr Cresswell remains a member of Supervisory Boards within
the Reemtsma group and the Board of Imperial Vina Danang
Company Limited.
Mr M A Häussler
Mr M A Häussler is currently in receipt of a retirement pension
that has been reduced because it was taken before he reached
his normal retirement age. His service agreement with the Group
provided that he would receive similar overall pension benefits
to those that he would have received had he remained in the
Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH pension arrangement.
This was a pension for life equivalent to 42 per cent of his fixed
annual salary at age 63. For death in retirement, a spouse’s
pension for life of 60 per cent of that amount would be payable.
The pension is made up of two parts: one part payable from the
unfunded pension arrangement of Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken
GmbH, the other part payable from the separately funded Imperial
Tobacco Pension Fund. The pension payable under the Reemtsma
arrangement and from the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund may
be increased annually in accordance with the Rules of those
arrangements, or as required by law.
Mr S Huismans
Following his retirement from the Board in January 2006,
Mr S Huismans remains a member of Supervisory Boards within
the Reemtsma group. He was also appointed as a non-executive
director of Altadis, S.A. upon its acquisition by the Group in
January 2008 until 5 November 2008. Mr Huismans received
additional remuneration for fulfilling such non-executive roles.
Mr S T Painter
Following his retirement in May 2000, Mr S T Painter entered
into a consultancy agreement with Imperial Tobacco Limited,
the Group’s principal operating company.
The agreement, as amended in October 2001 and May 2004, ran
until March 2007. Under the terms of the agreement he provided
consultancy services as required and received fees at a day rate
of £1,000 with a minimum fee based on 100 days’ service for
each 12 month period ending on 30 June, and 67 days for the
period 1 July 2006 to 6 March 2007. Mr Painter is still providing
consultancy services as required and receives fees at a day rate
of £1,000. However, there is now no minimum fee. He is entitled
to reimbursement for the use of his car.
Mr Painter is also a member of Supervisory Boards within the
Reemtsma group and, between January and October 2008, the
Altadis group for which he received additional remuneration for
fulfilling such non-executive roles.
Dr F A Rogerson
Dr F A Rogerson resigned as a Director on 27 June 2007 for
personal and private reasons. Under his contract of employment,
Dr Rogerson was required to give 12 months’ notice to terminate
his employment. Dr Rogerson completed a handover period and
was on compassionate leave until 27 June 2008, when his
employment terminated.
Dr Rogerson was excluded from the 2007/2008 bonus scheme
and did not receive any bonus payment in respect of that bonus
year. He was also excluded from any invitations to the LTIP and
SMS from his Board resignation date.
The Remuneration Committee agreed that the awards granted to
Dr Rogerson under the LTIP and the ordinary shares awarded to
him under the SMS would vest, to the extent that the applicable
performance conditions were satisfied, pro rata for the period up
to 31 December 2007.
No compensation has been paid to Dr Rogerson in connection
with the termination of his employment.
Dr Rogerson opted out of pension fund membership as
regards future service accrual as a result of registering for
enhanced protection with HMRC from 6 April 2006. Dr Rogerson
was in receipt of a salary supplement in lieu of future pension
service accrual of 16.4 per cent of salary. This amount was a
non-pensionable payment. It was agreed with Dr Rogerson that
this salary supplement ceased to be paid on 31 December 2007
and that no salary supplement would be paid for the remainder
of his notice period.
Mr B Setrakian
Following his appointment to the Board in June 2008,
Mr B Setrakian retained a number of appointments within
Altadis’ USA business. He resigned from these appointments in
December 2008. Mr Setrakian received additional remuneration
for fulfilling such non-executive roles.

Independent Auditors’ Report
to the Members of Imperial Tobacco Group PLC
We have audited the Group financial statements of Imperial Tobacco Group PLC for the year ended 30 September 2009 which
comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income
and Expense, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied
in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the Group
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require
us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with
Sections 495 and 496 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where
expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the Audit of the Financial Statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation
of the financial statements.
Opinion on Financial Statements
In our opinion the Group financial statements:
– give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 30 September 2009 and of its profit and cash flows for the year
then ended;
– have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
– have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the lAS Regulation.
Opinion on Other Matter Prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the Group financial statements are prepared
is consistent with the Group financial statements.
Matters on Which We Are Required to Report by Exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
– certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
– we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
– a corporate governance statement has not been prepared by the parent company.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
– the Directors’ statement in the Corporate Governance Report, in relation to going concern; and
– the part of the Corporate Governance Report relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the June 2008
Combined Code specified for our review.
Other Matter
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Imperial Tobacco Group PLC for the year ended
30 September 2009 and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.

Accounting Policies
Basis of Preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and IFRIC
interpretations as adopted by the European Union (collectively IFRS) and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to
companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except as described in the accounting policies on
financial instruments, retirement benefit schemes and share schemes below.
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the
date of the financial statements. The key estimates and assumptions are set out in the Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements
note on pages 83 to 84. Such estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed
to be reasonable in the circumstances and constitute management’s best judgement at the date of the financial statements. In the
future, actual experience may deviate from these estimates and assumptions. This could affect future financial statements as the
original estimates and assumptions are modified, as appropriate, in the year in which the circumstances change.
A summary of the more important Group accounting policies is set out below.
Consolidated Income Statement Presentation
Since the Group adopted IFRS in 2005, the audited consolidated financial statements of the Group were consistently prepared on the
basis that:
(a) the foreign currency exchange element of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments not designated as net
investment hedges under IAS 39 was reported as part of profit from operations;
(b) foreign currency exchange differences on borrowings not designated as net investment hedges under IAS 39 were also taken
to profit from operations, but were not separately disclosed; and
(c) the interest element of changes in the fair value of derivatives was reported as part of net finance costs.
During the year, as part of our ongoing procedures to improve the quality of our financial reporting, we reviewed our Consolidated Income
Statement presentation in the light of current best practice and against those members of our peer group reporting under IFRS. On the
basis of this review we concluded that it would be more helpful to users of our financial statements to present the foreign exchange
element of changes in value of derivative financial instruments and foreign currency exchange differences on borrowings not designated
as net investment hedges as part of net finance costs rather than profit from operations. For the year ended 30 September 2008 an
amount of £314 million has been reclassified from administrative and other expenses to net finance costs. There was no effect on profit
before taxation.
Consolidated Balance Sheet
As detailed in note 24, the fair value adjustments arising from the acquisition of Altadis were finalised in January 2009, with adjustments
made to the previously published provisional fair values. The consolidated balance sheet at 30 September 2008 has been restated to
reflect the finalisation of the fair value adjustments.
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the results of Imperial Tobacco Group PLC (the Company) and its subsidiary undertakings.
Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has the power to govern the financial and
operating policies of an enterprise taking into account any potential voting rights. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included
in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries. The cost of an acquisition is measured at
the fair value of the consideration plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition. The excess of the cost of the acquisition over the
Group’s share of the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the subsidiary acquired is recorded as goodwill. Transactions with
minority interests are treated as transactions with parties external to the Group.
Intragroup transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated; unrealised losses
are also eliminated unless costs cannot be recovered. Where necessary, accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed to
ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
A list of the principal subsidiaries is included on pages 131 to 132.
Joint Ventures
Joint ventures are those businesses which management and third parties jointly control. The financial statements of joint ventures are
consolidated using the proportionate method, with the Group’s share of assets and liabilities recognised in the balance sheet classified
according to their nature. In the same way, the Group’s share of income and expenses is presented in the consolidated income
statement in accordance with their function.
If necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of these companies to unify their accounting policies with those used
by the Group.
Foreign Currency
Items included in the financial statements of each Group company are measured using the currency of the primary economic
environment in which the company operates (the functional currency).
The income and cash flow statements of Group companies using non-sterling functional currencies are translated to sterling (the
Group’s presentational currency) at average rates of exchange in each period. Assets and liabilities of these companies are translated
at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. The differences between retained profits and losses translated at average and
closing rates are taken to reserves, as are differences arising on the retranslation of the net assets at the beginning of the year.
1849 Black Sun ImpTob p72_p132:Layout 1 30/11/09  21:39  Page 77 Any translation differences that have arisen since 1 October 2004 are presented as a separate component of equity. As permitted
by IFRS 1, any differences prior to this date are not included in this separate component of equity.
Transactions in currencies other than a company’s functional currency are initially recorded at the exchange rate ruling at the date
of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at
exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised
in the income statement, except when treated as qualifying net investment hedges.
The Group designates as net investment hedges certain external borrowings and derivatives up to the value of the net assets of Group
companies that use non-sterling functional currencies after deducting permanent intragroup loans. Gains or losses on these hedges
are transferred to equity and offset any gains or losses on translation of the net assets.
Revenue Recognition
For the Tobacco segment, revenue comprises the invoiced value for the sale of goods and services net of sales taxes, rebates and
discounts. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when a Group company has delivered products to the customer, the customer
has accepted the products and collectibility of the related receivables is reasonably assured. Sales of services, which include fees for
distributing third party products, are recognised in the accounting period in which the services are rendered. Licence fees are recognised
on an accruals basis in accordance with the substance of the relevant agreements.
For the Logistics segment, revenue comprises the invoiced value for the sale of goods and services net of sales taxes, rebates and
discounts. The Logistics business only recognises commission revenue on purchase and sale transactions in which it acts as a
commission agent. Distribution and marketing commissions are included in revenue. Revenue is recognised on products on
consignment when these are sold by the consignee.
Duty and Similar Items
Duty and similar items includes duty and levies having the characteristics of duty. In countries where duty is a production tax, duty is
included in revenue and in the income statement as an expense. Where duty is a sales tax, duty is excluded from revenue. Payments
due in the United States under the Master Settlement Agreement and the Fair and Equitable Tobacco Reform Act are considered to
be levies having the characteristics of duty and are treated as a production tax.
Taxes
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the
balance sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns where the applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. The
Group establishes provisions on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities only where it is considered more likely
than not that an amount will be paid or received. The Group applies this test to each individual uncertain position. The Group measures
the uncertain positions based on the single most likely outcome.
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements
and the tax base. However, the deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction,
other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax
assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the assets can be
realised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted. Deferred tax is determined using the tax rates that have been enacted
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, and are expected to apply when the deferred tax liability is settled or the deferred
tax asset is realised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal of the
temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Tax is recognised in the income statement, except where it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised
in equity.
Dividends
Final dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividends are approved by shareholders, while interim dividends
are recognised in the period in which the dividends are paid.
Intangible Assets – Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the Group’s share of the fair value of the net identifiable assets,
liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions made on or after 27 September 1998 is capitalised. Previously all goodwill was written off through
equity in the period of acquisition. As permitted under IFRS 1, goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 October 2004 is stated in
accordance with UK GAAP and has not been remeasured on transition to IFRS. Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment and
carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and cannot be
subsequently reversed. Goodwill is allocated to groups of cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation
is made to those cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination
in which the goodwill arose. Gains or losses on the disposal of a Group company are determined by comparing the proceeds with the
carrying value of the Group company’s assets and liabilities including the carrying amount of related goodwill. Goodwill previously written
off directly to reserves under UK GAAP is not recycled to the income statement on the disposal of the subsidiary to which it relates.
Intangible Assets – Other
Other intangible assets are initially recognised in the balance sheet at historical cost unless they are acquired as part of a business
combination, in which case they are initially recognised at fair value. They are shown in the balance sheet at historical cost or fair value
(depending on how they are acquired) less accumulated amortisation and impairment.

These assets consist mainly of acquired trademarks, concessions and rights, acquired customer relationships and computer software.
The Davidoff cigarette trademark and some premium cigar trademarks are considered by the Directors to have indefinite lives based
on the fact that they are established international brands with global potential. Trademarks with indefinite lives are not amortised but are
reviewed annually for impairment. Other trademarks, supply agreements (including customer relationships) and computer software are
amortised over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Other trademarks up to 30 years straight line
Supply agreements 3 – 15 years straight line
Computer software up to 5 years straight line
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are initially recognised in the balance sheet at historical cost unless they are acquired as part of a
business combination, in which case they are initially recognised at fair value. They are shown in the balance sheet at historical cost
or fair value (depending on how they are acquired), less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Historical cost includes expenditure
that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Subsequent costs are included in the assets’ carrying amounts or recognised
as a separate asset as appropriate only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with them will flow to the Group
and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance costs are charged to the income statement
as incurred.
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation is provided on other property, plant and equipment so as to write off the initial cost of each asset
to its residual value over its estimated useful life as follows:
Buildings up to 50 years straight line
Plant and equipment 2 – 20 years straight line/reducing balance
Fixtures and motor vehicles 2 – 14 years straight line
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed and, if appropriate, adjusted at each balance sheet date.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amounts. These are included in the income statement.
Leases
Assets acquired under finance leases are included within property, plant and equipment. They are initially valued at the lower of fair
value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. The assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the
useful life of the asset. The associated lease liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet, and the interest element of the leasing
payments is charged to the income statement.
Rental payments under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Impairment of Assets
Assets that are not subject to amortisation or depreciation are tested at least annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to
amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement for the amount by which the carrying
amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and
the value in use. For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately
identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units).
Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the relevant
instrument. Financial assets are de-recognised when the rights to receive benefits have expired or been transferred, and the Group has
transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. Financial liabilities are de-recognised when the obligation is extinguished.
Non-derivative financial assets are classified as loans and receivables (including cash and cash equivalents). Receivables are initially
recognised at fair value and are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method, subject to reduction for
allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. A provision for impairment of receivables is established when there is objective
evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of those receivables. The amount
of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, and is
recognised in the income statement. For interest-bearing assets, the carrying value includes accrued interest receivable.
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits held on call, together with other short-term highly liquid investments.
Non-derivative financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective
interest method. For borrowings, the carrying value includes accrued interest payable, as well as unamortised transaction costs.
The Group transacts derivative financial instruments to manage the underlying exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks.
The Group does not transact derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Derivative financial assets and liabilities are included
in the balance sheet at fair value, which includes accrued interest receivable and payable where relevant. However, as the Group has
decided (as permitted under IAS 39) not to cash flow or fair value hedge account for its derivative financial instruments, changes in fair
values are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they arise unless the derivative qualifies and has been designated
as a net investment hedging instrument in which case the changes in fair values, attributable to foreign exchange, are recognised
in equity.
Collateral transferred under the terms and conditions of credit support annex documents under International Swaps and Derivatives
Association (ISDA) agreements in respect of certain derivatives with negative fair values are net settled and are therefore netted off the
carrying value of those derivatives on the balance sheet.
1849 Black Sun ImpTob p72_p132:Layout 1 30/11/09  21:39  Page 79 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.
The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production
overheads (based on normal operating capacity) but excludes borrowing costs. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price
in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
Leaf tobacco inventory which has an operating cycle that exceeds twelve months is classified as a current asset, consistent with
recognised industry practice.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is more
likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle that obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made.
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has
either commenced or has been publicly announced, and it is more likely than not that the plan will be implemented, and the amount
required to settle any obligations arising can be reliably estimated. Future operating losses are not provided for.
Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by
considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one
item included in the same class of obligations may be small.
Retirement Benefit Schemes
The Group operates a number of retirement benefit schemes for its employees, including both defined benefit and defined
contribution schemes.
Under a defined benefit scheme, the amount of retirement benefit that will be received by an employee is defined with respect to period
of service and final salary. The amount recognised in the balance sheet is the difference between the present value of the defined benefit
obligation at the balance sheet date and the fair value of the scheme assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by
independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by
discounting the estimated future cash outflows.
The service cost of providing retirement benefits to employees during the year is charged to profit from operations.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in income, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees
remaining in service for a specified period of time (the vesting period). In this case, the past service costs are amortised on a straight
line basis over the average vesting period. All actuarial gains and losses, including differences between actual and expected returns
on assets and differences that arise as a result of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised immediately in full in the statement
of recognised income and expense for the period in which they arise.
A credit representing the expected return on plan assets of the retirement benefit schemes during the year is included within net
finance costs. This is based on the market value of the assets of the schemes at the start of the financial year. A charge is also made
within net finance costs for the expected increase in the liabilities of the retirement benefit schemes during the year. This arises from
the schemes being one year closer to payment.
For defined contribution schemes, the Group pays a defined contribution to the scheme; there are no further payment obligations
once these contributions have been paid. Such contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due.
Any prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or reduction in future payments is available.
Share-Based Payments
The Group applies the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment to share-based employee compensation schemes in respect
of awards granted after 7 November 2002.
The Group operates equity-settled and cash-settled share-based compensation schemes. The cost of employees’ services received
in exchange for the grant of rights under both types of scheme is expensed over the vesting period, and is determined by reference
to the fair value of the instruments granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (e.g. earnings per share).
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of instruments that are expected to become exercisable.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of instruments that are expected to become exercisable
under all schemes, and re-measures the fair value of the cash-settled schemes. The Group recognises the impact of the revision of
original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity for equity-settled schemes and current
liabilities for cash-settled schemes. The fair value is measured based on an appropriate valuation model, taking into account the terms
and conditions of the award.
The Group funds the purchase of shares to satisfy rights to shares arising under share-based employee compensation schemes.
Shares acquired to satisfy those rights are held in Employee Share Ownership Trusts. On consolidation, these shares are accounted
for as a deduction from equity attributable to equity holders of the Company. When the rights are exercised, equity is increased by the
amount of any proceeds received by the Employees Share Ownership Trusts.
Share Capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from
the proceeds.
Where the Company purchases its own equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly attributable
incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted on consolidation from equity attributable to equity holders of the Company until
the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received,
net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to
equity holders of the Company.

Segmental Reporting
A business segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged in providing products or services that are subject
to risks and returns that are different to those of other business segments.
The two distinct businesses of Tobacco and Logistics have been used as the primary reporting segments. Transactions between
segments are undertaken on an arm’s length basis reflecting market prices for comparable products and services.
Use of Non-GAAP or Adjusted Measures
Management believes that reporting non-GAAP or adjusted measures provides a useful comparison of business performance and
reflects the way in which the business is controlled. Accordingly, adjusted measures of profit from operations, net finance costs,
profit before tax, taxation, attributable earnings and earnings per share exclude, where applicable, amortisation of acquired intangibles,
restructuring costs, post-employment benefits net financing cost, fair value gains and losses on derivative financial instruments in
respect of commercially effective hedges, one-off acquisition accounting adjustments, brand divestment gains and related taxation
effects. Reconciliations between adjusted and reported profit from operations are included within note 1 to the financial statements,
adjusted and reported net finance costs in note 5, adjusted and reported taxation in note 6, and adjusted and reported earnings per
share in note 8. The adjusted measures in this report are not defined terms under IFRS and may not be comparable with similarly titled
measures reported by other companies.
The items excluded from adjusted results are those which are one-off in nature or which arose due to acquisitions and are not influenced
by the day-to-day operations of the Group, and the movements in fair value of financial instruments which are marked-to-market and
not naturally offset. Adjusted net finance costs also exclude all interest on items not included within adjusted net debt. This allows
comparison of the Group’s cost of debt with adjusted net debt. The adjusted measures are used by management to assess the Group’s
financial performance and aid comparability of results year-on-year.
The principal adjustments made to reported profits are as follows:
Acquisition Accounting Adjustments
In 2008 there were a number of acquisition accounting adjustments required under IFRS which affected reported profit from
operations. The most significant of these were one-off adjustments related to the adjustment to fair value stocks held in Altadis at
the date of acquisition, and the elimination of sales between the Altadis and Imperial Tobacco Groups.
Prior to the acquisition of Altadis, Imperial Tobacco sold products to Altadis, principally to the logistics business for distribution in
France, Spain, Italy and Portugal, and recognised profit at the time of sale to Altadis. Following the acquisition the enlarged Group
recognises these profits when the products are sold out of the enlarged Group, so there was an initial post acquisition period during
which no profit was recognised. These one-off effects had no impact on the performance of the business or on cash flow.
Consequently we excluded these adjustments and their related taxation effects from our adjusted earnings measures.
Amortisation of Acquired Intangibles
Acquired intangibles are amortised over their estimated useful economic lives where these are considered to be finite. Acquired
intangibles considered to have an indefinite life are not amortised. We exclude from our adjusted measures the amortisation of acquired
intangibles, other than software, and the deferred tax associated with amortisation of acquired intangibles and tax deductible goodwill.
The deferred tax liability is excluded on the basis that it will only crystallise upon disposal of the intangibles and goodwill. The related
current cash tax benefit is retained in the adjusted measure to reflect the ongoing tax benefit to the Group. Impairment of goodwill is
also excluded from our adjusted measures.
Brand Divestment
The Group was required to divest a small number of fine cut and pipe tobacco brands as a condition of the European Commission’s
approval of the acquisition of Altadis. This one-off gain and its related taxation effects have no impact on the operational performance
of the business and have consequently been excluded from our adjusted earnings measures.
Fair Value Gains and Losses on Derivative Financial Instruments
IAS 39 requires that all derivative financial instruments are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in the fair value
being recognised in the income statement unless the instrument satisfies the hedge accounting rules under IFRS and the Group
chooses to designate the derivative financial instrument as a hedge.
The Group hedges underlying exposures in an efficient, commercial and structured manner. However, the strict hedging requirements
of IAS 39 may lead to some commercially effective hedge positions not qualifying for hedge accounting. As a result, the Group has
decided not to apply cash flow or fair value hedge accounting for its derivative financial instruments as permitted under IAS 39.
However, the Group does apply net investment hedging, designating certain borrowings and derivatives as hedges of the net
investment in the Group’s foreign operations, as permitted by IAS 39, in order to minimise income statement volatility.
We exclude fair value gains and losses on derivative financial instruments providing commercial hedges from adjusted net financing
costs. Fair value gains and losses on the interest element of derivative financial instruments are excluded as they will reverse over time
or are matched in future periods by interest rate charges. Fair value gains and losses on the currency element of derivative financial
instruments are excluded as the relevant foreign exchange gains and losses on the commercially hedged item are accumulated as
a separate component of equity in accordance with the Group’s policy on foreign currency.
Restructuring Costs
Significant one-off costs incurred in integrating acquired businesses and in major rationalisation initiatives together with their related tax
effects are excluded from our adjusted earnings measures.
Post-Employment Benefits Net Financing Cost
The expected return on plan assets and the interest on retirement benefit liabilities, together with the unwind of discount on redundancy
and social plans costs included in restructuring provisions, are reported within net finance costs. These items together with their related
tax effects are excluded from our adjusted earnings measures.
1849 Black Sun ImpTob p72_p132:Layout 1 30/11/09  21:39  Page 81 Other Non-GAAP Measures Used by Management
Net Revenue
Net revenue comprises the Tobacco segment revenue less duty and similar items. Management considers this an important measure
in assessing the profitability of Tobacco operations.
Distribution Fees
Distribution fees comprises the Logistics segment revenue excluding the cost of distributed products. Management considers this an
important measure in assessing the profitability of Logistics operations.
Adjusted Net Debt
Management monitors the Group’s borrowing levels using adjusted net debt which excludes interest accruals, the fair value of
derivative financial instruments providing commercial cash flow hedges and finance lease liabilities.
New Accounting Standards
The following interpretations became effective for the current reporting period:
IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation
IFRIC 18 Transfer of Assets from Customers
Application of these interpretations has not had a material impact on the net assets or results of the Group.
The following standards and interpretations were issued but application was not mandatory for the period:
IAS 1 (Revised) Presentation of Financial Statements
IAS 23 (Revised) Borrowing Costs
IAS 27 (Revised) Consolidation and Separate Financial Statements
IAS 32 and IAS 1 (amendment) Puttable Financial Instruments
IAS 39 (amendments) Reclassification of Financial Assets and Eligible Hedged Items
IAS 39/IFRIC 9 (amendment) Embedded Derivatives
IFRS 2 (amendments) Amendments to IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment – Vesting Conditions and Cancellations, and Group
Cash-settled Share-based Payments
IFRS 3 (Revised) Business Combinations
IFRS 1 and IAS 27 (amendment) Cost of an Investment in a Subsidiary, Jointly Controlled Entity or Associate
IFRS 7 (amendment) Financial Instruments: Disclosures
IFRS 8 Operating Segments
IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements
IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes
IFRIC 14 IAS 19 – The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction
IFRIC 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate
IFRIC 17 Distribution of Non-cash Assets to Owners
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the
net assets or results of the Group other than IFRS 3 (Revised) which may have a material impact on the reporting of future acquisitions.
IAS 1(Revised) will require some changes in the format of the financial statements and terminology.

Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements
The Group makes estimates and assumptions regarding the future. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated based on historical
experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
In the future, actual experience may deviate from these estimates and assumptions. The estimates and assumptions that have a
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are
discussed below.
Legal Proceedings and Disputes
In accordance with IFRS, the Group recognises liabilities where there is a present obligation from a past event, a transfer of economic
benefits is probable and the amount of costs of the transfer can be reliably estimated. In such instances a provision is calculated and
recorded in the financial statements. In instances where these criteria are not met, a contingent liability may be disclosed in the notes
to the financial statements.
A contingent liability is a possible obligation arising from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or
non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group; or a present obligation arising from
past events that is not recognised in the financial statements because it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic
benefits will be required to settle the obligation, or because the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.
Realisation of any contingent liabilities not currently recognised or disclosed in the financial statements could have a material effect on
the Group’s financial condition.
As required under purchase accounting, claims and contingencies are recorded initially at fair value. Future changes to these
estimates of fair value are required to be reflected in the income statement and could have a material effect on the Group’s results
and financial condition.
Application of these accounting principles to legal proceedings and disputes, including cases in which claimants are seeking damages
for alleged smoking and health-related effects, is inherently difficult, given the complex nature of the facts and law involved. Deciding
whether or not to provide for loss in connection with such claims requires the Group’s management to make determinations about
various factual and legal matters beyond its control.
The Group reviews outstanding legal cases following developments in the legal proceedings at each balance sheet date, in order to
assess the need for provisions in its financial statements. Among the factors considered in making decisions on provisions are the
nature of the litigation, claim or assessment, the legal processes and potential level of damages in the jurisdiction in which the litigation,
claim or assessment has been brought, the progress of the case (including progress after the date of the financial statements but
before those statements are issued), the opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers, experience of similar cases and any
decision of the Group’s management as to how it will respond to the litigation, claim or assessment.
To the extent that the Group’s determinations at any time do not reflect subsequent developments or the eventual outcome of any
claim, its future financial statements may be materially affected, with an adverse impact upon the Group’s profit from operations,
financial position and liquidity.
The Group is currently involved in a number of legal cases in which claimants are seeking damages for alleged smoking and health-related
effects. In the opinion of the Group’s lawyers, the Group has meritorious defences to these actions, all of which are being vigorously
contested. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of the pending litigation, the Directors believe that the pending actions
will not have a material adverse effect upon the revenue, profit or financial condition of the Group. Consequently, in respect of any such
cases, the Group has not provided for any amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
In October 2003 the UK Office of Fair Trading (OFT) commenced an investigation under the Competition Act 1998 into the operation
of the UK tobacco supply chain.
On 24 April 2008, the OFT issued a Statement of Objections (SO) which set out the OFT’s allegations against the tobacco manufacturers
Imperial Tobacco Group and Gallaher, and 11 retailers. The OFT alleges that these tobacco manufacturers and retailers variously
engaged in one or more unlawful practices in relation to retail prices for some or all of a number of tobacco products in breach of
Chapter 1 of the Competition Act 1998.
Following the issue of the SO, the OFT invited recipients of the SO to enter into settlement discussions on a ‘without prejudice’ basis
to reach ‘early resolution agreements’ with the OFT. On 11 July 2008, the OFT announced that six of the parties subject to the SO had
reached early resolution agreements with the OFT, agreeing to pay a combined figure of some £132.3 million if all leniency and early
resolution discounts are taken into account. Other than Imperial Tobacco Group, the parties which have also not settled with the OFT
and are therefore contesting the OFT’s allegations, are the Co-operative Group, Morrisons (including Safeway), Shell and Tesco.
Imperial Tobacco Group’s detailed written response to the SO was submitted to the OFT on 15 August 2008 and Imperial Tobacco’s
representatives made submissions to the OFT in defence of the allegations at an oral hearing on 3 December 2008.
The OFT indicated in a letter dated 12 October 2009, that it currently intends to notify the parties of its ‘final’ decision in the investigation
in the first quarter of 2010. We have no indication of whether that will be an infringement decision, a file closure decision or some other
form of decision.
If the OFT proceeds to an infringement decision, it may impose a fine. The maximum amount of any fine, under the statutory regime
we believe that the OFT may apply, is 10 per cent of a company’s UK turnover for up to three years (although the actual amount may
be less). By way of example, in the three years to 30 September 2003, Imperial Tobacco Group’s aggregate net UK turnover was
£2,215 million. The applicable turnover on which the amount of a fine is based expressly excludes VAT and other taxes directly related to
turnover, which Imperial Tobacco Group has been advised would also exclude duty. In addition, if the OFT were to make an infringement
finding, it could issue orders prohibiting that activity in the future, whilst the infringing company might face the prospect of damages
actions from third parties. If the OFT were to make an infringement decision, Imperial Tobacco Group would be able to appeal the
OFT’s decision to the Competition Appeal Tribunal, and ultimately, on a point of law to the Court of Appeal.
We take compliance with competition law very seriously and reject any suggestion that we have acted in any way contrary to the
interests of consumers. Consequently, the Group has not provided any amount in the consolidated financial statements.
1849 Black Sun ImpTob p72_p132:Layout 1 30/11/09  21:39  Page 83 Property, Plant and Equipment and Intangible Assets
Intangible assets (other than goodwill, the Davidoff cigarette trademark and certain premium cigar trademarks) and property, plant and
equipment are amortised or depreciated over their useful lives. Useful lives are based on management’s estimates of the period over
which the assets will generate revenue, and are periodically reviewed for continued appropriateness. Due to the long lives of certain
assets, changes to the estimates used can result in significant variations in the carrying value.
The Group assesses the impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortisation or depreciation
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors considered important
that could trigger an impairment review include the following:
– significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results;
– significant changes in the manner of the use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business; and
– significant negative industry or economic trends.
Additionally, goodwill arising on acquisitions and indefinite lived assets are subject to impairment review. The Group’s management
undertakes an impairment review annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value
may not be recoverable. When it is determined that there is an indicator that the carrying value may not be recoverable, impairment
is measured based on estimates of the recoverable amount of the underlying assets of the cash-generating unit.
The complexity of the estimation process and issues related to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent in the application of
the Group’s accounting estimates in relation to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets affect the amounts reported in the
financial statements, especially the estimates of the expected useful economic lives and the carrying values of those assets. If business
conditions were different, or if different assumptions were used in the application of this and other accounting estimates, it is likely that
materially different amounts could be reported in the Group’s financial statements.
See notes 9 and 10 to these financial statements.
Retirement Benefits
The costs, assets and liabilities of the defined benefit retirement schemes operating within the Group are determined using methods
relying on actuarial estimates and assumptions. Details of the key assumptions are set out in note 18. The Group takes advice from
independent actuaries relating to the appropriateness of the assumptions. It is important to note, however, that comparatively small
changes in the assumptions used may have a significant effect on the Group’s financial statements.
We estimate that a 0.5 per cent increase/(decrease) in the discount rate would increase/(decrease) the IAS 19 pension expense
by approximately £3 million. We estimate that a 0.5 per cent decrease/(increase) in the expected return on plan assets would
increase/(reduce) the IAS 19 pension expense by approximately £14 million.
Income Taxes
The Group is subject to income tax in numerous jurisdictions and significant judgement is required in determining the provision for
tax. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of
business. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on estimates of the additional taxes that are likely to become
due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact
the current income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.

Notes to the Financial Statements
Segmental Information
Imperial Tobacco comprises two distinct businesses – Tobacco and Logistics – which have been used as the basis for the primary
segment reporting below. The Tobacco segment comprises the manufacture, marketing and sale of tobacco and tobacco-related
products, including sales to (but not by) the Logistics segment. The Logistics segment comprises the distribution of tobacco products
for tobacco product manufacturers, including Imperial Tobacco, as well as a wide range of non-tobacco products and services. Central
costs of the Group are allocated to the Tobacco and Logistics segments based on management’s assessment of the level of support
provided to each business segment. The business segments presented reflect the management structure of the Group and the way
in which the Group’s management reviews business performance. Transactions between segments are undertaken on an arm’s length
basis reflecting market prices for comparable products and services.

Restructuring costs in 2009 relate primarily to European Integration projects announced in June 2008 as part of the integration of
Imperial Tobacco and Altadis. These projects affect sales and marketing, manufacturing and central support functions in a number
of markets and will be implemented progressively over a period of three years. Costs in 2009 also include expenses related to
the closure of our Tampa, Florida, USA cigar factory announced in June 2009. In addition to the European Integration projects,
restructuring costs in 2008 include expenses relating to the closure of our cigar factory in Selma, Alabama, USA, the integration with
Commonwealth Brands of the Lignum 2 operation acquired in May 2008, and costs in relation to streamlining Logistics operations
in France.
The net charge of £145 million in 2009 includes £23 million of unused restructuring provisions reversed during the period, £95 million
booked as additional restructuring provisions, £15 million booked as an impairment of property, plant and equipment and £19 million
booked against net retirement benefits liabilities. The remaining charge of £39 million was booked directly to the income statement as
these costs did not meet the provisioning requirements of IAS 37.
Restructuring costs are included within administrative and other expenses in the consolidated income statement.

A final dividend for the year ended 30 September 2009 of 52.0 pence per share has been proposed. This amounts to £527 million
based on the number of shares ranking for dividend at 30 September 2009. At the year end, the shareholders had not yet approved
the final dividend and therefore it is not included in the balance sheet as a liability.
The dividend per share figures included in the table above reflect the bonus element of the rights issue as described in note 20.

Basic earnings per share is based on the profit for the period attributable to the equity holders of the Company and the weighted
average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period excluding shares held to satisfy the Group’s employee share schemes
and shares purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares. Diluted earnings per share have been calculated by taking into
account the weighted average number of shares that would be issued if rights held under the employee share schemes were exercised.
No instruments have been excluded from the calculation on the grounds that they are anti-dilutive.

Basic and diluted earnings per share have been calculated on a post rights issue basis where the weighted average number of shares

to the closing date of the rights issue, which is described in note 20. The bonus factor used was 1.1509.

1849 Black Sun ImpTob p72_p132:Layout 1 30/11/09  21:40  Page 93 Goodwill and intangible asset impairment review
Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units (CGUs). For the Tobacco segment
these are based on the geographic areas in which the Group operates. A summary of the carrying value of goodwill and intangible
assets with indefinite lives is set out below. The joint ventures that distribute Cuban cigars worldwide were previously presented within
the Rest of the World, but have been reported separately in the current year as sensitivity disclosures are being provided for this CGU.

Logistics 1,795 – 1,549 –

Goodwill has arisen principally on the acquisitions of Reemtsma in 2002 (mainly EU and Rest of the World), Commonwealth Brands
in 2007 (Americas) and Altadis in 2008 (all CGUs).
The Group tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are any
indications that impairment may have arisen. The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections derived from three year financial budgets which are based on management’s experience
and expectations and are approved by the Board annually. The compound annual growth rates implicit in these value-in-use calculations
are shown below. Cash flows beyond the budget period are extrapolated using the estimated long-term growth rate of three per cent
per annum. Discount rates used are based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the different risk profiles of
the CGUs. Pre-tax discount rates ranged from 8.6 per cent to 11.4 per cent.

Logistics 0.8% 3.0%
1 Weighted average compound annual growth rate used for first three years in value-in-use calculations.
2 Weighted average compound annual growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the initial three years.
For the Tobacco business in the European Union, Americas and the Rest of the World, and for Logistics, any reasonable movement
in the assumptions of the impairment test would not result in an impairment. In addition to the initial growth rates shown above applied
to cash flows arising in existing markets, the valuation of the Cuban cigar joint ventures includes assumptions about the timing and
extent of cash flows from entry to new markets. The impairment test for the Cuban cigar joint ventures indicated headroom of
£100 million and that a reduction of 15 per cent or more in the value of overall cash flows would result in an impairment. We do not
consider that any reasonable movement in other assumptions relating to the Cuban cigar joint ventures would result in an impairment.
No impairment charges have been recognised in the year in respect of goodwill and intangible assets. In 2008 goodwill impairment
of £21 million was recognised in respect of the Sinclair Collis business included in European Union CGU, reducing the carrying value
to nil. This impairment reflected the decline in UK vending sales as a result of the introduction of restrictions on smoking in licensed
premises and anticipated access restrictions.

It is generally recognised industry practice to classify leaf tobacco inventory as a current asset although part of such inventory, because
of the duration of the processing cycle, ordinarily would not be consumed within one year. Leaf tobacco held within raw materials
inventories at the balance sheet date will ordinarily be utilised within two years.

(i) Management of financial risk
The Group operates a centralised treasury function, Group Treasury, which is responsible for the management of the financial risks of
the Group, together with its financing and liquidity requirements. It does not operate as a profit centre, nor does it enter into speculative
transactions. The Group Treasury Committee (GTC) oversees the operation of Group Treasury in accordance with terms of reference
set out by the Board. The Board reviews and approves all major treasury decisions. The GTC currently comprises the Finance Director,
the Director of Accounting, Forecasting and Tax, Director of Investor Communications, Cigar Business Unit Finance Director, Senior
Group Management Accountant Manufacturing, Group Treasurer and Deputy Group Treasurer. The GTC agrees a framework which
sets out the current expectations and boundaries to assist in the effective oversight of Group Treasury activities, covering all key areas
within Group Treasury. The Group Treasurer reports on a regular basis to the Board, including the provision of a monthly treasury
report, which is also provided to the GTC.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group is exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates due to its commercial trading transactions denominated in foreign
currencies, foreign currency cash deposits, borrowings and non-sterling derivatives.
The Group’s policy is to manage its balance sheet translation risk by funding acquisitions and the underlying business assets with
borrowings (post cross currency swaps) in the currency of the underlying net assets. This results in foreign currency profits from
operations being reduced by foreign currency interest costs thereby minimising the translation exposure on foreign currency profits
after tax.
The Group issues debt in the market or markets that are most appropriate at the time of raising new finance and uses derivative
financial instruments, such as cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps where necessary, to change the debt into the desired
currency and into floating interest rates shortly after issue. At 30 September 2009, approximately 13 per cent (2008: 13 per cent) of
adjusted net debt was denominated in sterling, 56 per cent in euro (2008: 62 per cent) and 31 per cent in US dollars (2008: 25 per cent).
In 2009, 82 per cent of revenue (2008: 77 per cent) and 80 per cent of adjusted profit from operations (2008: 74 per cent) was in markets
outside the UK. Certain sales in these markets are invoiced in currencies other than the functional currency of the selling company.
The material foreign currency denominated costs include the purchase of tobacco leaf, which is sourced from various countries but
purchased principally in US dollars, and packaging materials which are sourced from various countries and purchased in a number
of currencies. After taking into account other US dollar inflows the Group currently does not consider the foreign exchange risk here
to be material enough to hedge.
The Group’s sterling dividend to shareholders is partly sourced from foreign subsidiary earnings. In order to provide certainty as to the
amount of sterling available to pay future dividends the Group has entered into transactional cross currency swaps maturing between
2011 and 2015 that will convert forecast euro dividends from subsidiaries into sterling.
Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from borrowings net of cash and cash equivalents. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the
Group to cash flow interest rate risk. Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. Group Treasury
monitors the Group’s borrowing levels using adjusted net debt which excludes interest accruals, the fair value of derivative financial
instruments providing commercial cash flow hedges and finance lease liabilities. The Group’s financial results are currently principally
exposed to gains or losses arising from fluctuations in sterling, euro and US dollar interest rates.
In order to manage the interest rate risk on its borrowings, the Group separates its borrowing activities from its interest rate risk
management decisions by issuing debt in the market or markets that are most appropriate at the time of raising new finance and uses
derivative financial instruments, such as cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps where necessary, to change the debt into the
desired currency and into floating interest rates shortly after issue. The Group then transacts interest rate swaps at other times for
different notional amounts and for different maturities to manage the Group’s exposure to interest rate risk. At 30 September 2009,
32 per cent (2008: 38 per cent) of adjusted net debt was at a floating rate of interest, 67 per cent (2008: 60 per cent) at a fixed rate
of interest and one per cent (2008: two per cent) floating within a set range.
The Group manages its interest rate exposure on a regular basis and reports the position monthly to the Board and GTC. This report
shows the profit or loss impact of a defined interest rate shift for each of the major currencies of borrowings and forecast percentage
of debt fixed for at least the next 10 years, together with other relevant information.
Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
IAS 39 requires that all derivative financial instruments are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in the fair
value being recognised in the income statement unless the instrument satisfies the hedge accounting rules under IFRS and the
Group chooses to designate the derivative financial instrument as a hedge. The Group hedges underlying exposures in an efficient,
commercial and structured manner. However, the strict hedging requirements of IAS 39 may lead to some commercially effective
hedge positions not qualifying for hedge accounting. As a result, the Group has decided not to apply cash flow or fair value hedge
accounting for its derivative financial instruments as permitted under IAS 39. However, the Group does apply net investment hedging,
designating certain borrowings and derivatives as hedges of the net investment in the Group’s foreign operations, as permitted by IAS
39, in order to minimise income statement volatility. See section (vi) below for details. The information contained in sections (ii) and (iii)
below shows the underlying borrowing position before the effect of interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps.

Sensitivity analysis
IFRS 7 requires a sensitivity analysis that illustrates the estimated impact on the income statement and items recognised directly in
equity due to hypothetical changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates in relation to all of the Group’s financial instruments.
The Group considers that the movements in interest rates and sterling foreign exchange rates shown in the table below represent
reasonably possible changes. The impact on income and equity of these changes are shown in the table below. The sensitivity analysis
has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives
portfolio, and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the net investment hedge
designations in place at 30 September 2009. The sensitivity analysis does not reflect any change to sales or costs that may result from
changing interest or exchange rates. All financial assets and liabilities held in the functional currency of subsidiary companies are not
included in the analysis. The analysis excludes instruments that expose the Group to interest rate and foreign exchange risk where
such risk is fully hedged with another financial instrument.

10% appreciation/depreciation of the US dollar (222)/181 (56)/46 (202)/165 (50)/41
The impact in the income statement due to changes in interest rates reflects the effect on the Group’s floating rate debt at
30 September 2009.
The impact in the income statement from foreign exchange rate movements primarily relates to derivative financial instruments that
commercially hedge net investments, but are not accounted for as hedges under IAS 39 (although they are commercially effective).
This value is expected to be fully offset by the retranslation of the hedged foreign currency net assets leaving a net impact on
shareholders’ funds of zero. This gain or loss is excluded from our adjusted performance measures.
The equity impact shown for foreign exchange sensitivity relates to derivative and non-derivative financial instruments hedging net
investments. This value will be more than fully offset by the retranslation of the hedged foreign currency net assets.
Credit risk
The Group is exposed to credit risk arising from its trade receivables due from customers, as well as from cash and cash deposits
and the mark-to-market of derivative financial instruments transacted with financial institutions.
The Group has some significant concentrations of customer credit risk. However, the Group has implemented policies to ensure that
sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history and obtains guarantees or other means of credit support
to reduce the risk where this is considered to be necessary. Analysis of trade and other receivables is provided in note 13.
The Group has no material concentrations of credit risk from financial institutions. The Group has cash and has placed cash deposits
and entered into derivative financial instruments with a diversified group of financial institutions with suitable credit ratings in order to
manage its credit risk to any one financial institution.
The table below summarises the Group’s major financial institution counterparties by credit rating and balances at 30 September 2009:

Financial institution G A+ 81 AA- 70
Management do not expect these counterparties to default on their current obligations.
On 15 September 2008 Lehman Brothers Holdings announced it was filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The Group had
various financial instruments in place with Lehman Brothers International (Europe) at that date. On 2 October 2008 the Group served
a default notice to terminate these financial instruments and filed a claim for settlement of the outstanding mark-to-market plus interest
for £11.1 million. The mark-to-market of these financial instruments was fully provided against at 30 September 2008. The claim was
subsequently sold on to a third party for £2.1 million in September 2009.

Liquidity risk
The Group would be exposed to liquidity risk from having insufficient funds to meet the financing needs of the Group. However, the
Group actively maintains a mixture of short, medium and long-term committed facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has
sufficient available funds for the forecast requirements of the Group over the short to medium-term. At 30 September 2009 the Group
had £3,109 million (2008: £2,053 million) of undrawn committed facilities, maturing between July 2010 and July 2012.
As well as forecasting and monitoring the Group’s core liquidity needs, the Group Treasury function is in regular dialogue with
subsidiary companies to ensure their liquidity needs are met. Subsidiary companies are funded by a combination of share capital and
retained earnings, loans from central finance companies on commercial terms, or through local borrowings by the subsidiaries in
appropriate currencies. Funds over and above those required for short-term working capital purposes by subsidiary companies are
remitted to Group Treasury where practical and possible and are used to pay down debt whenever possible.
The table below summarises the Group’s financial liabilities and derivatives analysed by maturity date based on the remaining period
at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash
flows, which have been calculated using spot rates at the relevant balance sheet date, including interest to be paid. The carrying value
of derivative financial liabilities excludes collateral transferred in respect of certain derivatives with negative fair values for which there is
no reasonable basis upon which to allocate future cash flows to maturity groupings.

Price risk
The Group is not exposed to equity securities price risk or financial instrument price risk other than its pension assets disclosed in
note 18. The Group is exposed to commodity price risk in that there may be fluctuations in the price of tobacco leaf. As with other
agricultural commodities, the price of tobacco leaf tends to be cyclical as supply and demand considerations influence tobacco
plantings in those countries where tobacco is grown. Also, different regions may experience variations in weather patterns that may
affect crop quality or supply and so lead to changes in price. The Group seeks to reduce this price risk by sourcing tobacco leaf from
a number of different countries, sourcing from various counterparties and by varying the levels of tobacco leaf held.

Capital risk management
The Group manages the capital structure in an efficient manner in order to minimise the cost of capital whilst ensuring that we have
access to ongoing sources of finance such as the debt capital markets. The Group defines capital as adjusted net debt (see note 27)
and equity attributable to equity holders of the Company (see note 22). The only externally imposed capital requirements for the Group
are interest cover and gearing covenants under the terms of the Senior Bank Facility.
The Group therefore manages the capital structure to maintain an investment grade credit rating and has and will continue to take the
appropriate measures to maintain this. For example, where new equity is needed, the Group will issue the minimum required in order
to maintain an investment grade credit rating. This is determined in connection with detailed discussions with credit rating agencies.
Fair value estimation
The fair values of derivatives are determined using valuation techniques based on market data (such as yield curves and foreign
exchange rates) to calculate the present value of the estimated future cash flows at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of financial assets and liabilities maturing within one year are approximate to their carrying value. For liabilities with a
maturity of more than one year the fair value is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.

IAS 39 requires that all derivative financial instruments are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in the fair

Group chooses to designate the derivative financial instrument as a hedge. The Group hedges underlying exposures in an efficient,

hedge positions not qualifying for hedge accounting. As a result, the Group has decided not to apply cash flow or fair value hedge
accounting for its derivative financial instruments as permitted under IAS 39. However, the Group does apply net investment hedging,
designating certain borrowings and derivatives as hedges of the net investment in the Group’s foreign operations, as permitted by IAS

The Group separates its borrowing activities from its interest rate risk management decisions by issuing debt in the market or markets
that are most appropriate at the time of raising new finance and using derivative financial instruments, such as cross currency swaps
and interest rate swaps, to change the debt into the desired currency and into floating interest rates shortly after issue.
The following table sets out the derivative financial instruments held by the Group at 30 September 2009, and demonstrates the
Group’s use of those derivative financial instruments to manage the Group’s foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate exposures.
The table presents the nominal value of such instruments used to calculate the contractual payments under such contracts, analysed
by maturity date, together with the related weighted average interest rate where relevant. Seven of the interest rate swaps have
embedded options and assumptions have been made based on market information and third party advice at 30 September 2009 to
determine whether such options are likely to be exercised and when in order to determine the probable maturity date, however the
actual maturity date could be earlier or later depending upon future market conditions.
Debt is issued in the market or markets that are most appropriate at the time of raising new finance.

US$800 million and MAD2,500 million), cross currency swaps of €5,502 million (2008: €5,502 million) and non-deliverable forwards of
MAD1,675 million (2008: MAD1,675 million) have been designated as hedges of the net investment in the Group’s foreign operations.
Gains or losses on the retranslation of these borrowings and derivatives are transferred to equity to offset any gains or losses on
translation of the net investments in the Group’s foreign operations. Permanent intragroup loans with a fair value of €4,284 million
(2008: €4,284 million) have been treated as a reduction in investments in the Group’s foreign operations.
In addition, cross currency swaps of €1,516 million (2008: €1,516 million) and US$nil (2008: US$3,235 million) and foreign exchange
swaps of US$3,235 million (2008: US$nil) are considered to provide commercial hedges against investments in the Group’s foreign
operations. The fair value gains and losses on these derivatives are recognised in the income statement, but are excluded from our
adjusted performance measures.

Set out below is a comparison by category of carrying amounts and fair values of all financial liabilities that are carried in the financial
statements at amounts other than fair values.
All financial assets and liabilities are carried at amortised cost, other than derivative financial instruments that are carried at fair value.
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and trade payables are approximate to their fair value and so
are excluded from the analysis below. Derivative financial instruments are excluded as they are carried at fair value. No assets are held

Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax
liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority. The following amounts, determined after appropriate
offsetting, are shown in the consolidated balance sheet.

Within other temporary differences, deferred tax assets of £180 million (2008: £12 million) are recognised for tax losses carried forward
to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable. Deferred tax assets of £20 million
(2008: £14 million) have not been recognised due to the potential uncertainty of the utilisation of the underlying tax losses in certain
jurisdictions. Of these unrecognised deferred tax assets, £11 million (2008: £9 million) will expire within five years.
Also within other temporary differences, deferred tax assets of £77 million (2008: £54 million) are recognised for tax credits carried
forward to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits are probable.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities
have not been recognised is £8 billion (2008: £6 billion). A provision of £9 million (2008: nil) has been made for taxation expected to
arise on a planned future dividend payment of £125 million from one subsidiary. No other liability has been recognised in respect of
these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences, and it is probable
that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Retirement Benefit Schemes
The Group operates a number of retirement benefit schemes for its employees, including both defined benefit and defined contribution
schemes. The Group’s two principal schemes are final salary defined benefit schemes and are operated by Imperial Tobacco Limited
in the UK and Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH in Germany. The UK scheme’s assets are held in trustee administered funds while
the German scheme is unfunded.
The results of the most recent actuarial valuations for the principal Group schemes (outside Germany) have been updated to
30 September 2009 by Watson Wyatt Limited, actuaries and consultants, in order to determine the amounts to be included in the
balance sheet and income statement. Actuarial valuations of the pension liabilities of Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH pension
schemes were undertaken by Russ, Dr Zimmerman und Partner at 30 September 2009.

The derivation of the overall expected return on assets reflects the actual asset allocation at the measurement date combined with an
expected return for each asset class. The bond return is based on current market yields. The corporate bond yield has been reduced
to allow for an element of default risk. The return on equities and property is based on a number of factors including the income yield
at the measurement date, the long-term growth prospects for the economy in general, the long-term relationship between each asset
class and bond returns, and the movement in market indices since the previous measurement date.
Excluding any self-investment through pooled fund holdings, the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund has no investments (2008: nil) in
Imperial Tobacco Group PLC’s own financial instruments.

The main UK Group scheme is the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund (the ITPF). An actuarial valuation of the ITPF (the triennial valuation
for funding purposes) was made at 31 March 2007 by Watson Wyatt Limited. The assumptions which had the most significant effect
when valuing the ITPF’s liabilities were those relating to the rate of investment return on the ITPF’s existing assets, the rates of increase
in pay and pensions and estimated mortality rates. On the basis that the ITPF is continuing, it was assumed that the future investment
returns relative to market values at the valuation date would be 5.20 per cent per annum and that pay and pension increases would
average 4.5 per cent and 3.0 per cent respectively. The assets were brought into account at their market value.
At 31 March 2007 the market value of the invested assets of the ITPF was £2,951 million. The total assets were sufficient to cover
114 per cent of the benefits that had accrued to members for past service, after allowing for expected future pay increases. The total
assets were sufficient to cover 102 per cent of the total benefits that had accrued to members for past service and future service
benefits for current members. As there was no actuarial deficiency, it was agreed with the trustees that, with effect from 31 March 2007,
no employer contributions are required. The financial position of the ITPF and the level of contributions to be paid will be reviewed at
the next triennial valuation, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2010 and will consider the scheme as at 31 March 2010.

Restructuring provisions relate primarily to European Integration projects announced in June 2008 as part of the integration of Imperial
Tobacco and Altadis. They affect sales and marketing, manufacturing and central support functions in a number of markets and will
be implemented progressively over a period of three years. These liabilities are expected to crystallise over a number of years.
Redundancy and social plan costs have been discounted at 5.0 per cent.
Other provisions principally relate to commercial legal claims and disputes. The majority of other provisions represent the fair value
at acquisition of current and potential Altadis commercial disputes, litigation and duty claims arising in the normal course of business.
These liabilities are expected to crystallise within the next five years.

On 20 May 2008 the Group announced a fully underwritten 1 for 2 rights issue to part finance the Altadis acquisition. The subscription
price of 1,475 pence per share represented a 30.2 per cent discount to the theoretical ex-rights price after adjusting for the interim
dividend, for which new shares issued under the rights issue were not eligible. The rights issue closed on 11 June 2008, by which time
valid acceptances were received in respect of 329,215,281 new shares representing 97.19 per cent of the total number of new shares
offered to shareholders. The remaining 9,526,679 new shares were placed by the underwriters on 12 June 2008. The total number
of new shares issued was 338,741,960. Proceeds of the rights issue, after costs of £93 million, were £4,903 million.

Share Schemes
The Group recognised total expenses of £21 million (2008: £18 million) related to share-based payment transactions during the
year (note 4).
The Group operates a number of share-based employee benefit plans.
International Sharesave Plan
Under the International Sharesave Plan the Board may offer options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company to employees
who enter into a savings contract. The price at which options may be offered varies depending on local laws, but will not be less than
80 per cent of the mid-market price of an Imperial Tobacco Group PLC ordinary share on the London Stock Exchange on the day
prior to invitation. The options may normally be exercised during the six months after expiry of the savings contract, three years after
entering the Plan. The majority of awards under the International Sharesave Plan are equity-settled.
Under the UK Sharesave Plan, which is part of the International Sharesave Plan, the Board may offer options to purchase ordinary
shares in the Company to UK employees who enter into an HM Revenue and Customs approved Save as You Earn (SAYE) savings
contract. The options may normally be exercised during the six months after the expiry of the SAYE contract, either three or five years
after entering the UK Sharesave Plan. The UK Sharesave Plan is equity-settled.
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
Each year since demerger in 1996, annual conditional awards specified as a percentage of base salary have been made under the LTIP
to Executive Directors and senior executives. The conditional awards, which vest three years after grant, are subject to the satisfaction
of specified performance criteria, measured over a three year performance period. All conditional awards are at the discretion of the
Remuneration Committee, with no employee having the right to receive such a conditional award. Further information relating to the
performance criteria and the terms of the LTIP are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
In respect of the November 2005 – November 2008 award, 93.9 per cent of the EPS related element, 77.6 per cent of the TSR related
element linked to the FTSE 100 ranking, and nil per cent of the TSR element linked to the tobacco and alcohol companies comparator
group, vested on 25 November 2008. Overall 66.3 per cent of the award vested on that date.
In respect of the November 2006 – November 2009 award, 100 per cent of the EPS related element, 100 per cent of the TSR related
element linked to the FTSE 100 ranking, and 76.7 per cent of the TSR element linked to the tobacco and alcohol companies comparator
group, vested on 1 November 2009. Overall 94.2 per cent of the award vested on that date.
The majority of the awards under the LTIP are equity-settled.
Share Matching Scheme
The Share Matching Scheme is designed to encourage eligible employees to acquire and retain Imperial Tobacco Group PLC ordinary
shares. All of the awards under the Share Matching Scheme are equity-settled.
Executive Directors and most of the Group’s management may elect to invest any proportion of their gross bonus (capped at 100 per
cent of base salary for the Chief Executive and the Finance Director and 75 per cent for the other Executive Directors) in Imperial
Tobacco Group PLC ordinary shares to be held by the Employee Benefit Trusts. For the financial year ending 30 September 2010 the
cap will be 100 per cent of base salary for the Chief Executive, Finance Director and Chief Operating Officer and 85 per cent for the
Group Sales and Marketing Director. Provided the shares are left in the Trusts for three years, and the individual remains in employment
within the Group, the participant will retain the original shares and receive additional shares on a 1:1 ratio. The matching of the
Executive Directors’ shares is subject to a performance criterion as set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
Employee Share Ownership Trusts
The Imperial Tobacco Group PLC Employee and Executive Benefit Trust and the Imperial Tobacco Group PLC 2001 Employee Benefit
Trust (the Trusts) have been established to acquire ordinary shares in the Company to satisfy rights to shares arising on the exercise
of Sharesave and LTIP options and on the vesting of the Share Matching Schemes. At 30 September 2009, the Trusts held 3.5 million
(2008: 4.9 million) ordinary shares with a nominal value of £350,904. These comprise 3.3 million shares (2008: 4.9 million) acquired
in the open market at a cost of £64.3 million (2008: £93.9 million) and 0.2 million treasury shares (2008: nil) gifted to the Trust by the
Group. The acquisition of shares by the Trusts has been financed by a gift of £19.2 million and an interest free loan of £169.5 million.
None of the Trusts’ shares has been allocated to employees or Executive Directors as at 30 September 2009. All finance costs and
administration expenses connected with the Trusts are charged to the income statement as they accrue. The Trusts have waived their
rights to dividends and the shares held by the Trusts are excluded from the calculation of basic earnings per share.
Cash-settled plan liabilities
As noted above certain awards are cash-settled. The total liability recognised in the balance sheet as at 30 September 2009 in respect
of cash-settled awards was £0.6 million (2008: £0.6 million).

For US sharesave 2009 – granted as ordinary shares and included in the 2009 international sharesave figures.
The exercise price of options/awards is fixed over the life of each option/award, except as described below.
Following the rights issue described in note 20, adjustments were made to the share plans. In respect of the Share Matching Scheme,
the Trustees sold sufficient rights ‘nil paid’ to enable the balance of the rights to be taken up. In the case of the Sharesave and LTIP
plans the number of shares under option, or subject to awards, was adjusted by the relevant bonus factor. In the case of the
Sharesave Scheme the option price was also adjusted by the relevant bonus factor.

Pricing
For the purposes of valuing awards to calculate the share-based payment charge, the Black-Scholes option pricing model has been
used for all the share option and share matching schemes and for the LTIPs except for those granted since November 2005, where
the Monte Carlo model has been used.
A summary of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model for 2009 and 2008 is as follows:
2009 2008
Sharesave Share match Sharesave Share match
Risk-free interest rate 2.2% – 3.0% 1.7% 4.1% – 5.5% 4.1%
Volatility 31.0% – 36.0% 35.0% 24.0% – 26.0% 21.0%
Expected lives of options granted 3 – 5 yrs + 6 mths 3 yrs 3 – 5 yrs + 6 mths 3 yrs
Dividend yield 3.1% 3.1% 3.3% 3.3%
Fair value £4.67 – £4.93 £16.21 £3.77 – £5.30 £19.18
Share price used to determine exercise price £15.67 – £16.13 £17.80 £21.87 – £22.24 £21.17
Exercise price £12.54 – £12.91 n/a £17.50 – £17.81 n/a
Volatility is determined based on the three or five year share price history (the time period being determined by the length of the scheme).
Market condition features were incorporated into the Monte Carlo model for the total shareholder return elements of the LTIP , in
determining fair value at grant date. Assumptions used in this model were as follows:
2009 2008
Future Imperial Tobacco Group share price volatility 28.0% 18.0%
Future Imperial Tobacco Group dividend yield 3.1% 3.3%
Share price volatility of the tobacco and alcohol comparator group 18.0% – 43.0% 12.0% – 27.0%

Acquisitions
2009
On 7 October 2008 the Group paid deferred consideration of US$81 million (£46 million) to acquire the outstanding 49 per cent
minority shareholdings in 800 JR Cigar and MCM Management. The holding was already 100 per cent consolidated as control was
obtained in prior periods.
2008
On 25 January 2008 the Spanish Securities Exchange Commission, the Comision Nacional del Mercado de Valores (CNMV),
announced that acceptances representing 95.81 per cent of Altadis, S.A.’s share capital had been received and Imperial Tobacco’s
offer to purchase Altadis had become unconditional. The Group exercised the squeeze-out provision available under Spanish law on
25 January 2008 to compulsorily purchase the remaining shares at the offer price of €50 per share. The squeeze-out was completed
on 21 February 2008. As a consequence the acquisition was fully consolidated from 25 January 2008 when the Group obtained
control of Altadis.
Through the acquisition of Altadis, the Group acquired direct control of Logista, and pursuant to its obligations under Spanish regulations,
the Group made an offer for those shares in Logista not already owned by Altadis. The offer, at a price of €52.50 per share, completed
on 6 May 2008, resulting in a total shareholding in Logista of 96.92 per cent. The remainder of the shares were subsequently acquired
on 9 June 2008 by using the squeeze-out provision available under Spanish law.
In the period from 25 January 2008 to 30 September 2008, the acquired business contributed revenue of £6,916 million and loss from
operations of £153 million after charging £245 million for amortisation of acquired intangibles and after one-off charges of £118 million
in relation to stock revalued to fair value at acquisition and sold during the period. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 October 2007,
Group revenue would have been £23,602 million and Group profit from operations for the year would have amounted to £1,212 million,
these amounts having been estimated by including Altadis’ results for the four months prior to acquisition adjusted to reflect the Group’s
accounting policies and changes in depreciation and amortisation due to fair value adjustments.
In May 2008, the Group acquired Lignum 2 Inc., a seller of quality discount cigarettes in the United States, for a total of £11 million
cash. Its net assets had nil book and fair value, giving rise to goodwill of £11 million.
During the year the Group also acquired interests in a number of small businesses. The aggregate consideration for these acquisitions
amounted to £3 million. Full IFRS disclosures have not been provided for these small acquisitions as they are not considered to be
significant to the Group as a whole.
During 2005 the Group acquired a 43 per cent interest in Skruf Snus AB. The acquisition agreement included a commitment to acquire
the remaining shares and provided the Group with immediate control of its operating and financial policies. Accordingly the acquisition
was accounted for as a 100 per cent subsidiary to reflect the substance of the transaction. In June 2008 the Group acquired the
remaining 57 per cent for a consideration of £39 million. This amount exceeded the £10 million contingent consideration originally
booked by £29 million, which has been recorded as goodwill. No further consideration is payable to the former shareholders.

The fair value adjustments arising from the acquisition of Altadis were finalised in January 2009, with adjustments made to the
previously published provisional fair values as follows. Provisions and tax liabilities were increased by £7 million and £15 million
respectively and property, plant and equipment were reduced by £3 million. Goodwill on the acquisition of Altadis consequently
increased by £25 million. The consolidated balance sheet at 30 September 2008 has been restated to reflect the finalisation of the
fair value adjustments.
The fair value adjustments represent management’s best estimates of the adjustments required to restate Altadis’ assets from book
value to fair value at acquisition. The principal fair value adjustments are in respect of intangibles, which comprise cigarette and cigar
trademarks and supply contracts and have been independently valued using the income method, and property, plant and equipment
for which we engaged independent valuers. With the exception of premium cigar trademarks that the Directors have determined have
an indefinite life, cigarette and mass market cigar trademarks are being amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful
lives ranging from 20 to 30 years. Supply contracts are being amortised over periods ranging from 3 to 15 years. The goodwill of
£7,023 million arising on the acquisition of Altadis represents a strategic premium to acquire Altadis’ leading positions in the world
cigar market and the western European logistics market, the synergies expected to be realised following acquisition and the
assembled sales, manufacturing and distribution workforces.
The Group’s share of Aldeasa’s assets and liabilities was classified as held for sale upon acquisition and fair valued at that date at
€275 million (£202 million). The investment in Aldeasa was disposed of on 14 April 2008 for cash consideration of €275 million at
no profit or loss.

Legal Proceedings
The Group is currently involved in a number of legal cases in which claimants are seeking damages for alleged smoking and health-related
effects. In the opinion of the Group’s lawyers, the Group has meritorious defences to these actions, all of which are being vigorously
contested. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of the pending litigation, the Directors believe that the pending actions
will not have a material adverse effect upon the results of the operations, cash flow or financial condition of the Group. Consequently,
the Group has not provided for any amounts in respect of these cases in the consolidated financial statements.
In October 2003 the UK Office of Fair Trading (OFT) commenced an investigation under the Competition Act 1998 into the operation
of the UK tobacco supply chain.
On 24 April 2008, the OFT issued a Statement of Objections (SO) which set out the OFT’s allegations against the tobacco
manufacturers Imperial Tobacco Group and Gallaher, and 11 retailers. The OFT alleges that these tobacco manufacturers and retailers
variously engaged in one or more unlawful practices in relation to retail prices for some or all of a number of tobacco products in
breach of Chapter 1 of the Competition Act 1998.
Following the issue of the SO, the OFT invited recipients of the SO to enter into settlement discussions on a ‘without prejudice’ basis
to reach ‘early resolution agreements’ with the OFT. On 11 July 2008, the OFT announced that six of the parties subject to the SO had
reached early resolution agreements with the OFT, agreeing to pay a combined figure of some £132.3 million if all leniency and early
resolution discounts are taken into account. Other than Imperial Tobacco Group, the parties which have also not settled with the OFT
and are therefore contesting the OFT’s allegations, are the Co-operative Group, Morrisons (including Safeway), Shell and Tesco.

1849 Black Sun ImpTob p72_p132:Layout 1 30/11/09  21:40  Page 124 IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2009 125
Imperial Tobacco Group’s detailed written response to the SO was submitted to the OFT on 15 August 2008 and Imperial Tobacco’s
representatives made submissions to the OFT in defence of the allegations at an oral hearing on 3 December 2008.
The OFT indicated in a letter dated 12 October 2009 that it currently intends to notify the parties of its ‘final’ decision in the investigation
in the first quarter of 2010. We have no indication of whether that will be an infringement decision, a file closure decision or some other
form of decision.
If the OFT proceeds to an infringement decision, it may impose a fine. The maximum amount of any fine, under the statutory regime
we believe that the OFT may apply, is 10 per cent of a company’s UK turnover for up to three years (although the actual amount may
be less). By way of example, in the three years to 30 September 2003, Imperial Tobacco Group’s aggregate net UK turnover was
£2,215 million. The applicable turnover on which the amount of a fine is based expressly excludes VAT and other taxes directly related
to turnover, which Imperial Tobacco Group has been advised would also exclude duty. In addition, if the OFT were to make an infringement
finding, it could issue orders prohibiting that activity in the future, whilst the infringing company might face the prospect of damages
actions from third parties. If the OFT were to make an infringement decision, Imperial Tobacco Group would be able to appeal the
OFT’s decision to the Competition Appeal Tribunal, and ultimately, on a point of law to the Court of Appeal.
We take compliance with competition law very seriously and reject any suggestion that we have acted in any way contrary to the
interests of consumers. Consequently, the Group has not provided for any amount in the consolidated financial statements.

We have audited the parent company financial statements of Imperial Tobacco Group PLC for the year ended 30 September 2009
which comprise the Balance Sheet and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation
is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the parent
company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the parent company
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Sections
495 to 497 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility
for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly
agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the Audit of the Financial Statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall
presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on Financial Statements
In our opinion the parent company financial statements:
– give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 30 September 2009;
– have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
– have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on Other Matters Prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion
– the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 2006; and
– the information given in the Report of the Directors for the financial year for which the parent company financial statements are
prepared is consistent with the parent company financial statements.
Matters on Which We Are Required to Report by Exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
– adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received
from branches not visited by us; or
– the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement
with the accounting records and returns; or
– certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
– we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Other Matter
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Imperial Tobacco Group PLC for the year ended 30 September 2009.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Imperial Tobacco Group PLC Balance Sheet
at 30 September 2009 IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2009 129
Basis of Preparation
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis in accordance with the historical cost convention,
the Companies Act 2006 and UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, no separate profit and loss account has been presented for the Company.
The Company has not presented a cash flow statement or provided details of related party transactions as permitted under FRS 1
(revised) “Cash flow statements” and FRS 8 “Related party disclosures” respectively. As permitted by FRS 29, the Company has
elected not to present FRS 29 “Financial instruments: disclosures” in the notes to its individual financial statements as full equivalent
disclosures are presented in the consolidated financial statements.
The principal accounting policies are set out below.
Investments Held as Fixed Assets
Investments held as fixed assets comprise the Company’s investment in subsidiaries and are shown at cost less any provision
for impairment.
Dividends
Final dividends are recognised as a liability in the Company’s financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved
by shareholders, while interim dividends are recognised in the period in which the dividends are paid.
Financial Instruments
Non-derivative financial assets are classified as debtors (including cash). Debtors are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently
stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method, subject to reduction for allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
A provision for impairment of receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect
all amounts due according to the original terms of those receivables. The amount of the provision is the difference between the
asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, and is recognised in the profit and loss account.
For interest-bearing assets, the carrying value includes accrued interest receivable.
(i) Dividends
Amounts recognised as distributions to ordinary shareholders in the year:
In £s million 2009 2008
Final dividend for the year ended 30 September 2008 of 42.2p per share (2007: 42.2p) 427 326
Interim dividend for the year ended 30 September 2009 of 21.0p per share (2008: 20.9p) 213 161
640 487
A final dividend for the year ended 30 September 2009 of 52.0 pence per share has been proposed. This amounts to £527 million
based on the number of shares ranking for dividend at 30 September 2009. At the year end, the shareholders had not yet approved
the final dividend and therefore it is not included in the balance sheet as a liability.
The dividend per share figures included in the table above reflect the bonus element of the rights issue as described in note 20 of the
consolidated financial statements.
(ii) Investments Held as Fixed Assets
In £s million 2009 2008

On 20 May 2008 the Group announced a fully underwritten 1 for 2 rights issue to part finance the Altadis acquisition. The subscription
price of 1,475 pence per share represented a 30.2 per cent discount to the theoretical ex-rights price after adjusting for the interim
dividend, for which new shares issued under the rights issue were not eligible. The rights issue closed on 11 June 2008, by which time
valid acceptances were received in respect of 329,215,281 new shares representing 97.19 per cent of the total number of new shares
offered to shareholders. The remaining 9,526,679 new shares were placed by the underwriters on 12 June 2008. The total number
of new shares issued was 338,741,960. Proceeds of the rights issue, after costs of £93 million, were £4,903 million.

Profit for the year
As permitted by section 408(3) of the Companies Act 2006, the profit and loss account of the Company is not presented. The profit
attributable to shareholders, dealt with in the financial statements of the Company, is £826 million (2008: £601 million).
Purchase of treasury shares
In 2009 and 2008 the Company did not buy back any ordinary Imperial Tobacco shares following the suspension of the programme
on 8 February 2007.
The total number of shares held in treasury is 51,481,000 (2008: 51,717,000) representing 4.8 per cent (2008: 4.8 per cent) of the
issued share capital. The total cost, including expenses, of shares held in treasury is £862 million (2008: £862 million). The shares
purchased to date have not been cancelled but are held in a treasury shares reserve and represent a deduction from equity shareholders’
funds (see note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The reduction during the year in the number of shares held in treasury
is due to a gift of 236,000 shares to the Employee Share Ownership Trusts.

(viii) Contingent Liabilities
Imperial Tobacco Group PLC has guaranteed various borrowings and liabilities of certain UK and overseas subsidiary undertakings,
including various Dutch and Irish subsidiaries. At 30 September 2009, the contingent liability totalled £11,464 million (2008: £11,161 million).
The guarantees include the Dutch subsidiaries which, in accordance with Book 2, Article 403 of The Netherlands Civil Code, do not
file separate financial statements with the Chamber of Commerce. Under the same article, Imperial Tobacco Group PLC has issued
declarations to assume any and all liabilities for any and all debts of the Dutch subsidiaries.
The guarantees also cover the Irish subsidiaries, all of which are included in the consolidated financial statements as at 30 September 2009.
The Irish companies, namely John Player & Sons Limited, John Player Distributors Limited and Imperial Tobacco Mullingar have therefore
availed themselves of the exemption provided by section 17 of the Irish Companies (Amendment) Act 1986 in respect of documents
required to be attached to the annual returns for such companies.
The Directors have assessed the fair value of the above guarantees and do not consider them to be material. They have therefore
not been recognised on the balance sheet.
(ix) Other Information
Number of employees
The average number of employees during 2009 was nil (2008: nil).
Directors’ emoluments
Details of Directors’ emoluments and interests are provided within the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 55 to 70.
These disclosures form part of the financial statements.

Adjusted attributable earnings
Adjusted profit after tax attributable
to the equity holders of the company.
Adjusted distribution margin
The adjusted profit from operations
for the Logistics segment divided by
distribution fees for the Logistics segment.
Adjusted measures
Management believes that reporting
adjusted measures provides a useful
comparison of business performance
and reflects the way in which the business
is controlled. Accordingly, adjusted
measures of profit from operations, net
finance costs, profit before tax, taxation,
attributable earnings and earnings
per share exclude, where applicable,
amortisation of acquired intangibles,
restructuring costs, retirement benefits
net financing income, fair value gains and
losses on derivative financial instruments
in respect of commercially effective
hedges, one-off acquisition accounting
adjustments, brand divestment gains
and related taxation effects. The adjusted
measures in this report are not defined
terms under International Financial
Reporting Standards and may not be
comparable with similarly titled measures
reported by other companies.
Adjusted net debt
Management monitors the Group’s
borrowing levels using adjusted net debt
which excludes interest accruals, the fair
value of derivative financial instruments
providing commercial cash flow hedges
and finance lease liabilities.
Adjusted operating margin

the Tobacco business divided by net
revenue for the Tobacco segment.
Adjusted profit from operations
Profit from operations adjusted for
amortisation of acquired intangibles,
restructuring costs, one-off acquisition

divestment gains.
Amortisation
A systematic charge to the income
statement to write off the value of
intangible assets with finite lives over
their useful lives.
Attributable earnings
Profit after tax attributable to the
equity holders of the company.
Cash conversion rate
Cash conversion is calculated as cash
flow from operations before tax payments
less net capital expenditure relating
to property, plant and equipment and
software as a percentage of adjusted
profit from operations.
Distribution fees
Distribution fees comprises the Logistics
segment revenue excluding the cost
of distributed products. Management
considers this an important measure
in assessing the profitability of
Logistics operations.
Earnings per share – adjusted
Adjusted profit after tax attributable to the
equity holders of the Company divided by
the weighted average number of shares
in issue during the period excluding shares
held to satisfy employee share plans and
shares purchased by the Company and

Earnings per share – basic
Profit after tax attributable to equity holders
of the Company divided by the weighted
average number of shares in issue during
the period excluding shares held to
satisfy employee share plans and shares
purchased by the Company and
held as Treasury shares.
Earnings per share – diluted
As for basic earnings per share except that
the weighted average number of shares

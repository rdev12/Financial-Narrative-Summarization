in selected markets in the UK, 
North America, Spain and Gibraltar. 
We seek to add shareholder value
through the achievement of profitable
growth and by improving capital
management. Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2005 1

(Represents interim dividends declared and paid and 
ﬁnal dividend for the year as declared by the Board) 2 Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2005
In 2005 we:
• Achieved a robust performance, 
despite challenging conditions in 
the UK
• Continued to grow our housing 
operations in North America
• Increased our investment in our 
housing operations in Spain
• Substantially exited our property 
operations
• Reduced gearing to 23.7%
• Increased land in all markets
Maintaining growth in dividends
through the cycle
In line with our intention at the half year
to increase full-year dividends by 20 per
cent, the Board recommends an
increase in the ﬁnal dividend for 2005 to
8.9 pence from 8.1 pence in 2004. This,
together with the interim dividend of 4.5
pence paid on 1 November 2005, makes
a total dividend for the year of 13.4 pence,
an increase of 21 per cent. Subject to
conﬁrmation at the Annual General
Meeting on 3 May 2006, the dividend will
be paid on 3 July 2006 to shareholders
on the register at close of business on 
2 June 2006.
This dividend will be paid as a
conventional cash dividend but
shareholders are once again being offered
the opportunity to reinvest some or all 
of their dividend under the Dividend 
Re-Investment Plan, details of which 
are contained in a separate circular to
shareholders.
Board Changes

Board, I would like to extend our sincere
Chairman’ s Statement
2005 has shown the beneﬁts of our
strategy of operating in different
geographical and product markets and
allocating capital where we see the best
opportunities. The UK market has
continued to be subdued in 2005, although
the stability of prices assisted by a quarter
point interest rate cut in August
contributed to improved reservation rates
in the second half. Our housing business
in North America continued to beneﬁt
from strong markets, resulting in another
year of signiﬁcant organic growth. We
also achieved excellent results in Spain.
Norman Askew, Chairman
thanks for his exceptional contribution to
the Group over his 39 year career with us.
Our people
The performance that we have achieved
this year is a reﬂection of the skill and
enthusiasm of our team members. I
would like to take this opportunity to thank
all of my colleagues throughout the Group
for their hard work over the year.
As a business we are also dependent 
on our customers, trading partners, 
shareholders and our other stakeholders.
I would like to take this opportunity to
offer our thanks for all the support they
give us.

Chief Executive’ s Review
Our presence in different markets
provides us with alternative growth
channels. These enable us to allocate
capital where we see the best
opportunities for returns and optimises
our ability to mitigate any short term
weakness in any particular market or 
sub market.
Housing
Our housing operations worldwide
reported a slight rise in proﬁt from
operations* to £456.0m (2004: 448.8m)
on turnover of £2,864.9m (2004:
£2,876.6m). During 2005 we sold a total
of 12,516 homes, compared to 13,092 
in 2004.
As expected, the UK market continued 
to be relatively subdued in 2005 after a
number of years of unusually strong
performance came to an end in the
second half of 2004. We sold 8,178
homes in the UK in 2005 (2004: 9,053).
We saw a fall in visitor numbers,
resulting from a lack of conﬁdence due 
to widespread forecasts of a house price
collapse that did not materialise. This fall
was partially offset by improvements in
our conversion rate of visitors into
customers. 
T aylor Woodrow has completed the
transformation from a group of diverse,
semi-autonomous companies into 
one focused housing business. 
In order to achieve continuing growth 
in shareholder value, we conduct our
business through a portfolio of 
selected housing markets – across 
the UK and within North America, 
Spain and Gibraltar.
Proﬁt from operations* was £233.4m
(2004: £301 .1m). The reduction in our UK
Housing operating margin from 15.6 per
cent in 2004 to 14.2 per cent in 2005
reﬂects the difﬁcult conditions that we
faced and the impact of reduced
volumes on overhead absorption not
withstanding year on year reduction in
overhead costs. 
The second half of 2005 saw the
potential for a return to a more favourable
environment and our order book of
£41 1m at the end of 2005 (2004: £407m)
sees us well-placed for 2006. 
During 2005 we have grown our UK
landbank of owned and controlled plots
to 34,985 (2004: 32,459) of which 41 per
cent is sourced from strategic land. Our
strategic landbank has also grown and
we now have 80,000 potential plots,
most of which are held under option.
Options enable us to purchase land at an
agreed discount to open market value
when planning is received, with no
obligation to buy if satisfactory planning
is not forthcoming. 
During 2005, 19 per cent of our home
completions were from strategic land
holdings. We continue to build the

majority of our homes on brownﬁeld
land, with 68 per cent of completions in
2005 coming from this source.
In the challenging conditions experienced
in the UK housing market this year, we
have made good progress on strategy by
improving our forward sales position,
managing our cost base and providing for
future growth. During the year we have 
also delivered the £25m of synergies
identiﬁed at the time of the Wilson
Connolly transaction. We saw improved
reservation rates towards the end of
2005, albeit against low comparatives,
which has enabled us to enter 2006 
with an increased order book. We
continue to operate regional ofﬁces 
that are serviced by support functions
based at our central ofﬁce in Solihull, 
and have an organisational structure in 
place to support growth as market
conditions allow.
Our operations in North America had an
excellent year, beneﬁting from increased
investment and careful target marketing.
We saw another year of strong organic
growth, with proﬁt from operations*
growing by 56 per cent to £199.6m.
Return on capital employed rose again 
to 49.2 per cent (2004: 39.2 per cent). 
Our business in Phoenix, Arizona
continues to perform strongly, with over
1,000 home completions in 2005. Our
strategy of acquiring large land parcels
where we retain the premier plots for our
homebuilding business continues to
generate exceptional results. 
In California, we continue to beneﬁt from
our reputation as a luxury homebuilder.
Whilst at the same time we have now
successfully moved our product offerings
into the mid-market, where we offer
quality homes with high brand values 
at premium prices.
Our Florida business continues to
experience strong growth as we have
increased the scale of our homebuilding
operations. All of our low-rise operations
are well placed for continued growth,
having made promising land acquisitions
in 2005 and previous years. During the
year, we also completed several luxury
high-rise waterfront condominiums
which enhanced our proﬁts and returns.
The California, Arizona and Florida
markets all experienced strong price
growth in 2005, albeit partially offset by
increased construction costs. Sourcing
land in these markets remains
competitive, however we continue to
ﬁnd attractive opportunities to replenish
and grow our landbanks.
In recent years, the markets in T exas have
not seen the exuberance of other states
where we operate. However during the
fourth quarter of 2005 we experienced
increasing demand for our homes.
Our business in Ontario, Canada,
continues to provide excellent returns.
The greater T oronto area remains a supply
constrained market ensuring demand for
well located high quality developments.
2005 has been another year of growth
for our operations in Spain and Gibraltar.
Proﬁt from operations has grown by 
14 per cent to £23.0m. We continue 
to focus on the British second home
market in our three core regions of the
Balearic Islands, Alicante and Malaga,
where we offer a mix of apartments 
and townhouses. Our Los Arqueros
development, near Marbella, has recently
been declared 'Best Spain Development'
as one of ﬁve awards achieved at the
prestigious Bentley International 
Property Awards. In Gibraltar we focus 
on the premium end of the market,

Chief Executive’ s Review continued
As the Government seeks
to address the chronic

development agenda,

to ensure that practicalities
of implementation are

selling offplan well in advance of the start
of construction.
Construction and property
T aylor Woodrow Construction has also
had a successful year in terms of
industry recognition. As well as being
voted Contract Journal's 'Building
Contractor of the Y ear' for 2005, our work
on the new stand at The Oval received
praise and signiﬁcant media exposure 
as the Ashes cricket series drew to a 
nail-biting close. 
As previously announced, we completed
the sale of the K2 development at St.
Katharine’ s Dock in London on 1 July
2005. This substantially completes our
exit from property operations. We have,
however, retained the expertise required
to deliver future 'mixed use' schemes in
our housing business.
Prospects for 2006
The long term imbalance between
demand and supply for new housing,
added to continuing low UK interest
rates, continue to underpin the market.
However, margin pressures remain with
consented land in short supply and the
need for increased use of incentives in 
a tighter market. Larger builders are 
likely to fare better in this environment.
We are addressing these issues through
increasing the pull-through of our
strategic landbank, working with our
supplier base to drive out cost and
increasing the use of our rationalised
range of standard housetypes. 
A large amount of potential legislation is
pending to accompany the introduction
of new technical standards as the
Government seeks to address the
chronic shortage of developable land in
the UK and pursue its sustainable
development agenda. T aylor Woodrow
plays an active part in consultation to
ensure that practicalities of
implementation are considered in
Government planning. Whilst we broadly
welcome the thrust of the Government’ s
intent, we remain concerned about the
country’ s ability to deliver consented 
land without a wholesale overhaul of 
the current planning regime. We are
encouraged by the Government’ s
apparent determination to bring about
reform in this area.
We have experienced substantial levels
of house price inﬂation in parts of North
America over the last two years, which
has been reﬂected in our strong
performance. Although pricing strength
and demand moderated during the
fourth quarter of 2005, we remain
conﬁdent that we can successfully
deliver superior results in a more normal
market. Due to our record forward order
book and strong landbank, we anticipate
a successful 2006.
The market for second homes in Spain
continues to be attractive, with demand
remaining robust from British buyers. As
in the UK and North America, we have an
in-depth knowledge of the markets that
we operate in under an experienced and
capable team of local managers. 
Therefore, we will continue to invest all
across our portfolio in the best interests
of our shareholders.

Operating Performance Review continued
A Homebuilder of Choice
With over 95 per cent of proﬁt from
operations *coming from housing,
T aylor Woodrow’ s aim is to be the
homebuilder of choice in our selected
markets across the United Kingdom
and within North America, Spain and
Gibraltar. T aylor Woodrow seeks to 
build sustainable shareholder value
through the business cycle. The Board’ s
conﬁdence in the long-term fundamental
characteristics of our markets is
supported by the Board’ s commitment
to a 20% increase in the full year
dividends declared for 2005.
The markets in which we operate share
characteristics that sustain demand 
for new homes. In the UK, an ageing
housing stock, increasing numbers of
households, and an increasingly
complex process for the delivery of
those additional homes, combine to
create ever widening disparity between
demand and supply.
This complexity arises in a variety of
different ways. Regulatory design
constraints, onerous planning
requirements and remediation of
brownﬁeld sites all present additional
difﬁculties for housebuilding operations. 
The company’s UK homebuilding
business has the commercial and
construction skills necessary to
compete effectively in this challenging
but rewarding market. 
Our US markets are in the sunbelt
states. All beneﬁt from inward migration
from the colder Northern states. Arizona
and Florida beneﬁt from healthy and
sustainable demand for retirement and
second homes, whilst California and
T exas enjoy markets sustained by high
levels of employment. In Canada, our
business also beneﬁts from immigration
and economic growth.
Spain and Gibraltar present good growth
prospects within the European second
home market and our mainly British-
based customers beneﬁt from the
reassurance of buying from a familiar UK
brand name backed by over 40 years’
experience in this market. 
We are proud of the achievements of our
people and their commitment to our
company’ s success. In 2005 the success
of investing in the wellbeing, training and
development of our people, from senior
managers to trade apprentices, is
demonstrated by the wealth of industry
awards that our team members win
across a wide variety of disciplines. 
These included the NHBC’ s highest level
of ‘Pride in the Job’ recognition; a
Supreme Award amongst 29 individual
Quality Award winners in the UK.
Four US Building Industry Association
‘Pinnacle’ Awards and eight National
Sales and Marketing Council’ s Awards
were among the highlights achieved 
by North American team members.

Sales and Marketing team of the year

Association. Scaffolding in progress

Overall group housing had a satisfactory
year. Strong North American markets
compensated for a challenging year in
the UK. Average sales price was up 3 per
cent to £204k (2004: £199k) - and
operating margins by 0.3 percentage
points to 15.9 per cent - helping to offset
a reduction in volumes. Housing proﬁt
from operations*rose 2 per cent to
£456.0m (2004: £448.8m). 
49 per cent of 2005 housing proﬁt 
from operations* came from overseas
operations (2004: 33 per cent). This
reﬂects both our decision to increase
investment into those markets over the
last few years, and their relative strength
compared to the UK. 
We remain well placed to grow our
housing business, with the group order
book up 16.5 per cent to £1 .32bn (2004:
£1 .13bn) and the group landbank up 
18 per cent at 75,160 plots (2004: 
63,701 plots).
Results
Consolidated revenue for the year to 
31 December 2005 was up 5 per cent 
at £3,476.9m (2004: £3,31 1 .5m). Proﬁt
before tax was 2 per cent up on the
previous year at £41 1 .0m (2004:
£403.9m), with an increase in housing
proﬁt*accompanied by a smaller
contribution from property and
construction.
At 31 December 2005, total equity
before minority interests was £1,928.4m
(2004: £1,702.8m). Net debt was
£456.9m (2004: £538.8m). Net gearing
was 23.7 per cent (2004: 31 .6 per cent).
Basic and adjusted earnings per share
was 50.6 pence (2004: 49.1 pence basic
and 51 .1 pence adjusted). Equity
shareholders’ funds per share increased
by 1 1 .4 per cent to 338.4 pence.

During 2005, the UK housing market was
challenging, with overall demand lower
than in 2004. Visitor levels over the year
were approximately 20 per cent down on
2004 but this was partially compensated
for by a higher conversion rate. We made
good progress on strategy by improving
our forward sales position, managing our
cost base and providing for future growth
by increasing the landbank. 
Against the market average, the company
delivered a strong sales performance
during 2005. Demand in the ﬁnal quarter
was stronger than in the equivalent
period of 2004 and we start 2006 with an
order book of £41 1m, up 1 per cent on
last year, from 4.2 per cent fewer sites.
Average selling prices were lower at
£185k (2004: £197k), with the reduction
mainly attributable to a higher proportion
of social housing and apartment
completions than last year. The average
square footage of our homes in the UK
fell as a consequence from 1,032 sq ft to
960 sq ft. 
Bryant Design provides an attractive
options programme that provides a ‘one-
stop’ , convenient solution for ﬂooring,
kitchen, garden, bathroom, lighting and
ﬁttings enhancements to our standard
home package. In 2005, 73 per cent
(2004: 69 per cent) of our customers
took advantage of the Bryant Design
service to personalise their home.
Operating margins* fell to 14.2 per cent
(2004: 15.6 per cent). This includes the
beneﬁt of higher than usual land sales
during the year, primarily due to the
disposal of our interest in the Quartermile
project in Edinburgh, the sale of which
was completed in January. 
We continue to focus on cost control,
reducing overhead costs through supply
chain management, use of standard
housetypes and pull-through from
strategic land. Through our logistics
business, WCL (acquired as part of the
Wilson Connolly business), we have
managed to reduce materials costs,
improve quality and speed up delivery
times by implementing an integrated
solution that works in partnership with
our key materials suppliers.
We continue to reduce the overall
number of suppliers, achieve common
standards and quality controls, with
challenging performance criteria for
suppliers. In conjunction with our
partners we have also developed
commercial solutions that streamline 
the ordering, veriﬁcation and payment
administration burden. 
We are particularly pleased with the
progress of our timber frame construction
company, Prestoplan (also acquired with
Wilson Connolly), which achieved record
results in 2005 and has embarked on an
expansion programme that will develop
its position as one of the UK’ s leading
timber frame suppliers. A second off-site
manufacturing facility has been opened
this year at Quedgeley in Gloucestershire
to complement the existing facility. 
Operating Performance Review continued
Our strategic landbank
is a key strength with
some 18,300 gross acres
representing 80,000
potential plots. T ypically,
land acquired this way 
is secured on option at 
a discount to the open
market, and this has
helped us to manage the
average cost of plots in
our landbank. Design and innovation will continue to be a key theme for
Bryant, to meet customers needs. We work with planning
authorities to design developments that meet the housing
needs of the locality, while being sensitive to issues of
context and environment.

Although planning remains difﬁcult, we
have been successful in securing
consents on strategic land. In 2005 we
obtained approval for 2,300 sustainable
homes in Swindon, the largest current
greenﬁeld site in Southern Britain. 
As a result of this and prudent purchasing
in the land market, we have increased
our landbank by 8 per cent to 34,985
plots (2004: 32,459 plots).
In 2005, 68 per cent (2004: 64 per cent)
of our developments in the UK were on
brownﬁeld sites and we seek, in
partnership with central and local
government, to develop all our land
responsibly with due regard to local
sensitivities. Several of our largest
schemes, including Grand Union 
Village in Northolt and the Swindon
Development Area have been cited 
as model schemes by local authorities
and Urban Design programmes.
Our strategic landbank is a key strength
with some 18,300 gross acres
representing 80,000 potential plots.
T ypically, land acquired this way is
secured on option at a discount to the
open market, and this has helped us to
manage the average cost of plots in our
landbank. The beneﬁts of this investment
continue to be realised, with 19 per cent
of completions coming from plots
originally sourced from our strategic
landbank (2004:18 per cent). Around 41
per cent of our landbank has been
sourced through our strategic land
programme, with the resulting beneﬁts
to be realised in future years.

in Leith is a key part of Edinburgh’ s waterside
regeneration. Combined housing and
development expertise within the business
has also delivered Newington Grange – a
remarkable refurbishment and new build
project in one of the city’ s most desirable areas. 
Y orkshire and North East
The Y orkshire and North East region has its
regional ofﬁce in Leeds. Sites range from
Centurion Square in the heart of historic Y ork
to Carey Meadows’ development of executive
detached homes in Longhoughton in
Northumberland, and Newcastle Great Park’ s
phased development of some 2,500 energy
efﬁcient new homes.
North W est
Based in Warrington, the North West region
sold in excess of 1,000 homes from over 30
active sites during the year. The Deck at
Runcorn Old Quay is a waterside project of
466 apartments set to transform the region
and breathe new life into the town, while the
Botanic in Ancoats will be part of the New
Islington Millennium community regenerating
east central Manchester. 
West Midlands
West Midlands region is based at the
company’ s central ofﬁces in Solihull and offers
a diverse range of homes from traditional
family properties to both new build and
refurbished apartments. Work has also
commenced on the major regeneration of
Diglis Basin in Worcester to provide new
homes in a vibrant community alongside the
River Severn.
East Midlands
From its base in Leicester, East Midlands
provides new homes across Derbyshire,
Leicestershire, Lincolnshire and
Northamptonshire and manages several large
scale brownﬁeld redevelopments on ex-public
sector land. In Northampton, for example, two
former hospital sites, St Crispins and
Mansﬁeld Grange have both been
transformed into impressive communities
incorporating sensitive refurbishment of
historic buildings.
Anglia 
The counties of Norfolk, Suffolk and
Cambridgeshire are covered by our Anglia
regional ofﬁce, based in Newmarket. A key
feature of the region is the broad range of
housing offered, including affordable homes
for key workers and ﬁrst-time buyers as well
as family homes. The company is playing a
lead role in establishing the new town of
Cambourne near Cambridge to help meet the
area’ s high demand for additional housing.
Eastern 
Eastern Region covers Bedfordshire,
Hertfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Essex,
including the key development areas along the
M1, A1 and M1 1 corridors where we have
very high quality landbank holdings. From
ofﬁces in Welwyn Garden City the region is
sensitive to this part of England’ s architectural
heritage. Many of its developments are
designed to blend with vernacular styling
whilst its ﬂagship site redeveloping part of 
the old barracks in Colchester revealed the
remains of a Roman circus track for chariot
racing. The traces of the remains will be
suitably marked for future generations at 
the same time as some 2,500 new homes 
are created.
South W est and W ales 
Developments in Gloucestershire, Wiltshire,
Somerset, Devon and South Wales are
managed from a South West ofﬁce based near
Bristol. Sites range from the high proﬁle 477
apartment Victoria Wharf at the revitalised
Cardiff Bay to a selection of traditional homes
of varying size in Cotswolds towns like
Cirencester and Cheltenham. The region has
been particularly successful in acquiring new
land and building a growing reputation In
South Wales.
South
Based in Newbury, the South region is
responsible for our developments south of
Oxford, west of Surrey and Sussex and east of
UK Housing Organisation
Our UK business operates across the UK and is organised
currently into 1 1 regions designed to provide cost effective
management of around 200 individual developments at 
any one time. We aim to achieve optimal scale economies
from our national presence predominantly under our Bryant
Homes brand, without compromising the value of our
regional ofﬁces’ local market knowledge.

Design and innovation will continue 
to be a key theme for Bryant, to meet
customers needs. We work with
planning authorities to design
developments that meet the housing
needs of the locality, while being
sensitive to issues of context and
environment. Our standard range of
home designs provides homes that meet
a diverse set of customer needs, whilst
ensuring that optimal use is made of
space and natural light at minimum build
cost. Through Bryant Connect we offer
UK buyers unique technology and 
multi-media solutions, as well as
advanced security systems. It’ s also
important to us that home-buying is
made as straightforward and as stress-
free as possible and we strive to achieve
this by constantly reviewing our
‘Customer Journey’ process to ensure
that it meets the needs of Bryant home-
buyers.

homes in locations such as Petersﬁeld and
Basingstoke. The company is playing a major
part in the regeneration of a signiﬁcant area of
Poole, which will eventually result in 3,000
new homes for the popular coastal town.
London
Based in Watford, the London region covers
the Greater London area, where opportunities
increasingly involve the redevelopment of
previously used brownﬁeld land. The team is
currently developing large scale urban
regeneration schemes at Grand Union Village
in the West of the capital, Vision 7 in Islington,
North London and Greenwich Millennium
Village to the South East. The region also has
six sites in and around Bromley including a 94
home development set in a 70 acre private
country estate at Holwood in Keston.
South East
The South East region based in Crawley,
covering Kent, Surrey and Sussex provides a
wide variety of house styles within easy
commuting distance of London. Current sites
include the centrally located Delta Riverside
development in Maidstone, a range of stylish
new homes in Canterbury and a waterfront
development at Shoreham by Sea near
Brighton. 20 Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2005

Our operations in North America had an
excellent year, beneﬁting from the
increased investment over the past few
years, as well as from a strong market.
Proﬁt from operations* increased by 56
per cent to £199.6m (2004: £127 .6m),
driven by 8.2 per cent growth in home
completions and a 2.7 percentage point
improvement in operating margins. 
We continue to improve our forward
sales position with the order book 14 per
cent higher (excluding high-rise, 38 per
cent) than at year -end 2004, at 
US$1 .42bn. 
The landbank increased by 26 per cent to
37 ,910 plots (2004: 30,009 plots). More
than half our landbank is controlled
through options rather than owned,
which improves capital efﬁciency. We
also continue to manage actively our
landbank by selling plots to other builders
where we consider it to be value creating. 
Our Florida operations cover both coasts
from T ampa Bay to Naples on the Gulf 
of Mexico and from Jacksonville to Fort
Lauderdale on the Atlantic. We offer 
a wide range of middle market to luxury
homes and condominiums targeted to
move-up families, retirees, and second
home purchasers. This year, the Florida
market continued the trend of 2004 and
remained strong. During 2005, we
completed 752 homes (2004: 505) at an
average sales price of US$727k (2004:
US$544k). The Florida average selling
price increased signiﬁcantly by three
high-rise beachfront condominiums that
completed in the second half of the year. 
Our California operations are
concentrated in two key markets. In 
the North, we have a growing urban inﬁll
business that caters to the local working
population with a range of products 
from townhomes to mid-market family
homes. Our business in Southern
California focuses mainly on the mid-
market in Riverside and San Bernandino
counties but also sells luxury homes on
the Southern Californian coast. Some
parts of the market are showing signs of
cooling after several years of considerable
price appreciation. Therefore, we have
continued to operate mainly in the
stronger mid-market as opposed to the
luxury segment. We have also expanded
our footprint by re-entering the Palm
Springs market. The average sales price
in 2005 was US$835k (2004: US$776k),
with home completions up 3 per cent at
721 homes (2004: 697).
Our Arizona division serves the Phoenix
metropolitan area and continued its
exceptional performance, targeting entry
level and mid-market homebuyers.
Recent sales releases indicate that the
market is moderating with price
appreciation levelling off, although
Phoenix is one of the fastest growing
cities in the US, beneﬁting from
migration from other less affordable
markets. Home completions increased
by 20 per cent to 1,009 (2004: 841) with
average sales price up 14 per cent to
US$209k (2004: US$183k). 
In T exas we are growing our homebuilding
operations in both Austin and Houston.

In Ontario, Canada, the group trades
under the Monarch brand which beneﬁts
from a long-standing reputation for
quality and value. Operating in the
Greater T oronto area and Ottawa in
southern Ontario, Monarch builds both
low-rise, mid-market family homes and
high-rise condominiums as well as
affordable, urban townhomes.
Completions in the year of 2005 were
1,260 homes (2004: 1,498). The average
sales price was Can$326k (2004:

In North America, we meet our
customers’ needs through a mixture of
high-quality targeted developments,
professional ﬁnishes, and exceptional
customer service. Our ‘Inspired By Y ou’
programme ensures that customers
remain at the very top of our priorities by
giving them opportunity for direct input
into the design, construction and

Construction
Our construction business continues 
to build on its reputation with a growing
portfolio of blue-chip and public sector
clients, including T esco, T exaco and the
NHS and winning a number of industry
awards in 2005, including Contract
Journal’ s ‘Building Contractor of the Y ear,

partly accounted for by lower income

Over the past few years T aylor Woodrow
has progressed our stated strategy of

Accordingly, segmental analysis of this

Equity Shareholders’ funds
At the end of 2005, shareholders’ funds
were £1,928.4m, up from £1,702.8m at
the end of 2004. Equity shareholders’
funds per ordinary share rose to 338.4
pence at the end of 2005. This represents
an increase of 1 1 .4 per cent from the
previous year.
Shareholders' returns
Basic earnings per share increased 
by 3.1 per cent to 50.6 pence. The
proposed ﬁnal dividend of 8.9 pence
produces a total return of 13.4 pence per
ordinary share, an increase of 21 per cent
over last year. This level of dividend is
consistent with the Board’ s policy of
paying progressive dividends through 
the business cycle. 
Also, during the year, the Board has
decided to re-balance the levels of
interim and ﬁnal dividends to reﬂect a
more usual weighting of proﬁts between
the ﬁrst and second halves of the
ﬁnancial year. The dividend is covered 
3.8 times by earnings.  Our Spanish housing operations enjoyed a very strong 2005.
Completions increased by 1 per cent, with average sales

Cash ﬂow
Operating cashﬂows before movements
in working capital were £461 .1m (2004:
£493.4m). Inventories increased by
£204.9m which was partly funded by an
increase in creditors of £1 12.6m. Of this
latter increase, £92m is represented by
an increase in land creditors.
Cash generated by operations was
£359.7m (2004: £410.5m). Income taxes
and interest payments totalled £229.5m
(2004: £212.4m), resulting in net cash
from operating activities being down 34
per cent to £130.2m (2004:£198.1m).
T reasury Management and Funding
The Group operates within policies and
procedures approved by the Board. The
Group’ s capitalisation policy establishes
overall parameters for the consolidated
capital structure together with guidelines
in respect of interest and currency
translation exposures. The Group seeks
to match long-term assets with long-
term funding and short-term assets with
short-term funding. Strict controls are
exercised on the use of ﬁnancial
instruments in managing the Group’ s
ﬁnancial risk. The objectives are to
ensure sufﬁcient liquidity is maintained
to meet foreseeable needs and to invest
cash assets safely and proﬁtably. The
Group does not undertake speculative or
trading activity in ﬁnancial instruments or
foreign currencies. 
The disclosures relating to the use of
ﬁnancial instruments and treasury risks
faced by the Group, required under the
EU’ s fair value directive, are detailed in
notes 16–20 to the consolidated ﬁnancial
statements.
The Group maintains a balance between
certainty and ﬂexibility through the use 
of term borrowings, overdrafts and
committed revolving credit facilities 
with a range of maturity dates. It is the
Group’ s policy to maintain committed
facilities or borrowings with staggered
maturity dates in order to ensure
continuity of funding.
T reasury functions are centralised in our
main geographic locations. All treasury
operations must remain in compliance
with Group policy and are closely
monitored by the Group treasury
department.
Equity, retained proﬁts and long-term
ﬁxed interest debt are primarily used to
ﬁnance goodwill, ﬁxed assets and land.
Short-term borrowings are primarily
required to ﬁnance net current assets,
other than landbank assets of more than
one year, and commercial developments
and are therefore kept at a ﬂoating rate.
Where possible, temporary cash
balances made available by our
construction business are used to reduce
our short-term borrowing requirements.
The Group also uses derivatives to
manage interest rate exposure if
economically appropriate.
A signiﬁcant proportion of the Group’ s
capital employed is in currencies 
other than sterling with the result that
currency movements can affect the
balance sheet. Where appropriate,
foreign currency translation exposure is
reduced by ﬁnancing overseas assets
with borrowings of the same currency
and by the use of derivatives.
Net debt at the year end stood at
£456.9m (2004: £538.8m) equivalent to
net gearing of 23.7 per cent (2004: 31 .6
per cent). Interest on borrowings, net of
interest receivable was £54.4m (2004:
£60m) - see note 6, page 62. Average net
debt for the year was £823.4m (2004:
£946.9m). At the year end T aylor
Woodrow had undrawn committed
revolving credit facilities totalling £685m.
T axation
The effective tax rate in 2005 is 30.3 
per cent (2004: 30.4 per cent).
Pensions
At 31 December 2005, the IAS19 deﬁcit,
net of deferred tax, was £154m (2004:
£100m). The increase has been caused
by continuing falls in the yield of AA-
credit rated corporate bonds. The
company has now commenced
discussions with the trustees with a
view to reaching agreement on the
means of mitigating this deﬁcit.

Reporting Standards. All 2004

This section of the Annual Report is an
abridged version of the company’ s full
2005 CSR Report, which can be viewed
on the Company’ s website.
Objectives and T argets
At the beginning of 2005 we set a
number of high level business objectives
for CSR in the areas of Sustainability,
Safety, Health/People, Environment and
Community. Further details are available
in our full CSR Report. 
As a leading company, the way we
manage social, environmental and ethical
issues is coming under increasing
scrutiny. Grouped together, these come
under the heading of CSR. A number of
CSR issues are of material signiﬁcance to
T aylor Woodrow’ s business and our
approach is to manage these issues in 
a proactive and balanced way. 
Sustainable Development
Government policy and regulation aimed
at encouraging more sustainable
development is a growing and important
feature of the UK market. During 2005
we saw increased utilisation of
brownﬁeld land in our housing schemes,
with 68 per cent of unit sales coming
from this source (2004: 64 per cent). 
In the UK we have been progressing 
sustainable community schemes in
T elford and Swindon. During the year 
we completed the Green Building in
Manchester which incorporates
renewable energy technologies and
achieved an ‘Excellent’ rating from the
EcoHomes benchmarking scheme. 
The number of affordable homes that we
built increased to 1,048 (2004: 782).
We believe that construction of new,
high quality, homes is an important 
factor in improving quality of life for our
customers. Through planning
agreements we also provide substantial
investment for the beneﬁt of local
communities, for example by improving
roads, construction of community
centres, playgrounds and nature areas,
and contributions to the Arts.
In North America, sustainability issues
vary between states and are therefore
managed locally. 
Health and Safety
Our approach to the management of
health and safety is recognised as being
one of the best within the development
sector. We strive to make our project
sites and our ofﬁces safe working
environments. 
Corporate Social Responsibility
A number of CSR issues are 
of material signiﬁcance to 
T aylor Woodrow’ s business and our
approach is to manage these issues 
in a proactive and balanced way. 
In the UK we improve safety through
promoting a positive safety culture,
incentivisation, supporting the
development of skills and knowledge,
providing a framework for the
management of safety, and monitoring
performance. We not only review
accidents but we have an extensive
programme of active monitoring that
measures how our working environments
are being managed. We manage
occupational health by identifying key 
risk activities, undertaking health
assessments and, where appropriate,
implement health surveillance
programmes. 
In North America, T aylor Woodrow
operates a comprehensive and
independent health and safety audit
process. Sites are scored against criteria
which are made continually more
demanding each year.  Above: Building community relations 
at Mortimer Hill, Berkshire
This image: Lichﬁeld provide an excellent range of beneﬁts .
We facilitate training through an employee
review process for each team member
and we provide a range of development
options that help our people to improve
their personal performance. We have
deﬁned a core training matrix on health,
safety and environmental issues which
provides clarity on our minimum
competency requirements for different
roles. T aylor Woodrow is a long-standing
supporter of apprentice, student and
graduate development programmes.
Ethics
The Group’s whistleblowing policy, 
is supported in the UK by an externally-
facilitated procedure – ‘Safecall’ –
through which team members may, 
in conﬁdence, raise concerns about
possible improprieties in ﬁnancial
reporting, ethical conduct or other
matters. Safecall is widely publicised
within the company. Calls received are
investigated by the head of Risk
Management and Audit and action 
taken where appropriate. The Audit
Committee receives, reports on all
28 Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2005
The UK, North America and Spanish
operations all achieved the management
performance standards that had been
set at the beginning of the year. In the
UK, accident rates also were lower in
2005 compared with 2004 and reﬂect 
a long-term trend of reducing accident
incident rates. In North America the
business exceeded its target audit score
of 90 per cent demonstrating a year on
year improvement in performance.
There were no fatalities on our
development sites in 2005 (2004:1) and
no prosecutions for health and safety
issues (2004:1).
Environmental issues
Waste management continues to be a
particular focus in the UK. Waste volumes
per housing unit have been reduced by
3.6 per cent compared with 2004,
maintaining a continuous improvement
trend. The cost of waste disposal
continued to decline, falling from £513
per unit in 2003 to £351 per unit in 2005
as changes in waste management
practice such as segregation of waste
plasterboard for recycling have been
implemented. In 2005 we segregated
and returned for recycling 4,677 tonnes
of plasterboard waste, representing
approximately 80 per cent of
plasterboard waste generated. There
were no prosecutions for environmental
offences in 2005 (2004:1).
Customers
We remain committed to giving all of our
customers a great purchasing experience.
A key management objective is to
achieve continual improvement in
customer satisfaction ratings, which
forms part of the bonus reward of
directors and senior managers. During
the year, the following achievements
were recorded:
UK housing 75% (2004: 70%)
Construction 91% (2004: 88%)
North American housing 86% (2004: 86%)
Spanish Housing 73% (2004: 76%)

Stakeholders / Community
We have a range of stakeholders that
have an interest in our CSR activities.
These include shareholders, customers,
team members, neighbours, local
authorities, government and non-
government organisations. Consultation
is important for new developments. 
We are involved in some leading edge
consultation programmes, for example
the Swindon Southern Development
Area, which has been cited as an
exemplar by Government.
We have continued to expand our
participation in the Considerate
Constructors Scheme and were awarded
one Gold, one Silver and one Bronze
Award in 2005.
As part of the ABC nationwide television
‘Extreme Makeover’ show T aylor
Woodrow donated time, resource and
money to create new homes for two
families in 2005. The Okvath family in
Phoenix, Arizona had a 5,300 square 
foot home constructed for them in six
days with the help of over 1,600 team
members and suppliers. In Los Angeles,
we assisted the local community’ s 
efforts to remodel the 1,300 sq ft Lewis
family home. In addition, in North
America the T aylor Woodrow team
donated over £267 ,000 to other
worthwhile charities during the year .
In the UK we have been actively
supporting the children’ s charity
Barnardo’ s through our ‘building futures’
partnership which helps fund skills and
training programmes for disadvantaged
young people. 
We continue to match team members’
charitable fund-raising efforts in the
community through the ‘Support the
T eam’ programme.
Recognition
External benchmarking exercises are a
useful means by which we can review
our progress in CSR. Our comprehensive
suite of policies, coupled with processes
for implementation and monitoring, are
reﬂected in positive outcomes following
external scrutiny. T aylor Woodrow is a
member of FTSE4good and the Dow
Jones Sustainability and Stoxx Indices. 
In January 2005 we were listed in the
Corporate Knights Global 100 most
sustainable corporations. In the second
sustainability survey of UK housebuilders
carried out by Insight Investment and 
the Worldwide Fund for Nature, T aylor
Woodrow was placed fourth of 12 with 
a score of 7 4 per cent.

Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
CSR issues are of material signiﬁcance to T aylor Woodrow’ s
business. The company’ s approach to the management of them
is described on pages 26 to 29. The full Corporate Social
Responsibility Report 2005 is available on the company’ s

Corporate/About Us/Corporate Social Responsibility.
Research and development
The company is committed to investing in research and
development projects where there are clearly deﬁned business
beneﬁts.
Charitable donations
During the year Group companies donated £363,000 (2004:
£296,000) to various charities, £96,000 (2004: £1 13,000) in the
UK and Europe and £267 ,000 (2004: £183,000) in North
America. An outline of the Group’ s programme of charitable
giving appears in Corporate Social Responsibility and fuller
details can be found in the on-line CSR 2005 report. Report of the Directors continued
Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2005  33
Political donations
The company did not make any donations to political parties
during 2005 (2004: £nil). A business subscription of £167 ,000
(2004: £158,000) was paid to the House Builders’ Federation,
which is active in supporting the interests of the housebuilding
sector. Some may consider that this payment may fall within
the meaning of ‘EU Political Expenditure’ as deﬁned by Section
347A of the Companies Act 1985. At the 2006 Annual General
Meeting shareholders are being asked to approve a renewal for
up to eighteen months of the existing consent for such
donations.
Policy on payment of suppliers
The nature of the Group’ s operations means that there is no
single Group standard in respect of payment terms to suppliers.
Generally, subsidiaries are responsible for establishing payment
terms with suppliers when entering into each transaction or
series of linked transactions. In the absence of dispute, valid
payment requests are met as expeditiously as possible within
such terms. This policy continues to apply in 2006. T rade creditor
days for the Group for the year ended 31 December 2005 were
31 days (2004: 39 days), based on the ratio of year end Group
trade creditors (excluding subcontract retentions and unagreed
claims of £12.9 million (2004: £13.2 million) and land creditors,
see Note 20 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements) to
amounts invoiced during the year by trade creditors. The
company had no signiﬁcant trade creditors at 31 December 2005.
Corporate governance
Detailed statements of the company’ s corporate governance
principles, the Group’ s systems of internal control and the going
concern conﬁrmation are set out in Corporate Governance on
pages 34 to 37 .
Important events since the year end
Except for any matters referred to elsewhere in this Report and
Accounts, there have been no other important events affecting
the company or any of its subsidiary undertakings since the end
of the ﬁnancial year.
This report of the directors was approved by the Board 
of directors on 27 February 2006.
Richard I Morbey
Secretary
27 February 2006 Corporate Governance Statement
34 Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2005
The company is committed to the principles of corporate
governance contained in the July 2003 FRC Combined Code on
Corporate Governance which is appended to the Listing Rules 
of the Financial Services Authority (‘the Code’) and for which 
the Board is accountable to shareholders.
Statement of compliance with the Code of Best Practice
Throughout the year ended 31 December 2005, the company
has been in compliance with the Code provisions set out in
section 1 of the Code.
Statement about applying the Principles of Good
Governance
In complying with the Code, the company has applied the Main
and Supporting Principles of Good Governance of the Code.
Further explanation of how these Principles have been applied
is set out below and, in connection with directors’ remuneration,
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report. The Chairman’ s
Statement, the Chief Executive’ s Review and the Operating
Performance Review seek to present a balanced and
understandable assessment of the company’ s position and
prospects.
The Board and its committees
The Board consists of eight directors whose names,
responsibilities and other details appear on pages 30 and 31 . 
Three of the directors are executive and ﬁve are non-executive.
The Board discharges its responsibilities by providing strategic
and entrepreneurial leadership of the company, within a
framework of prudent and effective controls, which enables risk
to be assessed and managed. It sets the company’ s strategic
aims, ensures that the necessary ﬁnancial and human
resources are in place for the company to meet its objectives
and reviews management performance. It also deﬁnes the
company’ s values and standards and ensures that its
obligations to its shareholders and other stakeholders are
understood and met.
The following documents have been published on the company’ s
website and outline the way the Board and its committees
operate, which the Board reviews at least annually:
• A schedule of matters speciﬁcally reserved for the decision 
of the Board;
• A suite of board-mandated policies covering operational
matters, compliance and stakeholder policies.
• The T erms of Reference of the Nomination, Audit and
Remuneration Committees, which outline their objectives
and responsibilities and which deﬁne a programme of
activities to support the discharge of those responsibilities.
The Board has also adopted a framework of delegated
commercial and operational authorities, which deﬁne the scope
and powers of the chief executive and of operating
management. All directors have access to the advice and
services of the company secretary and the Board has
established a procedure whereby directors may take
independent professional advice at the company’ s expense
where they judge it necessary to discharge their responsibilities
as directors.
Board and Committee balance, independence and
effectiveness
It is the company’ s policy that appointments to the Board are
made on merit and through a formal, rigorous and transparent
process against objective criteria recommended by the
Nomination Committee. The Committee guides the whole
Board in arranging orderly succession for appointments to the
Board and to senior management. No Board appointments
were made during the year.
There is a clearly established division of responsibilities
between the chairman and chief executive, set out in writing,
agreed by the Board, implemented by regular review meetings
between these ofﬁcers and validated by the Board performance
evaluation process.
The chairman is also chairman of IMI plc, a FTSE 250 company.
The Board is satisﬁed that this and his other commitments 
do not detract from the extent or the quality of the time which
he is able to devote to the company.
The appointment of non-executive directors is for a speciﬁed
term and re-appointment is not automatic. During the three
years up to and including the 2006 Annual General Meeting,
every director will have sought re-election at least once. 
The Board has reviewed and re-afﬁrmed that it considers all 
of the non-executive directors, including the chairman, to be
independent in character and judgement. Whenever any
director considers that he or she is interested in any contract 
or arrangement to which the company is or may be a party, due
notice is given in accordance with the Articles of Association.
The Board has determined that any such interests as may have
arisen during the year are not material to the director or to the
companies concerned.
The directors possess an appropriate balance of skills and
experience for the requirements of the business. The Board and
its committees operate within a framework of scheduled core
meetings and additional ad hoc meetings are held as required. 
In addition to formal meetings, the directors also participate 
in an annual Board planning awayday at which strategic and
ﬁnancial plans are reviewed and developed. All directors visit
the company’ s operations on a regular basis, meeting
employees at all levels in order to maintain and refresh
directors’ understanding of the business.  Corporate Governance Statement continued
Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2005  35
The members of the Board and its committees, together with
their attendances at the core meetings during 2005 are shown
below. The Company Secretary is also secretary to the Board’ s
committees.
Information and professional development
The company has procedures whereby directors (including 
non-executive directors) receive formal induction, training and
continuing familiarisation about the company’ s business,
operations and systems, the principles underlying the discharge
of their duties as directors and wider issues relating to the
housing and construction sector. T raining needs are identiﬁed
and implemented.
Performance evaluation of the Board, its Committees 
and other functions
Between November 2005 and January 2006 the directors
carried out the third annual evaluation of the performance and
effectiveness of the Board and its committees, of individual
directors and the internal and external auditors. The evaluations
were performed using the following framework:
The Board, its members and its committees:
The evaluation of effectiveness of the Board and its committees
was focused mainly on the principles of the Combined Code
and the NAPF Corporate Governance Policy, but also contained
a number of broader judgements covering commercial and
operational issues. The evaluation was carried out by the company
secretary through structured interviews with each director.
Additionally, the non-executive directors, led by the senior
independent director, met without the chairman present to
appraise the chairman’ s performance. The chairman also held
meetings with the non-executive directors without the
executives present. 
The directors reviewed the ﬁndings of these assessments in
February 2006 and concurred with the conclusions that the Board
is a cohesive and effective group and that its committees operate
effectively. The Board veriﬁed that each director demonstrates
effectiveness and commitment and that the quality of the Board's
processes and its relationship with management is of a high
order. As a result of the evaluation, the Board has re-ordered a
number of priorities and will intensify its focus on succession
planning. The Board will continue to use the evidence gained
through the evaluation process when setting objectives and
procedures for 2006 and will continually review its approach to
the evaluation process. 
The internal Risk Management and Audit (RMA) function:
An evaluation of the RMA function was carried out through
consultation with the members of the Audit Committee, the
external auditors and the head of function. In addition,
management provided feedback. The evaluation, which was
reviewed by the Audit Committee in November 2005, conﬁrmed a
high degree of conﬁdence in the effectiveness of the function and
its ability to achieve its objectives and to meet the requirements
of the Audit Committee and the business operations.
The external auditors:
An evaluation of the external auditors was carried out through
consultation with Board and Audit Committee members and
with senior management. The evaluation, which was reviewed
by the Audit Committee in November 2005, found the
performance of the external auditors to be satisfactory.

Board Committees
Remuneration Committee and remuneration
The Board’ s policy and approach to the setting of remuneration
for directors and senior executives and the activities of the
Remuneration Committee are described in the directors’
Remuneration Report on pages 38 to 46.
The Nomination Committee
The members of the Nomination Committee and their
attendance at meetings during 2005 is shown on page 35. 
The Board has enjoyed a period of stability in recent years and
the work of the Nomination Committee during the year has
therefore been focused primarily on planning Board and senior
management team succession and reviewing the balance of
the Board’ s composition.
T erms and conditions of appointment of all directors are
available for inspection as described in the 2006 Annual General
Meeting circular to shareholders.
Audit Committee and auditors
The members of the Audit Committee are shown on page 35. 
All members are independent non-executive directors. The
Board has determined that Andrew Dougal, the committee
chairman, who is a member of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of Scotland, has recent and relevant ﬁnancial
experience. 
The chairman of the company, the chief executive, ﬁnance
director, head of RMA, representatives of the external auditors,
and senior executives of major Group companies attend
meetings of the committee by invitation.
The committee reviews the internal control framework, the
internal audit process the ﬁnancial reporting practices and the
external audit process. It ensures that the Board regularly
assesses business risks, and their management and mitigation.
In monitoring the ﬁnancial reporting practices the committee
reviews accounting policies, areas of judgement, the going
concern assumption and compliance with accounting standards
and the requirements of the Code. The committee also reviews,
prior to publication, the interim and annual ﬁnancial statements
and other major statements affecting the Group concerning
price-sensitive information.
Appointment of the auditors for non-audit services
The Audit Committee has approved a policy on employing the
auditors to provide services other than audit services, which 
is to require a competitive tender except in narrowly-deﬁned
circumstances where the company considers that for
conﬁdentiality, past knowledge or other reasons, there is an
advantage in using a single tender procurement procedure. 
The committee has determined that the following assignments
should not be undertaken by the auditors:
• the provision of internal audit services; and
• advice on large IT systems.
The Board is satisﬁed that this policy is conducive to the
maintenance of auditor independence and objectivity.
Executive Committee
The Executive Committee consists of all the executive directors
of the company, senior executives of major Group companies
and senior function heads. The chief executive chairs its meetings.
The committee meets monthly and directs, controls and reviews
the ﬁnancial and operational performance of all Group companies
and divisions, and key issues relating to human resources,
communications and legal matters. It deﬁnes and recommends
to the Board forward-looking business plans and budgets.
Within the delegated authorities framework, the fortnightly
investment sub-committee meetings review all major
investment proposals affecting the Group’ s business.
Other Group committees
The Group has a number of other committees which co-
ordinate activities in areas such as risk management, corporate
social responsibility improvement (including health, safety and
environmental matters), information technology developments
and other key activities. 
Internal control
The Board has applied Principle C.2 of the Code by establishing
a continuous process for identifying, evaluating and managing
the signiﬁcant risks the Group faces. The Board regularly
reviews the process, which has been in place from the start of
the year to the date of approval of this report and which is in
accordance with Internal Control: Guidance for directors on the
Code published in July 2003. The Board is responsible for the
Group’ s system of internal control and for reviewing its
effectiveness. Such a system is designed to manage rather than
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and
can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against
material misstatement or loss.
In compliance with provision C.2.1 of the Code, the Board
regularly reviews the effectiveness of the Group’ s system 
of internal control. The Board’ s monitoring covers all controls,
including ﬁnancial, operational and compliance controls and risk
management. This process is based principally on reviewing
reports from management to consider whether signiﬁcant risks
are identiﬁed, evaluated, managed and controlled and whether
any signiﬁcant weaknesses are promptly remedied and indicate
a need for more extensive monitoring. The Board has also
performed a speciﬁc assessment for the purpose of this annual
report. This assessment considers all signiﬁcant aspects of
internal control arising during the period covered by the report
including the work of RMA. The Audit Committee assists the
Board in discharging its review responsibilities. Key elements 
of the system of internal control are detailed below.
A Group-level review is carried out by the members of the
Executive Committee to identify the major risks facing the
Group and to develop and implement appropriate initiatives 
to manage those risks. This process applies across the Group. 
Key operational and ﬁnancial risks are identiﬁed and assessed 
at the operating process level, while strategic risks are
identiﬁed as a part of the business planning process. Strategic
risk reviews are carried out in each of the operating divisions
to identify business risk, evaluate existing controls and
develop strategies to manage the risks that remain, the
results of which form part of the Board’s assessment.
Updates to these risk assessments are reported to the
Executive Committee. Corporate Governance Statement continued
Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2005  37
An Executive Risk Committee, chaired by the Group Finance
Director, reports to the Executive Committee. This committee,
which has formally agreed terms of reference, oversees the risk
and control framework of the Group and monitors the response
to key risk issues identiﬁed through the assessment process.
The committee meets monthly and its ﬁndings are reviewed by
the Audit Committee as part of an overall process whereby
assurance is obtained about the integrity of the risk
management and internal control process.
Management
The Chief Executive has responsibility for preparing and
reviewing a three-year corporate plan and the annual budgets.
These are subject to formal approval by the Board. Budgets are
re-examined in comparison with business forecasts throughout
the year to ensure they are sufﬁciently robust to reﬂect the
possible impact of changing economic circumstances. The chief
executive and the Board conduct regular and systematic
reviews of actual results and future projections with comparison
against budget and prior year, together with various treasury
reports. Disputes that may give rise to signiﬁcant litigation or
contractual claims are monitored monthly. The chief executive
conducts quarterly business performance reviews, at which an
assessment is made of the progress against objectives,
changes to operational risk and adequacy of control.
The Group has clearly-deﬁned policies, processes and
procedures governing all areas of the business, which are
accessible using a web-enabled intranet tool, which also
facilitates continuous improvement. An owner is identiﬁed for
each process, responsible for risk assessment and process
effectiveness. Operational compliance responsibilities are also
assigned to individual managers who have access to
compliance testing and auditing software tools. For each
process, key operational controls have been identiﬁed and
these are subject to quarterly self-assessment. 
Deﬁned authority limits are in place. In particular, any
investment in land, property and other signiﬁcant assets,
including acquisitions and disposals, require detailed appraisals
and are subject to deﬁned authorisation levels and post-
investment review procedures. Investment decisions, including
Private Finance Initiative (PFI) projects, and tenders for
contracts are subject to approval by the Board, the chief
executive or subsidiary operating management, depending on
the value and nature of the investment or contract.
There is a clearly identiﬁable organisational structure and a
framework of delegated authority approved by the Board within
which individual responsibilities of senior executives of Group
companies are identiﬁed and can be monitored.
The RMA function oversees a quarterly programme of Controls
Self Assessments across the UK development and construction
businesses. A similar programme is to be implemented in the
North America housing business. These activities are reinforced
through process compliance and other audits conducted by RMA.
The RMA function reviews the effectiveness and efﬁciency of
the systems of internal control in place to safeguard the assets,
to quantify, price, transfer, avoid or mitigate risks and to monitor
the activities of the Group in accomplishing established
objectives. Regular reports from these reviews are provided to
the Board and reported to the chief executive, Audit Committee
and management, who consider them on a regular basis. The
head of the RMA function has direct access to the chairman of
the Audit Committee.
A database of audit recommendations and improvement
initiatives is maintained. A monthly follow up routine ensures
that such improvements are implemented in a timely manner. 
Throughout the year the Board continually considers the
effectiveness of the Group’ s internal control systems. On 
23 February 2006 it completed the annual assessment for the
year to 31 December 2005 by reviewing evidence from the
Audit Committee, operating divisions, RMA, and by taking
account of events since the year -end.
The annual employee performance appraisal process is
objective-based, with individual objectives cascaded down from
the appropriate business objectives. Development reviews
identify training needs to support achievement of objectives.
Whistleblowing
The Group’ s whistleblowing policy is supported in the UK by an
externally-facilitated procedure – ‘Safecall’ – through which
employees of the company may, in conﬁdence, raise concerns
about possible improprieties in ﬁnancial reporting or other
matters. Safecall is widely publicised within the company. 
Calls received are investigated by the head of RMA. The Audit
Committee receives reports on all occasions when such
concerns are raised. 
Relations with shareholders
The Board actively seeks and encourages engagement with
major institutional shareholders and other stakeholders and has
put in place arrangements designed to facilitate contact about
remuneration and other issues. This provides the opportunity for
meetings with the chairman, the Senior Independent Director as
well as the chief executive and ﬁnance director and other
executives in order to establish a mutual understanding of
objectives. There is a structured programme of investor relations,
based on formal announcements and publications covering the
full year and interim results. There are associated brieﬁngs for
stockbroking analysts and investors, the presentation material
for which is published on the company’ s website.
All directors receive formal reports and brieﬁngs during the year
about the company’ s investor relations programme and receive
detailed feedback through surveys, direct contact and other
means, through which they are able to develop an understanding
of the views of major shareholders about the company.
The Board encourages shareholders to participate in the Annual
General Meeting. 
Information about the company and the Group, including full
year and interim results and other major announcements, is
published on the company’ s website www.taylorwoodrow.com 
Going concern
After making enquiries, the directors have formed a judgement, 
at the time of approving the ﬁnancial statements, that there is a
reasonable expectation that the Group and the company have
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the
foreseeable future. For this reason, the directors continue to adopt
the going concern basis in preparing the ﬁnancial statements.  Directors’ Remuneration Report
38 Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2005
Introduction
This Report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A
to the Companies Act 1985 (‘the Act’) and meets the relevant
requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority. In it, we describe how the Board has applied the
Principles of Good Governance relating to directors’
remuneration. As required by the Act, a resolution to approve
the Report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of
the company on 3 May 2006. 
The Act requires the auditors to report to the company’ s
shareholders on certain parts of the Report and to state
whether in their opinion those parts of the Report have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Act. The Report has
therefore been divided into separate sections for unaudited and
audited information.
Unaudited information:
Remuneration Committee

• T o determine the remuneration of the Chief Executive,
executive directors and senior executives of the Group

• T o determine amounts payable under the Bonus Plan
• T o agree awards under the company’ s discretionary share-
based reward plans
The Committee establishes and maintains formal and
transparent procedures for developing policy on executive
remuneration and for ﬁxing the remuneration packages of
individual directors, and monitors and reports on them. It makes
recommendations to the Board. 
The members of the Committee during the ﬁnancial year were
Lady Robin Innes Ker (Committee Chairman), Norman Askew,
Mike Davies, Vernon Sankey, all of whom are independent non-
executive directors. Their details, including attendances at
meetings held during 2005, are listed in the Corporate
Governance Statement on page 35.
None of the Committee members has any personal ﬁnancial
interest other than as shareholders, conﬂicts of interests arising
from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running
the business. No director plays a part in any discussion about
his or her own remuneration.
Advice
In determining the directors’ remuneration for the year, the
Committee consulted Iain Napier (chief executive) and Alec
Luhaste (Group director of human resources). The Committee
appointed T owers Perrin to provide advice on directors’
remuneration packages. T owers Perrin did not provide any other
services to the company or the Group. KPMG LLP advised the
company on executive pay and practices, including share-based
reward and on the valuation of the company’ s share plans for
the purposes of IFRS 2.
Remuneration policy for the executive directors
and other senior executives
The company’ s executive remuneration packages are designed
to be attractive, so as to motivate and retain high quality
management and to reward them for achieving a high level of
corporate performance in line with the best interests of
shareholders. The performance measurement of the executive
directors and key members of senior management and the
determination of their annual remuneration package is
undertaken by the Committee.
The main elements of the remuneration packages for executive
directors and senior management are described below.
Packages are designed to include a signiﬁcant element of
performance-related incentive remuneration, set against
challenging business performance objectives. The Committee
has procedures in place to monitor the size of potential pay
awards. In 2005, the proportion of ﬁxed pay of the executive
directors was 58.3 per cent (2004: 61 .3 per cent) and variable
pay was 41 .7 per cent (2004: 38.7 per cent).
The committee reviews annually the basis and component
parts of executives’ reward to ensure that they remain
appropriate and competitive.
Executive directors are entitled to accept appointments outside
the company provided that the Board’ s prior permission is
obtained and a determination made in respect of any fees
resulting from all such appointments. Iain Napier, the chief
executive, is a non-executive director of Imperial T obacco Group
plc (ITG), from which he received fees of £77 ,500 (2004:
£40,000). £20,000 of these fees, less statutory deduction, is
applied in the purchase of ITG shares. Peter Johnson is a non-
executive director of Shanks Group plc (appointed 16 May,
2005) in respect of which during 2005 he received £18,885
(2004: nil). They are entitled to retain these fees.
Basic salary
The Committee reviews the basic salaries of executive directors
and members of the Executive Committee annually and
whenever an individual changes position or responsibility. 
In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee makes its
judgement drawing on objective research from T owers Perrin
which gives up-to-date information on FTSE 150, FTSE 100 to
150 companies, comparator groups of companies, and an
industry-speciﬁc comparator group comprising 25 companies
representing the housing, development and construction
industry. The comparator group includes Alfred McAlpine,
Amec, Balfour Beatty, Barratt Developments, Bellway Homes,
Berkeley Group Holdings, Bovis Homes Group, British Land,
Canary Wharf Group, Carillion, Costain, Crest Nicholson,
George Wimpey, Hammerson, Kier Group, Land Securities,
Liberty International, McCarthy & Stone, Mowlem, Persimmon,
Westbury Homes, Redrow Group, Slough Estates, and Wilson
Bowden.
The Committee considers this research and its own judgement
when determining appropriate levels of remuneration, taking
into account the scale and scope of individuals’ responsibilities
and corporate performance. Basic salaries were reviewed in
November 2005 with any consequent changes being made
from 1 January 2006. Reviews take account of the level of
remuneration elsewhere in the business.
Executive directors’ contracts of service, which include details
of remuneration, will be available for inspection at the Annual
General Meeting and generally as described in the 2006 Annual
General Meeting circular. Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2005  39
Other beneﬁts, including beneﬁts-in-kind
The executive directors receive certain beneﬁts-in-kind,
principally a car or an allowance in lieu, life assurance and
private medical insurance. The company also operates an
Income Protection Plan. Beneﬁts-in-kind are not pensionable.
Annual bonus payments and the deferred bonus plan
The Committee establishes the objectives that must be met for
each ﬁnancial year if a performance-related bonus is to be paid.
In setting appropriate bonus parameters, the Committee refers
to the objective research by T owers Perrin on the comparator
group of companies as noted above.
Account is also taken of the relative success of the different
parts of the business for which the executive directors are
responsible and the extent to which the strategic objectives set
by the Board are being met. The current maximum bonus award
that can be made to an executive director in any one year is 100
per cent of salary. 2005’ s bonus awards were dependent upon
the achievement of a number of ‘stretch’ business-speciﬁc and
personal targets. The targets include factors which the Board
considers to be commercially conﬁdential if disclosed in detail,
but which are summarised as follows: 
• Achievement of speciﬁed levels of proﬁt before tax for 2005. 
(A signiﬁcant element of the bonus is dependent on this target);
• Achievement of improvements in health and safety
performance, based on speciﬁed levels of safety
management performance and site inspection results;
• Achievement of speciﬁed customer satisfaction ratings;
• Other important and relevant business issues.
Most, but not all, of the targets were achieved.
For 2005, the maximum performance-related cash bonus that
can be paid is 100 per cent of basic salary (2004: 100 per cent)
for the chief executive and 100 per cent (2004: 85 per cent) in
the case of the other executive directors. Bonus awards for
executive directors in respect of the year ended 31 December
2005 ranged between 7 4.3 per cent and 98.2 per cent of basic
2005 salary (2004: 65 per cent and 95 per cent), reﬂecting
performance against the targets. For 2006, bonus targets have
been set based broadly on the 2005 framework and designed
to reﬂect the company’ s performance relative to the peer group.
No bonus or deferred bonus is pensionable.
Bonus Plan matching award
The Committee believes share ownership by executive
directors and senior executives strengthens the link between
the interests of executives and the company’ s shareholders.
Executive directors and selected senior executives have the
opportunity of participating in the deferred bonus plan by
investing some or all of their pre-tax bonus in the purchase 
of shares in the company. If these shares remain undrawn 
for a period of three years, the company will match them on a
one for one basis, provided, in the case of awards made from
2005 onwards, that Group Earnings per share (Eps) shall have
grown by at least three per cent compound in real terms during
the prior three ﬁnancial years. Eps is calculated using the
adjusted basic earnings per share as shown in Note 9 to the
consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
Executive share-based reward
The Performance Share Plan
In order to incentivise executive directors and other senior
executives, the company has established a Performance Share
Plan (PSP). The Remuneration Committee is responsible for
supervising the plan and for granting or recommending of
awards under the PSP .
Conditional awards of shares are made to participants, entitling
them to receive shares of the company at no direct cost. V esting
occurs on the third anniversary of the award, provided that the
performance criterion is fulﬁled. There is a limit for awards under
the current Plan Rules of 200 per cent of basic salary per annum.
The Plan contains two elements: Basic awards, which under
current policy are restricted to a current maximum of 75 per
cent of basic salary and additional enhanced awards, which
under current policy are restricted to a current maximum of 50
per cent of basic salary. Enhanced awards, introduced in 2005,
are made on a discretionary basis to members of the Executive
Committee, including the executive directors. The vesting
criteria for these awards are as follows:
In 2005, conditional awards were made to 296 participants,
including each of the executive directors, in respect of a total 
of 2,644,102 shares. Of these, 2,356,526 were basic awards
(2004: 3,244,327 shares) and 287 ,576 were enhanced awards
(2004: Nil).
The performance criteria, which apply to all participants in the
PSP , were chosen because Eps is considered to be an
appropriate indicator of management’ s success in advancing
the performance of the business. Eps is calculated as described
in Note 9 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. TSR was
selected in order to incentivise improvement in performance
relative to the PSP peer group, whilst continuing to focus on
earnings growth. The peer group for this purpose consists of:
Barratt Developments, Bellway, Berkeley Group Holdings,

Executive Share Option Plan 
The T aylor Woodrow Executive Share Option Plan was
suspended on 9 October 2003. No awards have been made
since that date and the Committee has no plans to make any
such awards.
Awards made under the Plan were subject to increasingly
demanding performance criteria, which in respect of options
granted from 2002 onwards, require
– Eps to exceed the RPI by 12 per cent (for awards which
cause aggregate option values, measured at the time 
of grant, to exceed three times basic salary); and
– Eps to exceed the RPI by 15 per cent (for awards which
cause aggregate option values, measured at the time of
grant, to exceed four times basic salary). 
Eps is calculated as described on page 39.
For awards granted in October 2003, the company reduced the
number of performance re-tests to two, which are applied at
the fourth and ﬁfth anniversaries of the date of grant. For these
re-tests, the measurement period is four and ﬁve years
respectively. If the performance test is not satisﬁed at the ﬁnal
re-test, the option lapses.
The exercise prices of all options granted under the above Plan
were equal to the market value of the company’ s shares at the
time when they were granted.
The rules of the PSP , the Executive Share Options Plan and the
Deferred Bonus Plan, referred to above, and the Company’ s all-
employee share plans referred to below provide for the early
vesting or exercise of share entitlements in the event of a
participant’ s death or cessation of employment because of a
change of control, disability, redundancy or retirement.
Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006
The current eligibility criteria under the Deferred Bonus Plan and
Performance Share Plan do not allow awards to be made to
participants within one year of retirement. The introduction of
the Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006
(‘Regulations’) in October 2006 on age discrimination will
require this provision to be removed. T o comply with the
requirements of the Regulations, the Board proposes to
implement changes to the rules of these Plans by way of a
resolution of the directors. Such change will take effect when
the Regulations come into force.
All-employee share plans
United Kingdom
The company operates a Sharesave Plan under which all UK
team members with at least three months’ service can save up
to £250 per month and receive three or ﬁve year options to
acquire the company’ s shares priced at a discount of up to 20
per cent of market value.
A UK Share Purchase Plan has also been introduced, under
which all UK team members with at least three months’ service
are permitted to invest up to £1,500 per annum of their pre-tax
earned income in the purchase of partnership shares of the
company. Such shares, if held for a period of three years, attract
an award of free matching shares. Currently participants receive
one matching share for each partnership share purchased.
The executive directors are eligible to participate in these all-
employee Plans.
Overseas Plans
During 2005, the company implemented an all-employee stock
purchase plan in the United States and plans to introduce a
share incentive plan in Canada in early 2006.
The United States Plan is based broadly on the UK Sharesave
Plan and entitles participants to contribute funds of up to a US$
amount equivalent to £3,000 per year of their post-tax income
to purchase shares of the company at a discount of 15 per cent
to the relevant market price.
The Canadian Plan will be based broadly on the UK Share
Purchase Plan and will entitle participants to contribute funds of
up to a Can$ amount equivalent to £1,500 per year of their post-
tax income to purchase shares of the company which, if held for
a period of three years, would be matched by the company.
Impact of International Financial Reporting Standards on
performance criteria of incentive plans
In accordance with the scheme rules and as indicated in
previous Remuneration Reports, earnings per share ﬁgures for
the purpose of performance measurement of share incentive
schemes are restated in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards. 
Pension arrangements
Details of the Group’ s principal UK pension schemes are given
in Note 21 the consolidation ﬁnancial statements.
Of these, the T aylor Woodrow Group Pension and Life
Assurance Fund, into which the Bryant Group Pension Scheme
was merged in June 2002 and the Wilson Connolly Holdings
Pension Scheme, the Wainhomes Limited Pension Scheme, the
Prestoplan Pension Scheme and the Wilson Connolly Deﬁned
Contribution Pension Scheme were merged in August 2004, is
a funded scheme with deﬁned beneﬁt and deﬁned contribution
elements. The T aylor Woodrow Personal Choice Plan is a
Deﬁned Contribution Pension Scheme. All members of these
schemes are entitled to payment of a lump sum in the event of
death in service. Dependents of members of the deﬁned
beneﬁt elements are eligible for Dependents’ pensions. Only
basic salary is pensionable.
T aylor Woodrow Group Pension and Life Assurance Fund 
None of the executive directors is a member of the T aylor
Woodrow section of the Fund. The Fund was closed to new
entrants from 31 March 2002. With effect from 1 September
2004, a restriction was applied so as to limit the amount of any
increase in pensionable salary of members of this scheme to
the lesser of the actual increase in basic salary or the RPI,
subject to a maximum of 5 per cent per annum.  Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2005  41
At 31 December 2005 Graeme McCallum was a member of
the Wilson Connolly Holdings section of the Fund. He has a
target beneﬁt of 7 .8 per cent of his ﬁnal pensionable pay, which
is restricted to the Earnings Cap, currently £105,600, at his
normal retirement age of 60. T o reﬂect the impact of the
Earnings Cap on his pension, he also receives an additional
salary allowance/supplement of 12.5 per cent of his basic
salary. Details of Graeme McCallum’ s accrued pension
entitlements under the Fund and the opening and closing
transfer values of his accrued pension rights are shown in the
tables of directors’ pension entitlements on page 46.
The company contributes a sum to an individual deﬁned
contribution top up arrangement for each member calculated 
on the full basic salary. The company’ s contributions in respect
of Graeme McCallum totalled £2,603 (2004: £850) for the year.
T aylor Woodrow Personal Choice Pension Plan 
With effect from 1 April 2002 the company introduced the 
T aylor Woodrow Personal Choice Plan, a deﬁned contribution
Pension Scheme which all new eligible UK team members are
invited to join.
At 31 December 2005 Iain Napier and Peter Johnson were
members of this Plan. The company contributes to the Plan 38
per cent and 34.5 per cent respectively of their basic salary, of
which an amount up to the maximum permitted by the Inland
Revenue will be applied to the Plan and the balance paid as an
additional allowance, this being reduced by the amount of
employer’ s National Insurance contributions thereon. Iain
Napier and Peter Johnson each contribute 5 per cent of basic
salary, subject to the Earnings Cap.
Pensions of former directors
Denis Mac Daid retired from the Board on 30 June 2005. Prior
to his retirement, terms were agreed with him in relation to his
pension. The Company agreed that Mr. Mac Daid’ s pension
should be calculated with an assumed retirement date of 5 April
2006. The difference between beneﬁts calculated at that date
and Fund beneﬁts at his actual date of retirement is being paid
by the Company to Mr. Mac Daid by monthly installments. The
annual equivalent of this payment is £18,836. This additional
payment will increase on 1 May annually in line with increases
awarded by the T rustees on Mr. Mac Daid’ s main Fund beneﬁts,
with the ﬁrst such increase being due on 1 May 2006. The
additional payment also attracts Dependents’ beneﬁts in line
with his Fund pension.
No other arrangements were made during the year for the
provision of pensions for former directors.
UK Pensions Legislation 
The Remuneration Committee had reviewed the Company's
pensions policy in the light of changes in UK pensions
legislation. The Committee has agreed that where the
Company's pension arrangements are no longer attractive to an
employee as a result of the introduction of the new pension
taxation regime on 6 April 2006, and where the employee
advises the Company that he no longer wishes to participate in
the company's ongoing pension arrangements, the Company
will pay an additional allowance to the employee equal to the
Company pension contribution that would otherwise have been
paid to the pension arrangement, reduced by the amount of
employer's National Insurance contribution thereon. The
employee will continue to participate in the Company's lump
sum life assurance arrangements. No other compensation will
be offered. 
Performance graph
The following graph shows the company’ s performance,
measured by total shareholder return for the ﬁve year period 
to 31 December 2005, compared with the performance of the
FTSE 250 Share Index also measured by total shareholder
return. The FTSE 250 Share Index has been selected for this
comparison because the company is a constituent of that Index
and in order to provide consistency of comparison with the
2004 Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
Growth in value of a hypothetical £100 holding over ﬁve years
This graph has been prepared from information obtained through Datastream. 
It shows the theoretical growth in the value of a shareholding in the company
and in FTSE 250 companies over the specified period, assuming that dividends
are re-invested to purchase additional units of equity at the closing price
applicable on the ex-dividend date. Historical data is based on the constituent
companies at each given date.

Directors’ contracts
It is the company’ s policy that executive directors should have
contracts of employment providing for a maximum of one
year’ s notice. However, it may be necessary occasionally to
offer longer notice periods to new directors. Where this arises,
it is the company’ s policy to reduce the notice period to one
year within one year of appointment of the director.
The details of the directors’ contracts are summarised in the
table below:
Non-executive directors
None of the non-executive directors has a service contract, 
as their terms of engagement are regulated by letters of
appointment as follows:
Their fees are determined by the Board based on research of
fees paid to non-executive directors of similar companies within
the FTSE 150 index and the sector peer group, subject to the
aggregate annual limit of £600,000 imposed by the Articles of
Association.
The fees of the chairman were increased on 1 July 2005 from
£150,000 to £170,000 per annum. The basic fees of each non-
executive director were increased on 1 January 2005 from
£37 ,500 to £39,000. The Senior Independent Director and the
Audit Committee Chairman each receive an additional fee of
£10,000 and the Remuneration Committee Chairman receives
an additional fee of £5,000 in respect of these services. Non-
executive directors cannot participate in any of the company’ s
share option plans and are not eligible to join the company’ s
pension scheme. Their fees are generally reviewed at two-yearly
intervals.

It is the company’s policy that liquidated damages should not apply on the termination of an executive director’s contract. In accordance with this approach, payment
for early termination of contract (without cause) by the company is, in the case of each of the executive directors, to be determined in accordance with normal
principles of English law, which requires mitigation of liability on a case by case basis. Any such payment would typically be determined by reference to the main
elements of a director’s remuneration, namely, salary, contractual bonus, benefits-in-kind and pension entitlements. The executive directors' contracts contain no
express provisions relating to a change of control of the company. In such event the directors’ rights and entitlements would be ascertained as stated above.

Lady Robin Innes Ker
27 February 2006 Directors’ Responsibilities Statement 
Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2005  47
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report
and the ﬁnancial statements. The directors are required to
prepare accounts for the group in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and have chosen to
prepare company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK
GAAP).
In the case of UK GAAP accounts, the directors are required to
prepare ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year which give a
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of
the proﬁt or loss of the company for that period. In preparing
these ﬁnancial statements, the directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
• Make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and
prudent;
• State whether applicable accounting standards have been
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and
explained in the ﬁnancial statements;
• Prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time
the ﬁnancial position of the company, for safeguarding the
assets, for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and
detection of fraud and other irregularities and for the preparation
of a directors' report and directors' remuneration report which
comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985.
In the case of IFRS accounts, International Accounting Standard
1 requires that ﬁnancial statements present fairly for each
ﬁnancial year the company's ﬁnancial position, ﬁnancial
performance and cash ﬂows. This requires the faithful
representation of the effects of transactions, other events and
conditions in accordance with the deﬁnitions and recognition
criteria for assets, liabilities, income, and expenses set out in
the International Accounting Standards Board's 'Framework for
the preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements'. In
virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by
compliance with all applicable International Financial Reporting
Standards. Directors are also required to:
• Properly select and apply accounting policies;
• Present information, including accounting policies, in a
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and
understandable information;
• Provide additional disclosures when compliance with the
speciﬁc requirements in International Financial Reporting
Standards is insufﬁcient to enable users to understand the
impact of particular transactions; other events and conditions
on the entity's ﬁnancial position and ﬁnancial performance;
and
• Prepare the accounts on a going concern basis unless, having
assessed the ability of the company to continue as a going
concern, management either intends to liquidate the entity or
to cease trading, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity
of the company website. Legislation in the United Kingdom
governing the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial
statements differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.  48 Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2005
We have audited the Group ﬁnancial statements (the ‘ﬁnancial
statements’) of T aylor Woodrow plc for the year ended 
31 December 2005 which comprise the income statement, 
the statement of recognised income and expense, the balance
sheet, the cash ﬂow statement, the statement of accounting
policies, the related notes 1 to 37 and the reconciliation of
changes in shareholders' equity. These ﬁnancial statements
have been prepared under the accounting policies set out
therein.
The directors' remuneration report is included in the individual
company annual report of T aylor Woodrow plc for the year
ended 31 December 2005. We have reported separately on the
individual company ﬁnancial statements of T aylor Woodrow plc
for the year ended 31 December 2005 and on the information 
in the directors’ remuneration report included in the individual
company annual report that is described as having been
audited.
This report is made solely to the company’ s members, as a
body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act
1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might
state to the company’ s members those matters we are
required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other
purpose. T o the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
company and the company’ s members as a body, for our audit
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report
and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable
United Kingdom law and International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) as adopted for use in the European Union 
are set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁnancial statements in
accordance with relevant United Kingdom legal and regulatory
requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and
Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁnancial
statements give a true and fair view in accordance with the
relevant framework and whether the ﬁnancial statements have
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act
1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We report to you if, in
our opinion, the directors’ report is not consistent with the
ﬁnancial statements. We also report to you if the company has
not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all
the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information speciﬁed by law regarding directors’ remuneration
and transactions with the company and other members of the
Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement
reﬂects the company’ s compliance with the nine provisions of
the 2003 FRC Combined Code speciﬁed for our review by the
Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if
it does not. We are not required to consider whether the Board’ s
statement on internal control covers all risks and controls, or
form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’ s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures. 
Independent Auditors’ Report to the members of T aylor Woodrow plc
We read the directors’ report and the other information
contained in the annual report for the above year as described in
the contents section and we consider the implications for our
report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or
material inconsistencies with the ﬁnancial statements.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis,
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the
ﬁnancial statements. It also includes an assessment of the
signiﬁcant estimates and judgements made by the directors in
the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements, and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the company’ s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary
in order to provide us with sufﬁcient evidence to give
reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements are free
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the
ﬁnancial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, in
accordance with IFRS as adopted for use in the European
Union, of the state of the Group’ s affairs as at 31 December
2005 and of its proﬁt for the year then ended; 
• the ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 
of the IAS Regulation.
Separate opinion in relation to IFRS
As explained in the statement of accounting policies note, the
Group in addition to complying with its legal obligation to
comply with IFRS as adopted for use in the European Union,
has also complied with the IFRS as issued by the International
Accounting Standards Board. Accordingly, in our opinion the
ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance
with IFRS, of the state of the Group's affairs as at 31 December
2005 and of its proﬁt for the year then ended.

27 February 2006 Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2005  49
Basis of accounting
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in
accordance with applicable International Accounting Standards
(IAS) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as
adopted for use in the European Union and as issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board. 
The disclosures concerning the transition from UK GAAP to
IFRS, namely the reconciliations of equity at 1 January 2004
(the date of transition to IFRS), at 31 December 2004 (date of
last UK GAAP ﬁnancial statements) and the reconciliations of
proﬁt and cash ﬂow for 2004, as required by IFRS 1, are set out
in note 36. 
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on
the historical cost basis, except where stated below. The
principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements incorporate the ﬁnancial
statements of the company and entities controlled by the
company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year.
Control is achieved where the company has the power to
govern the ﬁnancial and operating policies of an investee entity
so as to obtain beneﬁts from its activities. The existence and
effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or
convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group
controls another entity.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities
of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of
acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair
values of the identiﬁable net assets acquired is recognised as
goodwill. Any deﬁciency of the cost of acquisition below the fair
values of the identiﬁable net assets acquired (i.e. discount on
acquisition) is credited to proﬁt and loss in the period of
acquisition. The interest of minority shareholders is stated 
at the minority’ s proportion of the fair values of the assets and
liabilities recognised. Subsequently, any losses applicable to the
minority interest in excess of the minority interest are allocated
against the interests of the parent.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the
year are included in the consolidated income statement from
the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of
disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are
made to the ﬁnancial statements of subsidiaries to bring the
accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are
eliminated on consolidation. 
Joint ventures are consolidated under the equity accounting
method rather than the alternative treatment of proportionate
consolidation allowed under IAS 31 ‘Interests in Joint Ventures’ .
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the
cost of acquisition over the Group’ s interest in the fair value of
the identiﬁable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary or jointly
controlled entity at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment
at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately 
Accounting Policies
in proﬁt or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary or jointly controlled entity, the
attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination
of the proﬁt or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition 
to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts
subject to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill
written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not
been reinstated and is not included in determining any
subsequent proﬁt or loss on disposal.
Revenue
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received
or receivable, net of value-added tax, rebates and discounts and
after eliminating sales within the Group. 
Revenue is recognised as follows:
(a) Private housing, development properties and land sales
Revenue is recognised at the fair value of the consideration
received or receivable on legal completion.
(b) Contracting work
Where the outcome of a construction contract can be
estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by
reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity 
at the balance sheet date. This is normally measured by surveys
of work performed to date. Variations in contract work, claims
and incentive payments are included to the extent that it is
probable that they will result in revenue and they are capable 
of being reliably measured.
Where the outcome of a construction contract cannot be
estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent
of contract costs incurred that it is probable will be recoverable.
Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in
which they are incurred. When it is probable that total contract
costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is
recognised as an expense immediately.
T ender costs
Signiﬁcant tender costs are treated as recoverable once the
directors consider that it is probable that the contract will be
won. This is presumed to be when preferred bidder status is
awarded.
Foreign currencies
The individual statements of each Group company are
presented in the currency of the primary economic
environment in which it operates (its functional currency).
T ransactions in currencies other than the functional currency are
recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the
transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and
liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the
functional currency are retranslated at the rates prevailing on
the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities
carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies
are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair
value was determined. Gains and losses arising on retranslation
are included in net proﬁt or loss for the period. 50 Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2005
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’ s
overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing
on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are
translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless
exchange rates ﬂuctuate signiﬁcantly. Exchange differences
arising are classiﬁed as reserves and transferred to the Group’ s
translation reserve. Such translation differences are recognised
as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation 
is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of
a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign
entity and translated at the closing rate. The Group has elected
to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on
acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS as assets 
and liabilities denominated in the functional currency of the
company in which they arise.
The Group enters into forward contracts and currency options
in order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange
transaction risks relating to the functional currency in
accordance with Group policy. It also uses foreign currency
borrowings and currency swaps to hedge its net investment
exposure to certain overseas subsidiaries (see below for details
of the Group's accounting policies in respect of such derivative
ﬁnancial instruments). 
Operating leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income
on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Beneﬁts received and receivable (and costs paid and payable) 
as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread
on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Property and plant
Land and buildings held for use in the production or supply of
goods or services, or for administrative purposes, are stated in
the balance sheet at their revalued amounts, being the fair value
at the date of revaluation, determined from market-based
evidence by appraisal undertaken by professional valuers, less
any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent
accumulated impairment losses. Revaluations are performed
with sufﬁcient regularity such that the carrying amount does not
differ materially from that which would be determined using fair
values at the balance sheet date.
Any revaluation increase arising on the revaluation of such land
and buildings is credited to the properties revaluation reserve,
except to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease for
the same asset previously recognised as an expense, in which
case the increase is credited to the income statement to the
extent of the decrease previously charged. A decrease in
carrying amount arising on the revaluation of such land and
buildings is charged as an expense to the extent that it exceeds
the balance, if any, held in the properties revaluation reserve
relating to a previous revaluation of that asset.
On the subsequent sale or retirement of a revalued property,
the attributable revaluation surplus remaining in the properties
revaluation reserve is transferred directly to accumulated
proﬁts.
Accounting Policies continued
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or valuation
of assets over their estimated useful lives. Depreciation is
charged, where material, on buildings over the life of the asset.
Other assets are depreciated using the straight-line method, 
on the following bases:
Plant, ﬁxtures and equipment 20%-25%
Computer equipment 33%
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset
is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds
and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in
income.
Own shares
The cost of the company’ s investment in its own shares, which
comprise shares held in treasury by the company and shares
held by employee beneﬁt trusts for the purpose of funding
certain of the company’ s share option plans, is shown as a
reduction in shareholders’ equity.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities are recognised on the
Group’ s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables and other receivables
T rade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated 
at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances 
for estimated irrecoverable amounts. 
Financial Liability and Equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classiﬁed
according to the substance of the contractual arrangements
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that
evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after
deducting all of its liabilities.
Borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges,
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and
direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis to the
proﬁt and loss account using effective interest method and are
added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent
that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
T rade payables
T rade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are
stated at their nominal value. T rade payables on extended
terms, particularly in respect of land, are recorded at their fair
value at the date of acquisition of the asset to which they relate.
The discount to nominal value is amortised over the period of
the credit term and charged to ﬁnance costs.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded at the
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2005  51
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group uses forward exchange contracts and currency
options to hedge transactions denominated in foreign
currencies. The Group also uses foreign currency borrowings 
and currency swaps to hedge its net investment exposure 
to movements in exchange rates on translation of certain
individual ﬁnancial statements denominated in foreign
currencies other than pounds sterling which is the functional
currency of the Company. Interest rate derivatives are used 
to manage interest rate risk in respect of speciﬁc borrowings.
The Group does not use derivative ﬁnancial instruments for
speculative purposes.
The use of ﬁnancial derivatives is governed by the Group’ s
policies approved by the board of directors, which provide
written principles on the use of ﬁnancial derivatives. 
Changes in the fair value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments that
are designated and effective as hedges of net investments in
foreign operations are recognised directly in reserves and the
ineffective portion, if any, is recognised immediately in the
income statement. 
For an effective hedge of an exposure to changes in the fair
value, the hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair value
attributable to the risk being hedged with the corresponding
entry in proﬁt or loss. Gains or losses from re-measuring the
derivative, or for non-derivatives the foreign currency
component of its carrying amount, are recognised in proﬁt 
or loss.
Changes in the fair value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments that
do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the
income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging
instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no
longer qualiﬁes for hedge accounting. At that time, any
cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised 
in reserves is retained in reserves until the forecasted
transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer
expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised 
in reserves is transferred to the income statement for the
period.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable
value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable,
direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred
in bringing the inventories to their present location and
condition. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling
price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be
incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
T axation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently
payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable proﬁt for the year.
T axable proﬁt differs from net proﬁt as reported in the income
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that
are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes
items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’ s liability
Accounting Policies continued
for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable 
on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities in the ﬁnancial statements and the corresponding tax
bases used in the computation of taxable proﬁt, and is
accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred
tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary
differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent
that it is probable that taxable proﬁts will be available against
which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such
assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary
difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition
(other than in a business combination) of other assets and
liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax proﬁt nor
the accounting proﬁt.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary
differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests
in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the
reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each
balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer
probable that sufﬁcient taxable proﬁts will be available to allow
all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax is
calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the
period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement,
except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to
reserves, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in
reserves.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 ‘Share-based
payments’ . In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS
2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7
November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005. 
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to
certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are
measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value is
expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based
on the Group’ s estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Employee beneﬁts
The Group accounts for pensions and similar beneﬁts under IAS
19 ‘Employee beneﬁts’ . In respect of deﬁned beneﬁt plans,
obligations are measured at discounted present value whilst
plan assets are recorded at fair value. The operating and
ﬁnancing costs of such plans are recognised separately in the
income statement; service costs are spread systematically over
the lives of employees and ﬁnancing costs are recognised in the
periods in which they arise. Actuarial gains and losses are
recognised immediately in the statement of recognised income
and expense, rather than adoption of the ‘corridor method’
alternative available under IAS 19.
Payments to deﬁned contribution schemes are charged as an
expense as they fall due. Consolidated Income Statement for the year to 31 December 2005

2004 salaries increased by the lowest of annual salary increase, increase in the Retail Price Index or 5%.

has been determined on the basis of the current business plan which extends for 6 years.
Key assumptions are:
(i) Gross margins are consistent with latest forecasts
(ii) Overhead reductions commensurate with the scale of the remaining business
(iii) Discount rate of 7.8% based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital.
The fair value of the net assets acquired in the acquisition of Wilson Connolly Holdings Plc in 2003 was revised in 2004 from
£369.0m to £362.1m. This comprised of a reduction in the fair value of tangible assets by £1.5m, a reduction in the fair value of
stocks by £5.1m and an increase in other provisions of £0.3m. Hence goodwill on acquisition increased by £6.9m from £131.0m 
to £137.9m. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for year to 31 December 2005

available for offset against future capital profits. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses because the
directors do not consider that these capital losses will be utilised in the forseeable future.

The average credit period taken on sales is 8 days (2004: 9 days). An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable
amounts from trade receivables and amounts recoverable on contracts of £2.7m (2004: £2.9m). This allowance has been
determined by reference to past default experience.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents 
This comprises of cash held by the Group and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. 
The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value.
Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash and, trade and other receivables, which represent the Group’s
maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of
allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based on prior experience and their assessment 
of the current economic environment.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is governed by Group policy that specifies the minimum credit
rating, maximum exposure and maximum tenor.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties 
and customers.

Bank borrowings are arranged at floating rates of interest, from 1.85% to 21.5% (2004: 4.35% to 25.49%), thus exposing 
the Group to cash flow interest rate risk (see Operating Performance Review on pages 11 to 25).
Secured bank loans and overdrafts totalled £6.8m (2004: £11.6m). Secured bank loans and overdrafts are secured 
on certain fixed asset properties and land.
The directors estimate the fair value of the Group’s bank borrowings to be equivalent to its book value.
At 31 December 2005, the Group had available £685.0m (2004: £800m) of undrawn committed revolving credit.

its investment in the United States of America and the interest on this has been swapped from 6.625% to floating rates
based on US$ LIBOR applicable to periods of three months.
• A currency swap relating to the 7.04% loan notes 2008 acquired with Bryant Group plc in 2001. These notes were issued
by way of a US$81m 6.59% fixed rate US private placement. The dollar proceeds were swapped into £49.5m at a fixed
rate of interest of 7.04%.
• A five year collar to December 2007, acquired with Wilson Connolly in 2003, limiting the three month LIBOR interest rate
to between 3.99% and 6.5% on £30m.
• A ten year interest swap to December 2012, acquired with Wilson Connolly in 2003, on £35m from floating rate to a fixed
interest rate of 5.8%.
At 31 December 2005, the fair value of the Group’s derivatives is a net debtor of £1.6m (2004: £5.7m). These amounts are based on
market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date, comprising £6.7m (2004: £15.2m) assets included in trade and
other receivables and £5.1m (2004: £9.5m) liabilities included in trade and other payables. The fair value of derivatives that are
designated and effective as net investment hedges amounting to £7.2m (2004: £17.8 m) has been deferred in equity. Changes in
the fair value of non-hedging currency derivatives amounting to £0.5m have been charged to income in the year (2004: £1.0m).

21 . Retirement beneﬁt schemes
Retirement benefit obligation comprises gross pension liability of £219.8m (2004: £142.5m) and gross post-retirement health care
liability of £2.7m (2004: £3.8m).
The Group operates Defined Benefit and Defined Contribution pension schemes. In the UK, the T aylor Woodrow Group Pension
and Life Assurance Fund (TWGP&LAF) and the T aylor Woodrow NHS Pension Scheme (TWNHSPS) are funded Defined Benefit
schemes providing pensions related to pay at retirement. The TWGP&LAF merged with the Bryant Group Pension Scheme (BGPS)
on 24 June 2002 and with the Wilson Connolly Holdings Pension Scheme (WCHPS), the Wainhomes Ltd Pension Scheme
(WHLPS) and the Prestoplan Pension Scheme (PPS) on 27 August 2004. The schemes are managed by trustees. All scheme
assets are held separately from the Group. With the exception of the TWNHSPS the Defined Benefit schemes are closed to new
entrants. An alternative Defined Contribution arrangement, the T aylor Woodrow Personal Choice Plan, is offered to new
employees. Contributions of £6.9m (2004: £3.1m) were charged to income in respect of defined contribution schemes. The Group
also operates a number of overseas pension schemes of the defined benefit type.
The most recent formal actuarial valuation of the TWGP & LAF was carried out at 1 June 2004 and updated to 1 September 2004 
to take account of subsequent mergers. The TWNHSPS commenced in December 2003 and the Actuary has now completed his
initial valuation with an effective date of 31 December 2003. The projected unit method was used in all valuations and assets were
taken into account using market values.
The main ﬁnancial assumptions, which are all relative to the inﬂation assumption, are as set out below:
Assumptions TWGP&LAF TWNHSPS
Inflation 2.5% pa 2.5% pa
Investment return – pre/post retirement 5.0/3.0% pa 3.0/3.0% pa
General pay inflation 0% pa 1.0% pa
Pension increases 0% pa 0% pa
Valuation results TWGP&LAF TWNHSPS
Market value of assets £563.3m £0.05m
Past service liabilities £627.9m £0.09m
Scheme funding levels 90% 58%
The actuaries to each scheme calculated the long-term funding rates to be 16.0% (TWGP&LAF) and 18%pa (TWNHSPS) of each
scheme’s respective pensionable salary roll. 
The funding policy of the T rustees is to maintain a stable contribution rate with a funding level in excess of 100%.
The valuations of the Group’s pension schemes have been updated to 31 December 2005 and the position of overseas schemes
has been included within the IAS 19 disclosures. The principal actuarial assumptions used in the calculation of the disclosure items
are as follows:
United Kingdom North America
2005 2004 2005 2004
As at 31 December
Discount rate for scheme liabilities 4.75% 5.3% 5.0-5.4% 5.9-6.0%
Expected return on scheme assets 5.8% 5.8% 6.6% 5.7%
General pay inflation 2.6% 2.5% 3.5-4.0% 4.0-4.5%
Pension increases 2.6% 2.5% 0.0-3.0% 0.0-3.0%
The above annual assumptions are prescribed by IAS 19 and do not reflect the assumptions that may be used in future funding
valuations of the Group’s pension schemes. The key change in assumptions in the year relates to future bond yields.

T o develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption, the Group considered the current level of expected returns
on risk for investments (particularly Government bonds), the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset
classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class. The expected return for each
asset class was then weighted based on the asset allocation to develop the expected long term rate of return on assets
assumption for the portfolio.

The gross post-retirement liability also includes £2.7m at 31 December 2005 (2004: £3.8m) in respect of continuing post-retirement
health care insurance premiums for retired long service employees. The liability is based upon the actuarial assessment of the
remaining cost by a qualified actuary on a net present value basis at 31 December 2005. The cost is calculated assuming a discount
rate of 5% per annum and an increase in medical expenses of 12.2% per annum. The premium cost to the Group in respect of retired
long service employees for 2005 was £0.2m (2004: £0.2m).  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for year to 31 December 2005

As explained in the statement of accounting policies, an expense is recorded in the Group's income statement over the period from
the grant date to the vesting date of share options granted to employees. As there is a temporary difference between the accounting
and tax bases, a deferred tax asset is recorded. The deferred tax asset arising is calculated by comparing the estimated amount of tax
deduction to be obtained in the future (based on the company's share price at the balance sheet date) with the cumulative amount of
the expense recorded in the income statement. If the amount of estimated future tax deduction exceeds the cumulative amount of
the remuneration expense at the statutory tax rate, the excess is recorded directly in equity, in this share-based payment tax reserve.

32. Contingent liabilities
The company and certain subsidiary undertakings have, in the normal course of business, given guarantees and entered into counter-
indemnities in respect of bonds relating to the Group's own contracts and given guarantees in respect of the Group's share of certain
contractual obligations of joint ventures.
Provision is made for the Directors' best estimate of known legal claims and legal actions in progress. The Group takes legal advice as
to the likelihood of success of claims and actions and no provision is made where the Directors’ consider, based on that advice, that
the action is unlikely to succeed or a sufficiently reliable estimate of the potential obligation cannot be made.
33. Operating lease arrangements

34. Share based payments continued
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the period was £3.17 (2004: £2.61). 
The options outstanding at 31 December 2005 had a range of exercise prices from £nil to £2.61 (2004: £nil to £2.5275) and a
weighted average remaining contractual life of 4.9 years (2004: 6.3 years).
For share options with non-market conditions granted during the current and preceding year the fair value of those options at grant
date were determined using the Binomial model. The inputs into that model were as follows:
2005 2004
Weighted average share price £3.11 £2.15
Weighted average exercise price £0.68 £0.68
Expected volatility 32.4% - 32.9% 32.4% - 33.6%
Expected life 3/5 years 3/5 years
Risk-free rate 4.33% - 4.36% 4.76% - 4.82%
Expected dividend yield 3.6% - 3.8% 3.4% - 3.5%
The weighed average fair value of share options granted during the year is £2.29 (2004: £1.95).
For share options with market conditions granted during the current year the fair value of these options were determined using the
Monte Carlo simulation model. The inputs into that model were as follows:
2005 2004
Weighted average share price £3.19 -
Weighted average exercise price £nil -
Expected volatility 26% - 30% -
Expected life 3 years -
Risk-free rate 4.2% -
Expected dividend yield 3.6% -
The weighted average fair value of share options granted during the year is £1.75 (2004: £nil)
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the expected term. 
The expected life used in the model is based on historic exercise patterns.
The group recognised total expenses of £5.9m and £3.4m related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in 2005 
and 2004 respectively.
35. Related party transactions
T ransactions between the company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and are not
disclosed in this note. T ransactions between the Group and its joint ventures are disclosed below. T ransactions between the
company and its subsidiaries and joint ventures are disclosed in the company’s separate financial statements.
T rading transactions
During the year, Group companies’ purchases from joint ventures totalled £7.3m (2004: £6.6m). Purchases were based on open
market values.

IAS 10 Events After the Balance Sheet Date
IAS 10 provides that any dividends declared after the year end represent a non-adjusting post balance sheet event and therefore no
liability should be recognised. In accordance with this provision T aylor Woodrow has decreased its current liabilities at the year end 
for dividends declared after the year end. 
IFRS 3 Business combinations
This standard requires goodwill to be carried at cost with impairment reviews carried out both annually and when there are indications
that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Under the transitional arrangements set out in IFRS 1 T aylor Woodrow has applied
IFRS 3 prospectively from the transition date. The net carrying value of goodwill as at 31 December 2003 has therefore been brought
forward as cost at 1 January 2004 with no amortisation charge from this date. 
IAS 21 The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates
On the disposal of a foreign operation or part thereof, the cumulative amount of the exchange differences deferred in translation
reserve relating to that foreign operation are now recognised in proﬁt or loss when the gain or loss on disposal is recognised.
Previously, exchange differences on share capital, revaluation reserve, pre-acquisition retained proﬁt and loss account, inter -company
long-term loans and foreign currency borrowings, to the extent they hedged the Group’ s investment in overseas operations, were
taken to revaluation reserve and transferred directly to proﬁt and loss account reserve on disposal; exchange differences on post-
acquisition proﬁt and loss account were previously taken to and remained in proﬁt and loss account reserve. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for year to 31 December 2005
82 Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2005
36. Explanation of transition to IFRS continued
IAS 12 Income T axes
IAS 12 requires separate disclosure of deferred tax asset from its associated pension deﬁcit on the balance sheet. The impact has
therefore been to reclassify the deferred tax asset in respect of retirement beneﬁt obligations that had previously been used to
reduce this provision.
IAS 19 Employee Beneﬁts
Deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme assets are required to be valued at bid prices rather than mid-market prices. 
IAS 32 & IAS 39 Financial Instruments
IAS 39 requires derivative ﬁnancial instruments to be disclosed separately at fair value, the movement of which is taken to proﬁt or
loss, and the loans related to them to be disclosed separately on the basis of their original currency at amortised cost. Previously such
loans were stated using the currency into which they had been swapped by the derivatives and the derivatives were not themselves
included on the balance sheet. In addition, land payables are now discounted and the discount amortised to ﬁnance costs over the
period of liability.
In accordance with IAS 32, preference shares were reclassiﬁed and disclosed as ﬁnancial liabilities.
Material adjustments to the cash ﬂow statement for 2004
Cash ﬂows under IFRS include those in respect of cash equivalents. An adjustment was therefore made to include the cash ﬂows in
respect of cash held on deposit for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments. 
Cash ﬂows arising from taxes on income were reclassiﬁed as cash ﬂows from operating activities, as it was not possible to identify
elements associated with ﬁnancing and investing activities. 
Cash ﬂows arising from interest payments were reclassiﬁed as cash ﬂows from operating activities on the basis that they enter into
the determination of proﬁt. 
Under IAS 31 an entity must account for joint ventures using either proportional consolidation or equity method accounting. The policy
adopted is applied to all joint ventures. T aylor Woodrow has chosen to adopt the policy of equity method accounting in respect of its
joint ventures. Under UK GAAP joint arrangements for certain housing and property developments were not considered entities and
were proportionally consolidated. An adjustment was therefore made to reverse the cash ﬂows associated with joint ventures that
were previously proportionally consolidated.
37 . Standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective
At the date of authorisation of these ﬁnancial statements, the following relevant Standards and Interpretations which have not been
applied in these ﬁnancial statements were in issue but not yet effective:
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, and the related amendment to IAS 1 on capital disclosures.
IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease.
IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2
The directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on 
the ﬁnancial statements of the Group except for additional disclosures on ﬁnancial instruments when the relevant standard comes
into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007 . Independent Auditors’ Report to the members of T aylor Woodrow plc
Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2005  83 Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2005  83
We have audited the individual company ﬁnancial statements
(the ‘ﬁnancial statements’) of T aylor Woodrow plc for the year
ended 31 December 2005 which comprise the balance sheet,
the statement of accounting policies and the related notes 1 
to 19. These ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the
accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the
information in the directors’ remuneration report that is
described as having been audited.
We have reported separately on the Group ﬁnancial statements
of T aylor Woodrow plc for the year ended 31 December 2005.
This report is made solely to the company’ s members, as a
body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act
1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might
state to the company’ s members those matters we are
required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other
purpose. T o the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
company and the company’ s members as a body, for our audit
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report,
the directors’ remuneration report and the individual company
ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable United
Kingdom law and United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice are set out in the statement of directors’
responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁnancial statements and the
part of the directors’ remuneration report described as having
been audited in accordance with relevant United Kingdom legal
and regulatory requirements and International Standards on
Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁnancial
statements give a true and fair view in accordance with the
relevant framework and whether the ﬁnancial statements and
the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited have
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act
1985. We report to you if, in our opinion, the directors’ report is
not consistent with the ﬁnancial statements. We also report to
you if the company has not kept proper accounting records, if
we have not received all the information and explanations we
require for our audit, or if information speciﬁed by law regarding
directors’ remuneration and transactions with the company is
not disclosed.
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not
complied with any of the four directors’ remuneration
disclosure requirements speciﬁed for our review by the Listing
Rules of the Financial Services Authority. These comprise the
amount of each element in the remuneration package and
information on share options, details of long term incentive
schemes, and money purchase and deﬁned beneﬁt schemes.
We give a statement, to the extent possible, of details of any
non-compliance.
We read the directors’ report and the other information
contained in the annual report for the above year as described in
the contents section including the unaudited part of the
directors’ remuneration report and consider the implications for
our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements
or material inconsistencies with the ﬁnancial statements. 
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis,
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the
ﬁnancial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration
report described as having been audited. It also includes an
assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates and judgements 
made by the directors in the preparation of the ﬁnancial
statements, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the company’ s circumstances, consistently
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary
in order to provide us with sufﬁcient evidence to give
reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements and the 
part of the directors’ remuneration report described as having
been audited are free from material misstatement, whether
caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our
opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the
presentation of information in the ﬁnancial statements 
and the part of the directors’ remuneration report described 
as having been audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, in
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice, of the state of the company's affairs 
as at 31 December 2005; 
• the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the directors’
remuneration report described as having been audited have
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 1985.
Deloitte & T ouche LLP
Chartered Accountants and Registered Auditors
London
27 February 2006 Accounting Policies
84 Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2005
The following accounting policies have been used
consistently, unless otherwise stated, in dealing with items
which are considered material.
Basis of preparation
The Companies Act ﬁnancial statements have been prepared
in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting
standards under the historical cost convention. As permitted
by the Companies Act 1985 the company has not presented
its own proﬁt and loss account.
Under Financial Reporting Standard 1, the company is
exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash ﬂow
statement on the grounds that its consolidated ﬁnancial
statements, which include the company, are publicly
available. 
Note 21, on pages 72 to 7 4, and note 34, on pages 79 and 80,
to the T aylor Woodrow plc consolidated ﬁnancial statements
form part of these ﬁnancial statements.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Group undertakings
Investments are included in the balance sheet at cost less
any provision for permanent diminution in value.
Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is provided in full on timing differences that
result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more
tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates
expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax
rates and law. Timing differences arise from the inclusion of
income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods
different from those in which they are included in the ﬁnancial
statements. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is
regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Overseas currencies
T ransactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded
in sterling at actual rates as of the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies at the year end are reported at the rates of
exchange prevailing at the year end. Any gain or loss arising
from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of
the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the
proﬁt and loss account. Unrealised exchange differences on
inter -company long term loans and foreign currency
borrowings, to the extent that they hedge the company’ s
investment in overseas investments, are taken to translation
reserve. 
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments and hedge accounting 
The company uses foreign currency borrowings and currency
swaps to hedge its investment in overseas investments.
Changes in the fair value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments
that are designated and effective as hedges of investment in
overseas operations are recognised directly in reserves and
the ineffective portion, if any, is recognised immediately in the
proﬁt and loss account.
The hedged items are adjusted for changes in exchange
rates, with gains or losses from re-measuring the carrying
amount being recognised directly in reserves.
Share-based payments
The company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 ‘Share-
based payments’ . In accordance with the transitional
provisions, FRS 20 has been applied to all grants of equity
instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as 
of 1 January 2005. 
The company issues equity-settled share-based payments to
certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are
measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value is
expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period,
based on the estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Employee beneﬁts
The company accounts for pensions and similar beneﬁts
under FRS 17 ‘Retirement beneﬁts’ . In respect of deﬁned
beneﬁt plans, obligations are measured at discounted
present value whilst plan assets are recorded at fair value. The
operating and ﬁnancing costs of such plans are recognised
separately in the consolidated income statement; service
costs are spread systematically over the lives of employees
and ﬁnancing costs are recognised in the periods in which
they arise. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised
immediately in the consolidated statement of recognised
income and expense.
Payments to deﬁned contribution schemes are charged as an
expense as they fall due.
Own shares
The cost of the company’ s investment in its own shares,
which comprise shares held in treasury by the company and
shares held by employee beneﬁt trusts for the purpose of
funding certain of the company’ s share option plans, is
shown as a reduction in shareholders’ funds. Company Balance Sheet at 31 December 2005

1 . Prior year adjustment
Following the adoption of FRS21 ‘Events after the balance sheet date’ , dividends declared after the balance sheet date are no longer
recognised as a liability at the balance sheet date. Comparative ﬁgures for 2004 have been restated accordingly.
The adoption of FRS21 led to an increase of £8.1m in retained proﬁt for the year to 31 December 2004 and an increase of £45.5m in
net assets at 31 December 2004.
The effect of the prior year adjustment on the current year has been an increase of £7 .2m in retained proﬁt.
Following the adoption of FRS 26 ‘Financial Instruments: Measurement’ , derivative ﬁnancial instruments that are designated and
effective as hedges of investments in foreign operations are measured at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognised directly in
reserves and the ineffective portion, if any, is recognised immediately in the proﬁt and loss account. Comparative ﬁgures for 2004
have been restated accordingly. 
The adoption of FRS26 led to an increase in net assets at 31 December 2004 of £1 .3m. There were no changes to retained proﬁt for
the year to 31 December 2004. There have been no changes in retained proﬁt for the current year as a result of the prior year
adjustment.

9. Retirement beneﬁt obligations
The company participates in the T aylor Woodrow Group Pension and Life Assurance Fund. This is a deﬁned beneﬁt multi-employer
plan, the assets and liabilities of which are held independently from the Group. The company is unable to identify its share of the
underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme and accordingly accounts for the plan as if it were a deﬁned contribution plan. 
Information in respect of the scheme is provided in note 21, on pages 72 to 7 4, to the T aylor Woodrow plc consolidated ﬁnancial
statements. The fair value of assets as disclosed in those ﬁnancial statements has been calculated in accordance with International
Accounting Standard 19 ‘Employee Beneﬁts’ . In accordance with Financial Reporting Standard No. 17 ‘Retirement Beneﬁts’ (FRS 17)
the total fair value of scheme assets would be £707 .2m (2004: £628.2m). All other information provided in those ﬁnancial
statements meets the disclosure requirements set out in FRS 17 . 
Contributions in respect of the deﬁned contribution scheme for directors can be found in the Remuneration Report on page 46.
There were no outstanding contributions at the year end.

The Directors present their report and the audited financial statements (pages 29 to 76) of Cohort plc for the year ended 30 April 2011. 
Cohort plc is a company incorporated in and operating from England. Its registered address is Arlington House, 1025 Arlington Business Park, 
Theale, Reading RG7 4SA. The Corporate governance report set out on pages 32 to 33 forms part of this report.
Principal activities
The principal activity of the Company is that of a holding company. The principal activities of the Group are described in the 
“Who we are” section on the inside front cover and the Overview on pages 2 to 5.
Business review
The Company is required by the Companies Act 2006 to include a business review in this report. The information that fulfils the 
requirements of the business review can be found in the following sections, which are incorporated in this report by reference:
         Pages
 Chairman’s statement   4 to 5
 Chief Executive’s review  6 to 9
 Finance Director’s review  10 to 15
 Operations reviews   16 to 21
Information about the use of financial instruments by the Company and its subsidiaries is given in note 21 to the financial statements 
and in pages 10 to 15 of the Finance Director’s review.
There are no significant events since the balance sheet date.
Dividends
The Directors recommend a final dividend of 1.60 pence (2010: 1.40 pence) per 10 pence ordinary share to be paid on 7 September 2011 
to ordinary shareholders on the register on 5 August 2011 which, together with the interim dividend of 0.80 pence paid on 2 March 2011, 
makes a total of 2.40 pence for the year (2010: 2.05 pence).
Research and development
During the year ended 30 April 2011 the Group expenditure on research and development, both on behalf of customers and the 
Group’s own private venture expenditure was £10.2m (2010: £8.5m).
Going concern
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis. The reasons for this are set out on page 68 of the 
Accounting Policies.
Capital structure
Details of issued share capital, together with details of the movements in the Company’s issued share capital during the year are shown 
in note 22. The Company has one class of ordinary shares which carry no right to fixed income. Each share carries the right to one vote 
at general meetings of the Company.
There are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding nor on the transfer of shares, which are both governed by the general provisions 
of the Articles of Association and prevailing legislation. The Directors are not aware of any agreements between holders of the Company’s 
shares that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights.
Details of employee share schemes are set out in note 23. Shares held by the Cohort plc Employee Benefit Trust abstain from voting 
and do not receive any dividend.
No person has any special rights of control over the Company’s share capital and all issued shares are fully paid.
With regard to the appointment and replacement of Directors, the Company is governed by its Articles of Association, the Combined 
Code, the Companies Act and related legislation. The Articles themselves may be amended by special resolution of the shareholders. 
The powers of Directors are described in the Main Board Terms of Reference, copies of which are available on request, and the 
Corporate governance report on pages 32 to 33.
Under its Articles of Association, the Company has authority to issue up to a third of its issued shares as new ordinary shares. 
This approximates to 13.6m shares at 30 April 2011.
There are also a number of other agreements that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company, such as: 
commercial contracts; bank loan agreements; property lease arrangements; and employee share plans. None of these are considered 
to be significant in terms of their likely impact on the business of the Group as a whole. Furthermore, the Directors are not aware of any 
agreements between the Company and its Directors or employees that provide for compensation for loss of office or employment that occurs 
because of a takeover bid, other than those disclosed in the Remuneration & Appointments Committee report on page 34 to 36.

are held and notices are published containing information about matters of interest within the Group and its subsidiaries.
Disabled employees

Corporate governance 
Corporate governance report
Introduction
As Cohort plc is listed on AIM it is neither required to comply with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance that was issued in 
2008 by the Financial Reporting Council (the Code) nor issue a statement of compliance with it. Nevertheless, the Board fully supports 
the principles set out in the Code and seeks to comply wherever this is appropriate, having regard to the size of the Company and the 
resources available to it. Details are provided below of how the Company applies the Code.
The Board
The Board of Directors comprises the Chairman, two Executive Directors and two Non-executive Directors, Stanley Carter (Co-Chairman) 
and Sir Robert Walmsley. Nick Prest and Stanley Carter are not considered independent.
The Board has determined Sir Robert Walmsley to be independent and he is designated the Senior Independent Director.
The Board meets most months and receives a monthly Board pack comprising individual reports from each of the Executive Directors 
and the subsidiary Managing Directors together with any other material deemed necessary for the Board to discharge its duties. It is the 
Board’s responsibility to formulate, review and approve the Group’s strategy, budgets, major items of expenditure and acquisitions.
All Directors retire by rotation and are subject to election by shareholders at intervals of once every three years.
Board committees
The Board has established two committees: Audit and Remuneration & Appointments, each having written terms of delegated responsibilities.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises the Company Chairman and the Non-executive Directors and is scheduled to meet at least twice 
a year. It is the Audit Committee’s role to provide formal and transparent arrangements for considering how to apply the financial 
reporting and internal control requirements of the Code, whilst maintaining an appropriate relationship with the independent auditor 
of the Group. In order to comply with the requirement of the Code that at least one member has relevant financial experience, 
the Chairman of the Board sits on the Audit Committee. 
The independent auditor liaises with the Audit Committee regarding work to be undertaken and complies with the Ethical Standards 
for Auditors issued by the Auditing Practice Board. Each year, prior to commencing its audit work, the independent auditor confirms 
in writing the nature of any non-audit work on behalf of the Group and the safeguards in place to ensure its independence and objectivity; 
any in-year proposals for non-audit work are subject to prior approval by the Audit Committee.
The Company has formal arrangements in place to facilitate “whistle-blowing” by employees through a contract with a third-party 
service provider. If any call is made to this third party, either the Chief Executive or the Chairman of the Audit Committee is notified 
promptly of the fact and the content of the call, so that appropriate action can be taken. 
Remuneration & Appointments Committee
The Remuneration & Appointments Committee comprises the Company Chairman and the Non-executive Directors and is scheduled 
to meet at least once a year. It is the Remuneration & Appointments Committee’s role to establish a formal and transparent policy 
on Executive remuneration and to set remuneration packages for individual Directors.
Sir Robert Walmsley is Chairman of both the Audit and Remuneration & Appointments Committees.
The attendance of the Directors at Board and Committee meetings for the year ended 30 April 2011 was as follows:
           Remuneration & 
        Board  Audit Appointments 
        (10 meetings)  (4 meetings) (3 meetings)
N Prest (Chairman)       10  4  3
S Carter (Co-Chairman)      10  4  3
Sir Robert Walmsley (Non-executive Director)    9  4  3
A Thomis (Chief Executive)      10  —  —
S Walther (Finance Director and Company Secretary)    10  —  —
The Board has not established a Nominations committee. This is not considered necessary due to the small size of the Cohort Board. 
The role of the Nominations committee is undertaken by the Remuneration & Appointments Committee and the Chief Executive.  Cohort plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 www.cohortplc.com

Management of the Group and its subsidiary undertakings
The management of the Group and subsidiary undertakings is as follows:
Group management
 Cohort plc Board meeting at least eight times per year.
  Group Executive committee meeting at least four times per year, comprising Cohort plc Executive Directors and subsidiary 
Managing Directors.
Subsidiary management
  Monthly executive management meetings involving the senior management of each subsidiary. Cohort Executive Directors attend 
subsidiary executive management meetings on a regular basis.
Shareholder relations
The Company meets with its institutional shareholders and analysts as appropriate and uses the AGM to encourage communication with 
private shareholders. In addition, the Company uses the Annual Report and Accounts, Interim Report and website (www.cohortplc.com) 
to provide further information to shareholders.
Internal control and risk management
The Board is responsible for the system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such systems are designed to manage rather 
than eliminate risks and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. Each year, on 
behalf of the Board, the Audit Committee will review the effectiveness of these systems. This is achieved primarily by considering the 
risks potentially affecting the Group and from discussions with the external auditor.
The Group does not currently have an internal audit function due to the small size of the administrative function and the high level 
of Director review and authorisation of transactions.
A comprehensive budgeting process is completed once a year, reviewed and approved by the Board. In addition the Group conducts 
quarterly re-forecasts. The Group’s results, as compared against budget and the latest quarterly forecast, are reported to the Board 
on a monthly basis and discussed in detail at each meeting of the Board.
As reported on last year, the Board (through the Chairman of the Audit Committee) undertook a review of the oversight and control 
of the Group and its subsidiaries. The significant recommendations of this report, which was independently reviewed, have now been 
implemented including the key recommendations of:
 closer oversight of the subsidiaries by the Cohort Executive; and
 review and implementation of business processes at SCS.
In the case of the latter recommendation, further assurance was obtained at the interim review last December when the Group’s auditor, 
KPMG, carried out a review of SCS’s business processes which confirmed the progress made. Cohort plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 www.cohortplc.com

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent company financial statements for each financial year. As required by 
the AIM Rules of the London Stock Exchange, they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements on the same basis.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and 
parent company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and
  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent 
company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure 
that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Directors’ responsibility statement
We confirm to the best of our knowledge:
1.  the financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
2.  the management report, which is incorporated into the Directors’ report, includes a fair review of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with 
a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Independent auditor’s report
to the members of Cohort plc
We have audited the financial statements of Cohort plc for the year ended 30 April 2011 set out on pages 40 to 76. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the EU and, as regards the parent company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions 
of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities set out on page 37, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit, and express an opinion 
on, the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements is provided on the APB’s website at www.frc.org.uk/apb/scope/private.cfm.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
  the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 30 April 2011 
and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
 the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
  the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU 
and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
 the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
 the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
 certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries. These subsidiaries are the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
Abacus EW was acquired 14 May 2010 (see note 32). The goodwill and other intangible assets arising on this acquisition have been 
included as part of MASS (the acquiring entity), the separable and identifiable cash-generating unit.
The amortisation charge is disclosed as “Amortisation of other intangible assets” in the income statement.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the subsidiaries (cash-generating units) are determined from value-in-use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates and any other factors which 
may affect future performance as known of in the current period.
The Group’s subsidiaries have prepared cash flow forecasts as part of the recent annual budgetary process, as approved by management. 
This provides the next three years’ cash flow forecasts which have been extrapolated forward at an estimated long-term growth rate 
of 2.25% (2010: 2.25%). The cash flow forecasts are prepared on a consistent basis based upon each subsidiary’s budget. To this has 
been applied the Group’s estimated weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 12.3% (2010: 11.5%).
The Group’s WACC is an estimate based upon the Company’s current equity risk, market interest rates, Company debt interest rates 
and market equity risk. The same rate of WACC and long-term growth rate have been applied to the assessment of the carrying value 
of goodwill for both MASS and SEA, since the businesses have similar market experience and exposures.
On the basis of these tests, no impairment of goodwill has arisen in the year ended 30 April 2011 in respect of MASS (including Abacus EW).
The impairment test for the goodwill in respect of SEA is more sensitive with no impairment at the Group’s WACC of 12.3% but is impaired 
by £5.0m if the Group’s WACC increases to 15.5%. Cohort plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 www.cohortplc.com

16. Trade and other receivables continued
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair values. The largest trade receivable 
to which the Group is exposed at 30 April 2011 is the UK MOD, with a balance outstanding of £3.5m (2010: £4.2m). Other customers who 
represent more than 5% of the total balance of trade receivables include:

Customer A          1.6 2.3
Customer B          1.1 3.4
Customer C          1.0 0.1
Trade receivables include £1.7m (2010: £4.1m) denominated in foreign currency.
The majority of the Group’s customers are UK or overseas government organisations and larger prime contractors in the defence 
and space sectors.
The Group assesses all new customers for credit worthiness before extending credit. In the case of overseas customers, the Group utilises 
various payment protection mechanisms including but not limited to export credit guarantees, letters of credit and advance payments.
Trade receivables disclosed above include amounts which are part due at the reporting date but against which the Group has not 
recognised an allowance for doubtful debts because the credit quality of the customer is not considered to have changed and the 
amount due is considered fully recoverable.

Trade payables and accruals principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing contract costs. Advance receipts 
reflect invoicing ahead of work done in accordance with contracted terms. The average credit period taken for trade purchases is 53 days 
(2010: 26 days). The Group has financial risk management policies in place to ensure that all payables are paid within the pre-agreed 
credit terms.
Trade payables and accruals, other payables and taxes are all due for settlement within 12 months of the year-end, the majority within 
three months. The advance receipts will unwind over the next 12 months.
Social security and other taxes include employment taxes and VAT.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade payables approximates to their fair values. 
Total payable includes £1.3m (2010: £1.5m) denominated in foreign currency. Cohort plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 www.cohortplc.com

applicable to the overdraft facility when drawn is at 2.25% (2010: 2.25%) above the Bank of England base rate. Overdrafts in currency 
other than sterling are not part of the sterling current account offset facility and are disclosed as part of bank borrowings above.
b.  The bank loans of the Group are as follows:
 i.  £3.0m structured debt facility of 364 days with an option to term the loan out (fix the repayment period of the borrowing) 
for up to three years during the 364 day period, at a floating rate of 2.00% to 2.75% above LIBOR, fixed in advance on one 
to six month terms; and 
 ii.  £0.4m in mortgages repayable over 15 years with completion dates of 26 February 2012 and 8 July 2017 for £49,000 
and £395,000 respectively.

At 30 April 2011, the Group had available £5.0m of undrawn overdraft facility and £4.5m of undrawn committed structured debt facility. 
During the year ended 30 April 2011, the Group switched £2.5m of undrawn facility from its committed structured debt facility to its 
overdraft facility. All facilities are in sterling. The Directors consider the carrying amount of bank borrowings approximate to their fair value.
The Group’s net funds at 30 April 2011 of £6.7m (2010: £3.0m) are all with RBS.

The earn out provision in respect of the acquisition of Abacus EW was recognised at 14 May 2010. The earn out payable of up to £1.4m 
is disclosed above on acquisition and is potentially payable over the next two years. However, the full amount is potentially payable within 
12 months and the provision is disclosed as due in less than one year for that reason. Any reduction in the net earn out payable in 
respect of Abacus EW over the next two years will be recognised in the consolidated income statement as an exceptional item.
The MASS earn out was in respect of the obligation of the Group to settle deferred consideration payable to the vendors of MASS on receiving 
certain overseas contracts as set out in the sale and purchase agreement pertaining to the acquisition. On 5 June 2009, agreement was 
reached to pay the vendors of MASS £280,000 (after costs) in full settlement of the earn out. The earn out was paid on 11 June 2009.
The provision in respect of the withdrawal from AGS is to cover existing commitments related to the period prior to the sale of the 
AGS business in August 2009.
The restructuring provision at 30 April 2011 is in respect of the Group’s subsidiaries: £54,000 in respect of SEA and £8,000 in respect 
of SCS (2010: £105,000 in respect of SCS). All provisions are expected to be utilised in the next 12 months.
The onerous lease commitment is in respect of MASS’s continuing lease obligations on its former operating property in St Neots which 
it vacated in August 2010 to enter its new freehold property, Enterprise House. This obligation will expire in May 2013.
The warranty provisions are management’s best estimates of the Group’s liability under warranties granted on software and other 
products supplied and are based upon past experience. The timing of such expenditure is uncertain although warranties generally 
have a time limit of no more than 12 months, unless a longer warranty period is purchased by the customer. 
Warranty provisions are reviewed at the half year and year-end in the light of actual spend and the remaining obligations to be fulfilled.
The other contract related provisions are management’s best estimate of the Group’s exposure to contract related costs and undertakings 
which are in addition to contract accruals and include contract loss provisions. The timing of these is uncertain but expected to be 
resolved within 12 months of the balance sheet date. These arise where a service or product has been previously delivered to the 
customer and the Group receives a claim or an adverse indication in respect of the work done. Where the amount required is uncertain 
or the Group disputes the amount of the claim, provisions is made for the best estimate of the amount that will be required to settle 
the issue. Cohort plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 www.cohortplc.com

19. Provisions continued
Contract loss provisions are in respect of contracts where the estimated cost at completion exceeds the total expected revenue 
of the contract. The contract loss provision is recognised as a provision in full immediately it arises. The contract loss provisions 
are held in respect of contracts which are expected to complete in the next 12 months.
Other contract related provisions also includes property dilapidation provisions and other trade related issues which may not be 
related to a trading contract. These balances are immaterial.

The deferred tax charge of £600,000 is a combination of the charge to the income statement (£755,000) and the effect of the change 
in tax rate from 28% to 26% on those items recognised in the income statement (£155,000 credit).
The charge is disclosed as £14,000 (2010: £639,000 credit) in respect of the current year and £586,000 (2010: £Nil) in respect of prior 
years. The prior years’ charge mainly arises from general provisions being recognised as specific provisions in the corporation tax for 
prior years.
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to do so. The following 
is the analysis of the deferred tax balances (after offset) for financial reporting purposes:
           2011 2010 
           £’000 £’000

Deferred tax liabilities         (1,601) (1,053)
           (1,483) (38)
At the balance sheet date the Group had unused trading tax losses within its subsidiaries of £1.9m (2010: £1.6m) available for offset 
against future profits. This was not recognised as a deferred tax asset at 30 April 2011 (2010: £467,000 asset) as the losses are not 
considered recoverable in the foreseeable future. These tax losses can all be carried forward indefinitely.

20. Deferred tax continued
A deferred tax liability in respect of the revaluation of freehold building arose on the acquisition of SEA and is the potential tax 
liability payable on the revaluation gain in respect of the building with reference to its historical cost.
The deferred tax asset in respect of the share-based payments has not been recognised as the Group’s share options in issue remain 
below the average market price and the realisation of any deferred tax asset is considered remote.
The Company’s deferred tax balance at 30 April 2011 was an asset of £6,000 (2010: £4,000) being £5,000 (2010: £4,000) in respect 
of other short-term timing differences and accelerated tax depreciation of £1,000 (2010: £Nil).
On 23 March 2011, the Chancellor announced the reduction in the main rate of UK corporation tax to 26% with effect from 1 April 2011. 
This change became substantively enacted on 29 March 2011 and therefore the effect of the rate reduction creates a reduction in the 
deferred tax liability which has been included in the figures above.
The Chancellor also proposed changes to further reduce the main rate of corporation tax by 1% per annum to 23% by 1 April 2014, but 
these changes have not yet been substantively enacted and therefore are not included in the figures above. The overall effect of the 
further reductions from 26% to 23%, if these applied to the deferred tax balance at 30 April 2011, would be to further reduce the net 
tax liability by £171,000.

Interest rate swaps
The Group uses an interest rate swap to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its mortgage borrowings.
A contract with nominal value of £395,000 (2010: £476,000) has fixed interest payments at a rate of 6.38% for periods up until August 2016.
The fair value of the swap entered into at 30 April 2011 is estimated at £428,000 (2010: £491,000). These amounts are based on market 
values of equivalent instruments at 30 April 2011.
This interest rate swap is designated and effective as a cash flow hedge. The derivative financial instrument in respect of the interest 
rate swap is valued as follows:
           2011 2010

The SAYE options have maturity periods of three or five years from grant date.
The Group plan provides for a grant price equal to the average quoted market price of the Group shares on the date of grant. The vesting 
period is generally three years, five years in the case of some SAYE schemes. If options under the Cohort plc 2006 share option scheme 
remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the options expire. Furthermore, options are forfeited if the 
employee leaves the Group before the options vest. Cohort plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 www.cohortplc.com

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was £Nil (2010: £1.72). The options 
outstanding at 30 April 2011 had a weighted average exercise price of £1.28 (2010: £1.58) and a weighted average remaining contractual 
life of six years (2010: six years).
In the year ended 30 April 2011, options were granted as follows: 966,947 on 23 July 2010, 397,227 on 27 July 2010 and 64,935 on 
27 October 2010. The fair values of the options granted on those dates were £0.835, £0.970 and £0.770 respectively. In the year ended 
30 April 2010 options were granted as follows: 617,777 on 5 August 2010 and 362,923 on 18 August 2010. The fair values of the options 
granted on those dates were £1.715 and £1.380 respectively.
Share options granted during the current and previous years were valued using the Quoted Companies Alliance Model, a Black Scholes 
based binomial model. The inputs to this model for the current and previous year were as follows:
          2011  2010
Weighted average share price        £0.78  £1.43
Weighted average exercise price       £1.28  £1.58
Expected volatility         20% – 45%  20% – 38%
Risk free rate        2.45% – 5.75% 2.91% – 5.75%
Leaver rate (per annum)       6.5% – 10.0% 6.5% – 10.0% 
Dividend yield        0.26% – 1.96%  0.26% – 0.62%
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous three years. 
The leaver rate used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, 
exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised a cost of £317,000 (2010: £259,000) relating to share-based payment transactions which are all equity settled, 
an equivalent amount being transferred to the share option reserve.
The cost of share-based payments is included in “administrative costs” within the consolidated income statement.

The change in the loans, current accounts and sales ledgers reflects purchases, sales and support costs to the related party 
undertakings less any receipts received.
The relationships are described as follows:
  AGS – the interest in which is owned by SCS, a 50% joint venture. From 1 May 2009 this has been accounted for as an investment, 
the Group no longer having an active participation in this entity.
  DMM – the interest in which is owned by SCS, a 25% joint venture. From 1 November 2006 this has been accounted for as an investment, 
the Group no longer having an active participation in this entity.
The change in investment in the current and previous year in DMM reflects recovery of the investment through a dividend.
The Group is expected to have no significant transactions with either AGS or DMM. Cohort plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 www.cohortplc.com

31. Related party transactions continued
The Group had a leasing agreement (dated 27 February 2006) with the Court House Partnership to lease the Court House at an annual 
rent of £57,000 for an initial period of five years, terminable by the Group with six months’ notice at no penalty. Stanley Carter (a Director 
of Cohort plc) is a partner in the Court House Partnership. SCS vacated the Court House on 31 March 2010 with its lease commitment 
ceasing at that point. The Group’s dilapidation obligations in respect of the Court House are still to be determined and an estimate has 
been provided for at 30 April 2011. The transactions with Directors of the Company are disclosed in the Remuneration & Appointments 
Committee report on pages 34 to 36.
During the year ended 30 April 2011, the Directors of Cohort plc received dividends from the Company as follows:

32. Acquisition of subsidiary
On 14 May 2010 the Group’s subsidiary, MASS Consultants Limited acquired the entire share capital of Abacus EW Consultancy Limited 
(Abacus EW) for a cash consideration of £918,000 and deferred cash consideration of up to £1.4m payable over three years from completion 
according to specific performance criteria being achieved by Abacus EW over the three-year period to 30 April 2013. The sale and purchase 
agreement included a deferred cash consideration of up to £1.8m. This was reduced to £1.4m at 30 April 2011 following review of the 
specific performance criteria which indicated £0.4m of deferred consideration was no longer payable.

A deferred tax liability of £840,000 in respect of the other intangible asset balance above was established on acquisition and is disclosed 
in the deferred tax liability (see note 20).
The goodwill of £352,000 arising from the acquisition represents the customer contacts, supplier relationships and territorial know-how 
to which no certain value can be ascribed. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
The contingent consideration arrangement or earn out was payable in cash to the vendor of Abacus EW over the three-year period 
to 30 April 2013 as follows:
         2011 2012 2013 Total

The maximum earn out payable was £1.8m.
Review of the earn out obligation at 30 April 2011 has shown no earn out is payable in respect of the specific contract win for 2011 
and 2012. The £0.4m earn out has been derecognised and the adjustment made to the other intangible assets arising on acquisition.
The earn out in respect of the performance of Abacus EW is payable up to 30 April 2013 to a maximum of £1.4m. This earn out is 
payable in each of the years ended 30 April 2012 and 30 April 2013, up to the maximum of £1.4m in total. The earn out is payable up 
to the maximum in any one year and has been recognised as a provision due in less than one year at 30 April 2011.
Acquisition costs of £13,000 (2010: £75,000) in respect of Abacus EW were charged as an exceptional item in the consolidated income 
statement. The total acquisition costs were £88,000.
Abacus EW contributed £1,680,000 of revenue and £753,000 to the Group’s adjusted operating profit for the period from 14 May 2010 
to 30 April 2011.
If the acquisition of Abacus EW had been completed on 1 May 2010, the Group’s reserves for the year and the Group’s adjusted 
operating profit would not have changed from that reported in this Annual Report and Accounts.  Cohort plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 www.cohortplc.com

Financial statements 
Accounting policies
Basis of accounting
Both the parent company financial statements and the Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (Adopted IFRSs). On publishing the parent 
company financial statements here, together with the Group financial statements, the Company is taking advantage of the exemption 
in Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and related notes that form part of these 
approved financial statements.
As highlighted in note 18 to the financial statements, the Company meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through an 
offsetting facility which is due for renewal in October 2011. Both the current domestic economic conditions and continuing UK 
Government budget pressures, including defence, create uncertainty particularly over (a) the level of demand for the Group’s 
products; (b) the exchange rate between sterling and euro and thus the consequence for certain long-term contracts; and (c) the 
availability of bank finance in the foreseeable future.
The Company’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Company 
should be able to operate within the level of its current facility. The Company will open renewal negotiations with the bank in due 
course and has at this stage not sought any written commitment that the facility will be renewed. However, the Company has held 
discussion with its bankers about its future borrowing needs and no matters have been drawn to its attention to suggest that renewal 
may not be forthcoming on acceptable terms.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual financial statements.
Further information regarding the Company’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position is set out in the Business review on pages 6 to 25. The financial position of the Company, its cash flows, 
liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Finance Director’s review on pages 10 to 15.
In addition, the Finance Director’s review of the financial statements includes the Company’s objectives, policies and processes 
for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities; and 
its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings made 
up to 30 April 2011. Subsidiaries acquired during the year are consolidated from the date of acquisition, using the purchase method 
(see business combinations opposite).
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used in line with 
those used by the Group. This is necessary as the Group’s subsidiaries continue to prepare statutory financial statements in accordance 
with UK GAAP.
Adoption of new and revised standards
The following new and revised standards and interpretations have been adopted in the current year. Their adoption has not had any 
significant impact on the amounts reported in these financial statements but they may impact the accounting for future transactions 
and arrangements.
Standard     Timing   Effect    Financial effect

‘Share-based Payments’; Amendment to IAS 17 ‘Leases’; Amendment to IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ 
have been adopted by the Group but have no impact.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including 
premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis in the income statement 
using the effective interest rate method and are disclosed within accruals to the extent they are not settled in the period, unless the 
loan terms provide for the interest to be added to the principal, in which case the interest is added to the carrying amount of the 
instrument to which it pertains. Cohort plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 www.cohortplc.com

Borrowing costs
All borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred unless, where appropriate, 
interest costs are capitalised into assets, fixed and current.
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured as the aggregate 
of the fair values, at the completion date, of assets acquired, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the 
Group in exchange for control of the acquired subsidiary. The costs of acquisition are charged to the Group income statement as 
an exceptional item in accordance with IFRS 3 (Revised).
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business 
combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable intangible assets, assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities recognised. If, after reassessment, which is a point in time greater than 12 months after the completion date, the Group’s 
interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds or is below the cost of 
the business combination, the excess or shortfall is recognised immediately in the income statement as an exceptional item.
Adjustments to the provisional value of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination when the final values have become 
known within 12 months are adjusted as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date and the comparative information 
for prior periods is restated accordingly.
Any change in consideration, where previously estimated, is immediately recognised as an exceptional item in the income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and on-demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Deposits are included within cash and 
cash equivalents where the maturity from commencement of the deposit is three months or less.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Group uses 
foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures. The Group does not use derivative 
financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are 
recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. If the cash flow hedge 
of a firm commitment or forecasted transaction results in the recognition of an asset or a liability, then, at the time the asset or 
liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in 
the initial measurement of the asset or liability. For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts 
deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net income.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income 
statement as they arise.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Exceptional items
Cohort’s trade is the provision of technical advice and support, and the design, development and manufacture of niche products. 
As part of its operations, the Group may dispose of, or recognise impairment of, subsidiaries, or significant parts of subsidiaries, 
associates (including joint ventures and investments) and fixed assets as well as other significant non-trading transactions including 
significant restructuring costs, either as part of continuing operations or discontinued operations.
These items form part of the Group’s operating activities and are reported in arriving at the Group’s profit from operations, however, 
management does not consider these items to be part of trading activities. The gains or losses on such items can be significant and 
arise in different reporting periods and would consequently have a material impact upon the absolute amount of and trend in the 
Group’s trading profit from operations.
Any gains or losses (including transaction costs) on these non-trading items are disclosed as a separate line item (in aggregate) in the 
income statement with analysis in a note to the accounts.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. Cohort plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 www.cohortplc.com

Financial statements 
Accounting policies continued
Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. 
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each Group Company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which it operates (its functional currency), which is currently sterling for the whole Group. For the purpose of the consolidated 
financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in pounds sterling, which is the functional 
currency of the Company, and the presentational currency for the consolidated financial statements. 
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency 
(foreign currencies) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary 
assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. 
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in the 
income statement for the year. 
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts (see page 69 for details 
of the Group’s Accounting policies in respect of such derivative financial instruments).
These forward foreign exchange contracts are revalued to fair value at each balance sheet date with any movement included 
in the consolidated income statement as part of the cost of sales.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the 
identifiable intangible assets, assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition. 
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. 
Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately 
in the income statement as an exceptional item and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s subsidiaries as appropriate. Subsidiaries (cash-generating 
units) to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the 
unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the subsidiary is less than the carrying amount of the subsidiary, the impairment 
loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the subsidiary and then to the other assets of the 
subsidiary pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the subsidiary. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is 
not reversed in a subsequent period. The impairment of goodwill is a critical judgement and estimate and is discussed in detail below.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination 
of the profit or loss on disposal.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there 
is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset 
is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment (if any). An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for 
impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows 
are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or subsidiary) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset 
(subsidiary) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset 
is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease. 
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (subsidiary) is increased to the revised estimate 
of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (subsidiary) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is 
recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the 
impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase. Cohort plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 www.cohortplc.com

Intangible assets
Intangible assets are recognised in respect of contracts, intellectual property rights and other measurable intangibles arising on 
business combinations. The value of these intangible assets is determined by the estimated value to the Group going forward and the 
intangible assets are written off on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. As discussed below, the valuation of intangible 
assets is an area of critical judgement and estimate by the Directors.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost of finished goods and work in progress includes overheads 
appropriate to the stage of manufacture. Net realisable value is based upon estimated selling price less further cost expected to be 
incurred to completion and disposal. Provision is made for obsolete and slow-moving items.
Joint ventures
The Group accounts for joint ventures where it has a participating interest using the equity method of accounting and discloses 
the net investment in non-current assets.
Where the investment in a joint venture is negative, the negative investment, to the extent it is a liability of the Group, is offset 
against any trade and other receivables held by the Group in respect of that joint venture.
The Group accounts for joint ventures in which it no longer has a participating interest by recognising any investment and assets 
or liabilities due to or from the Group.
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
The Group as lessee
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum 
lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet 
as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to 
achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. 
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term.
Pension contributions
Payments are made to the Company’s stakeholder pension schemes, all defined contribution schemes. Amounts are charged to the 
income statement as incurred.
Property, plant and equipment
Land and buildings held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, or for administrative purposes, are stated in the 
balance sheet at their fair value at the date of acquisition, plus any subsequent cost, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation 
and subsequent accumulated impairment losses. 
Fixtures and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets, other than land and properties under construction, over their 
estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases:
Buildings        2% – 4% 
Fixtures, fittings and equipment 20% – 50%
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, 
over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement as an exceptional item.  Cohort plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 www.cohortplc.com

Financial statements 
Accounting policies continued
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and it is probable that 
the Group will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required 
to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material. In respect of specific 
types of provisions the policy is as follows:
Restructuring
A restructuring provision is recognised when the Group has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a 
valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main 
features to those affected by it. The measurement of a restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures arising from the 
restructuring, which are those amounts that are both necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not associated with the ongoing 
activities of the Group.
Onerous lease commitment
Present obligations arising under an onerous lease are recognised and measured as a provision. An onerous lease is considered to exist 
where the Group has a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the lease exceed the economic 
benefits expected to be received.
An onerous lease includes the vacation of a property prior to termination of the associated lease.
Warranty
Provisions for the expected cost of warranty obligations under local sale of goods legislation and specifically contracted warranty 
undertakings are recognised at the date of sale of the relevant product or service. The provision is the Directors’ best estimate 
of the expenditure required to settle the Group’s obligation.
Other contract related provisions including contract loss provisions
These include the following:
The Group undertakes a number of contracts where contractual and/or third-party obligations arise as a result of delivering the 
contract. This provision includes amounts for losses on contracts which are recognised in full immediately that it is probable that 
total contracts costs will exceed total contract revenue. In some cases, after a product has been delivered and revenue has been 
recognised, the Group receives claims (including warranty issues) from customers in respect of work done. Where the amount required 
to settle the claim is uncertain or the Group disputes the amount of the claim, provision is made for the best estimate of the amount 
that will be required to settle the claim.
Where the expected cost at completion of a current contract exceeds the sum of the contracted revenue and any probable revenue, 
then the amount of that excess (the estimated contract loss) is immediately provided for in full. Such contract loss provisions are reviewed 
on a regular basis to determine whether the provision is still adequate or excessive. Contract loss provisions and subsequent adjustments 
to them are charged as cost of sales in the income statement.
Where such an obligation relates to a discontinued operation then the charge will be disclosed as an exceptional item.
Research and development expenditure
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
An internally generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s own development activity is recognised only if all of the following 
conditions are met:
 an asset is created that can be identified (such as software and new processes) and is technically and commercially feasible; 
  it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits and the Group has available to itself sufficient 
resources to complete the development and to subsequently sell and/or use the asset created; and
 the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Internally generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. Where no internally generated 
intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.  Cohort plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 www.cohortplc.com

Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the provision of goods and services, 
excluding discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes:
Sales of goods are recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed.
The Group applies either IAS 11 ‘Construction Contracts’ or IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ to account for revenue depending on the nature 
of the arrangement with the customer. The Group’s arrangements fall into four main categories:
1. Time hire
 Revenue is recognised in accordance with IAS 18 when the services are provided, i.e. when the employees undertake the work.
2. Managed services
  In managed services, revenue is generally a fixed-price for the provision of specific ongoing defined services (not the construction 
of an asset) over an agreed period. These services include the provision of technical engineering support, maintaining help desks 
and consultancy. Where the services comprise an indeterminate number of acts over a specified period of time, revenue is recognised 
on a straight-line basis over the period that the services are provided. Where the services comprise one or more significant acts, 
revenue is recognised as each act is completed.
3. Product
  Goods are delivered to customers and, on their acceptance by the customer, revenue is recognised. At that point, the Group 
does not have any continuing involvement or control over the goods and all significant risks and rewards have been transferred 
to the customer.
4. System design, build, test and delivery
  These contracts are typically for building complex custom designed assets which are usually components for use in larger customer 
owned assets. These contracts are accounted for under IAS 11. The Group’s contracts of this nature are generally fixed-price and without 
“stand alone” values for each element as the contracts are negotiated and ultimately delivered/accepted as a single package.
 In these contracts the revenue is recognised using the “percentage of completion” method in IAS 11.
  In almost all cases the percentage of completion is based on input measures (i.e. costs incurred as a proportion of estimated total 
costs). In some cases, an output measure based on surveys of work performed may be used where these are available and measure 
reliably the work performed.
Costs are expensed as incurred in respect of all contracts unless they relate to goods yet to be delivered, services related to a 
significant act that has yet to be completed or future activities on a contract accounted for under IAS 11 in which case they are 
recorded as an asset (either inventory or amounts recoverable on contract).
In some cases, Group contracts can be divided into multiple elements with stand alone values using either the principle in IAS 18.13 
or the following criteria based on IAS 11.7–10:
 separate proposal for each element;
 each element was subject to separate negotiations; and
 costs and revenues for each element can be identified.
Where separate elements are identified, each is treated as one of the four revenue types described above.
Bid costs
Costs incurred before the award of a contract is probable are expensed as incurred. Where material bid costs arise after the award 
of a contract has become probable but before the contract is in place, then such identified bid costs are included in contract costs.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payments’. In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has 
been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 May 2006.
The Group issues equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments 
are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non-market based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined 
at the grant date of equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Group’s 
estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the non-market based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of the Quoted Companies Alliance binomial model (a Black Scholes model). The expected life used in 
the models has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effect of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and 
behavioural considerations. Cohort plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 www.cohortplc.com

Accounting policies continued
Share-based payments continued
A liability equal to the portion of the goods and services received is recognised at the current fair value determined at each balance 
sheet date for cash-settled, share-based payments.
The cost of share-based payments is charged to the income statement with a corresponding credit applied to the share option reserve. 
The appropriate element of the reserve is transferred to the retained profit of the Group when the share options to which the reserve 
relates vest.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and the deferred tax expense or credit.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are 
never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the 
balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred 
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition 
of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that 
affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, 
and interest in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable 
that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, 
in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis. 
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are initially measured at fair value. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised 
in the income statement when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. The allowance recognised is measured as the 
difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the estimated recoverable amount. 
Long-term contracts are assessed on a contract by contract basis and reflected in the income statement by recording revenue and related 
costs as contract activity progresses. Revenue is ascertained in a manner appropriate to the stage of completion of the contract, and 
credit taken for profit earned to date when the outcome of the contract can be assessed with reasonable certainty. The amount by 
which revenue exceeds payments on account is classified as “amounts recoverable on contracts” and included within trade and other 
receivables; to the extent that payments on account exceed relevant revenue, the excess is included as an advance receipt within 
trade and other payables. The amount of long-term contracts, at cost net of amounts transferred to cost of sales, less provision for 
foreseeable losses and payments on account not matched with revenue, is included within trade and other receivables as “amounts 
recoverable on contracts”.

Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described above, the Directors are required to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised 
in the period in which the estimate is revised. Cohort plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 www.cohortplc.com

Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued
The Directors have identified the following critical judgements and estimates in applying the Group’s accounting policies that 
have the most significant impact on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
 Critical accounting judgements
 Revenue recognition
  The revenue recognition policy of the Group is described in detail on page 73. There are areas where the Directors have to make 
judgements as to the level of revenue to be recognised in the financial statements, in particular “stage of completion”:
   In accordance with IAS 11, revenue is recognised using the “percentage of completion” method for system design, build, test 
and delivery contracts. In almost all cases the percentage of completion is based on input measures (i.e. costs incurred as 
a proportion of estimated total costs). In a few cases, an output measure based on surveys of work performed may be used 
where these are available and measure reliably the work performed.
   These contracts generally are not capable of segmentation and the percentage of completion method is applied to the contract 
as a whole.
   In advance of completion of key stages (or deliverables) of contracts, there is additional uncertainty in the estimated total 
costs and accordingly this additional uncertainty is reflected in increased estimates of the total costs, i.e. a contingency 
is added.
   Once those key stages have been completed and the risks expired, the relevant remaining contingencies are removed from the 
forecast total contract costs. It is a critical judgement of the Directors as to both the level of contingency recognised and its 
retention or not.
 Acquisition of other intangible assets
  Intangible assets other than goodwill that are obtained through acquisition are capitalised on the balance sheet. These other 
intangible assets are valued on acquisition using a discounted cash flow methodology which depends on future assumptions about 
the revenue from contracts, prices and costs and on the Group’s cost of capital. These assumptions reflect management’s best 
estimates but depend on inherent uncertainties which may not be within the control of management.
  The assessment of the acquisition of other intangible assets and their estimated respective lives are disclosed in note 32 for the 
year ended 30 April 2011.
 Key sources of estimation uncertainty
  The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have 
a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year 
are as follows:
 Impairment of goodwill
   The Group has significant goodwill balances, the life of which, it considers to be indefinite. It assesses annually the recoverability 
of the balance, or more frequently in the event of an occurrence indicating impairment. The assessment involves comparing the 
carrying amount of the asset with its recoverable amount, which is the greater of its value in use and net realisable value by 
reference to external measures. 
   Value in use is determined using discounted cash flow techniques that involve the estimation of future cash flows over a long 
period and an appropriate discount rate to apply.
   Future cash flows are estimated based on historical experience, internal estimates and data from external sources. Such estimates 
are subject to change as a result of changes in economic and competitive conditions. Higher estimates of future cash flows will increase 
the value in use of goodwill, but lower estimates of cash flows will reduce the value in use and increase the risk of impairment.
  Discount rates (weighted average cost of capital) are applied to the cash flows to arrive at the value in use. An increase in the 
discount rate will reduce the value in use of the goodwill, and therefore increases the risk of the value in use falling below the 
carrying value and resulting in the requirement for an impairment provision. A reduction in the discount rate decreases the 
likelihood of impairment.
   Future changes in interest rates, the premium that markets place on equity investments relative to risk free rates and the specific 
assessment of the capital markets as to the Group’s risk relative to other companies can affect our discount rate. Increases in 
interest rates or the risk premiums applied by capital markets would result in an increase in the Group’s discount rate and vice 
versa. These factors are largely outside the Group’s control or ability to predict and can therefore have a significant impact on the 
estimated fair value of goodwill and hence its impairment.
 The assessment of goodwill impairment is disclosed in note 12. Cohort plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 www.cohortplc.com

Standards and interpretations issued at 30 April 2011 not applied to these financial statements
The following changes and amendments to IFRS that have not been reflected in these financial statements and are likely to have 
an impact on the Group in the future:
Impact on the Group
Standard     Timing   Effect    Financial effect
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’  First applies to the year   First of three phases to replace  No financial impact. May require 
    ended 30 April 2014. IAS 39 ‘Financial Covenants:  further disclosure but Group has 
    Early adoption permitted Recognition and Measurement’.  few financial assets 
      Plan is for all of IAS 39 to be 
      replaced during 2010 by extending 
      IFRS 9. It simplifies the categories 
      of financial asset classification 
      relating it to the cash flow 
      characteristics of the asset
The above standard will not apply to the Group’s interim statement for six months ended 31 October 2011 to be published 
in December 2011.
A number of other standard amendments and International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee (IFRICs) have been issued 
and are yet to be applied by the Group. Cohort plc is an AIM quoted independent high

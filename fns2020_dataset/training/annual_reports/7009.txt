Halma p.l.c. 2004 3 In my first year as Chairman of Halma, I am delighted to announce record profit
before tax* of £50.3 million.
Observations from a new Chairman
However, before turning to more of the headline numbers, I thought it might be
useful, as a new boy to the Group, to share some of my initial observations, and to
glimpse behind the scenes at some of the issues we have been tackling.
FirstlyletmesaythatIwasattractedtoHalmabyitsextraordinarytrackrecord(one
of the top performing stocks on the London Stock Exchange over 20 years), its
management style and the robustness of demand for its products even under
difficult market conditions. I was intrigued. My induction into the Group, guided by
DavidBarber,wasexemplary.HeleftmealonetogowhereIwanted,askwhatever
I wished, yet was always available to discuss, debate and question what I had
observed.
Over the first few months I visited operations accounting for about half our profits.
I saw companies both large and small; some fighting in tough markets, many
successful – the picture became clearer. The strengths were evident:
* demand related to health and safety provided a driver or (at least) support to
demand.
* high market shares gave some protection to pricing.
* autonomously run companies gave clarity of responsibility and ownership of
performance.
* high returns on sales and capital.
* financial control was tight.
* a track record of which to be proud.
* many truly excellent and dedicated people.

Geoff Unwin,
Chairman
Chairman’s Statement HALMA
Halma p.l.c. 2004 4 However, over the last few years, performance as measured by our high historic
standards had not moved ahead as we would have wished. This was undoubtedly
due, to a certain extent, to the tough economic conditions we have seen recently,
but had other factors crept in that were holding us back?
Our Response
This was the question that was posed to the Board and senior management.
Extremely thoughtful answers came in followed by very lively debates – no factor
remained unexamined, no cow, sacred or otherwise, undisturbed. The outcome?
Work was accelerated on a number of potential bottlenecks:
* management: much strengthening (from both within and outside) and
training programmes increased.
* incentives:newbonusschemestoexplicitlyalignperformancetoshareholder
value.
* knowledgetransfer:‘‘wiringup’’theGrouptofacilitatetransferofknowledge
without destroying the foundations of autonomy.
* reducedspanofcontrol: remarkably, senior management felt they could be
more effective if they had fewer companies to manage and could therefore
implement necessary change faster. Done.
* sales:renewedemphasisonallaspectsofsellingandsharingofthebestideas
for tackling new markets across the Group.
* innovation:morefundsallocatedtoinnovationandnewtechniquesintroduced
to get improved or new products to market, faster.
* resource allocation: the beginnings (more to come) of a more rigorous
allocation of resources (capital and management) to higher growth areas. This
year we have made three non-core disposals.
Have the actions on these issues had some effect on performance? Impossible to
quantifybutnooneisinanydoubtwearethebetterforfocusingonthesepriorities.
However, what is undeniable is that the results from these actions are due to the
hard work and single-mindedness of the management team together with the
dedication from all our employees towards our customers.

HALMA
Halma p.l.c. 2004 5 Prospects
There is no shortage of ideas, determination or actions and these should show
through next year, as they have this year, in our results. We continue to focus on
those areas that are clearly under our control or influence, notwithstanding that
there is still little evidence of any significant uplift in our markets.
Geoff Unwin
Chairman’s Statement continued
HALMA
Halma p.l.c. 2004 6 Strong and active management delivers record profits
The Group performance has been strong despite market conditions remaining
difficult. We achieved record profits* of £50.3 million on a lower level of operating
assets, despite a net £1 million profit hit from currency movements. Widespread
improvement in sales performance across the Group’s businesses and regions
produced 9% sales growth. These results reflect our active management approach
through which we achieve growth through focused acquisitions, efficiency
improvementsandtheorganicdevelopmentofourexistingbusinesses.Iampleased
that excellent efforts from our management teams produced a return on capital
employed* of52%,outstanding foranyengineering andmanufacturing company.
Intheyearwesoldthreenon-corebusinessesfromourOpticsandSpecialistsector
thatwerenotcompatiblewithourtargetsforgrowthandfinancialreturns. Sincethe
year end we have made two important acquisitions for a total initial sum of
£22 million, significantly strengthening this sector. Looking forward we expect to
gain useful benefits from our acquisition and disposal activities. Two further
businesses were also consolidated to achieve the benefits of greater integration.
We remain strongly cash generative, creating net cash of £22 million during the
year. We funded our acquisitions from profits and also paid a record sum in
dividends to our shareholders.
Well positioned for growth
Our growth has come primarily from new products, the new customers they attract
and new applications for long-term repeat ordering customers. We spent a record
amount on research and development which now accounts for 4% of sales and
launched many new products. Our cost base has been well managed so that we
maintained our 17%return on sales* foryet anotheryear. TheGroup is in astrong
position to benefit from improvements in our end markets although we saw no

all of us wish him well in his retirement.
Widespread sales and profit growth
I am encouraged by the number of countries where we have built up stronger
positions. Territorial sales were grown to the UK, Europe, USA, Middle and Far East
and Other Countries. The US Dollar weakened considerably during the year so that
although sales in the USA grew by 12% in local currency, this translated to a 2%
increaseinSterlingterms.WemakeoveraquarterofourprofitsfromourUSbased

transferring best practice.
Just over half our sales and profits are made by the UK companies. Continuing

our premises in Beijing and our manufacturing facilities in Shanghai and Beijing, as
well as growing in Singapore. Important product innovations include new
emergencycommunicationequipment,demandforwhichislikelytogrowfollowing
new European legislation in this area.
Repositioning in Optics and Specialist sector
We are increasing the focus on higher technology products and more technically
advanced customers. Evidence of this can be seen in both the disposals made this
year and in the acquisitions of Diba and Ocean Optics since the year end, both of
which significantly broaden ourcapabilities inour Opticsand Specialist sector. Diba

Halma p.l.c. 2004 8 produced increased profits. However within the sector we report our Head Office
companiesandtheimprovedtradingwasmorethanoffsetbythecostsofincreasing
senior management and lower income from subsidiaries who reduced their capital
employed whilst growing profits. The net effect was a reduction in profits of
£0.4 million to £7.1 million.
Organic growth in Fire and Gas sector
TheFireandGassectorincreasedbothsalesandprofitswithnewfiredetectorsand
personal gas warning monitors. They earned £1.6 million of organic profit growth.
This sector increased its already effective use of assets, producing a return on
capital employed of 85%, exceeding even the Group’s strong ratios.
Resistors sector as predicted
As expected, our Resistors sector continued to suffer a depressed market,
particularly in US heavy industry. There are some indications of improvement in
one of our customer areas, mass transit systems. The sector has been managed
vigorously in terms of both cost and working capital reductions though we have yet
to reverse the decline in profits.
Investment in new products
Our Process Safety sector did not quite match last year’s sales and profits. The UK
market proved difficult although there are now improving conditions in the
petrochemical sector, which look likely to continue. New applications and specially
developed products are particularly important in this sector. New products
introduced late in the year that improve safety at delivery bays and provide
enhanced emergency pressure relief, are examples of increasing innovation in this
otherwise stable sector.
Product leadership helps Water sector to increased profits
Our Water sector increased both sales and profits this year. We believe we are now
offering customers the best UV sterilisation systems for drinking water on the
market.SalesofwaterleakdetectionandcontrolequipmentaregrowingintheUSA
and there are prospects of capital spending by UK water utilities beginning to rise.
We see this as a long-term growth sector.
Sustained growth based on sustained innovation
Our focus on innovation and investment in research and development is bringing
forwardincreasingnumbersofnewproductsandacceleratingtheacquisitionofnew
customers. The free cash generated by our businesses and through disposals has
been invested in maintaining this momentum and building our range of products
through judicious acquisitions. We will benefit significantly once our markets
improve but we are not dependant on this. We have the talent and the resources

HALMA
Halma p.l.c. 2004 9 Record profit with organic growth despite adverse currency movements
I am pleased to report that turnover for the year was 9% higher than last year at
£293 million (2002/03: £267 million). Turnover on continuing operations was
increased by 10%. Profit before tax* set a new record at £50.3 million (2002/03:
£46.5 million). Return on sales* exceeded 17%, as it has now done every year for
more than a decade.
Currencytranslation,withaboutone-thirdofourprofitslinkedtothecurrentlyweak
US Dollar, offset slightly by profits earned in stronger Euros, reduced 2003/04
reported sales and profits by around 2%. Looking ahead, if the US Dollar and Euro
weretostayattheirlevelsofarinthisnewfinancialyearandwiththecurrentmixof
results we might expect a further 3% adverse translation impact on our 2004/05
profits.
The extra £1.7 million of UK National Insurance, pension and general insurance
costs which I anticipated in my review last year have arisen and have been funded
within this year’s profits. These extra costs are ongoing. However, their effects are
mitigated by our success in producing consistently high net and gross margins
through continuous improvements in procurement and processes.

currency effect and the incremental impact of acquisitions and disposals, I am very

Consistently high returns generate strong cash flow
Each year I comment on our key metric, return on capital employed (profit before
tax*expressedasapercentageofnettangibleassets).Thiskeyindicatorguidesour
operations, combining both return on sales and asset turns. We have generated
£22 million of cash in the year and despite its inclusion in the Group’s return on
capital employed calculation we still produced a figure of 52%– remarkable by any
measure.

Financial Review HALMA
Halma p.l.c. 2004 10 On my regular visits to our businesses I see the benefits we obtain from a deep
understanding of the importance of producing high returns from the minimum
possible level of assets. This efficient use of assets benefits our customers and
shows through in our return on capital* which has exceeded 40% for well over
20 years. We grew this year and used less operating assets to do it. The result of
these outstanding returns is a strong flow of cash available to us for further
investment in our businesses, to pay dividends and to make acquisitions.

A progressive dividend policy with dividend cover edging up
The Board recommends a final dividend of 3.75p per share, giving a full year
dividend of 6.19p per share, 7% up on last year’s record level. This dividend
represents a continuation of Halma’s progressive dividend policy and also makes a
small contribution toward increasing the dividend cover which is our intention over
the medium term.

this will give a total of £23 million paid to shareholders in relation to the 2003/04
year financed by our strong cash flow, with a total of £88 million distributed as
dividends in the past five years.
Prudent approach to treasury, tax and pensions
Withthree-quartersoftheGroup’ssalesmadeoverseasandhalftheprofitsmadeby
companiesbasedoutsidetheUK,theGroup’sresultsaresensitivetomovementsin
exchange rates, particularly the US Dollar and Euro. Currency movements in the
year affect our results through the translation into Sterling of profits earned in local
currencies as well as affecting the underlying transactions. We have an element of
natural hedging, in particular through the purchase of components in US Dollars.
Our operating companies hedge their trading transactions back into their local
reporting currency. We do hedge the majority of our US Dollar and Euro net assets
using currency loans. The objective of our treasury activities is risk management
and control, no speculative transactions are undertaken.
Theeffectivetaxrateonprofits*was31.3%comparedwith32.9%in2002/03.We

Financial Review continued
HALMA
Halma p.l.c. 2004 11 As noted last year, we have closed our defined benefit schemes to new members
and established a defined contribution scheme. Contributions into the defined
benefit schemes are in line with the actuaries’ recommendations, following the
triennial actuarial valuations last year and are fully reflected in the Consolidated
Profit and Loss Account, with no further increases necessary at this time.
I note that the funding of pension obligations is a long-term issue, even though
schemeassetsaresubjecttoshort-termfluctuations.Ourlong-termfundingbasisis
solid and the currently reported deficit, by any set of rules, is small relative to the
Group’s market capitalisation.
Compliance and control continue at a high level
I remain committed to maintaining strong internal control across the Group. For
many years we have successfully used our senior finance staff to carry out reviews
of our operating companies at half year and year end, making rotational visits at
other times to assess internal controls. During the year we have enhanced these
procedures and in particular those relating to internal control visits by the
introduction of independent reporting lines. In 2004/05 we intend to confirm that
our procedures amount to a formal internal audit function.
Throughclosemonitoringofourbusinesses,theuseofsimplerelevantsystemsand
involvement of high quality finance executives based at each operating company,
we continue to have a strong control environment whilst providing value to our
entrepreneurial operations.
Active management of our operations
Wehavetakenanumberofactionstoimproveourbusinessesandmakegooduseof
our cash. Shortly before the end of the year we sold three non-core businesses for
£5 million. They accounted for turnover of £13 million and in aggregate were
operating around breakeven. If these discontinued operations are excluded the
Group’s return on sales is 18%. After deducting the costs of sale and pension and
property obligations retained within the Group, the net result was an exceptional
chargeof£9.1million including goodwillof£5.8million. Thegoodwilladjustment is

Combining the proceeds from the above transactions with our existing self-
generated cash, we spent £22 million just after the year end on two high-quality
acquisitions, Diba Industries, Inc., and Ocean Optics, Inc. This active management
produces an even stronger base for future growth.
International Accounting Standards on the horizon
International Accounting Standards will be in full effect for the first time in our
2005/06accounts,althoughpreparationsareinprogressnowtocollectdataforuse

HALMA
Halma p.l.c. 2004 13 Sector Overview
Our Fire and Gas sector companies
lead the world in sensor technologies
that detect hazards before they
become life-threatening and give
people warning to get out of harm’s
way. Our commercial quality fire
detection products, sold to 70
countries, protect both people and
buildings from the risk of fire.
Workers in many industries rely on
our gas detectors to safeguard their
livesandprotectthemfromexposure
to toxic or explosive gases. We also
make specialist products for
conditioning gas samples before they
are analysed.
The principal sales channels for fire
detectors are distributors and fire
alarm installers, whereas customers
for gas detectors range from lone
contractors to multinational oil
companies. During 2003/04 our Fire
and Gas sector companies produced
27% of continuing Group turnover
and 33% of operating profit*.
We achieved significant advances in
both sales and profits throughout this
sector. All of our fire products
companies raised profits during
2003/04, coupled with increased
market shares. Most growth in fire
detector sales came from the UK,
Europe, the Middle East and the US. We
also grew gas detector sales and profits
significantly,aidedbytherecruitmentof
a direct sales force in the US.
Increased co-operation between our fire
product companies on research and
development, marketing and shared
saleschannelsenhancedourcompetitive
advantage. Development of new smoke
detectors and electronic fire sounders
benefited from inter-company
collaboration. New microprocessor-
based smoke detectors were
successfully launched, opening new
markets in Eastern Europe and the
Middle East. In total, twenty new fire
productswerelaunchedduring2003/04.
Despite fierce price competition in the
global fire products market, and
dropping prices, our companies
achieved improved gross margins. This
was due to continued manufacturing
investment, improved supplier
relationships and skilful marketing.
The regulatory burden on fire safety
product manufacturers continues to
increase. New standards were imposed
in all major markets during 2003/04.
Through regular presentations, the
Group educates customers, regulatory
bodiesandgovernmentdepartmentson
the impact of new regulations.
Restructuring of European gas detector
sales through directly controlled branch
operations in Holland, Germany, Poland
and France led to significant European
sales growth. Prices of portable gas
detectorsdeclinedasmanufacturerscut
production costs through improved
manufacturing and offshore sourcing.
However, lower pricing is creating
greater demand and increasing the use
of personal protection products,
particularly in developing countries.
Certification of our gas detectors by the
principal marine approvals organisation
has created new sales opportunities in
the high growth marine market. We
expect to reach many new customers
via a new distribution agreement with a
leading multinational marine support
business. A new multi-gas portable
detector was successfully launched with
easeofmaintenance,leadingtolowcost
of ownership, proving critical.
Forseveralyearswehavebeenworking
closely with US developers of fuel cells.
These are electro-chemical devices that
function like batteries or electric
generators but run on hydrogen gas as
fuel. Until now, this has mainly been a
prototyping market. However, in 2003/
04 we began to sell gas conditioning
components used in fully commercial
fuel cell systems for small-scale power
generation.

Halma p.l.c. 2004 15 Sector Overview
We have world class companies
operating in three areas of water
technology: ultraviolet (UV) light
water treatment, instruments for
conserving water in distribution
networks and water analysis
products. All of these markets are
global and exports account for a high
proportion of sales in this sector.
Our principal customers in this sector
are drinking water supply companies
and municipal authorities together
with food and process industry
manufacturers. Based in the UK, the
Netherlands, France and the US,
during 2003/04 our Water sector
companies produced 12% of
continuing Group turnover and 11%
of operating profit*.
Worldwide growth in demand for clean
drinking water, industrial process water
and wastewater treatment results from
continuingindustrialisation,urbanisation
and population growth. Other factors,
such as tighter water quality and waste
regulations, environmental issues and
water shortages, also stimulate the
need for our water technology products.
During 2003/04 we saw sales and
profits grow in this sector.
We won significant new leak
instrumentation business in the US and
South-East Asia. In the American mid-
west there is growing interest in
managingandconservingexistingwater
supplies, instead of further depletion of
natural sources. US sales of water
conservation instruments doubled.
We won a major contract for leak
detection equipment from the city
authority in Las Vegas, Nevada. Las
Vegas has the fastest growing
population of any US city with 20,000
new homes built each year. Nevada’s
water supplies are under pressure and

The world market for UV water
treatment technology is predicted to
double within 5 years, mainly driven by
environmentalconcerns.Thereisashift
away from chemical techniques in
treatingdrinkingwater,wastewaterand
swimming pool water towards the UV
process which greatly reduces or
eliminates the use of chemicals.

Sales of water analysis instruments
werebuoyant,particularlyinEuropeand
Australia. A new photometer water
analyser, launched during 2003/04, is
already the laboratory sector market
leader. We will soon launch a low cost
water analyser for monitoring private
swimming pools and spas, transferring

UK water company has chosen our
ammonia monitoring system to control
its wastewater plants, which will
positively impact on sales in 2004/05.

Halma p.l.c. 2004 17 Sector Overview
We are world leaders in infrared and
microwavesensorsforcontrollingthe
opening and closing of elevator doors
andautomaticdoors.Ourdoorsensor
products have three functions. They
ensure public safety, make buildings
more accessible to people with
disabilities and optimise traffic within
buildings. We also make control
systems, voice communication and
visual display equipment for
elevators. These businesses are
based in Belgium, the UK, New
Zealand, the US, Singapore and
China.
Both the elevator and automatic door
markets split into new-build and
refurbishmentsectors.Thenew-build
sector is dominated by a small
number of multinational elevator and
door manufacturers, whereas
refurbishment projects are usually
handled by relatively small local
contractors. During 2003/04, this
sector produced 23% of continuing
Groupturnoverand24%ofoperating
profit*.
We saw a large rise in both sales and
profits from the Elevator and Door
sector in 2003/04. This followed
inclusion of the first full year of trading
at Belgian door sensor specialist BEA,
whichweacquiredinOctober2002.Our
other companies in this sector delivered
good overall organic growth despite
adverse currency movements,
reinforcing BEA’s excellent progress.
Sales growth in Asia was exceptionally
strong, with major volume increases in
China, Japan and Australia. We now
have two manufacturing facilities in
China and satisfy half of the entire
Chinese market for both elevator door
sensors and automatic door sensors.
Sales of in-elevator LCD display panels
also achieved substantial growth aided
by the Group’s worldwide distribution
network.
One fundamental driver affecting
demandfordoorautomationproductsis
the global trend towards urbanisation.
Increasing population densities in cities
require high rise office and residential
buildings, and also large public access
buildings where automatic doors are
commonly used.
Population growth is declining in many
countries. This demographic shift is
creating an ageing population more
likely to benefit from elevators and
automated doors. New legislation that
improves access to public buildings for
people with disabilities continually
raises demand for our door safety and
emergency communication products.
WearetheclearleaderintheUSmarket
for automatic door sensors. A new
elevator intercom product was
introduced mid-year designed to meet
new US building codes and sales have
been very promising.
New European regulations covering
elevator door safety and emergency
communications should also help drive
up demand in 2004/05. European sales
of elevator emergency telephones
almost doubled last year and we are
rapidly establishing market leadership
for these products in the UK.
One in ten of our employees in this
sector works on research and
development. Innovative new products
protect market share where we are
dominantandprovideleverageintonew
markets. An entirely new type of visual
safety product launched recently warns
when elevator doors are closing. This is
a unique product that is creating a new
market. Another new product that
controls pedestrian access barriers in
retail and transport facilities is already
selling well in Europe.

safety and door control
products.
Halma p.l.c. 2004 19 Sector Overview
In this sector we make two types of
industrial safety products. Our
companiesareworldleadersinsafety
interlocks, products that safeguard
dangerous machinery and process
equipment. They protect industrial
workers from death or injury and
prevent damage to plant. Our second
process safety speciality is bursting
discs. These devices prevent
excessive pressure and protect
people, the environment and process
equipment fromtheriskofexplosion.
Process safety markets are global,
but demand varies from one country
to another due to wide variation in
safety legislation. Customers for our
process safety systems range from
very small businesses up to the
world’s largest corporations.
Operating from the UK, the US and
France, Process Safety generated
13% of continuing Group turnover
and 13% of operating profit* in
2003/04.
During 2003/04 buoyancy of the
petrochemicals market has been at an
alltimehigh,andisstillrising.Growthis
fuelled by the quest for new energy
sources, particularly by China, Japan
and the US. High oil prices encourage
capital expenditure in petrochemicals
exploration and processing which, in
turn, creates demand for our process
safety products.
We are seeing a worldwide trend
towardsraisinglocalsafetystandardsto
match the best international practice.
Oil companies are increasingly adopting
the best practices from their worldwide
exploration and production sites and
applying them globally. This raises
safety standardsinmanyterritories and
strengthens underlying demand for our
products. Recent UK and EU safety
legislation also continues to exert a
positive influence on demand,
particularly in the operation of pipelines
and pressurised process plant.
Sales of safety interlocks for controlling
valves in the petrochemicals sector
increased significantly. However, sector
performance overall was flat. Increased
UK export sales to the enlarged EU
offset a decline in UK demand. We
responded by developing new,
technically innovative products, due for
launch in 2004/05, and through
diversification.
We have recently launched a unique,
patented product, targeted at the
growing retail logistics market, which
prevents accidents to fork lift truck
operators. The initial reaction from
some of the UK’s largest retailers and
logistics companies is very positive.
During 2004/05 we will also launch a
new generation of industrial access and
controlproducts,withbenefitsfarahead
of any competitor, and create sales
opportunities in new areas of
manufacturing industry worldwide.
Our two bursting disc manufacturers
maintained market share during 2003/
04. Over the past 3 years, our bursting
discbusinesseshavebeenrestructured;
production costs have been cut, new
managers have been recruited and new
methods of servicing the European
market are now in place. The end result
is higher product quality, lower cost
products, improved delivery and a
stream of innovative new products that
should increase market share.

Halma p.l.c. 2004 21 Sector Overview
The high power resistor market is
global, with demand subject to
macroeconomic trends. The principal
applications are in rail transport, the
process industries and power
distribution where our products are
used to safely dissipate electrical
energy. Our strategy to maintain
world leadership in this sector is to
continuously innovate and develop
resistor products with global sales
potential.
Our six resistor makers, based in the
US, Canada, Australia and the UK,
contributed 10% of continuing Group
sales and 5% of operating profit* in
2003/04.
Wesucceededingrowingexportsinthis
sector and saw strong sales growth in
transit and power filtration markets
during 2003/04. However, overall
resistor sales were flat and profits
declined. The impact of Dollar/Sterling
exchangeratemovementsdisguisesour
North American performance; an
8% Dollar increase in resistor sales
translated into a 1% Sterling decline.
Competition in this sector is tougher
thanithaseverbeen.Weareprotecting
market share and margins through
innovation,overheadcostreductionand
raised productivity. With a US economic
upturn, the trend of declining demand
could reverse. Expansion in key resistor
markets, notably mining, metals
refining and oil and gas processing,
should lead to rising demand.
Sales of filter resistors increased due to
rising capital investment by metals
processing industries in response to
commodity price rises. Tighter US
emissions regulations for diesel
locomotives, coming into force in 2005,
could stimulate rolling stock
replacement and restore transit resistor
demand to the normal historical level.
We supply both of the US diesel
locomotive builders. Predictions of
higher fuel costs for cars, together with
increased government spending on
mass transport infrastructure, also
suggest that transit sector demand will
rise.
New US safety legislation designed to
protect industrial workers from
electrical arc flash hazards should
stimulate demand for high resistance
grounding systems in the future. This
technology protects workers from
injury. It also cuts costs by reducing
production stoppages caused by
electrical faults. As the market leader in
high resistance grounding equipment in
North America, we expect to benefit
from the new regulations.
We have continued to rationalise
manufacturing between production
centres to gain efficiency benefits.
Manufacture of transit resistors has
been concentrated in the US, creating a
true world player, well positioned to
exploit the huge Chinese market for
urban transit systems.
During 2003/04 our resistor businesses
took advantage of the growing
commercial opportunities in China.
Increased raw materials sourcing from
Chinese suppliers has helped shield
marginsfromerosion.Atthesametime,
resistor sales into the Chinese market
rose substantially. A new partnership
project to manufacture our resistors in
Shenzhen, China, will add impetus to
Asian regional sales growth in 2004/05
and also deliver highly competitive
products to sell into our traditional
markets.

electrical power distribution
networks from damage when
faults occur.
Halma p.l.c. 2004 23 Sector Overview
We own two world leading optical
technology businesses. We make
ophthalmic instruments and lenses,
for examining eyesight and
diagnosing visual defects, and optical
sensing systems for measuring
colour, brightness and chemical
properties. Our secondary focus in
this sector is on high precision fluid
controlproductsforuseinclinicaland
analytical instrumentation. Both
areas have been strengthened by
acquisitions since the year end. We
have made several changes in this
sector, including selling three
non-core businesses.
Themarketforouropticalproductsis
global and exports account for a high
proportionofsales.Customersforour
fluid technology products are
primarily high-tech instrument
manufacturers, mostly based in the
US or Europe. The companies in this
sector are based in the UK and the
US, and in 2003/04 contributed 15%
of continuing Group turnover and
14% of operating profit*.
Improved sales and profits at our core
optics and fluid technology companies
were offset by slightly disappointing
performances from some of the
specialist businesses in this sector.
Head Office company results are
reported within this sector, and their
income reduced this year. As a result,
the Optics and Specialist sector sales
performance wasflatin2003/04 andits
profit contribution declined.
Bothofourophthalmicopticscompanies
pushed up export sales, with significant
growth in the US, Japan and Australia.
Our US ophthalmic lens business has
been increasingly successful at
developing OEM business. Several
manufacturers of electro-optical
instruments now design our optical
components into their products. Two
new types of surgical lens will help
protect patients from disease
transmission; one format will withstand
high temperature sterilisation and
another is disposable.
Sales of ophthalmic instruments
benefited from a series of new and
improvedproducts.Themostsignificant
were cordless, battery-powered
versions of our indirect
ophthalmoscopes, worldmarketleading
products. These instruments offer
significant benefits to ophthalmologists
andinitialsaleshavebeenencouraging,
particularly in the US.
In May 2004 we acquired Ocean Optics,
Inc., a manufacturer of optical sensing
systems. A world market leader in
miniature fibre-optic spectrometers, its
specialistmeasurementinstrumentsare
used in consumer electronics, process
control, environmental monitoring, life
sciences and medical diagnostics. Like
other Halma businesses, Ocean Optics
has strong positions in niche markets
and significant growth opportunities
exist for its optical sensor-based
products.
Three non-core subsidiaries were sold
during 2003/04. They did not achieve
our profit growth or return on
investment targets due to long-term
market changes.
We extended our interests in fluid
technology with the acquisition of Diba
Industries, Inc. in May 2004. Our
specialist fluid technology companies
grew sales in two high-tech markets:
bio-hazard detection and clinical
diagnostics. We won contracts for
critical components built into biological
hazard detection equipment, a new
emerging market. These systems
analyse air samples from mail sorting
machines and identify anthrax or other
terrorist biological threats. The United
States Postal Service will use this
equipment in mail distribution centres
across the US.

Halma p.l.c. 2004 32 Sociallyresponsible
investment
Investing in Halma shares meets the criteria of many professional and private
investors who base their decisions on environmental, ethical and social
considerations. The Group is a world leader in several key environmental
technologies and has a reputation for honesty and integrity in its relationships
with employees, customers and business partners.
Social conditions can be improved for all through the creation of wealth. Halma
creates wealth responsibly allowing our employees, customers, business partners
and shareholders to determine where this wealth is best distributed.
In each of the following areas, the regulatory demands upon us vary considerably
around the world, so Halma establishes the core structure to ensure that Group
companiesfullycomplywithregulatoryrequirementswhilepermittingthemtotailor
the solutions to their particular needs.
Theenvironment Within Halma, we have an excellent long-term record and a clear strategy for
addressing environmental issues that affect our businesses and for developing
products that protect the environment and improve safety at work and in public
places.
Ourproducts
Many of our innovative products play a very positive role in monitoring and
improving the environment. Halma brands lead the world in a number of
technologies which help to minimise environmental damage.
Our principal environmental technologies are water leakage detection, gas
emissions monitoring, water and effluent analysis and UV water treatment. We
tirelesslypromotetheuseofUVwatersterilisationwhicheliminatestheneedtouse
dangerous chemicals, as well as products that minimise the waste of clean water.
Our commitment to the development of equipment for measuring environmental
changes and controlling the damaging impact of industrial activities is long-term.
For example, Palmer Environmental’s Permalog
  is an acoustic leak noise logger
which transmits leakage information to a radio receiver to enable leaks in water
supplypipestobelocatedforpromptrepairtherebyreducingthelossofcleanwater.
Atmospheric levels of highly flammable hydrogen can be precisely monitored in
locations such as laboratories, refineries, battery rooms and fuel cell facilities with
Crowcon’s TXgard-IS+.
We make safety equipment for use at work, in public places and in transportation
systems that contribute to increased personal safety by ensuring safe practice at
work, protecting people from fire and making elevators and automatic doors safe
andeffective.Wearethemajorworldsupplierinseveraloftheseareas.VolkOptical
has developed a new autoclavable vitrectomy lens for use in retinal surgery which
means that ethylene oxide gas is not required for sterilisation.
Environmentalpolicy
The Group’s policy on environmental issues is published on our website and has
been distributed and explained to all Halma business units.
Asenior executive ineachofour business unitsis responsible forimplementing the
environmental policy at local level. The Group Finance Director, Mr K J Thompson,
has principal responsibility for coordinating and monitoring the policy.
During the past year, Perma

a state-of-the-art extrusion
system for precision tubing
to replace its existing
extruder. Perma Pure
anticipated that the new
extruder would reduce
consumptionofanexpensive
fluoropolymer Nafion
  ,
which it uses as a key
component, by reducing
rejected material and
permitting extrusion of finer
walled tubing, saving
materialaswell. Sixmonths
after installing the new
extruder at a cost of
$250,000, Perma Pure has
already observed not only
increased production
capacity but also a
considerable reduction in
rejected material,
amounting to more than
$50,000 per annum.
Additional savings are
anticipated as the
dimensions of the extruded
tubing are refined to benefit
from the narrow tolerances
of the new extruder.

Wearecommitted todeveloping andimplementinganenvironmentalmanagement
system (‘EMS’) throughout the Group to measure, control and, where practical,
reduce our environmental impacts. We are developing performance indicators that
willassistlocalmanagementinimplementingthepolicyanddevelopinganEMS.The
requirement for an EMS and the related reporting has been rolled out to all UK
business units, which represent over 50% of Group production facilities in terms of
external turnover. All Group companies are encouraged to undertake ISO 14001,
the international environmental standard, accreditation where warranted. The
requirement to implement an EMS will be extended to the rest of the Group in the
medium term.
None of the UK Group companies has incurred a Health and Safety Executive fine,

Equivalent information is not currently collected for the rest of the world.
Ourimpacts
We support the concept of sustainability and recognise that, in common with all
businesses, our activities have an environmental impact. Our products do not
require capital-intensive manufacturing processes, so the environmental effect of
our operations is relatively low compared to manufacturers in other sectors.
TheGroupissponsoringanInnovationInitiativewhichencouragestheresearchand
development teams at each Group company to re-examine their product designs
with a view to being more efficient and effective using components which are more
environmentally acceptable.
Group companies are encouraged to improve energy efficiency, reduce waste and
emissions and to reduce the use of materials in order to reduce our environmental
impact. The Group is carrying out an audit in 2004/05 to establish baseline data on
emissions to air and water, water and energy consumption and waste production.
The data collected will enable the Group to set objectives for reducing its
environmental impacts in those areas and to look at setting targets for reduction
in key areas. The Group plans to report shortly on CO
2
emission and water
consumption as well as waste disposal.
The baseline data is expected to confirm that the main areas of impact on the
environment are energy consumption and waste disposal. The Group does not
operate a fleet of distribution vehicles although we do own a number of company
cars.Fewofourassemblyprocessesrequirewater,sotherearenotlargequantities

Afterthe2004/05datacollectionexerciseiscompletedandtargetshavebeensetin

establishment of green procurement policies.
The Group’s environmental performance will continue to be reported in both the
Annual Report and on our website.

Directive that comes into
force in August 2005.
Across the Group we also
operate programmes, where
commercially viable, to
ensure the responsible
disposal of packaging,
including the re-use and
recycling of all packaging
types and, where necessary,
the use of licensed
contractors to dispose of
non-recyclable waste
packaging safely. In
addition, the use of

in Section 1 of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance (‘‘the Combined
Code’’) issued by the Financial Services Authority in June 1998.
Applicationofthe
principlesofgood
governance
The Group is controlled and directed by a Board consisting of a non-executive
Chairman, four executive Directors and three other non-executive Directors. Their
biographies appear on page 28. The Board considers each of the non-executive
Directorstobeindependent.TheBoardrecognises thattherevisedCombinedCode
considersthatanon-executivedirectorceasestobeindependentuponappointment
aschairman,howevertheBoardbelievesthatMrUnwin’sChairmanshipoftheBoard
does not interfere with his independence as regards, in particular, membership of
the Audit and Remuneration Committees. In assessing independence, the Board
considers that the Chairman and non-executive Directors are independent of
management and free from business and other relationships which could interfere
with the exercise of independent judgement now and in the future. The Board
believes that any shareholdings of non-executive Directors serve to align their
interests with those of all shareholders. Mr Stone is acknowledged as the Senior
Independent Director. Upon appointment and at regular intervals, all Directors are
offered appropriate training. Each Director is subject to re-election at least every
three years.
The Directors retain responsibility for the formulation of corporate strategy,
investment decisions, and treasury and risk management policies. There is a
formalscheduleofmattersreservedfortheBoard’sdecisionandtheBoardmeetsat
least eight times each year with further ad hoc meetings as required. Directors are
issued an agenda and comprehensive board papers in the week preceding each
BoardMeeting.AllDirectorshaveaccesstotheadviceandservicesoftheCompany

professional advice.
Mr Stone chairs the Remuneration Committee of which each of the non-executive
Directors is a member. Mr Walker and Mr Pettit joined the Committee during the
year. Mr Barber was a member until his retirement in July 2003 and Lord McGowan
remained a member until his death in May 2003. Formal terms of reference exist
which follow the recommendations of the Combined Code and are available on
request from the Company Secretary. The Committee makes recommendations to
the Board on the framework for executive Directors’ and senior executives’
remuneration based on proposals formulated by the Group Chief Executive. The
Committee meets at least twice per year.

annual accounts, the statement on internal controls and is responsible for the
relationship with the external auditors. The Group Chief Executive, Group Finance
Director and representatives from the Auditors attend Committee meetings by
invitation in order to provide appropriate advice. The Committee meets at least
three times per year.
Mr Barber chaired the Nomination Committee until his retirement at which
point Mr Unwin assumed the role of Chairman. Mr Stone and Mr O’Shea are also
members of the Committee. Formal terms of reference exist which follow the
Corporate Governance HALMA
Halma p.l.c. 2004 36 recommendations of the Combined Code and are available on request from the

regularly, thereby ensuring the Board’s strategies are communicated to those
overseeing operations.
The Executive Board reviews operational activities, trading results, budgets, policy
matters, investment opportunities, resource allocation and risk exposures. Any
matters arising out of the Executive Board meetings are reported to the Board via
the Group Chief Executive’s report to the Board.

Goingconcern After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the
Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the
going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

Halma p.l.c. 2004 37 The Group’s external auditors, Deloitte & Touche LLP, have audited the financial
statements and have reviewed the internal financial control systems to the extent
they consider necessary to support their audit report.
The Board meets regularly throughout the year and has adopted a schedule of
matters which are required to be brought to it for decision. This procedure is
intended to ensure that the Directors maintain full and effective control over all
significant strategic, financial and organisational issues.
Group companies operate under a system of controls which includes but is not
limited to:
* adefinedorganisationalstructurewithanappropriatedelegationofauthorityto
operational management
* the identification and appraisal of risks both formally, through the annual
process of preparing business plans and budgets, and informally through close
monitoring of operations
* a comprehensive financial reporting system within which actual results are
compared with approved budgets and previous year’s figures on a monthly
basis and reviewed at both local and Group level
* an investment evaluation procedure to ensure an appropriate level of approval
for all capital expenditure
* self-certificationbyoperatingcompanymanagementofcomplianceandcontrol
issues
* a prescribed robust structure under which it is appropriate to adopt means of
electronic communication and to conduct e-commerce.
The processes which the Board has applied in reviewing the effectiveness of the
Group’s system of internal control are summarised below.
* Operating companies carry out a detailed risk assessment each year and
identify mitigating actions in place or proposed for each significant risk. A risk
register is compiled from this information, against which action is monitored
through to resolution. In addition, Divisional Chief Executives carry out an
independent risk assessment for each operating company. A review of Group
risks is also conducted.

Halma p.l.c. 2004 38 * The Group Finance Director and Group Chief Executive report to the Audit
Committee on all aspects of Internal Control for its review. The Board receives
the minutes of the Audit Committee meetings and uses these as a basis for its
annual review of internal control.
As noted above, a programme of internal control visits is conducted. Following its
review of internal control activities in 2004, the Audit Committee has now put in
place procedures for independent reporting of the outcome of these visits to the
Audit Committee. Whilst internal audit is not a separate function within the Group,
the Board anticipates that the procedures now in place will allow it to report in
2004/05 that it has procedures which amount to an internal audit function.

Halma p.l.c. 2004 39 The following sections of the Report on Remuneration have been audited: the table
of Directors’ remuneration; pension benefits; Directors’ interests in shares.
Remunerationpolicy The policy on Directors’ Remuneration is to provide the remuneration packages
necessarytoattract,retainandmotivateDirectorsofthequalityrequiredtorunthe
Group successfully, manage the business of the Group and to align the interests of
the Directors with those of the shareholders.
In accordance with rule 12.43A(c) of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority the Board presents its Report on Remuneration to the shareholders. The
Board confirms that when determining the remuneration policy for executive
Directors for 2003/04 full consideration was given to the Combined Code
appended to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
The Remuneration Committee consists entirely of non-executive Directors, the
current members being Mr R A Stone (Chairman of the Committee), Mr E G Unwin,
Mr A J Walker and Mr S R Pettit. Messrs Walker and Pettit were appointed to the
Committee during the past year. Mr D S Barber was a member of the Committee
prior to his retirement and Lord McGowan was a member prior to his death. The
Board has considered and confirmed Mr Stone’s independence following the third
anniversary of his appointment to the Board. The Board has also affirmed its
decision to appoint Mr Unwin to the Committee as the Board believes that his
Chairmanship of the Board does not interfere with his independence as regards
membership of the Committee. Mr Unwin does not take part in discussions
concerning his own remuneration.
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board on the framework for
executive remuneration, based on proposals formulated by the Group Chief
Executive, and determines the terms of service and remuneration of executive
Directors andsenior executives. The Committee’s Terms of Reference are available
from the Company Secretary on request.

determined that incentive levels are appropriately set.

Mr S R O’Shea was the highest paid director in the financial year.
Pensionbenefits The executive Directors participate in the appropriate section of the Halma Group
Pension Plan. This section is a funded, Inland Revenue approved, final salary
occupational pension scheme, which provides a pension equal to the lower of two-
thirds of final pensionable salary and the Inland Revenue maximum pension at
normal pension age (60). Pensionable salary is the greatest salary of the last three
complete tax years immediately before retirement or leaving service. Bonuses and
otherfluctuatingemolumentsandbenefitsinkindarenotpensionable.Thescheme
also provides for life cover of three times pensionable salary, pensions in the event
of early retirement through ill health and dependants’ pensions of one-half of the
member’s prospective pension. Early retirement pensions, possible from age 50
withtheconsentoftheCompanyandtheTrusteesoftheHalmaGroupPensionPlan,
are subject to actuarial reduction. Pensions in payment increase by 3% per annum

Non-executiveDirectors All non-executive Directors have specific terms of engagement and their
remuneration is determined by the Board based on independent surveys of fees
paid to non-executive directors of similar companies. The non-executive Directors
receive a basic fee supplemented by additional fees for membership and/or
chairmanship of the Audit and Remuneration Committees.

HALMA United Kingdom Company Law requires the Directors to prepare financial
statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the Company and the Group as at the end of the financial year and of the
profit or loss for that period.
The Directors have responsibility for ensuring that proper accounting records are
maintained which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the Company and the Group and which enable them to ensure that the
financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
The Directors also have general responsibility for taking such steps as are
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and
detect fraud and other irregularities and are responsible for the system of internal
control.
TheDirectorsconsiderthat,inpreparingthefinancialstatementsonpages48to73

Halma p.l.c. 2004 52
HALMA Basis of accounting
The accounts set out on pages 48 to 73 are prepared under the historical cost
convention and comply with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards. The
principal Group accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the
current and preceding year and are described below. The accounts also reflect the
transitional requirements of FRS 17 (Retirement Benefits).
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated accounts include the accounts of Halma p.l.c. and its subsidiary
companies made up to 3 April 2004. The results of subsidiary companies acquired
are included from the month of acquisition.

to reserves as a matter of accounting policy.
Intangible assets
Goodwill arising on acquisitions after 28 March 1998 is capitalised and is classified
as an intangible asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Goodwill arising on
acquisitions prior to that date was written off to reserves, and would be included in
thedeterminationofprofitorlossarisingfromthesaleorclosureofthebusinessto
which it relates. Capitalised goodwill is amortised through the Consolidated
Profit and Loss Account on a straight line basis over its estimated economic life of
20 years.
Foreign currencies
Transactions inforeign currencyare recorded attherate ofexchangeatthedateof
the transaction unless matched by a forward currency contract. Monetary assets
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are
reported at the rates prevailing at that date, or, where appropriate, at the forward
currency contract rate. Any gain or loss arising from subsequent exchange rate
movements is included as an exchange gain or loss in the Consolidated Profit and
Loss Account.

the average rates of exchange for the financial year. Exchange gains or losses
arising on these translations, together with those on foreign currency borrowings
which are taken out to hedge the Group’s overseas investments, are taken to
reserves.
Turnover
Turnover represents sales, less returns, by subsidiary companies to external
customers excluding value added tax. Transactions are recorded as sales when
the delivery of products or performance of services takes place in accordance with
the contracted terms of sale.
Investments
Investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
AccountingPolicies
Halma p.l.c. 2004 53
HALMA Tangible fixed assets and depreciation
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less provisions for impairment and
depreciation which, with the exception of freehold land which is not depreciated,
is provided on all tangible fixed assets on the straight line method, each item being
written off over its estimated life. The principal annual rates used for this purpose
are:
Freehold buildings 2%
Leasehold properties -
more than 50 years unexpired 2%
less than 50 years unexpired Period of lease
Plant, machinery and equipment 8% to 20%
Motor vehicles 20%
Short-life tooling 33

%
Leases
The costs of operating leases of property and other assets are charged as incurred.
Pensions
The Group makes contributions to various pension schemes, covering the majority
of its employees, which are charged against profits on a systematic and rational
basis over the period during which benefit is derived from the service. Any
differences between this charge and amounts payable to the schemes are recorded
as provisions or prepayments as appropriate.
Research and development
Expenditureonresearchanddevelopmentiswrittenoffinthefinancialyearinwhich

Stocks
Stocks and work in progress of subsidiary companies are included at the lower of
costandnetrealisablevalue.Costincludestheappropriateproportionofproduction
and other overheads considered by the Directors to be attributable to bringing the
stock to its location and condition at the year end.
Deferred taxation
The Group provides for taxation deferred because of timing differences between
profits as computed for taxation purposes and profits as stated in the accounts, on
an undiscounted basis. Deferred taxation is measured at the average tax rates that
are expected toapply intheperiods inwhich thetiming differences are expected to
reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially
enacted by the balance sheet date.
The principal timing differences in the Group accounts arise on the excess of tax
allowances on tangible fixed assets over the corresponding depreciation charged in
theaccounts;andongoodwillarisinginjurisdictionswhereitiseligiblefordeduction
against tax, where it has been charged against reserves in the Group accounts but
would be accounted for through the Consolidated Profit and Loss Account on a sale

Policy
The Group does not use complex derivative financial instruments. No trading or speculative
transactions in financial instruments are undertaken. Where it does use financial instruments
thesearemainlytomanagethecurrencyrisksarisingfromnormaloperationsanditsfinancing.
Operations are financed mainly through retained profits and in certain geographical locations,
bankborrowings.ForeigncurrencyriskisthemostsignificantaspectfortheGroupinthearea
offinancialinstruments.Itisexposedtoalesserextenttootherriskssuchasinterestraterisk
and liquidity risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and
thesepoliciesaresummarisedbelow.Policieshaveremainedunchangedsincethebeginningof
the financial year.
Foreign currency risk
The Group has transactional currency exposures. These arise on sales or purchases by
operating companies in currencies other than the companies’ operating (or ‘functional’)
currency.Significantsalesarehedgedatthedateofinvoicingbymeansofmatchedborrowings
and forward currency contracts. Significant purchases are hedged by means of forward
currency contracts.
The Group which is based in the UK and reports in Sterling, has a significant investment in
overseas operations in the USA and Europe, with further investments in Australia, New
Zealand,Canada,Malaysia,SingaporeandChina.Asaresult,theGroup’sbalancesheetcanbe
affectedbymovementsinthesecountries’exchangerates.Wheresignificantandappropriate,
currency denominated net assets are hedged by currency borrowings. These currency
exposures are reviewed regularly. The Group does not hedge future currency profits, so the

particularly against the US Dollar and the Euro.
Finance and interest rate risk
The Group does not have significant exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Where bank
borrowings are used to finance operations they tend to be short-term with floating interest
rates.BorrowingsusedtomanageforeigncurrencyriskaredrawnontheGroup’sloanfacilities
and have fixed interest rates with maturities of not more than one year.

Surplus funds are placed on short-term fixed rate deposit or in floating rate deposit accounts.
Liquidity risk
The Group has a strong cash flow and the funds generated by operating companies are
managed regionally based on geographic location. Funds are placed on deposit with secure,
highly-ratedbanks.Forshort-termworkingcapitalpurposes,mostoperatingcompaniesutilise
local bank overdrafts. These practices allow a balance to be maintained between continuity of
funding,securityandflexibility.Becauseofthenatureoftheiruse,thefacilitiesaretypically‘on

facilities, are typically renewed annually.

deposits which totalled £33,898,000 at 3 April 2004 (2003: £14,309,000). These comprised
Sterling denominated deposits of £32,531,000 (2003: £14,022,000), US Dollar denominated
deposits of £nil (2003: £58,000), Euro and other currency deposits of £1,367,000 (2003:

overdrafts and certain unsecured loans, which totalled £26,934,000 at 3 April 2004 (2003:
£27,667,000). All are subject to floating rates of interest. These comprise US Dollar
denominated bank loans of £20,218,000 (2003: £19,745,000) which bear interest with
reference to the US Dollar LIBOR rates, US Dollar denominated bank overdrafts of £76,000

Borrowing facilities
The Group’s principal source of borrowing facilities is through ‘on demand’ bank overdrafts
which are, by definition, uncommitted. These facilities are generally reviewed on an annual or
ongoing basis and hence the facilities expire within one year or less.

£57,219,000 of which £26,676,000 was drawn down. The borrowing facilities are reviewed
annually, and as such the weighted average maturity of the facilities is less than one year.

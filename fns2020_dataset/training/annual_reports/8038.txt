Based near Rotherham, South Yorkshire, Inditherm plc designs, manufactures and installs heating
solutions using the Company’s innovative, patented, low voltage, carbon-based conductive
polymer technology (CPT).  This provides a flexible heating material that can be fitted over a wide
variety of shapes, as well as laid out flat to heat large areas from above or below. Running from a
low voltage (6V to 50V) dc or ac power supply, it can reach temperatures of up to 120°C.
Applications for the technology are numerous but the Company is focusing on selected
applications and market areas where there are perceived to be significant growth opportunities.
These include pitch heating, medical (patient warming), utility water and waste water treatment
plants, tanks and concrete curing.  Inditherm already has an established track record in industrial
process industries, such as confectionary , food and chemicals, where CPT is ideal for heating pipes,
tanks, valves and pumps. 
Our Vision
To be perceived as the best in the world in our chosen markets.
Our Values
We believe in….
● having total integrity in all we do
● delighting our customers
● treating others with dignity and respect
● teamwork
● working professionally and delivering exceptional quality.

INDITHERM at a glance The Industrial Division specialises in providing heating solutions for critical temperature
management and frost protection for pipelines, portable storage containers, tanks, valves and
pumps. The principal markets include confectionary, food, chemical processing and water utilities.
Inditherm’s technology is ideal for wrapping around complex shapes, as well as for providing heat
over large, flat areas.
The Medical Division specialises in warming solutions to prevent hypothermia and heat therapy
systems for the treatment of injuries and wounds. Patient warming products are primarily used in
operating theatres, recovery and intensive care, and offer improved performance, combined with
significant cost savings over traditional technologies.
Sports pitch heating has been moved into the Construction Division and provides a solid state
solution for preventing frost and also for promoting grass growth. Not only is the Inditherm
system far more reliable than traditional mechanical systems, it uses only about 25% of the energy.
Working in conjunction with Sheffield Hallam University, the Division is also in the process of
developing solutions to accelerate concrete curing, along with concrete infrastructure heating and
frost protection solutions.
The Custom Division has two main roles: providing heating solutions for third party partners to
incorporate into existing or new end user products, and as the seedbed for new major product
lines that are then taken on by other Inditherm Divisions.

Introduction
Following the successful fund-raising in 2003, Inditherm has made considerable
progress on several fronts. Most significantly, we entered the football pitch heating
market with two major contracts for Chelsea Football Club and Falkirk Community
Stadium.  Both installations represented challenges as we gained technical experience.
However, these projects are now fully operational and provide a platform for future
growth.  The concentration of resource on the football pitch market and particularly the
two projects undertaken, diverted resources away from other activities and resulted in
slower sales growth than originally anticipated.
Good progress was made by the Medical business with the establishment of direct
sales in the UK and a number of overeas distributors.
During the year we used our financial resources to expand our skills base, particularly
on the commercial front. This has given rise to an increased cost base which resulted in
a large loss for the year.
Results for the Year
Turnover for the year increased by 159% to £1,598k (2003: £616k), mainly due to the
large Chelsea contract, worth £775k.  Unlike previous years, we did not see a sharp
increase in Industrial orders during the last quarter, with many potential prospects
being delayed into 2005.  I am pleased to report that some of these have now borne
fruit.  We also moved into the water utilities market, where Inditherm’s solution offers
significant benefits and energy savings over alternative technologies. Medical sales
increased in the second half, mainly due to the strengthening of the Medical
management and sales team.
The cost base was increased through the addition of key people aimed at promoting
sales, resulting in an operating loss of £1,176k before exceptional items (2003: £684k).
After exceptional costs of £328k, relating to the termination of the Pegasus Distribution
Agreement, a provision for a doubtful debt and net interest income of £182k (2003:
£16k), the pre-tax loss was £1,306k (2003: £786k).
The year end cash balance was £3,590k (2003: £5,047k).
Dividends
As stated in previous years, the Board does not expect to declare a dividend during the
Company’s continuing formative period.
Management
In 2004 we took significant strides to strengthen management with the appointment of
Richard Harpum as Chief Executive. Richard was previously President of ABB
Metering and has also held senior positions in FKI Babcock and GEC. Since this
appointment, Colin Tarry has been Business Development and Technical Director but
resigned as a Director on the 23rd March 2005. He will be leaving the company later
this year to pursue other interests. He will be available to the company in respect of the
technology and has signed a confidentiality agreement.
Chairman’s Statement 5
Pat O’Grady retired as a Director of the Company and has agreed to an exclusive long-
term consultancy in respect of Inditherm technology.
I would like to thank both Pat and Colin for their efforts in the formative years of the
Company.
In recent weeks the team has been strengthened with three key appointments: a
Divisional Director responsible for the Medical business; a Technical Manager and a
Projects Director who between them will undertake Colin Tarry’s work.
Employees
We continue to invest in and expand our workforce to ensure that we have the
appropriate skills with which to grow the business. The workforce is extremely flexible
and has worked very hard during the year to deal with significant fluctuations in
demand, especially during the manufacture and installation of the heating pads for the
Chelsea contract.  On behalf of the Board, I thank all our staff members most sincerely
for their dedication.
Operations & Strategy
The concentration of resource on the football pitch projects and future opportunities
was considerable.  Whilst this showed positive results with significant future potential,
the order flow from other markets was disappointing. This has highlighted the need to
focus on market segments where our value proposition is most compelling.
Accordingly, we have reshaped the sales force to target certain parts of the Industrial
market, whilst increasing resources aimed at selling into the Medical market.  This new
strategy is expected to take six to twelve months to demonstrate the significant
potential that we believe is offered by Inditherm technology in these markets.
Outlook
Effort is now being focused on the pitch heating, medical, water utility and
construction markets, where we continue to see major potential.  Significantly, we have
recently won our first order for an accelerated concrete curing heating system, where
we are demonstrating the substantial cost savings derived from using Inditherm
technology.  We believe this could be a platform for significant growth.
The water utility market is another area where we can demonstrate the value of
Inditherm technology and the planned capital spend in that industry over the next four
years represents a new opportunity.
The year has started with volumes well ahead of last year, albeit that this represents
slower growth than planned.  Much work has been undertaken to establish the new
strategy which we believe will begin to show benefits from the second half of this year.

Chairman’s Statement (continued) 6
INDITHERM plc
Introduction
2004 was a period of intense change for Inditherm, with the main challenge being to
design, manufacture and install the pitch heating systems at Chelsea Football Club’s
training ground and at Falkirk Community Stadium.  Both projects were successfully
completed, albeit with some major challenges to overcome en route.  There was little
growth in the core industrial business, and a disappointing final quarter, which has
traditionally been strong.  However, we have found new industrial applications in the
water utilities market, where our technology offers significant benefits over alternative
heating solutions and is being well-received by the market. 
Following the termination of an exclusive agreement with a third party distributor in
2003, we effectively had to re-build our Medical business. We have put in place new
management and a sales team and achieved a 255% increase in sales over the previous
year.  
Following two years of joint development with Sheffield Hallam University, our
Construction business started to generate orders in 2005.
Strategy
Towards the end of the year, a full review of the business and its strategy was
undertaken and a number of key conclusions drawn from this review:
● Because of the compelling attraction of the Inditherm conductive polymer
technology (CPT), the number of potential applications can be overwhelming. It is
therefore vital to identify and focus on only those applications where there is a
clear market opportunity, such as sports pitch heating, water utilities and medical. 
● Until now, the industrial business has adopted a custom design approach to each
application. However, it is clear that there are significant opportunities for
standardisation, which will not only reduce costs, but make it easier to establish
new market channels and distributors both in the UK an overseas. 
● Although Inditherm is not always the most price competitive solution in the
market, the operational benefits and energy savings can lead to significant lifetime
cost savings compared to other technologies. 
● There is room for improvement in the way we execute projects and customer
contracts.
● Lack of product development and other resources mean that our ability to exploit
fully our CPT technology in the short term is resource limited.  Until we can afford
to build the team, we therefore need to concentrate on those areas that will bring
the quickest return for the minimum effort.
The business strategy was revised to position ourselves in markets and applications
where we can achieve rapid growth, without having to add significant resources or
spend significant time developing new applications or markets.  A detailed analysis
identified the following as the key areas of focus for the next two years:
● Industrial solutions, but with a shift in focus to standard products, such as mobile
and static tanks, and on key accounts where our technology is already well
accepted, UK investment remains robust and the contracts are generally larger.  
Chief Executive’s Review 7
● UK water utilities, where we have a clear competitive advantage and the
opportunity to offer more standard products. 
● Medical, notably in heated mattresses for patient warming, both in the UK and
overseas.  Having standard products makes exporting attractive.
● Sports pitch heating, both in the UK and Europe, and where the Inditherm
solution offers an improved solution and significant energy savings over
traditional hot water and cable systems.  
● Construction, notably in accelerating concrete curing.
Our other key strategies are to enhance operational excellence, develop new markets,
especially for standard products at home and overseas, and to continue to train and
develop our people. 
In summary, these applications generally require heating over often large, flat areas,
where other technologies are substantially less effective.
Industrial Solutions
Sales of Industrial products increased by 8% over 2003, partly as a result of the move
into the water utilities market in the second half.  The final quarter, normally strong in
the confectionary and food sectors, was disappointing, with low levels of orders
received.  We are strengthening the industrial sales organisation and streamlining our
selling processes, so as to improve performance in 2005.   
The recent move into water utilities is expected to enable us to take advantage in the
second half of 2005 of the new AMP4 spending round that starts in April 2005.  We
have developed solutions that are significantly superior to traditional approaches, not
only in the mode of operation but also in energy savings.   The main areas are in
heating chemical dosing lines and chemical tanks, and supplying removable heated or
insulated jackets for pumps, valves and pipework. 
Medical
Medical sales increased by 255%, with the recruitment of a new sales team and a
Commercial Director, who has since been promoted to Divisional Director.  Sales in
previous years were mainly to our sole distributor, with whom we ended our exclusive
arrangement towards the end of 2003. This has necessitated developing market
channels and demonstrating to hospitals that the Inditherm patient warming solution
has significant advantages over traditional air warming and other technologies. 
Although the medical industry is inherently conservative, there has been significant
interest in the Inditherm heated mattresses, not only because clinical trials have shown
that patient warming improves recovery, but also that Inditherm is a superior solution.
In addition, hospitals find that they can get a payback in about 6 months using
Inditherm, compared to other systems that use disposable products. Although we see
Medical as a core part of our business, market inertia means that it will take time to
grow this business sector to its full potential. 
Good progress was made in establishing new overseas distributorships, which we
expect will lead to significant sales growth in 2005. 
Chief Executive’s Review (continued) 8
Pitch Heating 
The main growth in the business in 2004 came from the two contracts at Falkirk
Community Stadium and Chelsea Football Club’s training grounds in Surrey.  These
have enabled us to prove that Inditherm is a superior technology to established
techniques in a number of ways.  Firstly, with no moving parts, the system is inherently
reliable compared to mechanical solutions. In addition, the control system gives
groundsmen the ability to manage temperatures in different zones of the pitch. We have
also seen improved grass growth. Finally, the energy savings are significant, typically
being 75% better than alternatives; our measurements show that during the winter
months, savings can be substantial. 
Although all pitch heating systems are likely to be bespoke, these two projects have not
only proved that the concept works but have also given us a significant level of data and
expertise in this application.  There is now significant interest from several clubs in the
UK and Europe, who are planning to install pitch heating systems during the next two
years and who are recognising the advantages that Inditherm offers over alternative
systems.
Construction
Throughout the year we continued to work with the Centre for Infrastructure
Management at Sheffield Hallam University on heating applications associated with
concrete and other areas in the construction industry, notably railway infrastructure.
There are a number of avenues of research taking place, notably in accelerating concrete
curing, and embedding Inditherm polymer within concrete for infrastructure warming.  
During early 2005, we started to receive orders for trials for concrete curing systems and
these should enable us to gather data on how strong a value proposition the Inditherm
solution is.  We are also carrying out trials in a number of railway-related applications.
Custom Products
In the past, Custom products have absorbed significant development effort, and some
have graduated to new business lines; the notable examples in 2004 were pitch heating
and concrete curing.  Sales of food heating bags and other products have progressed
during the year but we are limiting ongoing development efforts, concentrating on
those products that offer rapid returns over the next two years.   
We are being ruthless in assessing new market “opportunities”. However, it is important
to analyse these carefully up front to ensure that we do not miss any that can result in
quick wins. 
Future Developments
The key activities over the coming months will be to exploit our CPT technology in
those areas where we perceive there to be the greatest growth potential. Considerable
efforts are being put into water utilities ahead of the AMP 4 spending round, which
starts in April.  Other Industrial sales will focus on key accounts, larger projects and
more standard products.  
INDITHERM plc
Chief Executive’s Review (continued) 9
We anticipate steady pitch heating sales in 2005 to some well-known clubs and as a new
entrant in this market, we will also use the year to consolidate our reputation. The
prospects for 2006 are encouraging, as we are already getting involved in a number of
stadia and training pitch projects where there is strong interest in our solution.
As our patient warming solution is clearly superior, and with a strong sales
infrastructure now in place, we anticipate that Medical sales will grow strongly , from the
modest base established this year.   
Although the market potential has still to be proved, we are optimistic about the
opportunities in the Construction sector.
The challenges facing Inditherm in 2005 are demanding but the opportunities are
exciting. 2004 was a year of radical change in our business model and we are now well
positioned to exploit our targeted market sectors. However, these will take time to
develop, as customers gain confidence in Inditherm’s polymer technology and in our
ability to deliver value-added solutions.

Trading Results
Sales for the Year
Industrial Sales for the year showed an increase of 8% over the same period last year,
whilst Medical Sales were up 255%.
Pitch heating contracts income for the year was £888k and represented 55% of all Sales.
Gross Profit for the year was up 94% to £518k. The Gross Profit in percentage terms fell
from 43% to 32% reflecting competitive pricing on the Falkirk pitch heating contract,
£75k of abnormal development costs associated with entry into the pitch heating
market and reduced margins in the traditional Industrial segment.
Administration expenses before exceptional items increased during the year from
£951k in 2003 to £1,694k in 2004 reflecting the additional costs associated with building
the Industrial and Medical sales teams and increasing the marketing and selling costs.
The business will increasingly see returns on this investment in the year ahead.
The operating loss before exceptional items of £1,176k is an increase of £492k on the
same period last year.
Exceptional costs of £87k resulted from the provision against debt due to the company
from a business partner on the Falkirk pitch heating contract. The collection of this debt
is being pursued in the courts. With the termination of the Pegasus agreement, all costs
have now been expensed resulting in an exceptional charge in the year of £241k.
Cash resources generated net interest income for the year of £182k (2003: net income
£16k), giving a pre tax loss of £1,322k (2003: £802k).
Cash Resources and Net Assets
Net cash outflow from operations for the year was £1,538k (2003: £495k), reflecting the
operating loss incurred plus an increase in working capital of £8k (2003: increase £14k)
and an outflow of £136k arising from the payment of creditors associated with the cash
placing expenses incurred in late 2003.
Capital expenditure during the year was £92k (2003: £33k).
Net funds at the year end, after deduction of hire purchase liabilities, were £3,571k
(2003: £4,995k). Cash and short term deposits totalled £3,590k (2003: £5,047k). 
The £250k current asset investment is used as security for our current premises.
Shareholder funds amounted to £4,088k (2003: £5,410k).
Taxation
As the Company has continued to incur trading losses, no corporation tax liability has
yet arisen. Accumulated tax losses to the end of 2004 of £2,965k (2003: £1,681k) are
available, which should be recoverable against future trading profits. The Company’s
continuing investment in research and development has given rise to a tax credit
provision of £16k in the year on qualifying expenditure.

Directors and Board Committees 12
INDITHERM plc
The Board is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance in relation to
its size and sets out below details of how it has applied those provisions considered
appropriate to the Group’s circumstances:
Board Composition
The Board has three executive directors and two independent non-executive directors.
Details of the Board members are on page 11.
The Board meets regularly throughout the year and has a formal schedule of matters
specifically reserved for its decision.
The non-executive directors are considered by the Board to be independent of
management and free from any relationship which could materially interfere with the
exercise of their independent judgement. They receive a fixed fee for their services. 
If required, the directors are entitled to take independent legal advice and if the Board
is informed in advance, the cost of the advice will be reimbursed by the Company. The
Company Secretary’s services are available to all members of the Board.
Due to the current size of the Company the roles of Finance Director and Company
Secretary are carried out by one person.
Board Committees
The Board has three standing committees, the membership of which is set out on
page 11.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee meets as required, but at least twice a year. In addition to
reviewing the annual report and financial statements and the interim statement prior
to their submission to the Board for approval, it keeps the scope, cost effectiveness,
independence and objectivity of the external auditors under review. This includes
monitoring the level of non-audit fees.
The committee routinely meets for private discussion with the external auditors, who
attend its meetings, as required.
Remuneration Committee
The report of the Remuneration Committee is set out on page 14.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee considers succession planning, reviews the structure, size
and composition of the Board and nominates candidates to fill Board vacancies.
Board Appointments
Any decision to appoint further directors to the Board is taken by the entire Board in a
formal meeting. Where it is deemed necessary , new members of the Board are provided
with appropriate training in respect of their roles and duties as a public company
director.
Statement of Corporate Governance 13
Relations with Shareholders
The company places a great deal of importance on communication with its
shareholders.
John Markham has been identified as the Company’s Senior Independent Director. He
is available to shareholders who wish to raise any concerns that they have been unable
to resolve through other channels and to attend meetings between management and
major investors.
The notice of the AGM will be sent to shareholders at least 21 working days before the
Meeting. At the forthcoming AGM, the company will indicate the level of proxy voting
and members of the Board committees will be available to answer questions.
Internal Control
The directors acknowledge their responsibility for the Group’s systems of internal
control.
The Group maintains systems of internal control to provide reasonable but not
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The system of internal control is structured around an assessment of prioritisation of
the various risks to the business. The control environment is designed to address
particularly those risks that the Board considers to be material to the business, in
safeguarding the assets against unauthorised use or disposition and maintaining
proper accounting records which produce reliable financial information.
The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the system of internal control for the
accounting period and the period to the date of approval of the financial statements.
The key features of the group’s systems of internal control are as follows:
● An ongoing process of risk assessment to identify, evaluate and manage business
risks.
● Management structure with clearly defined responsibilities and authority limits.
● A comprehensive system of reporting financial results to the Board.
● Quality control systems certified under ISO 9001.
● Appraisal and authorisation of capital expenditure.
The Company does not currently operate an internal audit function. The Board keeps
this requirement under review in relation to the size and complexity of the business.
Going Concern
After making enquiries, and taking into account the risks of becoming established with
a new technology in the Company’s formative years, the directors have a reasonable
expectation that the group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence
for the foreseeable future. For this reason, the going concern basis has been adopted in
preparing the financial statements.
Statement of Corporate Governance (continued) 14
INDITHERM plc
Composition
The members of the Remuneration Committee (“The Committee”) are set out on page
11. The Committee is responsible for the determination of the remuneration policy of
the group’s executive directors and senior executives.
Details of each individual director’s remuneration and share options are included in
note 4 to the financial statements and those of directors’ shareholdings are set out in
the Report of the Directors.
Policy on Remuneration of Executive Directors and Senior Executives
Remuneration Policy
The Committee endeavours to offer competitive remuneration packages which are
designed to attract, retain and motivate executive directors and senior executives of the
highest calibre. Packages are reviewed each year to ensure that they are in line with the
Group’s business objectives. No director participates in decisions about their own
remuneration package.
The main components in determining pay are:
● Basic salary/fees and benefits
Salary ranges are reviewed annually and when an individual changes position or
responsibility. Benefits comprise the provision of a vehicle allowance, private health
insurance and a death in service insurance scheme.
● Annual bonus
Annual performance targets for executive directors are set which are consistent
with both the short and long term objectives for the business. The bonus scheme
includes individual objectives and targets linked to the group’s performance for its
key performance indicators. The maximum potential payment for the annual bonus
is 50% of basic annual salary, excluding benefits in kind and pension contributions,
although additional bonuses may be paid for the achievement of particular strategic
goals. 
● Executive share options schemes
Share options are granted to executive directors to encourage them to deliver
sustained, long term growth.
Except in exceptional circumstances the value of options granted in any year will
not exceed one times basic salary and the total value of options outstanding will not
exceed five times salary.
Details of share options outstanding are included in note 4 on page 26.
Service contracts
R Harpum and ID Smith have service contracts requiring 12 months’ written notice
given by either party.
C Tarry will be resigning from the board on 1st June 2005 and his service contract will

JOHN H MARKHAM
Chairman, Remuneration Committee
24 March 2005
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial
year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company
and of the profit or loss of the Group for that year. In preparing those financial
statements, the directors are required to:
● select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
● make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
● state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed subject to any
material departure disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
● prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is
inappropriate to presume that the group will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose
with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the group and to enable
them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group, and hence for
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other
irregularities.

Report of the Directors
For the Year ended 31 December 2004 17
Charitable and Political Donations
During the year the Group made no charitable or political donations.
Creditor Payment Policy and Practice
It is normally the Group’s policy to settle all trade creditors within the normal
commercial terms of trade agreed with each supplier. The number of days’ purchases
represented by trade creditors at the year end was 60 (2003: 78).
Re-appointment of Auditors
On 28 February 2005 our auditors, Blueprint Audit Limited, changed their name to
Tenon Audit Limited and have signed the audit report in their new name.
Tenon Audit Limited have expressed their willingness to continue in office and a
resolution to reappoint them will be proposed at the annual general meeting.
Special Business
● Resolution 5 in the Notice of Annual General Meeting on page 36 renews the
authority of the Directors to allot relevant securities. The nominal amount of
securities to which the authority relates is £15,000, which represents approximately
7% of the Company’s current issued share capital. This authority will expire at the
earlier of either the 2006 Annual General Meeting or 15 months from the date the
Resolution is passed. The Directors have no present intention of exercising this
authority.
● Resolution 6 waives the statutory pre-emption rights under s.89 of the Companies
Act 1985 in respect of the allotment of equity securities for cash. The nominal
amount of equity securities which may be issued without being offered to existing
shareholders is £15,000, as noted above for Resolution 5. There is no present
intention to make any such allotment of equity securities, but the Directors
consider it desirable to maintain the flexibility afforded by this power.
● The Directors believe that both of the above Resolutions are in the best interests of
the Company and shareholders and they therefore recommend Shareholders’ to
vote in favour of the Resolution.

INDITHERM plc
We have audited the financial statements of Inditherm plc for the year ended
31 December 2004 which comprise the consolidated Profit and Loss Account,
consolidated Balance Sheet, company Balance Sheet, consolidated Cash Flow
Statement and the related notes. These financial statements have been prepared under
the historical cost convention and the accounting policies set out therein.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with
Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that
we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to
them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by
law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and
the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the
opinions we have formed.
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the financial
statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting
Standards are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal
and regulatory requirements and United Kingdom Auditing Standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair
view and are properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also
report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report is not consistent with the financial
statements, if the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not
received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and transactions with
the company is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report, and consider whether it is
consistent with the audited financial statements. This other information comprises
only the Directors’ Report, the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s review, the

responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Independent Auditors’ Report to the Shareholders of
Inditherm plc 19
Basis of Audit Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom Auditing Standards
issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis,
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also
includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the
directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances, consistently applied and
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and
explanations which we consider necessary in order to provide us with sufficient
evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In
forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of
information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the
affairs of the company and the group as at 31 December 2004 and of the result of the
group for the year then ended and have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985.

INDITHERM plc
1 Accounting Policies
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and
are in accordance with applicable accounting standards. The following principal
accounting policies have been applied:
Basis of consolidation
The financial statements of the group consolidate the financial statements of Inditherm
plc and its subsidiary undertakings up to 31 December 2004 using acquisition
accounting. The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired during a financial period
are included from the effective date of acquisition.
The company has taken advantage of the exemption under Section 230 of the
Companies Act 1985 and has not presented its own profit and loss account.
Turnover
Turnover represents sales to outside customers at the value of work done excluding
value added tax and trade discounts. Where appropriate, the recognition of income is
deferred according to the specific circumstances of material transactions.
Long term contracts are included in turnover on the basis of the sales value of the work
performed during the period by reference to the total sales value and stage of
completion of these contracts.
Intangible fixed assets
Purchased intellectual property rights are capitalised and amortised over the Directors’
estimate of their useful economic life of 10 years. In addition, provision is made for any
impairment in value.
Research and development costs
Research expenditure is written off in the year in which it is incurred. 
Investments
Investments held as fixed and current assets are stated at cost less provision for any
impairment in value.
Depreciation
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost, less estimated residual values, of all fixed
assets evenly over their expected useful lives. It is calculated at the following straight
line rates:
Plant, machinery and office equipment – 20% per annum
Fixtures and fittings – 10% - 15% per annum
Motor vehicles – 25% per annum
Stocks
Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is based on the cost
of purchase on a first in, first out basis. Net realisable value is based on estimated
selling price less additional costs to completion and disposal.
Notes Forming Part of the Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 December 2004 25
1 Accounting Policies (continued)
Leasing and hire purchase commitments
Assets acquired under hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet and
depreciated over their expected useful lives. The interest element is charged to the
profit and loss account over the term of the contract. Rentals in respect of operating
leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the term
of the agreement.
Deferred taxation
The payment of taxation is deferred or accelerated because of timing differences
between the treatment of certain items for accounting and taxation purposes. Full
provision for deferred taxation is made under the liability method, without
discounting, on all timing differences that have arisen, but not reversed by the balance
sheet date, unless such provision is not permitted by FRS 19.
Financial instruments
In adopting Financial Reporting Standard 13: Derivatives and other financial
instruments, the group has not treated short term debtors and creditors as financial
assets and liabilities.
Employee share schemes
Provision is made for National Insurance contributions on options granted on or after
6 April 1999 under unapproved share option schemes. Provision is made at the
prevailing rate on the difference between the period end share value and the grant
price, being the best estimate of the ultimate liability at each period end.
Pension costs
Contributions to the group’s stakeholder pension scheme and to employees’ personal
pension schemes are charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which they
become payable.
Grants receivable
Revenue based grants are credited to the profit and loss account against related
expenditure whilst grants of a capital nature are treated as deferred income and are
transferred to the profit and loss account over the expected useful lives of the relevant
assets.
Warranty provision
The performance of products is warranted against clearly defined performance
specifications established by reference to the technical and development testing carried
out at the manufacturing facility in Rotherham and in the field.
Aprovision is made for future warranty costs based on the specific circumstances
pertaining to each contract.
2 Turnover
All turnover, losses and net assets are wholly attributable to the principal activity of the
group being the manufacture, sale and installation of specialised heating products and
arose predominately within the United Kingdom.

The investment was made on 26 February 2002 and represents the cost of a unitised
International with Profits Bond’s with Axa Isle of Man Limited. The bonds also include
life insurance on the lives of Mr P O’Grady and C Tarry, and would become repayable
on the death of the last life.
The value of the bonds as at 8 February 2005 are £282,830.
Under the terms of the bond early redemption would result in a surrender charge in
the first 5 years (currently 4%) and a Market value adjustment. Redemption on the
8 February 2005 would have resulted in total charges of £56,848, leaving a net realisable
value of £225,982. There is no intention at present to realise the investment.
On the 26 February 2002 the bond was pledged as security to HSBC plc for a guarantee
to Highbridge (Houndhill) Industries Ltd as security for £142,920 being a rolling two
years rent on the manufacturing facility at Rotherham. 31

13 short term debtors and creditors have been excluded from interest rate and liquidity
disclosures. The amount of foreign currency held is not considered to be material.
The main risk arising from the Group’s financial instruments is liquidity risk. The
Group ensures that it has sufficient cash resources available to meet all short term cash
requirements and to meet its capital expenditure programme for the foreseeable future. 
At present the directors do not believe that the group has significant interest rate or
foreign currency risk and consequently does not hedge against such risk. The Board
keeps these risks under regular review.
The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from
their book values.

The warranty provision was last year included in creditors but has been reallocated
this year into provisions. The comparative has been changed as a result.
The royalty provision arises from the agreement with Pegasus Ltd dated 24 September
2003 whereby a 10% Royalty is payable in respect of medical sales. In the event that
qualifying medical sales fail to reach £2.5m in aggregate for the four year period
ending 23 September 2007 the remaining balance becomes payable

Our Business
Vatukoula Gold Mines plc. (“VGM” or “Group”) 
explores, discovers, and develops gold mining 
operations. The Group is primarily focused on 
its operations on the Pacific Island of Viti Levu, 
Fiji.
VGM is the owner of the longest producing 
gold mine in Fiji. Operating for over 75 years, 
the mine has produced in excess of seven 
million ounces of gold. VGM acquired the mine 
in 2008 and aims to reach a sustainable and 
profitable production level. We are currently 
in our next phase of expansion at the mine, 
increasing our production from the current 
base of approximately 40,000 ounces per 
annum. The mine currently has 4.1 million 
ounces of Mineral Resources and 750,000 
ounces of Mineral Reserves.
The Vatukoula Gold Mine is located in 
the northern part of Fiji’s main island, 
approximately ten kilometres inland from the 
coast and within the Tavua Basin. The mine is 
located at the foot of the hills that make up the 
Tavua Volcanic Crater. 
The mine operates within three Special Mining 
Leases which cover a total area of 1,255 
hectares. In addition VGM has the right to 
explore areas outside the current mining leases 
via Special Prospecting Licenses that cover 
over 19,000 hectares of the surrounding Tavua 
Volcano.
The Vatukoula Gold Mine is currently both 
an open pit and underground operation, 
however in the medium-term it will become 
predominantly an underground mine. 
Underground production is sourced from 
four mining areas; Smith Shaft, Philip Shaft, 
R1 Cayzer Shaft and Emperor Decline. The 
Smith and Philip Shafts, and the Emperor 
Decline serve as the main accesses to the 
underground workings for personnel and 
materials, and are used for ore and waste 
haulage.
Once the ore is hauled to the surface it is 
crushed, enriched and refined at our on-site 
treatment plant, to produce gold doré. Gold 
doré produced at the mine is typically 80% 
gold, 19% silver and 1% base metals such as 
copper and iron. The gold doré is sold to the 
Perth Mint in Australia.
VGM has onsite workshops, assay labs and 
produces its own power via diesel generators.
Vatukoula Gold Mines plc. is a UK public 
company with its headquarters in London. We 
are listed on the AIM market of the London 
Stock Exchange under the symbol VGM. 
The Group reports in Pounds Sterling (£) in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the 
European Union.

We have a clear strategy: to deliver to our shareholders the full potential of the 
Vatukoula Gold Mine. We aim to achieve this by focusing on four key strategic 
priorities:
We operate in a responsible manner in relation to our people, the environment and the communities that we inhabit. As a business these elements 
are important in the achievement of our strategic priorities.
Strategic Priority Operational Drivers Targets in 2013 Achievements in 2013
Expand 
Current production from 
the Vatukoula Gold Mine to 
a targeted sustainable and 
profitable rate of production
Develop enough underground 
access, or development, allowing 
access to the required mining 
areas and therefore tonnages 
and grade
Achieve normal and capital 
development metres of 16,500 
metres
19,823 metres of operating and 
capital development carried out. 
Development was limited as the 
Group awaited the completion 
of the required financing of US$ 
40 million. This has subsequently 
been agreed and the first tranche 
of the financing was completed 
subsequent to the year end. The 
second tranche of the financing 
is due for completion by the end 
of February 2014.
Sustain 
The targeted production rate 
beyond current Mineral Reserves
Further define the large 
mineral resource inventory and 
converting this to Proven and 
Probable Mineral Reserves to 
both replace ounces mined and 
increase the current Mineral 
Reserve base
Begin reserve and resource 
drilling programme with the 
objective of increasing our 
Mineral Reserve base
Limited drilling occurred during 
the year as available cash 
reserves were used in operating 
and critical capital expenditure.
Optimise 
Our working practices and 
working relationships to target 
lower unit costs on a per tonne 
basis  
Target key operational drivers 
and costs that have high internal 
rates of return and low capital 
costs
Further negotiations with Fiji 
Sugar Corporation (“FSC”) 
with the aim of signing a 
memorandum of understanding 
to develop a biomass power 
station
It became apparent that during 
the year that the FSC were not 
progressing the development of 
a biomass power station at the 
rate we were expecting, as such 
we are currently looking to find 
alternate partners to develop and 
commission an alternate power 
source.
Grow 
Through greenfield opportunities 
in the area surrounding the 
Vatukoula Gold Mine 
Evaluate, define and explore the 
Special Prospecting Licenses 
within the Tavua Basin
Continue exploratory field work 
on the Special Prospecting 
Licenses within the Tavua Basin
Limited exploration and drilling 
occurred during the year as 
available cash reserves were 
used in operating and critical 
capital expenditure.

Overview
Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Dear Shareholders,
This is my first annual 
statement as VGM Chairman, 
having taken over from Colin 
Orr-Ewing as non-executive 
chairman of the board at the 
end of May 2013. I am honoured 
to serve as chairman of VGM 
and to tackle the challenges 
that VGM may encounter during 
one of the more difficult periods 
in the gold mining sector. 
Nonetheless I have a firm belief 
in the Vatukoula Gold Mine and 
its potential. In a recent report, 
by Natural Resource Holdings 
Ltd, the Vatukoula Gold Mine 
was ranked 212th in terms of 
minerals resources among 580 
mines, and ranked 29th among 
the top 50 producing mines by 
grade.
Introduction to the role
As part of my planned introduction to the 
role of chairman, I have had the opportunity 
to spend some time at the Vatukoula Gold 
Mine in Fiji, and to meet with many of its 
senior leaders in a range of forums. I have 
been extremely impressed by the enthusiasm 
and professionalism by many of the Group’s 
managers.
I have also been able to meet most of the 
Company’s larger shareholders. Keeping in 
touch with investors is an essential part of my 
role and I intend to maintain regular contact 
with them in future.
Market and economy
During this financial year we have seen a 
downward pressure on the gold price. This is 
despite evidence that shows a very positive 
increase in consumer demand and only a 
moderate increase in supply. However financial 
and investment demand has fallen which has 
been the primary driver for the negative price 
trend and, as such, I believe that in the short 
term the gold price is going to be dominated 
by unpredictable economic shocks and 
political shocks and an element of speculation 
amongst traders.
Nonetheless commodity prices have always 
been cyclical in nature and the gold market 
is no exception. If the past events are any 
indication for the future, the gold market has 
now reached its bottom, and is poised to 
recover in the future years. Why? Over the 
last 20 years since 1993, we have witnessed 
three major cycles for gold markets. In January 
1996, gold price reached its 7-year high at 
US$403 per ounce. A bear market followed, 
triggered by the 1997 Asian financial crisis. In 
January 2001, gold price reached its bottom at 
US$253 per ounce. This represents a 37.2% 
correction from its previous high. Then the 
gold price embarked on an initially gradual and 
later accelerated rise. In February 2008, gold 
price reached its 20 year high at US$973 per 
ounce. This represents a 141% rise from its 
2001 price. This new high was followed by a 
major corrective phase triggered by the US 
financial crisis. In October 2008, gold price 
dropped to US$732 per ounce, representing 
a 24.8% correction over its previous high. This 
correction is then followed by another bull run 
in the gold market. In July 2011, gold price 
reached another new high of US$1,838 ounce, 
representing a 151% rise over its previous low; 
3 quarters later in April 2013, because of the 
US monetary policy, the gold price fell to as 
low as US$1, 206 per ounce, representing a 
34.4% drop from its previous high.
I believe that we can conclude from the above 
events that with each major correction of 
25% to 40% in gold price, a major bull run 
of over 100% could follow, with initial price 
consolidation at the bottom and later an

accelerated rise. If history repeats itself, the 
gold price might rise to a US$2,000 per ounce 
level following the current consolidation.
Another major factor influencing the gold price 
is China’s strategy is to make its Renminbi 
(“RMB”) freely exchangeable and as an 
international reserve currency. The Chinese 
government has been preparing for this since 
1996 when China made RMB exchangeable 
under current account. To achieve its goal, 
China would have to substantially increase its 
current gold holding of 1,054 tonnes, which 
represents 1.2% of China’s total foreign reserve 
of US$3.662 trillion in September 2013. In 
comparison, gold holding accounts for 50% to 
70% of foreign reserves for the US and most 
of the European Union countries. In order to 
increase its gold holding to the global average 
of 10% of foreign reserves, China needs to 
acquire an additional 7,706 tonnes of gold, in 
par with the US gold holding of 8,133 tonnes.
Financial Performance
The continued downward pressure on the gold 
price has made developing and mining at the 
Vatukoula Gold Mines very difficult. Moreover 
the delays in securing the capital investment 
has prevented the mine from embarking on 
its growth strategy which in turn lowered 
production below management expectations. 
The losses this year have increased compared 
to the same period last year, however this was 
driven not by an increase in costs but as a 
result of lower gold prices and lack of capital 
investment which hampered production.
Financing and shareholder 
support
As mentioned at last year’s Annual General 
Meeting the board highlighted that to 
achieve its production targets it would 
require US$40 million for capital investment 
and working capital. While we secured this 
financing we continued to receive support 
from our major shareholders – including DRK 
Energy Co., Limited (“DRK”), who over the 
period under review, invested £4.5 million 
in May 2013 and Zhongrun International 
Mining Co. Ltd (“Zhongrun”), whom invested 
£6.6 million in October 2012 and £1.3 million 
in April 2013.
More importantly this year we finalised 
the US$40 million investment agreement 
with Zhongrun. The investment agreement 
stipulated that the funding will be provided in 
two tranches of approximately US$20 million 
each. The first tranche was completed after 
the year end in November 2013. The second 
tranche was due for completion at the end of 
January 2014, we have subsequently agreed 
with Zhongrun that they will deliver these funds 
by the end of February 2014.
I would personally like to thank both DRK and 
Zhongrun for their continued support in this 
difficult market.
The board
2013 saw change on the board, with the 
retirement of Colin Orr-Ewing and my 
appointment as his replacement. I would like to 
thank Colin for his service to the Group, both 
as chairman since 2004 and before that as a 
director of the Group. Continually refreshing 
is vitally important if a board is to function as 
effectively as possible.
In January 2013, Ian Stalker resigned from 
the board for personal reasons. Ian was 
appointed as a non-executive director in 
2008 and was heavily involved in the initial 
commissioning of operations at the Vatukoula 
Gold Mine. Subsequent to this his experience 
and knowledge was invaluable in planning the 
development of the Vatukoula Gold Mine.
As part of the equity subscription agreement 
announced in October 2012, VGM agreed with 
Zhongrun that they were entitled to propose 
four nominees for election as Directors at the 
Annual General Meeting (“AGM”). In January 
2013, the following directors were appointed 
as directors of the Group; Mr. Yeung Ng, 
Mr. Fengwen Zheng and myself.
162673 Vatukoula Gold Accounts  FRONT.indd   5 12/02/2014   15:45 6
www.vgmplc.com
As part of the equity subscription agreement 
announced in May 2013, VGM agreed with 
DRK that they were entitled to nominate two 
directors for appointment to the board. The 
two directors appointed were Mr. Yongan Lu 
and Mr. Wei Li.
In addition, and in order to complete the DRK 
agreement and comply with the shareholder 
agreement with Zhongrun, both of which 
require a board of seven directors, both 
Kiran Caldas Morzaria and John Francis 
Kearney agreed to tender their resignations as 
Directors.
I would like to thank John Kearney for his 
tireless efforts over the past 4 years. He 
contributed immensely to the development 
of the Board and provided the Company with 
valuable guidance and strategic vision.
Although no longer a Director, Kiran Caldas 
Morzaria has remained as the Chief Financial 
Officer of the Group.
I am delighted with these new appointments 
to the board; their qualities will be invaluable to 
the board and to the Group as we continue to 
develop the business.
Strategic Review Committee
2014 will be a time of both change and 
consolidation for the Group. There have been 
a number of changes at both board and Group 
executive committee level and there will be 
new challenges involved in implementing the 
Group’s strategy. 
Subsequent to the year-end VGM agreed with 
Zhongrun to form a strategic review committee, 
which has been reviewing all aspects of the 
Vatukoula Gold Mine. It is anticipated that 
these findings will be made available to the 
board during the second quarter of this year. 
The Group will however continue to grow and 
develop and I have learned in the short time 
that I have been involved with the Company 
that, in this aim, it is well served by a group 
dedicated and professional employees. 
Strategy and key business 
objectives
We have a clear strategy: to deliver to our 
shareholders the full potential of the Vatukoula 
Gold Mine. We aim to achieve this by focusing 
on four key strategic priorities: expand, sustain, 
optimise and grow:
In the coming year our key business 
objectives are:
Expand: To expedite the underground 
development and achieve a total capital 
development of 5,000 metres.
To produce 45,000 ounces of gold.
Sustain: To re-embark on the resource 
definition drilling campaign started in 2011.
Optimise: To review all current suppliers and 
embark on negotiating longer term contracts 
which will improve our operational process flow 
and reduce unit costs.
Grow: Carry out preliminary field work on 
identified gold and copper targets in the Tavua 
basin.
In the longer term our key business 
objectives are:
Expand: To produce 100,000 ounces per 
annum at a cash cost of below US$900 per 
ounce.
Sustain: Continue resource development 
drilling at approximately 20,000 metres per 
annum.

Optimise: To actively seek investment from 
international utility and power companies for 
building a power plant in Fiji, permanently 
resolving the problem of high power costs.
Grow: To continue our exploration efforts 
to upgrade and increase our 4 million once 
gold Mineral Resource estimate, laying the 
foundation for future mine expansion.
In addition to the above VGM will be seeking 
the opportunity of listing the Company in the 
Asia or North America markets, where gold 
companies command a better company 
valuation.
I firmly believe VGM is poised for growth 
and future success. With 2013 behind us, I 
take this opportunity to thank our employees 
for their tireless efforts and hard work; 
and acknowledge the support provided to 
the Company by all our stakeholders and 
suppliers. 
To all who share our optimism for seizing 
the great opportunities and challenges that 
lie ahead, we say thanks for your continuing 
confidence and support.

During the last twelve months 
the operations at the Vatukoula 
Gold Mine have been severely 
hampered by the lack of capital 
to undertake the necessary 
development required to 
establish production levels 
to our targeted rate. At the 
beginning of the year we were 
waiting for the funding that 
had been agreed to by a Hong 
Kong based mining investment 
company but unfortunately 
those funds never materialised.
As discussed in my last commentary we 
established that a major capital program 
was required to undertake the development 
required. The mining plan for the year was 
based on a development program over 
18 months, opening up major new areas for 
long term mining at Vatukoula. Due to the 
delay in the funding this program was delayed. 
At the end of the year, a full twelve months 
later, the program has not been commenced.
It is a credit to all the mine staff, from the 
General Manager to the trainees for the 
support that they have given to the Company 
during this trying time. We have been forced, 
due to lack of funds, to severely reduce 
our stock levels, which have impacted on 
underground equipment availability. Ore mining 
has been undertaken on a limited ‘where 
available’ basis. Exploration drilling was also 
halted in order to maintain funds. The lack of 
drill data compounded the planning for new 
development.
Operating and Financial 
Performance
VGM sold 39,517 ounces of gold in the year 
at an average cost of US$1,606 per ounce. 
The main driver to the lower cost per ounce 
was the lower operating costs per tonne which 
decreased to US$148 per tonne.

The negative movement of the gold price 
further exacerbated the lower production 
figures, with our gross loss for the year being 
£1.2 million. After administrative expenses, 
foreign exchange gains and depreciation 
and amortisation expenses the underlying 
operating loss was £12.6 million.
The lack of funds affected our underground 
fleet most severely. Without being able to 
maintain our stock levels, we were forced 
to ‘rob Peter to pay Paul’ with underground 
equipment. Critical parts that were required 
had to be ordered and air freighted to site at 
an additional cost.
We also continued to face issues as a result 
of the lack of resource definition, another 
capital item that we placed on hold during 
the year. One such example occurred in the 
Matanagata ore body, in Smith section. Our 
new footwall development was undertaken at 
the required elevation as defined in the Mineral 
Resource model. The ore body was identified 
a high grade ore body. Ore was exposed in 3 
crosscuts at the location as expected. Raises 
were initiated, including the ore passes and 
truck chutes as required.
However the exposed ore body did not 
reconcile to the Mineral Resource model and 
was not at a mineable grade. The development 
was halted for further investigation, and follow 
up underground drilling initiated.
It was discovered that the ore body we 
developed was a split of the main ore body 
and not the main Matanagata ore body. The 
main ore body was in fact 18 meters above 
this split. The area in question has been 
developed to the correct elevation and has 
commenced mining. However this example 
shows the fraught nature of blind developing 
at Vatukoula and shows how vital resource 
drilling is.
Development of the Vatukoula 
Gold Mine
Despite the lack of funds VGM still managed to 
carry out some additional capital development. 
We continued the development on the new 
lower levels at Philip Shaft, and the clearing of 
the lower levels at Smith Shaft. The key area 
for mining will be the lower levels at Philip, 
between 18 and 20 level. We are clearing the 
shaft above 20 level. Once cleared we will 
install new shaft furniture, including tipping 
points. This will become a major production 
level as planned in our 7 year mine plan. This 
area is considered a high grade area and will 
account for a significant portion of the gold 
produced at Vatukoula in that 7 year plan. 
Development in the lower levels is undertaken 
cautiously, due to the potential of hot water. 
The amount of water is not significant – but 
the heat can make the operating conditions 
difficult. Our program is to either seal the 
area, or to drain the water and remove – so 
removing the heat from the area. We have 
found that once ore mining operations 
commence – the draining technique works 
best.
For the Philip Shaft sections, comprising 
Prince, Prince William, Cayzer Prince and all 
of the associated ore bodies access to the 
20 level station at Philip Shaft was a vital first 
step. We have completed the development 
to the 20 level station, and started some of 
the development required on both 19 and 
20 levels. The decline from 18 to 20 level will 
become one of the key access routes for the 
long term profitability at Vatukoula for a long 
future. We have exposed the original 20 level 
station, and we are cleaning out the spillage in 
the shaft between 18 and 20 levels. This has 
been very difficult with the limited equipment 
available to us, and has been completed when 
we have equipment available only. 20 level in 
the Philip Shaft will become a major production 
centre. This station will service all of the new 
mining of the high grade ore bodies at levels 
between 18 level down to 23 level, as detailed 
in our 7 year plan.

Sustainable Power
A major expenditure at the Vatukoula Gold 
Mine is the cost of power generation. Diesel 
fuel is imported and used to generate power 
at the mine. This has costed up to F$0.70 
per kilo watt. The major uses for power 
are pumping, hoisting and mill processing. 
Numerous opportunities exist for the reduction 
of power use at the Vatukoula Gold Mine, but 
the biggest factor would be the reduction in the 
cost of power. We have investigated a number 
of options, however the use of biomass 
appears to be the most practical.
The FSC has designed a 40MW power 
biomass project at the nearby Rurawai 
Sugar plant, specifically designed to provide 
Vatukoula with the power required. However, at 
this time the FSC has not initiated construction.
We are fully aware that a power source, 
which is not at the behest of the international 
hydrocarbon price is essential for the long 
term profitability of VGM. Investigations toward 
possible solutions have been placed as a major 
priority.
Health & Safety
I would also like to thank the health and safety 
department for their diligent work over the 
past year. We have seen a major improvement 
in our accident statistics. One accident is 
one too many – and the focus of safety for all 
employees by all employees is one that we 
strive to achieve.
Financing
I would like to thank our largest shareholders 
for the support given to the Group at a very 
critical time. Although we had a positive 
independent engineers report confirming that 
our development plans and the production 
targets were achievable, we were unable to 
secure a suitable financial package to provide 
for our plans. Zhongrun stepped into the 
breach, and on behalf of all of the employees, 
their families and the communities that 
surround the Vatukoula Gold Mine I give my 
heartfelt thanks. Zhongrun now owns over two 
thirds of VGM, but without their investment the 
future would have been distressed.
Post Balance Sheet Events
Subsequent to year-end VGM completed the 
first tranche of the US$ 40 million financing 
with the issue of 188,897,000 new ordinary 
shares at a subscription of 6.89 pence per 
share, raising approximately £13 million. The 
second tranche was due for completion at the 
end of January 2014, we have subsequently 
agreed with Zhongrun that they will deliver 
these funds by the end of February 2014.
On 3 February 2014 we appointed Xuexin 
(Kevin) Zhu as General Manager of the 
Vatukoula Gold Mine. Xuexin is a professional 
mining engineer and PMI certified Project 
Management Professional with over twenty 
years’ experience in corporate management, 
mine planning, engineering design, 
construction and operation management of 
open pit and underground precious and base 
metal mines.
The board would like to thank the outgoing 
General Manager, David Whittle, for his 
efforts and the progress that has been made 
at the Vatukoula Gold Mine. Under difficult

financial circumstances David Whittle has 
improved many key operating and safety 
measures which will stand us in good stead 
going forward. In particular his focus on the 
development of the higher grade Cayzer prince 
ore-body forms part of the building blocks to 
increase production in the coming years.
Outlook
2013 was a difficult year for VGM in terms of 
achieving our targets that we set out at the 
beginning of the year. With limited financing we 
were not able to hit our production targets.
Looking forward, the investment by Zhongrun 
allows us to make the necessary adjustments 
and positions the Company to increase 
production in 2014. The mine has a number of 
world class ore bodies, any one of which could 
be a mine by itself. The mine is very shallow 
in international mining standards. Deeper 
drilling has shown the continuation of ore 
bodies at depths of double our current deepest 
mining depth and exploration at Vatukoula 
has identified some very high grades. Recent 
re-examination of the central Caldera has 
identified some indications of porphyry ore 
bodies and exploration will be undertaken in 
these areas over the coming year.
It is the development that we have achieved 
in the year that will assist in opening high-
grade areas that will sustain production in the 
longer term. Over the coming first half year 
ending February 2014 this increase in capital 
development will continue to negatively impact 
our gold production. Subsequent to this, 
production from the Cayzer Prince ore body 
will come on stream and production should 
increase to targeted production levels.
In conclusion, I would like to thank all of the 
operating staff at the Vatukoula Gold Mine for 
their commitment, enthusiasm and enormous 
effort in what has been a challenging year in 
the development of the business. I would also 
like to thank the Board for their support, advice 
and commitment throughout the year.

www.vgmplc.com
The World Gold Council is the 
main reference source for gold 
market trends and statistics 
and where Vatukoula Gold 
Mines sources its market data. 
The World Gold Council’s Q3 
report 2012, reported that gold 
demand was 1,084.6 tonnes, 
down 11% from the record Q3 
2011 figure of 1,224 tonnes. 
The slowing of overall demand 
can go some way in explaining 
why the price of gold started 
to decline heading into 2013 
and where we have seen from 
the beginning of 2013 to date a 
26% fall in the price.
How the gold price is reacting to supply, 
demand, volatility, quantitative easing (“QE”) 
and geo political risks makes the task of 
predicting the future gold price trend extremely 
difficult. Evidence of this can be seen with 
statistics that show very positive increases in 
consumer demand, only moderate increases in 
supply, but where financial demand has fallen 
off over the period under review. Consumer 
demand for gold is connected to global 
consumer confidence and economic growth, 
which can be forecast, whereas financial and 
investment demand is related to circumstances 
in the financial markets that can be associated 
with unpredictable exogenous economic 
shocks and geo political shocks and where an 
element of speculation amongst traders is at 
work.
Demand: Consumer
So far in 2014, consumer demand for gold 
is set to reach record levels and to date is at 
2,897 tonnes, with the vast bulk of consumer 
demand coming from the eastern markets 
with 90% of the 605 tonne increase so far 
coming from Middle Eastern and Asian 
consumers. Mainland China consumers have 
also been displaying a strong appetite for gold 
purchasing with Hong Kong showing so far in 
2014 a 28% increase in demand.
India demand has dropped as import 
restrictions have taken effect, resulting in a 
23% year on year drop so far this year. United 
States demand has remained robust with a 7% 
above 5 year average of 35.3 tonnes, driven 
by increased consumer confidence. Russia’s 
growing middle class has helped create a 7% 
year on year demand in Q3 2013.
Market Review
The year under review has seen the price of 
gold fall by 22% to US$1,394 per ounce on the 
31 August 2013, from a high of US$1,791 per 
ounce on the 4 October 2012.

The overall picture for consumer demand for 
gold heading into 2014 looks very positive as 
GDP growth across the 34-member OECD is 
projected to accelerate from this year’s 1.2% 
rate to a 2.3% rate in 2014.
Demand: Financial/Investment
Q3 of 2013 showed a mixed picture with 
respect to investment demand for gold. 
Whilst demand for physical gold bars and 
coins has so far increased by 6%, Exchange 
Traded Funds (ETF’s) are continuing to see 
net outflows, a trend that has continued 
throughout 2013 and where Q3 ETF tonnage 
holdings are around 1,100 tonnes, a similar 
level to that of Q3 2011. The steady decline 
in ETF gold holdings has again clearly placed 
downward pressure on the price of gold, 
throughout 2013. To illustrate the downward 
trend in investment holdings in gold, in 
Q3 2012 425.3 tonnes of gold was held 
in investments, in Q3 2013 that figure had 
slumped to 285.5 tonnes a decline of 56%. 
Central Bank net purchases have also declined 
in the same quarter comparison by 17%.
These Q3 2012 Q3 2013 comparisons reflect a 
significant portion of the reporting period under 
review and where overall demand for gold is 
down by 21%.
It is clear that strong consumer demand is now 
returning to the market and has helped offset 
the declines in ETF demand and Central Bank 
net purchasing, which have weighed heavily on 
the gold price. A modest gain in demand from 
the technology sector (1% year on year) has 
been supported by lower gold prices during 
the period.
Supply
Total gold supply to the market in Q3 2013 
was down 3% compared to the same period in 
2012, with recycling experiencing a decline of 
13% or 158 tonnes.
Supply from gold mines is up 4% in Q3 
2013 compared to Q3 2012, with industry 
commentators predicting a rise in gold 
production from mines in 2014 and 2015.
However, downward price pressures on gold 
are certain to cause an impact on the ability of 
mines and certain gold exploration companies 
to secure financing for projects that under 
buoyant gold prices would lead to an increase 
in supply.
Summary
Heading into 2014 the price of gold in the 
near term, is likely to be impacted by the 
US Federal Reserve’s strategy in respect of 
QE. A consensus amongst analysts exists 
to suggest that should a tapering of QE be 
applied by the US Federal Reserve, then the 
price of gold is likely to face downward price 
pressure, however, there is a view amongst 
other commentators that the impact of the 
easing of QE in the US may have a knock 
on effect in the equities markets, that could 
lead to market volatility. The S&P 500 (“VIX”) 
index is a measure of market volatility. During 
the year under review the VIX index traded 
at 17.47 points and peaked at 21.79 points. 
We have seen the VIX index begin to rise and 
trade at 15.54 points (13 December 2013), 
possibly in anticipation of news related to QE 
tapering. There is a correlation between market 
volatility and the price of gold where investors 
tend to invest in gold during periods of market 
and geo political volatility. From July 2013, the 
US Dollar has started to strengthen across 
the International Foreign Exchange Markets, 
strengthening by around 10% from July 
2013 to date across most currencies. There 
is a correlation between a strong US Dollar 
and its impact that leads to a weakening in 
commodity prices, including gold.
The upward price pressure on gold in 2014 will 
likely come from the financial and investment 
sector, who may reverse outflows as seen in 
2013 and where uncertainty unfolds within the 
international financial system related to the 
impact of QE tapering, will lead to ETF gold 
purchases. This coupled with strong consumer 
demand and only modest increases in gold 
supply, would serve to support the gold price.
Downward price pressure is likely to come 
from further strengthening of the US Dollar, 
improvements in mine supply and a return to 
stability across the financial markets which 
may see the easing of QE as a sign the US 
economy is heading to a firmer and sustainable 
financial footing, with US fiscal debt under 
control and growth returning to sustainable 
levels.

Performance in 2013 Gold Shipped totalled 39,517 
ounces, compared to 52,616 
ounces in the previous year. 
This reduction was a result of 
lower ore tonnes and lower 
grade being delivered to the

Underground Production
Total tonnes of ore, waste and capital mined 
for 2013 decreased by 17% to 397,995 tonnes 
compared to 2012. The lower tonnages 
were driven by decreases in strike drive 
development, which decreased from 4,034 
metres to 1,682 metres representing a 58% 
decrease over the twelve months ending 
31st August 2013.
The ore delivered from underground for 
2013 was 240,156 tonnes, a 21% decrease 
compared to the same period last year. This 
reduction in ore delivered was due in part to 
lower strike drive development during the year, 
which is typically delivered as ore.
The average underground grade for the twelve 
months was 5.00 grams per tonne, which was 
marginally lower than the same period last year 
(5.12 grams per tonne). We had forecast higher 
grades in this year, however lack of available 
finance prevented VGM accessing the higher 
grade deposits of the Philip Shaft.
Underground operations remain focused on 
infrastructure development which should 
enable the mine to produce at our long-term 
projected rate.
Surface Production
Production from surface oxides and sulphide 
waste piles for the twelve months delivered 
189,047 tonnes at a grade of 2.39 grams per 
tonne. The surface production predominantly 
came from historic waste dumps which are 
generally of a higher grade compared to the 
oxide material, but does lower the overall 
recovery in the oxide circuit given that the 
material has not been completely oxidised.
Vatukoula Treatment Plant 
(“VTP”)
During the year, the VTP processed 428,978 
tonnes of ore which was an 11% reduction 
compared to the same period last year 
(479,524 tonnes).
The average grade decreased from 4.24 grams 
of gold per tonne in the year ending August 
2012, to 3.81 grams of gold per tonne in the 
year ending August 2013. This was driven 
by lower grades delivered from underground 
operations.
Recoveries for the year were 75.6%. This was 
lower than the comparable period last year 
(78.6%) as a result of the sulphide nature of the 
material delivered from the surface mining at 
the waste dump.
Cash Costs
As a result of decreases in unit mining, cash 
cost per ounce of gold shipped decreased to 
US$1,606. Overall cash cost per tonne mined 
and milled also decreased to US$148 (2012: 
US$179). Further detail on the main drivers 
that led to these increases are contained within 
the Financial Review on pages 18 to 22.

Employees
At the year-end we employed 1,425 individuals 
as either full-time employees or as casual 
labour. Of our workforce 803 are involved in 
direct mining operations, and a further 365 
are involved in engineering support services 
and 77 are involved in the processing of ore. 
The remainder are involved in administration, 
finance, information technology, supply, 
security, and operational health and safety. 
Other Activity
The Group is currently rehabilitating some 
areas of land covered by historical trial mining 
and exploration leases in the state of Cuiaba, 
Brazil. Those areas were being explored for 
diamond prospects up to 2008, at which point 
the Group determined that the area was not 
suitable for a large scale mining operation.

importantly lower production levels. As a result 
the Group posted a loss of £15.7 million.
Revenue
Revenue for the year of £39.1 million was 
29% lower than the prior year period of 
£54.9 million. The Group’s year-on-year 
sales volume decreased by 13,099 ounces, 
which adversely reduced revenue by some 
£13.0 million. In addition to this the reduction 
in gold price from US$1,643 per ounce in the 
previous year to US$1,537 per ounce during 
the period under review reduced revenue by 
some £2.2 million.
Commodity Prices
Gold prices have a significant impact on the 
Group’s revenue, net profits and its ability 
to generate cash flows. In 2013 the price of 
Gold reached US$1,784 in October 2012 and 
traded as low as US$1,192 per ounce in June 
2013. Our average realised gold price was 
US$1,537 per ounce.

Cost of Sales and Operating Expenses 
decreased to £51.7 million in 2013 from 
£61.5 million in 2012. A 34% decrease in 
underground mining costs decreased the cost 
of sales and operating expenses by £11.1 
million. Removing the effect of the reduced 
tonnes mined and processed the reduction 
in costs on a like for like basis is £1.5 million. 
The £1.5 million is explained by the following 
variances:
• a net decrease in unit mining costs which 
represented a £5 million reduction in costs,
• a net decrease in unit milling costs which 
represented a £0.1 million reduction in 
costs,
• a £0.2 million increase in overhead and 
administrative costs,
• decreases in the value of gold shipped 
which reduced the gold duty paid by 
£0.5 million,
• higher amortization and depreciation 
charges of £0.8 million, and
• an increase in unrealised foreign exchange 
losses on intercompany loans of £3 million.
A breakdown of the key drivers behind the increase in cost of sales and operating expenses is shown in the graph below.
As outlined above the variance in unit mining 
costs represented the key driver to the 
decrease in costs compared to the previous 
year. The mining costs totalled £23.5 million 
for the year. This represents a decrease 
of £12.2 million from the prior year period 
(£35.7 million). Taking into account the 
decrease in the ore mined and processed 
which reduced the costs by £7.2 million, the 
decrease in costs can be mainly attributed to:
• a decrease in unit mining costs of 
£7.2 million which can be mainly 
attributable to changes in accounting 
estimates in which the allocation of 
development related overheads between 
operating expenditure and capitalised 
mine properties and development was 
calculated on a per tonne basis. Previously, 
this allocation was calculated on a per 
metre basis. 
• a £1.4 million increase in labour costs. 
This is a result of increased labour and an 
implementation of a bonus system
• a £0.5 million increase in engineering 
higher maintenance costs on heavy 
vehicles
• a £2.6 million increase in power and 
pumping costs mainly due to higher fuel 
costs experienced during the year.
• a £1 million decrease in mining costs 
which is attributable to the higher portion 
of waste dump material mined which has a 
lower mining cost
• expensing the gold in circuit drawn down 
in the period, which decreased compared 
to the previous year and decreased costs 
by £1.1 million

Gold stock movement  143 1,405
Total mining expenses  23,512 35,686
Depreciation and amortisation was £7.3 million 
for the year. This represents an increase of 
12% from the prior year (£6.2 million). This 
increase is due to the higher capital investment 
base employed in late 2011 and in 2012 
as a result of the accelerated development 
programme, capital equipment replacement 
programme and the rate of depreciation when 
compared to older capital development and 
equipment.
During the year we carried out an impairment 
review on some of the previously capitalised 
exploration and evaluation costs which resulted 
in an impairment charge of £3.3 million during 
the period under review.
Cash Costs
Cash costs for the year ending 31 August 
2013 were US$1,606 per ounce sold (2012: 
US$1,627 per ounce). This decrease in cash 
costs can mainly be attributed to the lower unit 
costs per tonne of ore mined, the effect of this 
would have reduced the cash costs per ounce 
to US$1,410. However decreases in recovery 
rates and lower grades increase the cash cost 
to US$1,606.

Administrative Costs
Administrative expenses totalled £2.3 million 
for the year ended August 2013 which was a 
15% decrease in costs from the prior year of 
£2.8 million. The administrative expenses are 
those costs associated with maintaining the 
London office and the administrative expenses 
in Fiji not directly attributable to operating 
activities. Costs include salaries, office rent, 
regulatory, audit, legal fees and investor related 
expenses.
Exploration and Evaluation 
Costs
Given the constrained cash flow during the 
year we substantially reduced exploration 
and evaluation costs to £1.1 million this 
year compared to £4.2 million in 2012. 
All the exploration and evaluation costs 
were capitalised as an Intangible Asset in 
accordance with the requirements of IFRS 
6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral 
Assets. Exploration costs to the amount 
£3,264,000 (2012: Nil) relate to specific 
areas which have not led to the discovery 
of commercially viable quantities of mineral 
resources, and the directors have decided to 
discontinue such activities in those specific 
areas. These costs have been impaired.
Taxation and Other Expenses
During the year the Group had a tax credit 
of £1.2 million (2012: £1.1 million). This tax 
credit arises as a result of the utilisation of the 
deferred tax liability.
Other expenses amounted to £1 million in 
2013 down from £1.5 million in the previous 
year. This decrease was primarily due to a 
reduction in provision against prepayments 
of more than one year which reduced to 
£0.3 million.
EBITDA
EBITDA for the year ended 31 August 2013 
was a loss of £8.9 million compared to a loss 
of £1.5 million in the prior year. This decrease 
was driven by decreases in production and 
lower average gold prices achieved during the 
years; this decrease was partly offset by lower 
mining costs.
Reconciliation between net profit for the period and EBITDA is presented below.

EBITDA (8,977) (1,548)
Basic Loss per Share
Basic loss per share for the year ended 
31 August 2013 was 12.74 pence compared 
to basic loss per share of 7.81 pence for the 
year ended 31 August 2012. This decrease 
was driven by the net loss for the year.
Cash Flow
Net cash used in operating activities was 
£0.1 million for the year, a decrease of 
£6.3 million on the prior year. The net operating 
loss before changes in working capital was 
£2.5 million compared to a net operating 
loss of £0.1 million in the previous year. This 
reduction was due to lower EBITDA. Changes 
in working capital generated £2.4 million 
(2012 generated £6.4 million) this cash was 
generated primarily from the Group decreasing 
its receivables.
Cash flow used in investing activities equated 
to £13.8 million for the year which represents 
a 14% decrease from the prior year of £16.1 
million. Of the £13.8 million used in investing 
activities, £2.2 million (2012: £7.2 million) was 
used in the purchase of plant and equipment 
and £11.7 million (2012: £9.1 million) was used 
in underground development and exploration 
activities. This increase is primarily attributable 
to changes in accounting estimates in 
which the allocation of development related 
overheads between operating expenditure and 
capitalised mine properties and development 
was calculated on a per tonne basis.

Previously, this allocation was calculated on a 
per metre basis.
Cash provided by financing activities for the 
year ended 31 August 2013 was £12.2 million 
(2012: £5.3 million). The large majority 
(£12.4 million) of this relates to equity issues 
completed during the year. At 31 August 2013 
the Group had cash and cash equivalents of 
£0.6 million (2012: £2.4 million).
In November 2013, and subsequent to the 
year end, the Group completed the first 
tranche of the US$40 million dollar financing 
via the placing of 188,897,000 new ordinary 
shares at 6.89 pence per share raising 
approximately £13 million. 
Zhongrun have informed the Group that it 
remains willing and will be able to complete 
the subscription for the secured loan notes. 
However as a result of administrative delays 
Zhongrun and the Group have agreed an 
extension of the time for payment until the end 
of February 2014.
Financial Position
Intangible assets decreased from £36.8 million 
in 2012 to £32.8 million in 2013. The decrease 
is primarily attributable to the impairment 
charge incurred during the period of 
£3.3 million. The net book value of property, 
plant equipment and mine properties and 
development was £43.5 million (2012: 
£37.2 million). The main capital expenditure 
drivers being those outlined in the cash 
flow used in investing in activities section 
above, which were offset by amortisation and 
depreciation charges of £7.3 million (2012: 
£6.6 million).
Total assets decreased from £90.7 million in 
2012 to £86.5 million in 2013. The decrease 
was for the large part due to a 39% decrease 
in current assets, which was driven by 
decreases in trade and other receivables and 
inventories.
During the year the Group reached a 
settlement agreement with FIRCA in relation 
to the £4 million taxation assessment against 
the Group. In the settlement the parties 
agreed that the Group had made advance tax 
payments against this assessment and FRICA 
agreed to refund the Group £0.8 million.
Total current liabilities for the year ended 
31 August 2013 were £11.2 million, a decrease 
of £1.1 million from the balance of £12.3 million 
in 2012. This decrease is primarily driven by 
the decrease in trade payables as we reversed 
the trend of extending creditor terms in the 
previous year. Non-current liabilities decreased 
to £10.3 million from £10.4 million in the 
previous year. This decrease is the net result 
of an increase in employee related and mine 
rehabilitation provisions, and a decrease in the 
Deferred Tax Liability.

Non-IFRS Measures
The Group has identified certain measures in this report that are not measures as defined under IFRS. Non-IFRS financial measures disclosed by the directors and 
management are provided to shareholders as additional information in order to provide them with an alternative method of assessing the Group’s financial condition and 
operating results. These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for IFRS, and may be different from or inconsistent with non-IFRS measures used by other 
companies. These measures are explained below.
Average realised gold price is a non-IFRS financial measure and is calculated by dividing the total revenue for the year by the total ounces sold during the year and 
converting the GB£ value to US$ at the average foreign exchange rate over the year.
EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure. The Group calculates EBITDA as (loss)/profit for the period excluding:
• Income tax credits or expense
• Finance expense
• Finance income
• Depreciation and amortisation charges; and
• Goodwill impairment charges
EBITDA is intended to provide additional information to investors and analysts. It does not have a standard definition under IFRS and other companies may calculate 
EBITDA differently. Refer to page 21 as part of the financial review section for a reconciliation of profit to EBITDA. EBITDA should not be considered a substitute or in 
isolation for measures of performance as prepared in accordance with IFRS, as it excludes the impact of cash costs of financing activities and taxes and the changes of 
working capital balances,
Cash cost per ounce sold/per tonne mined and milled are non-IFRS financial measures. Cash costs include all costs associated with mining and processing the unit 
of measure, inclusive of all costs absorbed into inventory, as well as royalties, production taxes and mine overheads/administrative costs. The cash costs exclude foreign 
exchange gains, depreciation and amortisation expenses, impairment charges, inventory obsolesces, rehabilitation charges, doubtful debts and share based payments. 
These cash costs are aggregated and divided by either ounces of gold shipped or the tonnes mined and milled to reach the relevant non-IFRS financial measure.
Operating cash flow per share is a non-IFRS financial measure and is calculated by dividing the Net cash (used) / generated in operating activities by the weighted 
average number of Ordinary Shares in issue.

Corporate Responsibility
We believe that to operate effectively and 
profitably VGM needs to establish mutually 
beneficial relationships within the community 
that we operate. We need to maintain these 
relationships to help us ensure a stable 
operating environment and allow access to our 
exploration assets.
Community Relations
The Vatukoula Gold Mine has, under previous 
owners, had some issues with its community 
relations. Over the course of 2013 there has 
been an improvement in the relationships 
between our Company and our local 
stakeholders. The key areas of focus for this 
improvement have been:
a) regular engagement with the local 
communities, allowing open and frank 
discussions and respecting stakeholders 
concerns,
b) maximising the communities’ opportunity 
to benefit from employment and local 
procurement; and
c) developing a long-term plan to assist local 
communities to pursue their own socio-
economic priorities.
Some of the main material contributions we 
make to the local community are: the provision 
of subsidised power and water: sponsorship 
of local sporting clubs and events; renovation 
or construction of staff housing and the 
contribution of F$6 million for the establishment 
of the Vatukoula Social Assistance Trust Fund 
(“VSATF).
Management expects that the commencement 
of the provision of assistance from the 
Vatukoula Social Assistance Trust Fund is 
imminent, the Trust implementation documents 
having been approved by the Cabinet of the 
Government of Fiji. The trustees are expected 
to administer the F$6 million dollars of 
assistance contributed by the Group for the 
benefit of those employees still redundant after 
the former owners of the Vatukoula Gold Mine 
ceased operations in December 2006. Under 
principles stipulated by VGM, it is intended 
that the VSATF function as a model for current 
and future mining operations throughout 
Fiji in terms of planning for the sustainable 
livelihoods of mine workers after mine closure 
or downsizing.
Health and Safety
Safety is a top priority for mine management. 
During the year under review we experienced 
a Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (“LTIFR”) 
of 3.34 per 1 million man hours. This is a 
significant improvement on last year’s LTIFR 
of 14.84. This improvement is evidence of 
our continued commitment to improve on the 
mine’s safety performance 
Safety in the workplace is regarded as a 
top priority at all times. We insist that all our 
employees work according to stringent safety 
practices and we are all working toward our 
target of a zero LTIFR.
Environment
We are currently implementing our 
comprehensive environmental policy. A study 
by an independent engineer reviewed our 
policies and procedures and carried out a 
gap analysis against relevant local legislation, 
the IFC Performance Standards, IFC EHS 
General Guidelines and the IFC Mining Sector 
Guidelines. Although the Company was 
either Compliant or Materially Complaint with 
these standards, it has identified areas for 
improvement in the coming year. 
One of the key consumables at the mine 
is energy which currently is provided by 
fossil fuels, and we have been examining 
opportunities to reduce our reliance on diesel 
power generation.

Commodity prices
The Group’s financial performance is 
dependent on the price of gold and 
diesel. Adverse movements in gold 
price and diesel price movements 
could have a material impact on the 
Group’s results and operations
The executive board constantly 
monitors the commodity prices and 
its potential effects on operating 
cash flow and profitability. The 
Group’s strategy however is to 
provide maximum exposure to Gold 
hence no hedging strategies have 
been employed. Long term energy 
hedging will come from sourcing 
another power source that is not 
reliant on diesel.

Costs and capital expenditure
The Group operates in an industry 
which has experienced shortages 
in consumables and capital 
equipment and as such prices can 
vary significantly year on year. These 
variations may adversely affect 
operating cash flow and the Group’s 
financial position
The Group’s management is 
constantly reviewing variation in both 
activity costs and the consumables 
driving them. We will seek to further 
mitigate these costs by entering into 
long-term supply contract where 
possible. In addition management 
carry out cash flow analysis and 
sensitivities to mitigate liquidity risk

Changes in the Mineral Resources between 
2012 and 2013 were the result of reductions 
due to depletion of the models between mining 
face positions at 1 September 2012 and 
31 August 2013 – 75,000 oz Au.
Underground Mineral Resource
AMC Consultants Pty Ltd (“AMC”) completed 
a Mineral Resource estimate for VGM using 
geological and assay data available at 18 May 
2012. The data supplied by VGM allowed AMC 
to generate a constrained grade model and 
estimate a Mineral Resource. AMC estimated 
the Mineral Resources using the end of August 
2013 surveyed face positions.
The VGM Mineral Resource estimate is 
classified into Measured, Indicated, and 
Inferred Mineral Resources based on the 
current drillhole spacing, quality of the drilling 
information and confidence in the geological 
controls on the gold mineralisation and grade 
continuity. The Mineral Resource estimate 
includes Measured and Indicated Mineral 
Resources that will convert to Ore Reserves on 
application of modifying factors.
The information in this statement of 
underground Mineral Resources is based on 
information compiled by Mr John Tyrrell, who 
is a Member of the Australasian Institute of 
Mining and Metallurgy and a full-time employee 
of AMC Consultants Pty Ltd. Mr Tyrrell 
has sufficient relevant experience to be a 
Competent Person as defined by the JORC 
Code. Mr Tyrrell consents to the inclusion of 
this information in the form and context in 
which it appears. Mineral Resources listed as 
being prepared by AMC were estimated under 
the direct supervision of Mr Tyrrell.
The following notes highlight assumptions used 
to generate the Underground VGM Mineral 
Resource estimate:
• An intercept width times gold grade cut-off 
of 4 metre grams per tonne (m.g/t Au) and 
a gold grade cut-off of 2 g/t were applied 
to the resource models to obtain the 
estimated Mineral Resources.
• The Mineral Resource models were 
depleted for mining to 31 August 2013, 
using surveyed mine outlines at 31 August 
2013.
• The Mineral Resource models use 
geological and assay data available at 
18 May 2012.
• Samples are prepared and analysed by 
fire assay using a 25 gram charge at the 
on-site Vatukoula laboratory.
• The mineralised envelope was defined 
using geological logging and assay 
information from diamond drillholes using a 
nominal lower gold cut-off grade of 1 m.g/t 
Au.
• Extrapolation of the interpreted mineralised 
zone was limited to 50 m between section 
lines and 25 m at the end of each section.
• In situ density data were available from 
drillhole sampling. Densities were assigned 
to each of the modelled mineralised 
structures based on the average results 
from all available samples.
• The estimation method used 3D wireframe 
and block modelling projected to a 2D 
plane, with ordinary kriging interpolation. 
A grade variable (the product of the 
intercept width and grade) was estimated 
using modelled semi-variograms and 
geostatistical analysis to determine kriging 
search parameters. The intercept width 
was estimated separately and the grade 
back-calculated.

• Grade times thickness (AUMET) capping 
was applied in calculating the grade times 
thickness variable.
Waikatakata Mineral Resource
The information for the Waikatakata Mineral 
Resource is based on information compiled 
by Mrs Rachael Birch, who is a Member 
of the Australasian Institute of Mining and 
Metallurgy and a full-time employee of AMC 
Consultants Pty Ltd. Mrs Birch has sufficient 
relevant experience to be a Competent Person 
as defined by the JORC Code. Mrs Birch 
consents to the inclusion of this information 
in the form and context in which it appears. 
The Waikatakata Mineral Resource was first 
reported in 2012 and has not changed since.
The following notes highlights assumptions 
used to generate the Waikatakata Mineral 
Resource estimate:
• The Waikatakata Mineral Resource 
estimate was completed in October 2011 
using 11 diamond drillholes and 133 
reverse circulation drillholes for a total 
drilled length of 4,338 m. A twin drillhole 
programme was completed in 2011. Four 
twin diamond drillholes were drilled into the 
broader Waikatakata area
• The Mineral Resource estimate is based 
on the interpretation of mineralised zones 
using a nominal lower gold cut-off grade 
of 0.3 g/t Au. The interpretation was 
constrained within the contact breccia, 
andesite, and tuff units and between 8,400 
m E and 9,500 m E
• All twin drill core samples were prepared 
and assayed at the VGM site laboratory. 
All samples were analysed for gold by fire 
assay on a 50 g charge with AAS finish
• Drillhole samples were composited to 
a dominant length of 1 m. Residual 
composites (less than 1 m) were retained 
for estimation
• A global bulk density value of 2.5 t/m
3
 was 
assigned to the model
• Estimation of gold was completed using 
ordinary kriging with estimation parameters 
derived from modelled semi-variograms
Tailings Mineral Resource
The Tailings Mineral Resource is an estimate 
developed by CSA Group Limited (CSA). In 
March 2008, CSA compiled an independent 
Competent Persons Report (CSA CPR), on 
behalf of River Diamonds, for inclusion in the 
application for readmission to trading on the 
Alternative Investment Market (AIM) of the 
London Stock Exchange.
The CSA CPR reported the 2006 Mineral 
Resources, including the Tailings Mineral 
Resource, according to the JORC Code. No 
further estimates or data is available at the time 
of this report. AMC cannot verify the estimate 
and allocates a low reliability to the estimate.
The Tailings Mineral Resource is approximately 
10% of the total Measured and Indicated 
Mineral Resources at VGM. AMC believes that 
the Tailings Mineral Resource may provide 
an opportunity to improve the output of the 
operation, but also believes the relevance of 
the Tailings Mineral Resource is low. VGM 
plans to review the tailings resource, in 
conjunction with the results of exploration 
programs currently under way, to determine 
the preferred means to extract the contained 
gold. VGM production plans do not include the 
Tailings Mineral Resource pending this review 
and conversion of Mineral Resources to Ore 
Reserves.

Total Ore Reserve    3.01 7.768 0.75 3.2 7.71 0.79
Note: Values are rounded and may not add correctly in this table.
The following notes highlight assumptions used 
to estimate the Ore Reserve:
• The Ore Reserve includes that part of the 
Mineral Resource that can be economically 
mined and includes the allowed dilution.
• A gold price of US$1,300/oz and 
Exchange rate of F$1.00 = US$0.55.
• Cut-off grade of 4.63 g/t Au.
• Minimum stope mining width of 1.07 m.
• 10% stope and development mining 
dilution.
• 95% mining recovery in development 
headings.
• 85% mining recovery in stopes.
• The metallurgical response for the ore 
bodies is well understood from actual 
production. No additional recovery factors 
were applied to the Ore Reserve estimate.
The Ore Reserve statement is based on mine 
design information prepared in 2012 under the 
supervision of Mr David Lee, who is a fulltime 
employee of AMC. The 2012 mining models 
were depleted with 31 August 2013 face 
positions to estimate the new Ore Reserve. 
The depletions were carried out by Mr Kevin 
Oborne, who is a full-time employee of 
VGMPLC, and reviewed by Mr Lee. Mr Oborne 
is a Member and Mr Lee is a Fellow of the 
Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy. 
Mr Lee has sufficient relevant experience to be 
a Competent Person as defined by the JORC 
Code.
The reduction in 2013 Ore Reserve estimate 
from the 2012 Ore Reserve estimate is mainly 
attributable to:
• the change in cut-off grade (12,000 
ounces)
• mining depletion between mining faces at 
1  September 2012 and 31 August 2013 
(30,000 ounces)
The method used to determine the 2013 Ore 
Reserve estimate required stopes to be split 
into panels to allow some stopes to be partially 
mined, such that only the panels with an ore 
reserve classification were considered. Access 
development to the ore reserve stopes was 
added to the mine plan if the panel met the Ore 
Reserve classification.
Independent reviews of the process plant, 
tailings facilities and environmental status were 
conducted by independent consultants for 
the 2010 Ore Reserve report. These reviews 
established that the operation at that time 
was fit for purpose and the facilities are in a 
condition suitable to enable recovery of the Ore 
Reserves of the project. 
Major recommendations highlighted in this 
report include:
• Further work is required to improve the 
efficiency of the processing plant – to be 
completed by existing VGM staff.
• Design and construction of the Toko West 
tailings dam to provide sufficient capacity. 
Budget cost F$7.8M.
• Adoption of the proposed environmental 
management system and associated 
management plans – to be developed by 
existing VGM staff
• Development of a comprehensive 
exploration program to replace Mineral 
Resources depleted over the past 10 years 
– Budget cost F$15.6M
The conclusions of reviews conducted by 
independent consultants on the process plant, 
tailings storage facilities and environmental 
issues indicate that applying modifying factors 
should result in no change to the confidence 
level of the Ore Reserves when converted 
from Mineral Resources. Work on these 
recommendations continues.
AMC is not aware of any significant changes 
to the operation since the independent reviews 
were conducted. AMC believes at this time 
that additional work is required to improve 
operational efficiency at VGM, but this is not 
likelyto impede economic extraction of the Ore 
Reserves.

The directors are pleased to present this year’s 
annual report together with the consolidated 
and company financial statements for the year 
ended 31 August 2013.
Principal activities
The principal activity of the Group was the 
operation of the Vatukoula Gold Mine in Fiji as 
described on page 1 of the Business Review. 
The principal activity of the Company was 
that of a holding Company for its subsidiary 
undertakings, which are set out in Note 15 of 
the financial statements.
Results and dividends
The loss on ordinary activities of the Group for 
the year ended 31 August 2013 after taxation 
was 15.7 million (2012: loss of £7.1 million).
The directors do not recommend the payment 
of a dividend (2012: nil).
Business review
A review of the current and future development 
of the Group’s business is given in the 
Business Review section of this report on 
pages 1 to 29.
Given the nature of business and industry 
the key performance indicators are based on 
financial and operational objectives set at the 
beginning of the year. Performance in relation 
to these is highlighted on pages 14 and 15.
The Business Review sets out a 
comprehensive review of the development 
and performance of VGM’s business for the 
year ended 31 August 2013 and the future 
developments. The Business Review is set 
out on pages 1 to 29 of this annual report. 
All information detailed in these pages is 
incorporated by reference into this Directors’ 
Report and is deemed to form part of this 
Directors’ Report.
Corporate Governance 
Statement
The corporate governance statement set out 
on page 37 is incorporated by reference into 
this Directors’ Report and is deemed to form 
part of this Directors’ Report.
Post balance sheet events
At the date these financial statements were 
approved, being 3 February 2014, the 
directors were not aware of any significant post 
balance sheet events other than those set out 
in Note 33 of the financial statements.
Future developments
A review of our future developments is given in 
the Review by the Chairman on pages 6 to 7.
Financial risk management
The Group’s operations expose it to financial 
risks that include liquidity risk, interest rate and 
foreign exchange risk. The Group does not use 
derivative financial instruments to manage any 
of these risks nor is hedge accounting applied. 
The Group depends on the Vatukoula Gold 
Mine for a substantial portion of its revenue 
and cash flow and, therefore, the Group’s 
business will be harmed if the Vatukoula Gold 
Mines’s revenues are adversely affected. 
A review of this risk is given in our Risk 
Management section on page 24.
Given the size of the Group, the directors 
have not delegated the responsibility of 
monitoring financial risk management to a 
sub-committee of the board. The Group’s 
finance department implements the policies set 
by the board of directors. Further details of the 
Group’s exposure to risks arising from financial 
instruments held are provided in note 25.
Liquidity risk
The Group actively manages its working 
finance to ensure the Group has sufficient

funds for current operations. As referred to 
in Note 3 of the financial statements, it is 
for this reason that the directors believe it is 
appropriate to prepare the financial statements 
on a going concern basis.
Interest rate cash flow risk
Interest bearing assets are only cash balances 
that earn interest at a floating rate. The Group 
does not have any variable rate debt and 
therefore it is not exposed to interest rate cash 
flow risk on its debt.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates in Fiji and Brazil. The 
board has assessed its exposure foreign 
exchange risk, the details of which are 
provided in note 25(i). This situation is 
monitored on a regular basis, and as such the 
directors do not currently consider it necessary 
to enter into forward exchange contracts.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to 
the Group if a customer or counter party 
to a financial instrument, fails to meet its 
contractual obligations, and arises principally 
from the Group’s receivables from customers. 
The Group has credit risk management policies 
in place and exposures to credit risk are 
monitored on an ongoing basis. Management 
generally adopts conservative strategies and a 
tight control on credit policy.
Directors’ insurance
The Company has taken out an insurance 
policy to indemnify the directors and officers of 
the Company against liability when acting for 
the Group.

practice. However, it is the Company’s policy 
to agree appropriate terms and conditions 
for its transactions with suppliers, to ensure 
that the suppliers are made aware of those 
terms and, provided the supplier has complied 
with its obligations, to abide by the terms of 
payment agreed. Trade creditor days of the 
Group for the year ended 31 August 2013 
were 74 days (2012: 69 days).
Related Party Transactions
Details of related party transactions during 
the year are set out at note 27 to the financial 
statements.
Going concern
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking 
account of reasonable possible changes in 
gold price, mining costs and the concentration 
of the gold in the ore delivered to the mill show 
that the Group should be able to operate using 
its current cash position and financing facilities. 
After making enquiries, the directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing the annual financial 
statements.
Subsequent to the year end the Group 
completed the first tranche of the 
US$40 million dollar financing via the placing 
of 188,897,000 new ordinary shares at 
6.89 pence per share. Included in the Group’s 
forecasts and projections is the completion 
and drawdown of the US$20 million secured 
loan notes agreed with Zhongrun. 
Zhongrun have informed the Group that it 
remains willing and will be able to complete 
the subscription for the secured loan notes. 
However as a result of administrative delays 
Zhongrun and the Group have agreed an 
extension of the time for payment until the end 
of February 2014. 
Further details are provided in note 3.
Auditor
In accordance with Section 489 of the 
Companies Act 2006, a resolution proposing 
that Mazars LLP be re-appointed will be put to 
the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Directors’ responsibilities in 
the preparation of financial 
statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the 
directors’ report and the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable laws and 
regulations. Company law requires the 
directors to prepare the financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the 
directors have elected to prepare the financial 
statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as 
adopted by the European Union and applicable 
law. Under Company law the directors must 
not approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Company 
and the Group and of the profit and loss of 
the Company and the Group for that period. 
In preparing the financial statements, directors 
are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable, 
comparable, understandable and prudent;
• state whether IFRS as adopted by the 
European Union have been followed 
subject to any material departure disclosed 
and explained in the financial statements;
• provide additional disclosures when 
compliance with specific requirments 
in IFRS is insufficient to enable users 
to conclude the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and condition of 
the entities’ financial position and financial 
performance; and
• prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Group 
will continue in business
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the Company’s’ 
transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of 
the Company and the Group and to enable

them to ensure that the financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. The 
directors are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the Company and the Group 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other 
irregularities.
The directors are also responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the Group’s 
website on the internet. However, information 
is accessible in many different countries 
where legislation governing preparation 
and documentation of financial statements 
may differ from that applicable in the United 
Kingdom.
Disclosure of information to 
auditors
Each of the directors in office at the date of 
approval of the annual report confirms that so 
far as they are aware there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditor is 
unaware and that each director has taken all 
the steps which they ought to have taken as 
directors it order to make themselves aware of 
that information.

Corporate Governance  
Statement
Compliance with UK Corporate 
Governance Code 
The directors recognise the value of the 
Combined Code on Corporate Governance 
that was issued in September 2012 by the 
Financial Reporting Council. Under AIM rules 
full compliance is not required. Therefore the 
Company has not adopted the Combined 
Code 2012, but the directors recognise 
the good principles that are set out within 
the Code and hence have chosen to follow 
some of principles which are relevant to 
the Company, the directors believe that the 
Company applies the Main Principles insofar 
as is practicable and appropriate for a public 
company of its size.
Outlined below is a summary of how the 
Company follows the Main Principles set out in 
the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Board of Directors
The board of directors comprises one 
executive director, and six non-executive 
directors, one of whom is the Chairman. The 
directors are of the opinion that the board 
comprises a suitable balance and that the 
recommendations of the Combined Code have 
been implemented to an appropriate level. The 
board, through the Chief Executive Officer, 
maintains regular contact with its advisers and 
public relations consultants in order to ensure 
that the board develops an understanding 
of the views of major shareholders about the 
Company.
Board Meetings
In addition to ad hoc meetings arranged to 
discuss particular transactions and events and 
the AGM, the full board met five times during 
the year ending 31 August 2013. The board 
is responsible for formulating, reviewing and 
approving the Company’s strategy, financial 
activities and operating performance. Day to 
day management is devolved to the executive 
directors who are charged with consulting the 
board on all significant financial and operational 
matters. Consequently decisions are made 
promptly and following consultation amongst 
the directors concerned where necessary and 
appropriate.
All necessary information is supplied to the 
directors on a timely basis to enable them 
to discharge their duties effectively, and 
all directors have access to independent 
professional advice, at the Company’s 
expense, as and when required.
The Chief Executive Officer is available to meet 
with institutional shareholders to discuss any 
issues and concerns regarding the Group’s 
governance. The non-executive directors can 
also attend meetings with major shareholders 
if requested.
The participation of both private and 
institutional investors at the Annual General 
Meeting is welcomed by the board.
Internal controls
The directors acknowledge their responsibility 
for the Company’s and the Group’s systems 
of internal control, which are designed to 
safeguard the assets of the Group and ensure 
the reliability of financial information for both 
internal use and external publication. Overall 
control is ensured by a regular detailed 
reporting system covering both technical 
progress of a project and the state of the 
Group’s financial affairs. The board has put in 
place procedures for identifying, evaluating and 
managing any significant risks that face the 
Group.
Any system of internal control can provide only 
reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that 
material financial irregularities will be detected 
or that the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives is eliminated. The directors, having 
reviewed the effectiveness of the system of 
internal financial, operational and compliance 
controls and risk management, consider 
that the system of internal control operated 
effectively throughout the financial year and 
up to the date the financial statements were 
signed.
Committees
Each of the following committees has its own 
terms of reference.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises three non-
executive directors, Yongan Lu, Yeung Ng and 
Yinbing Ian He. Its terms of reference indicate 
at least two regular meetings per year. Given 
the board changes during the year and the 
various directors induction required, the audit 
committee met once during the year. The 
Audit Committee’s primary responsibilities are 
to review the effectiveness of the Company’s 
systems of internal control, to review with 
the external auditors the nature and scope of 
their audit and the results of the audit, and to 
evaluate and select external auditors.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises three 
non-executive directors, John MacPherson, 
Yeung Ng, Fengwen Zheng. It plans to meet 
at least twice in each year. The Remuneration 
Committee did not meet during the year. 
The Company’s policy is to remunerate 
senior executives fairly in such a manner 
as to facilitate the recruitment, retention 
and motivation of staff. The Remuneration 
Committee agrees with the board a framework 
for the remuneration of the chairman, 
the executive directors and the senior 
management of the Company. The principal 
objective of the Committee is to ensure that 
members of the executive management of 
the Company are provided incentives to 
encourage enhanced performance and are, 
in a fair and responsible manner, rewarded for 
their individual contributions to the success 
of the Company. Non-executive fees are 
considered and agreed by the board as a 
whole.

1. General information
Vatukoula Gold Mines plc. is registered in England and Wales under number 5059077. The Company is governed by its articles of association and 
the principal statute governing the Company is the Companies Act 2006. The Company’s registered office is situated at Level 5, 2 More London 
Riverside, London, SE1 2AR. The Company is listed on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange.
The nature of the Group’s and Company’s operations and principal activities are set out in the Directors’ Report on page 32.
2. Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of Vatukoula Gold Mines plc. and all its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis. The consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds 
Sterling (GBP) and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (£’000) except when otherwise indicated.
The principal accounting policies adopted by the Group and Company in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below.
The Board has reviewed the accounting policies set out in the financial statements and considers them to be most appropriate to the Group’s 
business.
These financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling. Group revenues are in US Dollars. Given that the Fijian dollar is not widely used as a 
reporting currency and that the parent company is listed in the United Kingdom it is deemed appropriate for the presentation currency of the Group 
to be in Pound Sterling.
Statement of Compliance with IFRS
The Group’s and Company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS and 
interpretations) as adopted by the European Union.
New accounting standards
The Group and Company adopted IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’– Transfers of Financial Assets’. There was no impact from the 
adoption of this standard as the Group did not transfer any financial instruments during the year.
There was no material effect of other IFRS’s, IAS’s and IFRIC’s that came into effect in the year, as these new or amended standards, amendments 
and interpretations did not apply to operations of the Group and the Company.
The Group and the Company have not applied the following standard, amendments and interpretations that are applicable and have been issued, 
but are not yet effective.

applications. 
3. Summary of significant accounting policies
(a) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial information incorporates the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries (the “Group”). Control is achieved 
where the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns 
through its power over the investee.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated; unrealised losses are also 
eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used in line with those used by 
the Group.
(b) Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Business 
Review section of this report. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the financial 
review. In addition note 25 to the financial statements include the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, its financial risk 
management objectives and details of its financial instruments and it its exposure to credit and liquidity risk.
In assessing the Group’s going concern the Directors have taken into account the above factors, including the financial position of the Group and in 
particular its cash position, the current gold price and market expectation for the same over the medium term, and the Group’s capital expenditure 
and financing plans.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonable possible changes in gold price, mining costs and the concentration of the gold 
in the ore delivered to the mill show that the Group should be able to operate using its current cash position and financing facilities. The directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.
2. Basis of preparation (continued)

www.vgmplc.com
Subsequent to the year end the Group completed the first tranche of the US$40 million dollar financing via the placing of 188,897,000 new ordinary 
shares at 6.89 pence per share. Included in the Group’s forecasts and projections is the completion and drawdown of the US$20 million secured 
loan notes agreed with Zhongrun. 
Zhongrun have informed the Group that it remains willing and will be able to complete the subscription for the secured loan notes. However as a 
result of administrative delays Zhongrun and the Group have agreed an extension of the time for payment until the end of February 2014.
(c) Business combinations
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of the acquisition is measured as 
the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of the assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the 
Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in administrative expenses. The acquiree’s 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” are recognised 
at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with 
IFRS 5 “Non Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations”, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Where there is a difference between the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
and the cost of the business combination, any excess cost is recognised in the statement of financial position as goodwill and any excess net fair 
value is recognised immediately in the profit or loss as negative goodwill on acquisition of subsidiary. The non-controlling interest in the acquiree is 
initially measured as the non-controlling interest proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
(d) Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
Judgments
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgments, apart from those involving estimations 
and assumptions, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements
(i) Mineral Resources and Reserves
Quantification of mineral resources requires a judgement on the reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. Quantification of ore 
reserves requires a judgement on whether mineral resources are economically mineable. These judgements are based on the assessment of 
mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors involved, in accordance with the Australasian 
Code for Reporting Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves. These factors are a source of uncertainty and changes could 
result in an increase or decrease in mineral resources and ore reserves. This would in turn affect certain amounts in the financial statements 
such as amortisation, rehabilitation provisions which are calculated on a projected life of mine figures.
(ii) Provisions and Contingent Liabilities (notes 21 & 30)
Judgements are made as to whether a past event has led to a liability that should be recognised in the financial statements or disclosed as 
a contingent liability. Quantifying any such liability often involves judgements and estimations. These judgements are based on a number of 
factors including the nature of the claim or dispute, the legal process and potential amount payable, legal advice received, previous experience 
and the probability of a loss being realised. Several of these factors are a source of estimation uncertainty.
(iii) Inventory Valuations
Valuations of gold stockpiles, gold in circuit and gold within the fine ore bin requires estimations of the amount contained in, and the recovery 
rates from, the various work in progress gold circuits. These estimations are based on analysis of samples and prior experience. A judgement 
is also applied when the gold in circuit will be recovered and what gold price should be applied in calculating the net realisable value; these are 
both sources of uncertainty.
(iv) Income taxes (see note 9)
The Group is subject to income taxes in the United Kingdom, Fiji and Brazil. Significant judgement is required in determining the worldwide 
provision for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the 
ordinary course of business. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such 
differences will impact the current and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.
Estimates and Assumptions
The preparation of financial statements requires the application of estimates and assumptions on future events, which affects assets and liabilities 
at the reporting date and income and expenditure for the period. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. 
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period 
of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

The key estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of certain assets and 
liabilities within the next annual reporting period are:
(v) Share-based payment transactions (see note 19)
The Group measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date 
at which they are granted. The fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes model. The Black-Scholes model is particularly sensitive to 
expected volatility. Therefore any change in the methodology of the calculation of volatility will impact the amount expensed as share based 
payments on the statement of comprehensive income.
The value expensed in the statement of comprehensive income is £185,000 (2012: £627,000).
(vi) Intangible assets (see note 12)
Amortisation
Intangible assets (other than goodwill) are amortised over their useful lives. Useful lives are based on management’s estimates of the period 
that the assets will generate revenue, which are periodically reviewed for continued appropriateness. Due to the long lives of assets, changes 
to the estimates used can result in significant variances in the carrying value.
The Group assesses the impairment of intangible assets subject to amortisation or depreciation whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors considered important that could trigger an impairment review include the 
following:
– significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results;
– significant changes in the manner of the use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business; and 
– significant negative industry or economic trends.
The complexity of the estimation process and issues related to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent in the application of the 
Group’s accounting estimates in relation to intangible assets affect the amounts reported in the financial statements, especially the estimates 
of the expected useful economic lives and the carrying values of those assets. If business conditions were different, or if different assumptions 
were used in the application of this and other accounting estimates, it is likely that materially different amounts could be reported in the Group’s 
financial statements. In particular it would affect, the value of the intangible asset and rehabilitation provisions.
The carrying value at the reporting date of the intangible assets is £32,758,000 (2012: £36,841,000).
(vii) Mine Rehabilitation Provisions (see note 21)
The Mine Rehabilitation provision requires a judgement on likely future obligations, based on assessment of technical, legal and economic 
factors. The ultimate cost of environmental remediation is uncertain and cost estimates can vary in response to many factors, including 
changes in the relevant legal requirements, the emergence of new restoration techniques and changes to the life of mine. Changes to any of 
these costs will affect amounts in the financial statements, such as the mine asset and the provision for mine rehabilitation.
The carrying value at the reporting date of the mine rehabilitation provision is £4,660,000 (2012: £3,247,000).
(viii) Allowance for doubtful debts (see note 17)
Each receivable balance is assessed to determine recoverability. Provisions are made for those debtors where evidence indicates that 
recoverability is doubtful. Amounts are written off when they are deemed irrecoverable. Any changes to estimates made in relation to debtors 
recoverability may result in materially different amounts being reported by the Group’s financial statements. In particular any changes will affect 
trade and other receivable as well as the statement of comprehensive income.
The carrying value at the reporting date of the provision for doubtful debts is £520,000 (2012: £3,913,000).
(e) Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised when persuasive evidence exists that all of the following criteria are met:
• the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the product have been transferred to the buyer;
• neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership, nor effective control over the goods sold has been 
retained;
• the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
• it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the sale will flow to the Group; and
• the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the sale can be measured reliably.

www.vgmplc.com
Gold doré sales
The transfer of risks and rewards for the sale of the gold doré is assessed as taking place when the physical possession is passed to the customer 
upon collection of the gold doré from the mining premises. The customer does not have any right of return subsequent to the physical transfer, and 
accordingly at this point revenue is recognised.
Finance revenue
Interest revenue is recognised as interest accrues using the effective interest rate method. This is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a 
financial asset and allocating the interest income over the relevant period using the effective interest rate, which is the rate that exactly discounts 
estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.
(f) Turnover and Segmental Analysis
The reportable segments identified make up all of the Group’s external revenue, which is derived primarily from the sale of gold. The reportable 
segments are an aggregation of the operating segments within the Group as prescribed by IFRS 8. The reportable segments are based on the 
Group’s management structures and the consequent reporting to the Chief Operating Decision Maker, the Board of Directors. Our sector results 
are attributable to unallocated head office corporate costs, gold production & exploration costs, and other costs. These reportable segments also 
correspond to geographical locations such that each reportable segment is in a separate geographic location, i.e.; unattributed head office costs – 
UK, gold mining – Fiji, other activities – Brazil.
Income and expenses included in profit or loss for the year are allocated directly or indirectly to the reportable segments. Expenses allocated as 
either directly or indirectly attributable comprise: cost of sales, gold duty and administrative expenses.
Non-current segment assets comprise the non-current assets used directly for segment operations, including intangible assets, property, plant and 
equipment and mine properties and development.
Current segment assets comprise the current assets used directly for segment operations, including inventories, trade receivables, other receivables 
and pre-payments.
Inter-company balances comprise transactions between operating segments making up the reportable segments. These balances are eliminated to 
arrive at the figures in the consolidated accounts.
(g) The Company’s investments in subsidiaries
In its separate financial statements the Company recognises its investments in subsidiaries at cost, less any provision for impairment. Differences 
arising from changes in fair values of intercompany loans receivable at below market rates of interest are treated as an increase in the investment in 
the subsidiary.
(h) Foreign currency
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling (“£”), which is the parent company’s functional currency and the Group’s 
presentation currency. Each entity in the Group determines it own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity 
are measured using that functional currency. The assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into the presentation currency of Vatukoula 
Gold Mines plc. at the rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date and their Statements of Comprehensive Income are translated at the average 
exchange rate for the year. The exchange differences arising on the translation are taken directly to a separate component of equity.
All other differences arising on translation are included in the profit or loss except for exchange differences arising on non-monetary assets and 
liabilities where the changes in fair values are recognised directly in equity. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated 
at the closing rate.
Exchange differences recognised in profit or loss of Group entities’ separate financial statements on the translation of long-term monetary items 
forming part of the Group’s net investment in the overseas operation concerned are reclassified to the foreign exchange reserve. On disposal of 
a foreign operation, the cumulative exchange differences recognised in the foreign exchange reserve relating to that operation up to the date of 
disposal are transferred to the Statements of Comprehensive Income as part of the profit or loss.
(i) Goodwill on acquisition
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary or jointly controlled entity represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest 
in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the subsidiary or jointly controlled entity recognised at the date of 
acquisition. Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from synergies of 
the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is 
an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the 
impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata 
on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.
(j) Inventories
Ore stock, consisting of stocks on which further processing is required to convert them to trading stocks and gold doré, is valued at the lower of 
cost and net realisable value. Cost is calculated using a weighted average cost model, where inventories are valued at the weighted average cost of 
the closing inventory. Net realisable value is estimated selling price less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Other inventories include:
(i) Stores, comprising plant spares and consumable stores are valued on the basis of weighted average cost after providing for obsolescence.
(ii) Work in progress is valued on the basis of first in first out and includes direct costs, depreciation and amortisation.
(iii) Insurance spares are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Insurance spares are critical spare parts to equipment, that although 
may not be required on a regular basis are kept in inventory because, should a particular piece of equipment fail it would materially adversely 
affect production.
Gold in circuit
Gold in circuit is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct material, labour and transportation expenditure incurred 
in getting inventories to their existing location and condition, together with an appropriate portion of fixed and variable overhead expenditure based 
on weighted average costs incurred during the period in which such inventories were produced. Net realisable value is the amount anticipated to be 
realised from the sale of inventory in the normal course of business less any anticipated costs to be incurred prior to its sale.
(k) Intangible assets
Acquired intangible assets, which consist of mining rights and intangible computer software, are valued at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation for both types of intangibles is calculated using the units of production method which is calculated over the life span of the mine. As at 
31 August 2013, the estimated remaining life span of the mine is 7 years. This is the entire period over which the mine is currently being amortised.
The Group applies the full cost method of accounting for exploration and evaluation costs, having regard to the requirements of IFRS 6 ‘Exploration 
for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources’. All costs associated with mining development and investment are capitalised on a project by project 
basis pending determination of the feasibility of the project. Such expenditure comprises appropriate technical and administrative expenses but not 
general overheads.
Such exploration and evaluation costs are capitalised provided that the Group’s rights to tenure are current and one of the following conditions is 
met:
(i) such costs are expected to be recouped through successful development and exploitation of the area of interest or alternatively by its sale; or 
(ii) the activities have not reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of whether or not economically recoverable resources exist; or
(iii) active and significant operations in relation to the area are continuing.
When an area of interest is abandoned or the directors decide that it is not commercial, any exploration and evaluation costs previously capitalised 
in respect of that area are written off to profit or loss. Amortisation does not take place until production commences in these areas. Once production 
commences, amortisation is calculated on the unit of production method, over the remaining life of the mine. 
Impairment assessments are carried out regularly by the directors. Exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment when facts and 
circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may exceed its recoverable amount. Such indicators include the point at which a determination is 
made as to whether or not commercial reserves exist. 
The recoverability of capitalised mining costs and mining interests is dependent upon the discovery of economically recoverable reserves, the ability 
of the Company to obtain necessary financing to complete the development of reserves and future profitable production or proceeds from the 
disposition of recoverable reserves.

www.vgmplc.com
The assets’ residual value and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date. An asset’s carrying value is written down 
immediately to its recoverable value if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its listed recoverable amount.
(l) Tangible assets
(i) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Cost is the fair value 
of consideration given to acquire the asset at the time of its acquisition or construction and includes the direct cost of bringing the asset to the 
location and condition necessary for operation and the estimated future cost of closure and rehabilitation of the facility. Depreciation is provided 
on all tangible assets to write down the cost less estimated residual value of each asset over its useful economic life on a units of production 
method or straight line basis. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Freehold land Not depreciated
Plant and machinery Over 3 – 10 years
Mine Asset Life of mine basis
Motor vehicles Over 3 years
Fixtures, fittings and equipment Over 4 years
Work in progress Not depreciated
The depreciation charge for each period is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Assets in the course of construction are capitalised in the Work in Progress account. The cost comprises its purchase price and any costs 
directly attributable to bringing it into working condition for its intended use, at which point it is transferred to property, plant and equipment 
and depreciation commences.
Subsequent expenditure relating to an item of property, plant and equipment is capitalised when it is probable that future economic benefits 
from the use of the asset will be increased. All other subsequent expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Repairs and maintenance which neither materially add to the value of assets nor appreciably prolong their useful lives are charged against 
income.
The gain or loss arising from the de-recognition of any items of property, plant and equipment is included in the profit or loss when the item 
is de-recognised. The gain or loss arising from the de-recognition of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of the item. The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are 
reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
(ii) Mine properties and development (“MPD”) 
This represents the accumulated exploration, evaluation, development and acquisition expenditure in relation to areas of interest in which 
economically recoverable reserves exist.
Development costs that can be capitalised fall into the following categories:
• Initial Capital Development
This includes, but is not restricted to the following:
o Shaft sinking
o Station (plant) development & underground workshops
o Pump station and dams
o Ore and waste pass systems
• Primary Capital Development

• Secondary Capital Development
This is the development carried out within an area in which the primary development has been completed and which is critical to the 
continued operation of the mine or mining area. It includes, but is not restricted to the following:
o Airways, crosscuts and drives
o Pump stations
The capitalised value of mine properties is depreciated on a life of mine basis. The life of mine has been calculated on a units of production method 
based on economically recoverable reserves and resources. The depreciation for the period is calculated using the following:
 Delivered gold ounces during the period X Net book value at the 
 Total estimated delivered ounces  beginning of the period plus costs 
 over the Life of Mine  capitalised during the period
The net carrying value of mine assets is reviewed regularly and, to the extent to which this amount exceeds its recoverable amount (based on the 
higher of estimated future net cash flows and the mine’s asset’s current realisable value) that excess is fully provided against in the financial year in 
which this is determined.
(m) Provision for mine rehabilitation
A provision for rehabilitation is initially recognised at the present value of expected future cash flows when there exists a constructive obligation for 
the entity to undertake rehabilitation at the mine site. When provisions for closure and rehabilitation are initially recognised, the corresponding cost is 
capitalised as an asset, representing part of the cost of acquiring the future economic benefits of the operation. The capitalised cost of closure and 
rehabilitation activities is recognised in property, plant and equipment and depreciated accordingly. The increase in the provision for rehabilitation 
relating to the unwinding of the discount on the provision to the date of settlement of the provision and the depreciation of the rehabilitation asset are 
recorded within profit or loss.
(n) Impairment of intangible and tangible assets excluding goodwill
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, or when 
annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount 
is the higher of the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless 
the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets and the asset’s value in use 
cannot be estimated to be close to its fair value. In such cases the asset is tested for impairment as part of the cash-generating unit to which 
it belongs. When the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset or cash-generating unit is 
considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risk specific to the asset. Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised 
in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount (in which case 
the impairment is treated as a revaluation decrease). An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that 
previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated, 
a previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable 
amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. 
That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been 
recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in profit or loss unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the 
reversal is treated as a revaluation increase. After such a reversal the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset’s revised 
carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
(o) Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments and on 
a trade date basis. A financial asset is derecognised when the Group’s contractual rights to future cash flows from the financial asset expire or 
when the Group transfers the contractual rights to future cash flows to a third party. A financial liability is derecognised only when the liability is 
extinguished.

a. Trade and other receivables and other assets
Trade and other receivables and other assets are measured at initial recognition at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest rate method. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
b. Cash and cash equivalents
For purposes of the consolidated statement of financial position and consolidated statement of cash flows, the Group considers all highly liquid 
investments which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and have a maturity of three months or less when acquired to be cash 
equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, and short term deposits with an original maturity of three months 
or less, all of which are available for use by the Group unless otherwise stated.
c. Investments
Investments included as financial assets are valued at fair value and are held as available for sale. When available for sale assets are considered 
to be impaired, cumulative gains or losses previously recognised in equity are reclassified to the profit or loss in the period.
d. Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. The Group’s 
financial liabilities include trade and other payables, bank loans, other borrowings, convertible loans and obligations under finance leases. All 
financial liabilities, are recognised initially at their fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the 
financial liability and subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, unless the effect of discounting would be 
insignificant, in which case they are stated at cost.
e. Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Other financial liabilities are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
f. Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including 
premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis to the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are 
not settled in the period in which they arise.
g. Trade payables, provisions and other payables
Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at cost. Other payables which are interest-bearing are measured at fair value. Provisions 
are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligations, and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. Provisions are measured at fair 
value. Provision has been made in the financial statements for benefits accruing in respect of sick leave, annual leave, and long service leave.
h. Compound financial instruments
Compound financial instruments issued by the Group comprise convertible loan notes that can be converted to share capital at the option of 
the holder, and the number of shares to be issued does not vary with changes in their fair value.
The liability component of a compound financial instrument is recognised initially at the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an 
equity conversion option. The equity component is recognised initially at the difference between the fair value of the compound financial 
instrument as a whole and the fair value of the liability component. Any directly attributable transaction costs are allocated to the liability and 
equity components in proportion to their initial carrying amounts.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the liability component of a financial instrument is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method. The equity component of a compound financial instrument is not re-measured subsequent to initial recognition except on conversion 
or expiry.
(p) Financing costs and interest income
Financing costs comprise interest payable on borrowings and finance lease payments and interest income which is calculated using the effective 
interest rate method.
(q) Impairment of financial assets
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is objective evidence that financial assets, other than those at fair value through profit 
or loss, are impaired. The impairment loss of financial assets carried at amortised cost is measured as the difference between the assets’ carrying 
amounts and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rates.

(r) Share Capital
Ordinary shares are recorded at nominal value and proceeds received in excess of nominal value of shares issued, if any, are accounted for as share 
premium. Both ordinary shares and share premium are classified as equity. Costs incurred directly relating to the issue of shares are accounted for as 
a deduction from share premium, otherwise they are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
(s) Taxation
Tax on profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income except to the 
extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. 
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the 
amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect 
neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that 
they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or 
settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be 
utilised.
(t) Share-based payments
The Company operates a share option scheme for granting share options, for the purpose of providing incentives and rewards to eligible employees 
of the Group. The cost of share options granted is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted.
Non-market performance and service conditions are included in the assumptions about the number of options expected to vest. The total expense 
is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied.
At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-market 
vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to the original estimate, if any, in the statement of comprehensive income with a 
corresponding adjustment to equity.
When the options are exercised, the Company issues new shares. The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transactions costs are 
credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium. 
(u) Contingent liabilities and contingent assets
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will only be confirmed by the occurrence or non-
occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group. It can also be a present obligation arising from past 
events that is not recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of economic resources will be required or the amount of obligation cannot be 
measured reliably.
A contingent liability is not recognised but is disclosed in the notes to the accounts. When a change in the probability of an outflow occurs so that 
the outflow is probable, it will then be recognised as a provision.
A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence 
of one or more uncertain events not wholly within the control of the Group.
Contingent assets are not recognised but are disclosed in the notes to the accounts when an inflow of economic benefits is probable. When an 
inflow is virtually certain, an asset is recognised.
(v) Leased assets
Operating lease: Operating lease payments are recognised as an operating expense in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Finance lease: Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, 
are capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease 
payments. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest 
on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are recognised in finance costs in profit or loss.

(w) Employee benefits
a. Short-term benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed in profit or loss as the related service is 
provided.
b. Long-term employee benefits
Obligations in respect of long-term employee benefits such as long service leave is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in 
return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value.
c. Termination benefits
Termination benefits are recognised as an expense when the Group is demonstrably committed, without realistic probability of withdrawal, to 
a formal detailed plan to either terminate employment before the normal retirement date, or to provide termination benefits as a result of an 
offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination benefits for voluntary redundancies are recognised as an expense if the Company 
has made an offer encouraging voluntary redundancy, it is probable that the offer will be accepted, and the number of acceptances can be 
measured reliably. Benefits falling due in more than 12 months of the reporting date are discounted to their present value.
4. Turnover and segmental analysis
All turnover in the Group in the current and prior year is derived from the sales to one customer, which is included in the Gold mining segment. Other 
activities relate to a restoration obligation in Brazil.

The deferred taxation credit arises on the release of the deferred tax liability (note 31).
The Finance Act 2013, which was substantively enacted on 2 July 2013, has reduced the main corporation tax rate to 23% from 1 April 2013, 21% 
from 1 April 2014 and 20% from 1 April 2015. This reduction has been taken into account when calculating deferred tax assets and liabilities. The 
changes are not expected to have a material cash impact on the company.
The Group has estimated tax benefits in respect of tax losses of £2,953,000 (2012: £1,704,000) of which £2,162,000 will fully expire within 4 years 
and other net deferred tax benefits in respect of temporary differences of £1,159,000 (2012: 1,764,000) which have not been recognised as a 
deferred tax asset.
10. Loss for the year
The Company’s loss for the year dealt within the accounts of Vatukoula Gold Mines plc. was £35,757,850 (2012: £2,391,889). As provided by S408 
of the Companies Act 2006, no Statement of Comprehensive Income is presented in respect of Vatukoula Gold Mines plc.

The calculation of consolidated loss per share is based on the following loss and number of shares:

  £’000 £’000
Loss after tax (15,664) (7,070)

 2013 2012 
  Pence Pence
Basic loss per share (12.74) (7.81)
Basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the loss for the year from continuing operations of the Group by the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares in issue during the year. 
Outstanding share options could potentially dilute basic earnings per share by 8,407,112 shares in future periods, but were not included in the 
calculation of basic earnings per share because they are antidilutive for the year ended 31 August 2013.
Subsequent to year end the Group issued a total of 188,897,000 ordinary shares (note 34). These share issues would have significantly 
changed the number of ordinary shares outstanding as at 31 August 2013, if the share issues had occurred before 31 August 2013.
b. Diluted
All potential shares were anti-dilutive as the Group was in a loss making position. As a result diluted loss per share for the years ended 
31 August 2013 and 31 August 2012 is disclosed as the same value as basic loss per share. The diluted weighted average ordinary shares in 
issue during the period were 122,958,339 (2012: 90,509,159).

The Mining rights represent the mining rights acquired on the acquisition of the Vatukoula Gold Mine in April 2008. The amortisation of the Mining 
Rights is calculated on a unit of production basis, based on forecast production and the total Mineral Reserves. At the current production, reserves 
and gold price, the economic useful life is expected to be 7 years. This rate will vary from year to year and is dependent on the mineral reserves 
which are reassessed every year. Amortisation is included in depreciation and amortisation in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The directors believe that there have been no indicators of impairment for the mining rights for the year ended 31 August 2013 (and 31 August 
2012).
A deferred tax liability of £10,757,000 arose in 2008 in respect of the intangible assets recognised on the acquisition in the prior periods. The 
deferred tax liability is in respect of future taxable profits potentially generated from the exploration of the mining rights (Note 31).
The Exploration expenditure is an internally generated intangible asset, and represents costs associated with the exploration and evaluation of 
mineral deposits on our mining and special prospecting licenses and are capitalised in accordance with IFRS 6. At the current production, reserves 
and gold price, the economic useful life is expected to be 7 years. This rate will vary from year to year and is dependent on the mineral reserves 
which are reassessed every year. Amortisation is included in depreciation and amortisation in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Exploration costs to the amount £3,264,000 (2012: Nil) relate to specific areas which have not led to the discovery of commercially viable quantities 
of mineral resources, and the Group has decided to discontinue such activities in those specific areas. These costs have been impaired. The assets 
impacted by the impairment are allocated to the Gold Mining segment (note 4).
The Computer Software expenditure represents the costs associated with the purchase of specialised mining and inventory software.

Investments in subsidiary companies are measured at cost, less accumulated provisions for impairments.
The directors have assessed that the investment in subsidiaries is impaired as at 31 August 2013, as a result of significant decrease in forecast gold 
prices. The balance has been impaired by £36,852,000. The impairment was calculated based on the expected return from the subsidiary over the 
period that it is expected to make distributable profits.

The provision for doubtful debts includes £Nil (2012: £2.5 million) in relation to the prepayments against the claimed tax liabilities of F$Nil (2012: 
F$11.5 million) by the Fiji Islands Revenue & Customs Authority (“FIRCA”). During the year the Group reached a settlement agreement with FIRCA 
in relation to the F$11.5 million taxation assessment against the Group. In the settlement the parties agreed that the Group had made advance tax 
payments million against this assessment and FRICA agreed to refund the Group F$2.2 million. In the previous year the Group provided continued 
to provide for £2.5 million in relation to the prepayments against the claimed tax liabilities as the claim was settled during the year the Group utilised 
provisions amounting to £2.5million as the amount to be refunded was negotiated with FIRCA. All pending litigations and claims by FIRCA were also 
finalised as part of this settlement.
The Group has significant concentration of credit risk with its single customer in respect of gold doré sales. The Group has credit risk management 
policies in place and exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. Management generally adopts conservative strategies and tight 
control in credit policy.
The following table provides an analysis of trade and other receivables that were past due as at 31 August 2013, but not provided for, followed by

There were no share option issues during the year ended 31 August 2013. The following table lists the inputs used for the option issues which 
occurred during the year ended 31 August 2012:
Grant date  08/02/2012 08/02/2012 24/04/2012
Dividend yield 0% 0% 0%

Expected life of options 5 years 3 years 3 months
Exercise price £0.70 £1.75 £0.77
Price at grant date £0.89 £0.89 £0.52
The model used to arrive at the fair value of all the options granted during the year ended 31 August 2012 year was the Black-Scholes option pricing 
model. The weighted average fair value of the options granted during the year ended 31 August 2012 was determined as £0.05 per option.
The weighted average remaining contractual life of the 8.4 million options outstanding at the balance sheet date is 1.5 years (2012: 2.3 years). The 
weighted average share price during the year was £0.21 (2012: £1.59) per share.
The expected volatility of the options reflects the assumption that historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the 
actual outcome. The expected life of the options is based on historical data available at the time of the option issue and is not necessarily indicative 
of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.
The share option scheme and the warrants on issue is an equity settled plan and fair value is measured at the grant date of the option.

Employee related provisions include a provision for unpaid annual leave based on Fijian labour legislation, and a provision for legally required workers 
compensation relating to work injuries. Based on current estimates, these are expected to realise in at the end of the life of the mine. 
The provision for mine rehabilitation represents the current mine closure plan. The present value of the estimated cost is capitalised as a mine 
asset, as part of property, plant and equipment. Over time the discounted liability will be increased for the change in the present value based on 
the discount rates that reflect the current market assessments and the risks specific to the liability. The capitalised mine asset is expected to be 
expensed over the life of mine which is currently 7 years (2012: 7 years). The life of mine is dependent on the economic viability of extracting the 
contained Mineral Resources and may vary on a year by year basis dependant on the mining/processing costs and the price of gold. In addition the 
quantum of the provision may vary on a year by year basis dependant on the costs associated with executing the Mine Rehabilitation Plan. 
Long service leave is a contractual obligation for additional leave days earned by employees with 10 years or more service. Based on current 
estimates, these are expected to realise by the end of the life of mine.

The VSATF is part of the Vatukoula Trust Deed, a binding contract between the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary and the Fijian Ministry of 
Lands and Mineral Resources. A total of F$6million is payable of which the Group paid F$1.5 million on 10 March 2010 and F$1.125 million on 
31 December 2011. The remaining F$3.375 million has been allocated to Current and Non Current Liabilities as follows:
  F$’000 £’000

The non current portion of the liability has been discounted to the net present value of the future cash flows at £15,000.
24. Convertible loans
(i) On 26 June 2009, the Group issued a fully redeemable convertible loan note for £485,000. The loan is repayable in cash, 5 years after the date 
of grant. The loan note carries a coupon rate of 11% per annum. The loan note carries the option to convert into ordinary shares at £0.50, 
equating to 970,000 shares in Vatukoula Gold Mines plc. During the year no convertible loan notes were converted to ordinary shares (2012: 
None).
The net proceeds from the issue of the convertible loans have been split between the liability element and an equity component as follows:

Loans and receivables are measured using the amortised cost method. Available for sale financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and 
subsequently remeasured to fair value at each year end, with any change in value recognised directly in equity, unless the instruments are unable 
to be reliably fair valued, in which case they are stated at cost. The carrying amounts of the Available for sale investments at 31 August 2013 is £nil 
(2012: £Nil).
The Group and Company’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks; currency risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, gold price risk, liquidity risk 
and capital risk. The policies for managing these risks are regularly reviewed and agreed by the Board. It is, and has been throughout the period 
under review, the Group and Company’s policy that no trading in financial instruments should be undertaken. 
(i) Currency rate risk
Loans between companies which are members of the Vatukoula Gold Mines plc. Group are made in the functional currency of the lending 
company. In all other respects, the policy for all Group companies is that they only trade in their principal operating currency, except in 
exceptional circumstances from time to time.
The Group’s revenue derives from the sale of gold bullion by its Fijian operating subsidiary. Proceeds of gold bullion sales are received in US 
Dollars. As the Group reports in Pound Sterling, reported revenue is affected by the combination of changes in the US Dollar/Fijian Dollar and 
Pound Sterling/Fijian Dollar rates.
The Group’s expenses in Fiji and Brazil are incurred in Fiji Dollars and Reals respectively. Any weakening in the Fijian Dollar/Reals would result in 
a reduction in expenses in Pound Sterling terms, which would be to the Group’s advantage. There is an equivalent downside risk to the Group 
of strengthening in the Fijian Dollar/Reals which would increase Brazilian operating expenses in Pound Sterling terms. The following table 
illustrates the allocation of financial instruments across currencies:

rates:

For currency rate risk, the Company’s exposure is considered to not be significant because as it does not hold any financial instruments 
denominated in foreign currencies and therefore quantitative information has not been provided.
(ii) Interest rate risk
Interest rate exposure arises mainly from cash holdings. Contractual agreements entered into at floating rates expose the entity to cash flow 
risk whilst the fixed rate borrowings expose the entity to fair value risk.
The table below shows the Group’s financial assets and liabilities split by those bearing fixed and floating rates and those that are non-interest 
bearing.

The fair value of all financial instruments is approximately equal to book value due to their short term nature and the fact that they bear interest 
at floating rates based on the local bank rate.
If interest rates had been 1% higher/lower and all other variables held constant, the Group’s loss for the year ended 31 August 2013 would 
change by £15,270 (2012: £46,645).
For interest rate risk, the Company’s exposure is considered to not be significant as it only holds cash and cash equivalents at a floating rate 
and therefore quantitative information has not been provided.
(iii) Credit risk
Credit risk arises from trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents. Credit exposure is measured on a Group and Company basis. The 
Group and Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk relating to its financial assets is given in Note 17.
(iv) Gold price risk
The Group’s policy is to sell gold at spot. The Group is exposed to gold price risk through gold price fluctuations.
An increase/decrease of 25% in the spot price of gold at 31 August 2013, with all other variables held constant, would have the following 
impact on the Statement of Comprehensive Income and equity at 31 August 2013:

(v) Liquidity risk
Responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the board of directors, which has established appropriate liquidity risk frameworks for 
the management of the Group’s and Company’s short, medium and long term funding and liquidity management requirements. The Group 
and Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and by 
matching maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
The following table details the Group’s maturity profiles of its financial assets and liabilities. The table has been drawn up based on the 
undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay. The table includes both 
interest and principle cash flows:

For liquidity risk, the Company’s exposure is considered to not be significant as its only non-current financial liability is the convertible loan note 
and the maturity profile information is provided within the Group’s analysis above.
(vi) Capital risk
The Group’s capital management objectives (defined as net debt plus equity) are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern in order to provide returns to shareholders and benefits to other stakeholders, while maintaining a strong credit rating and headroom 
whilst optimising return to shareholders through an appropriate balance of debt and equity funding. The Group manages its capital structure 
and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes to economic conditions and the strategic objectives of the Company. Given the nature of 
early stage mining operations, the Group has been predominantly funded by equity. However once the mining operations are at a sufficiently 
advanced stage the Group may fund further expansion via debt. The Group includes within net debt borrowings, convertible loans, trade and 
other payables, less cash and short term deposits.

expansion of the operations at the mine predominantly via the issue of equity. The board thought this was the most appropriate means of 
funding given the stage of development of the Group, and the risks associated with the development of the Vatukoula Gold Mine.
26. Ultimate controlling party
There was no ultimate controlling party during the year end 31 August 2013. Subsequent to 31 August 2013, Zhongrun International Mining Co. Ltd 
increased its total holding to approximately 66% of the enlarged share capital of the Company (see note 33).
27. Related party transactions

Both the mining bond and the bankers undertaking are contingent liabilities to cover remediation or rehabilitation costs associated with any 
environmental breaches of the Special Site Rights. There have been no breaches to date, and depending on future events, it remains uncertain 
if these liabilities will realise or suffice.
b. The Group is a plaintiff in several litigations with respect to potential claims of creditors, workers compensation and industrial action. The 
directors have estimated that the possible liability for certain cases is F$306,000 (2012: $Nil), the equivalent of £104,000 (2012: Nil). The 
directors believe that the remaining litigations will not result in an economic outflow.
31. Deferred taxation
Movements in deferred taxation during the year are as follows:

The deferred tax liability is in respect of the intangible assets recognised in the acquisition in a prior period (Note 12).
32. Changes to accounting estimates
The following changes to accounting estimates were made in the 2013 financial year in accordance with IAS 8.39:
• The basis for the Unit of production calculation used to determine the amortisation rate for intangible assets has been changed to the total 
expected delivered ounces per the life of mine plan. Previously, opening contained Reserves per the prior year Reserves & Resources report 
was used a base for this calculation. This resulted in a decrease in amortisation of £646,842
• The impact of the above change in estimate also reduced the Taxation credit by £148,481 
• The basis for the Unit of production calculation used to determine the depreciation rate for Mine Properties and Development has been 
changed to the total expected delivered ounces per the life of mine plan. Previously, opening contained Indicated Resources per the prior year 
Reserves & Resources report was used a base for this calculation. This resulted in an increase in depreciation of £212,430 
• The allocation of development related overheads between operating expenditure and capitalised Mine Properties and Development was 
calculated on a per tonne basis. Previously, this allocation was calculated on a per metre basis. This reduced cost of sales by £5.6 million and 
increased capitalised Mine Properties and Development by £5.6 million. 
33. Post balance sheet events
On 21 October 2013, the Company completed the first tranche of a placing with Zhongrun whereby Zhongrun has subscribed for 90,000,000 new 
ordinary shares in the Company at a price of £0.69 per share, to raise £6.2 million.
On 5 November 2013, the Company completed the second tranche of the placing with Zhongrun whereby Zhongrun has subscribed for 98,897,000 
new ordinary shares in the Company at a price of £0.69 per share, to raise £6.8 million. As a result of this placing, Zhongrun’s total holding increased 
to approximately 66% of the enlarged share capital of the Company.
In January 2014 the Company agreed with Zhongrun to extend the time for payment by Zhongrun of the US$20 million loan note to 28 February 
2014. Zhongrun formally acknowledged and represented that it is willing and will be able to make full payment of the US$20 million loan note.

Notes 
(1) Holders of Ordinary Shares, or their duly appointed representatives, are entitled to attend and vote at the AGM. Shareholders are entitled to appoint a proxy to 
exercise all or any of their rights to attend and speak and vote on their behalf at the meeting. A Shareholder can appoint the chairman of the meeting or anyone else 
to be his/her proxy at the meeting. A proxy need not be a Shareholder. More than one proxy can be appointed in relation to the AGM provided that each proxy is 
appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different ordinary share or shares held by that Shareholder. To appoint more than one proxy, the Form of Proxy should 
be photocopied and completed for each proxy holder. The proxy holder’s name should be written on the Form of Proxy together with the number of shares in relation 
to which the proxy is authorised to act. If such is the case please indicate that the proxy instruction is one of multiple instructions being given. All Forms of Proxy 
must be signed and, to be effective, must be lodged with the Company’s registrar (Capita Asset Services, Proxies, The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, 
Kent BR3 4TU) so as to arrive not later than 48 hours before the time of the meeting, or in the case of an adjournment 48 hours before the adjourned time.
(2) The return of a completed Proxy Form will not prevent a Shareholder attending the AGM and voting in person if he/she wishes to do so.
(3) Only Shareholders whose names appear on the register of members of the Company as at 48 hours before the time of the meeting shall be entitled to attend the 
AGM either in person or by proxy and the number of ordinary shares then registered in their respective names shall determine the number of votes such persons are 
entitled to cast on a poll at the AGM.
(4) In order to facilitate voting by corporate representatives at the AGM, arrangements will be put in place at the AGM so that (i) if a corporate Shareholder has appointed 
the chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative to vote on a poll in accordance with the directions of all of the other corporate representatives for that 
Shareholder at the meeting, then on a poll those corporate representatives will give voting directions to the chairman and the chairman will vote (or withhold a vote) 
as corporate representative in accordance with those directions; and (ii) if more than one corporate representative for the same corporate Shareholder attends 
the meeting but the corporate Shareholder has not appointed the chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative, a designated corporate representative 
will be nominated, from those corporate representatives who attend, who will vote on a poll and the other corporate representatives will give voting directions to 
that designated corporate representative. Corporate Shareholders are referred to the guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators 
on proxies and corporate representatives (www.icsa.org.uk) for further details of this procedure. The guidance includes a sample form of appointment letter if the 
chairman is being appointed as described in (1) above.

Notice of General Meeting continued
Explanatory notes on the resolutions to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
Resolution 1 – Accounts
The Directors are required by company law to present each year the Company’s financial statements and the Directors’ and the Auditors’ report on 
the financial statements to the Company in a general meeting. 
Resolutions 2 and 3 – Directors
The Company’s Articles of Association require that any directors appointed during the year following the annual general meeting offer themselves for 
election at the next annual general meeting.
Two directors have been appointed since the last annual general meeting and therefore offer themselves for election. As announced on 20 May 
2013, the Company agreed as part of the subscription by SCD Energy Inc. (“SCD”) that SCD was entitled to nominate two directors for appointment 
to the board on completion of the first tranche of the subscription. Mr Yongan Lu and Mr Wei Li were appointed on 20 May 2013 and will be 
proposed for election:
Yongan Lu, Non-executive Director, age 44
Mr. Lu joined China Shandong International Economic & Technical Cooperation Corp., (“CSI”) in 1991. He has served in numerous positions within 
the Company, including: General Manager of the Nepal Office of CSI, Deputy Manager of Economic Aid & Engineering Department of CSI, General 
Manager of Tanzania Branch of CSI. He is currently Manager of Mineral Resources of CSI.
Wei Li, Non-executive Director, age 45
Mr. Li joined China National Oil and Gas Exploration and Development Corporation in 1998 as a Senior Engineer in the Project Administration 
Department and was responsible for management and control of two projects in Kazakhstan. In 2000 he joined Greater Nile Petroleum Operating 
Company (“GNPOC”) as Deputy Manager in the Planning Department where he advised management on policies, plans and decisions pertaining to 
GNPOC’s operations. In 2009 he was appointed President of DRK Energy Limited, an oilfield services provider to the global market.
Resolution 4 – Auditors
The Company is required at each general meeting at which financial statements are laid to appoint auditors who will remain in office until the next 
general meeting at which financial statements are laid. This resolution will, therefore, propose the reappointment of Mazars LLP as auditors and 
authorise the Directors to fix their remuneration.
Resolution 5 – Authority to allot shares 
The Companies Act 2006 provides that the Directors may not allot shares unless authorised to do so by the Shareholders. Such a power cannot be 
granted for longer than five years at any one time and the total nominal value of shares which can be allotted under the authority must be specified.
To renew the Board’s powers in respect of the allotment and issue of ordinary shares, it is proposed that the Directors be granted unconditional 
authority, in substitution for the existing authority granted by shareholders at the Company’s annual general meeting held on 25 February 2013, to 
allot and issue or to agree to allot and issue Ordinary Shares up to a nominal value of £5,754,256 (115,085,113 Ordinary Shares) at any time before 
the expiry of 15 months from the Annual General Meeting, or, if earlier, on the date of the following annual general meeting.
This represents approximately one third of the Company’s issued Ordinary Share capital as at the date of this notice and which complies with the 
guidelines issued by the Association of British Insurers and representative bodies of institutional investors.
Resolution 6 – Disapplication of Pre-emption Rights 
This resolution, which is in substitution for the authority granted to the Directors at the Company’s annual general meeting held on 25 February 
2013, is to grant the power to the Directors to allot equity securities for cash without first offering such shares pro-rata to existing Shareholders in 
accordance with the statutory rights of pre-emption.
This authority will allow the Directors to allot or agree to allot equity securities for cash up to an aggregate nominal value of £5,754,256 (115,085,113 
Ordinary Shares) without complying with the pre-emption requirements of the Companies Act 2006. This represents approximately 30% of the 
Company’s issued ordinary share capital as at the date of this notice and therefore exceeds the 5% disapplication recommended in the guidelines 
issued by the Association of British Insurers and representative bodies of institutional investors. The proposed disapplication is however in line 
with other AIM listed companies that are similar to the Company and recognises the professional costs of a pre-emptive share issue would be 
disproportionate to the net funds raised and the cost and delay in seeking specific shareholder approval for such issues.
If granted, the authority will expire 15 months after the Annual General Meeting, or, if earlier, on the date of the next annual general meeting.

Notes:
1. Any member entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting is entitled to appoint one or more proxies (who need not be a member of the Company but 
must attend the meeting in person) of his own choice to attend and to vote in his/her place.
2. You may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to different shares. You may not appoint more than one proxy 
to exercise rights attached to any one share. To appoint more than one proxy you may photocopy this form. Please indicate each proxy’s name and the number of 
shares in relation to which they are authorised to act as your proxy (which, in aggregate, should not exceed the number of shares held by you). Please also indicate 
if the proxy instruction is one of multiple instructions being given. All forms must be signed and should be returned together in the same envelope.
3. If you wish to appoint a proxy other than the Chairman, delete the words “the Chairman of the Meeting or,” initial the alteration and insert the name of the person 
you wish to appoint as your proxy.
4. All members are entitled to attend and vote at the meeting, whether or not they have returned a form of proxy.
5. To direct your proxy how to vote on the resolutions mark the appropriate box with an ‘X’. To abstain from voting on a resolution, select the relevant “Vote withheld” 
box. A vote withheld is not a vote in law, which means that the vote will not be counted in the calculation of votes for or against the resolution. If no voting indication 
is given, your proxy will vote or abstain from voting at his or her discretion. Your proxy will vote (or abstain from voting) as he or she thinks fit in relation to any other 
matter which is put before the meeting.
6. If a member is a corporation, this form of proxy must be executed under its common seal or by the signature of an officer or attorney duly authorised in writing.
7. In the case of joint holders, the signature of any one holder will be sufficient, but the names of all joint holders should be stated, and the vote of the senior holder 
who tenders a vote will be accepted to the exclusion of the vote(s) of other joint holder(s), seniority being determined by the order in which the names stand in the 
register of members of the Company.
8. In order to be valid, this Form of Proxy, duly executed together with any power of attorney or other authority under which it is signed, or a notarially certified or office 
copy of such power or authority, must be lodged at the Company’s Registrars (Capita Asset Services, Proxies, The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, 
Kent BR3 4TU) not less than 48 hours before the time of the meeting or any adjournment of the meeting.
9. The return of a completed Form of Proxy will not prevent a shareholder attending the Annual General Meeting and voting in person if he/she wishes to do so. If you 
have appointed a proxy and attend the meeting in person, your proxy appointment will automatically be terminated.
10. If you submit more than one valid proxy appointment, the appointment received last before the latest time for the receipt of proxies will take precedence.

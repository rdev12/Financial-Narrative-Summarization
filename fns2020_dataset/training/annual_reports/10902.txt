Introduction
I am pleased to report that, in a challenging
trading environment, financial results for the year
ended 31 December 2008 recorded a new high
for the Group.
Financial Results
Revenue for the year ended 31 December 2008
increased by 18% to £179.3 million (2007: £151.9
million). This included a combined contribution of
£5.0 million from the six new sites acquired during
the year. Revenue on a like-for-like basis increased
by 15%. Operating profit rose by 2% to £6.7
million (2007: £6.6 million) and profit before tax
rose by 3% to £7.1 million (2007: £6.8 million).
Earnings per share increased by 3% to 11.6 pence
(2007: 11.3 pence).
These results for the year ended 31 December
2008 are after the deduction of £750,000 in
respect of a bad debt provision made against the
debt of a customer that went into administration
in March 2009.
Net cash increased by £0.2 million, producing net
cash balances as at 31 December 2008 of £5.4
million (2007: £5.2 million). This increase in cash is
after an investment of £1.7 million in the purchase
of the Company’s own shares, deficit pension
contributions of £2.6 million and the payment of
£2.3 million for new site acquisitions.
Dividend
The Board is pleased to recommend a final
dividend of 3.3 pence per share (2007: 3.0 pence
per share), taking the total dividend for the year 
to 5.0 pence (2007: 4.5 pence), an increase of
11%. This will be paid, subject to approval by
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting, on
12 June 2009 to shareholders on the register at
the close of business on 15 May 2009.
Trading overview
The business continues to make solid progress and
we have increased our market share. The contract
wins and contract extensions signed in 2007
helped to increase volumes through our repair
network notwithstanding a decrease in accidents
during the year. We have also increased our non-
insurance work. While our customer base is biased
towards multi-year contracts with the leading
insurance companies, we also provide our services
to corporate fleets, brokers, motor manufacturers
and private individuals.
Our national network of bodyshops enables us to
service our customers’ needs in an efficient and
effective manner and we continue to manage the
network carefully, adding new locations where we
have identified customer demand and closing
locations no longer required. During the year we
acquired six new bodyshops and closed one
bodyshop. These new acquisitions further extend
our capacity and service capability and will provide
improved returns once they are fully integrated
into our network.  
A key strength of our bodyshop network is the
flexibility it provides us in the deployment of work
across our branches, which allows us to maximise
cost effectiveness. Our size enables us to derive
economies of scale and it is pleasing to note that,
despite inflationary pressure, gross margin
remained constant at 46.5% for the second
consecutive year. We remain focused on achieving
cost savings and believe there is scope to deliver
further efficiencies within the business.
Our retail initiative progressed well in 2008.
Targeted at customers whose vehicles are already
in a bodyshop for an insurance-related repair,
revenue from this new offering has developed
well. We are now developing further this direct-to-

consumer offering, which should also enable us 
to enhance our margins. 
Our Network Services division, which acts as 
a “one-stop shop” for accident management
services, continues to expand. The division gives 
us a competitive edge over many of our peers,
providing a service tailored to individual
customers’ needs, and capturing additional 
work for the Group’s bodyshops.
Outlook
These 2008 results demonstrate the ongoing
success of our twin track growth strategy,
organically and via acquisition, and we believe that
this strategy will continue to deliver future growth.
Although our business is not immune to the
current economic downturn, the nature of our
business, based as it is around accident repairs,
should afford us protection. In addition, we
benefit from good cash generation, a strong

Introduction
I am pleased to report that 2008 was another
record year for the Group, despite the increasing
economic turbulence as the year progressed. The
results were affected by the need to make a bad
debt provision of £750,000 in relation to a
customer which went into administration in 
March 2009. This provision has been disclosed 
as a non-recurring item.
During the twelve months, we benefited from 
the contract wins and extensions secured in 
2007 and underlying revenue and profits (before
non-recurring items) rose by 18% and 14%
respectively. In line with our commitment to a
progressive dividend policy, the proposed final
dividend represents an increase of 11% in the
total dividend for the year.  
Nationwide’s robust performance demonstrates
the inherent strengths of the business model, in
particular its resistance to cyclical influences, its
good cash generation, strong balance sheet, and
the scale of its operations, which enables us to
extract cost efficiencies.
Operations
Our national network of bodyshops constantly
evolves as we identify and acquire new locations
and withdraw from others, either at the end of
their lease or because they require additional
capital expenditure which would not deliver a
sufficiently commercial return. During 2008 
we acquired six new sites in total and closed 
one. Three sites were acquired in the first half of
the year, at Scunthorpe, Gravesend and Redruth.
Sites at Bristol, Kettering and Perth were added in
the second half of the year. New sites invariably
take a period of time to integrate within the
Nationwide model before making contributions
which mirror those from our more established
sites. As expected, the six new sites reflected 
this and generated a combined loss of £230,000
for the period as they went through the
integration process. We expect them to deliver
enhanced returns over 2009. All of these
acquisitions were designed to increase our
capacity in areas not served by our existing 
network and where we have identified and agreed
sufficient customer demand.
We continued to invest in our fully integrated 
in-house IT platform, ‘Voyager’. This system gives
us considerable market advantage, allowing us 
to offer claims handling and vehicle repair
management without the need for manual data
transfer and double entry inputs. As well as
improving our own efficiencies, the platform also
provides additional benefits. Accessible via the web,
it allows customers to track their vehicle repairs at a
time and location of their choosing, without the
need to call our sites. Information on the system is
automatically updated throughout the repair
process and the system is a good example of how
we use our scale and investment to develop
industry leading standards and efficiencies.
If our continued investment in sites, equipment
and IT is key to our continuing growth, it is our
skilled and committed team, which includes 116
apprentices, that enables us to deliver success. I
would like to extend my thanks to all of them.
Network Services
Network Services, our support division, offers 
the following:-
•
first contact (known as ‘first notification of loss’
or ‘FNOL’ in the industry);
•
claims handling;
•
replacement vehicles; 
•
deployment into our own or other networks;
•
uninsured loss recovery; and 
•
on site repair services for minor damage.
The division continues to grow and is unique in
the industry, offering accident management
services and also being able to transfer vehicles for
repair into our own wholly owned network of
bodyshops. This year we will invest in the further
growth of our ‘Mobile Restore’ and ‘Mobile
Solutions’ businesses which offer glass
replacement, electronic diagnostics and air
conditioning recharge services as well as off-site
repair for minor damage.
“...another record
year for our 
Group despite the
increasing economic
turbulence”
Chief Executive’s Report
Nationwide Accident Repair Services plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 5
Customers
Our strategy of aligning ourselves with our
customers’ objectives continues to deliver benefit.
Whilst many of our customers share similar aims,
including value for money, customer service and
process efficiency, their preferred method of
achieving these remains individual. The flexibility
of our business model allows us to tailor our
approach accordingly and our service offering
ranges from vehicle repairs at specific sites to
comprehensive claims handling. This unique
capability gives us considerable market advantage
and allows us to develop business relationships
with insurance companies, large corporate fleets
and brokers, as well as motor manufacturers and
other associated companies.  
In 2007 we launched a trial retail offering and,
having generated sales of £1.84 million in its first
year, income from this initiative over 2008 has
grown by 80% to £3.31 million. Our retail offering
is based both on convenience and value as we
provide private individuals with additional services,
normally while their vehicle is with us for an
insurance-related repair. We are currently
developing two trial sites at Leicester and Kettering
with an enhanced offering which we are
provisionally positioning as “Fast Fit +”. Adjoining
our existing bodyshop repair facilities, these sites
share infrastructure and capital investment, whilst
offering drive-in facilities for traditional “fast fit”
offers, including MOT and some servicing needs.
In the current economic climate, we have based 
our financial planning on conservative assumptions.
We believe that there is a market for cost
effective, basic servicing from well equipped
trustworthy companies. 
We put considerable emphasis on the level of
service we offer our customers and measure their
satisfaction at every site on a monthly basis. I am
pleased to report that customer satisfaction for
2008 for the Group as a whole was 85% and 
our objective is to increase this in 2009.
Outlook
We continued to grow in 2008 for the sixth year
in succession.  
The current economic environment is clearly
difficult. The nature of our work makes our
business model more resistant to cyclical variances
than many, but some claims, such as light
cosmetic vehicle damage can be deferred, whilst
more significant damage requires immediate
rectification. It is this second category of work 
which offers us protection from the extremes of
the economic cycle. We have built a market-

leading position which will allow us to use our 
scale to maximise cost efficiencies and with no 
bank debt and a profitable robust business, we 
believe that we are well positioned to weather
the current difficult economic environment and
to continue to execute our twin track strategy
of organic and acquisitive expansion.

Operating results
Overall turnover rose by 18% from £151.9m to
£179.3m. This increase included contributions
from six new sites; Scunthorpe (Feb 08),
Gravesend (Feb 08), Redruth (Feb 08), Bristol 
(Aug 08), Kettering (Aug 08) and Perth (Nov 08).
These six sites contributed turnover of £5.0m.
Turnover on a like for like basis therefore 
increased by 15%.
Operating profit before non-recurring items rose
by 13% to £7.5m from £6.6m. This included a
loss of £230,000 in relation to the six sites
acquired. Excluding the acquisitions, operating
profit increased by 17%.
Profit before tax rose by 14% to £7.8m from
£6.8m and Earnings per share has increased 
by 13% to 12.8p.
In addition, the Group closed  its Kidderminster
site in December 08. This site had turnover of
£1.6m and incurred losses of £160,000.
Pension scheme
The Group operates a defined benefit and defined
contribution pension scheme. The defined benefit
scheme was closed for future accruals on 31st July
2006 with active members transferred to a new
defined contribution section of the scheme.
Under IAS 19 the deficit in the scheme as at 31st
December 2008 was £16.5m (2007: £10.3m) or
£11.9m (2007: £7.4m) net of deferred tax. The
principal reason for the increase in the deficit in
the year is the decline in the value of equities. The
Group has agreed with the trustees to eradicate 
the Scheme Specific Funding deficit by making 
annual special contributions of approximately
£2.3m for approximately 7.5 years.
The Group has opted to amortise all actuarial
gains and losses above the corridor (10% of the
greater of assets and liabilities) over the future
working lifetime of the active membership. A full
actuarial valuation of the defined benefit scheme
was carried out as at 31 December 2005 and was
updated to 31 December 2008 by a qualified
independent actuary.
Cash flow
The net increase in cash during the year was
£0.2m (2007: a decrease of £1.8m) which
produced a net cash balance at 31st December
2008 of £5.4m. This increase in cash was after
spending £1.7m on the purchase of own shares
and £2.3m on acquisitions.
Overall debtors increased by £3.0m, of which
£2.1m relates to an increase in trade debtors. This
increase in debtors was however compensated by
an increase in creditors of £6.3m, of which £4.3m
relates to an increase in trade creditors. 
The Company continues to invest in new plant
and equipment and in improvements to its sites;
£2.8m (2007: £1.8m). In addition, the Company
continues to pay a “special” deficit contribution 
to its pension fund of £2,555,000 (2007:
£2,465,000) and a dividend of £2.0m was 
paid in 2008 (2007: £1.8m).
The Group has a committed bank facility with 
the Royal Bank of Scotland for £8m until 31st
December 2010.

Trade receivables
The Group’s trade receivables of £23.1m can 
be analysed between the two principal trading
units, NCRC (the bodyshops) and Network Services
(the accident management company).
NCRC’s trade receivables are principally owed by
insurance companies and debtor days as at 31st
December 2008 were 35 days (2007: 42 days).
Network Services customer base includes
insurance customers and fleet operators and
debtor days as at 31st December 2008 were 43
days (2007: 42 days). 
Tax
The effective tax rate is 28.8% which is slightly
above the Company’s effective rate of tax of
28.5%. The Group has no income tax losses
available but has capital losses of £4.1m available. 
Earnings per share 
The basic earnings per share are 11.6p (2007: 11.3p)
a growth of 3%. As a result of share options being
granted on 4th July 2006, the basic earnings per
share are reduced to 11.5p (2007: 11.0p).
Dividends 
The Board is proposing a final dividend in respect
of the results for the year ended 31 December
2008 of 3.3p per share (2007: 3.0p per share)
making 5.0p for the year as a whole (2007: 4.5p).
Subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual
General Meeting, this will be paid on 12 June
2009 to shareholders on the Register at the close
of business on 15 May 2009. The annual dividend
is covered 2.3 times by underlying earnings.
Key performance indicators
The Group reviews certain financial and non-
financial key performance indicators on a regular
basis and year-on-year comparisons are included
within the Directors’ Report. Despite inflationary
pressure it is very pleasing to report that the gross
profit margin has remained constant at 46.5% for
the second year running. Cycle time is also a key
measure of performance and is measured across
the group on a weekly basis. The “key to key”
measure i.e how long a car is physically on site for
has increased slightly in the year from 12.1 days 
to 12.5 days. 
Measurement of customer satisfaction is also a 
key indicator and is measured monthly via a
sample of independent telephone surveys across
all customers. This has been maintained at 85%.

The Directors present their report and accounts for the year ended 31 December 2008.
Principal activities and review of the business
As noted in the business review within the Chief Executive’s Report and Finance Director’s Review, the business of the Group is the repair of motor
vehicles and the provision of accident claim management services.
The strategy for 2008 was to maintain the profitability of the core business, to achieve consistency in margins and to introduce new insurance
companies to branches where possible. The Directors are pleased with the results for the year and this strategy will be maintained in 2009. 
Principal risks and uncertainties
The Directors regularly review principal risks and uncertainties that affect the Group. These include avoiding the reliance on key customers for work
provision by diversifying contracts and extending the duration of contracts. Legislation changes such as PAS 125, which affect road safety and vehicle
repair methodology, are being implemented through training programmes.
The Group’s business continuity has been addressed by adopting a comprehensive disaster recovery program, which has been approved by the
Directors. In the event of a systems failure, work can be re-directed to an alternative bodyshop.
Results and dividends
The Group’s sales revenue amounted to £179,337,000 (2007: £151,947,000) and the profit before taxation amounted to £7,052,000 (2007:
£6,815,000). Taxation was a charge of £2,030,000 (2007: charge of £1,744,000) and the net profit for the year was £5,022,000 (2007: £5,071,000).  
The Directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the results for the year ended 31 December 2008 of 3.3p per share. Subject to approval by
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting, this will be paid on 12 June 2009 to shareholders on the Register at the close of business on 15 May 2009.
During 2008, the Group paid dividends of £2,030,000 (2007: £1,840,000) to its equity shareholders. These comprised a final dividend in respect of 2007
of 3.0p per share paid in June 2008 (£1,296,000) and an interim dividend in respect of 2008 of 1.7p per share paid in November 2008 (£734,000).
Non-current assets
The movement of non-current assets is set out in notes 11, 12 and 13 to the accounts.
Directors and their interests
The Directors who served during the year and their interests in the shares of the Group are shown in the Remuneration Report on page 14. 
The Group has taken out Directors and Officers liability insurance.
Corporate governance
The Board is committed to the highest principles of corporate governance. As a Group quoted on AIM, the Group is not required to comply with the
requirements of the Combined Code.
The Board consists of three executive and three independent non-executive Directors who take an active role in Board matters and it meets eight times
in every year. The Board is responsible for maintaining a sound system of internal control to safeguard shareholders’ investment and Group assets.
The Board has appointed an Audit Committee, consisting of the Chairman and J J Brade, a Remuneration Committee consisting of the Chairman 
and J J Brade and a Nominations Committee consisting of the Chairman and Lady Judge.
The Audit Committee meets regularly with the external auditor and with the executive Directors to review the interim and final results, key areas of
accounting treatment and risk and control procedures. The Committee can meet with the external auditor without any of the executive Directors
being present.
The Remuneration Committee and the Nominations Committee both meet in met in February 2009, but the Nominations Committee has not met
since its formation in June 2007.
Employment of disabled persons
The Group gives full and fair consideration to applications for employment received from disabled persons having regard to their particular aptitudes
and abilities and wherever possible the Group continues the employment of, and arranges for reasonable adjustments to the working conditions of,
employees who become disabled persons while employed by the Group. Disabled employees are treated no differently from any other employees as
regards training, career development and promotion opportunities. The Group operated this policy throughout the year.
Employee involvement
Effective employee relations are seen as key drivers in moving the Group forward. Consequently human resources, quality, health and safety and
training functions need to establish good communications with individual sites and are therefore organised on a divisional basis. This structure
enables staff to obtain the help and guidance they may need and keeps them informed of, and effectively involved in, the development of the
Group’s business. Regular review meetings are held at local, divisional and Group level to ensure that all employees are kept informed of the 
Group’s objectives. Progress towards those objectives is measured and reported back to individual sites.
Directors’ Report Directors’ Report continued
Supplier payment policy
The Group requires its subsidiaries to negotiate clear and satisfactory arrangements for the payment of suppliers, as part of the overall terms and
conditions of the supply and to make payment accordingly. Group trade creditor days at the end of the year were 52 (2007: 53). The Company trade
creditor date at the end of the year were 29 (2007: 29).
Share capital

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have elected to prepare
financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. The financial statements are
required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing these financial statements the Directors are required to:
•
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
•
make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
•
state whether International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
•
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time the financial position of the
Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding
the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities
In so far as the Directors are aware:
•
there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
•
the Directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that 
the auditor is aware of that information.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from other legislation in 
other jurisdictions.

We have audited the Group and Parent Company financial statements (the ‘’financial statements’’) of Nationwide Accident Repair Services plc for the
year ended 31 December 2008 which comprise the consolidated income statement, the consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated and Company
statements of changes in equity, the Company balance sheet, the consolidated and Company cash flow statements and notes 1 to 26. These
financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has
been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no
other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditor
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted for use by the European Union are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on
Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’ report is
consistent with the financial statements. The information given in the Directors’ report includes that specific information presented in the Chief
Executive’s report and the Finance Director’s review that is cross referenced from the Business Review section of the Directors’ report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed. 
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. The other
information comprises only the Directors’ report, Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s report and Finance Director’s review. We consider the
implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our
responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an assessment of
the significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies
are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with
sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
•
the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, of the state of the Group’s 
affairs as at 31 December 2008 and of its profit for the year then ended;
•
the Parent Company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985, of the state of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2008;
•
the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
•
the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements.
Separate opinion in relation to IFRS
As explained in note 2 to the Group financial statements, the Group in addition to complying with its legal obligation to comply with IFRS 
as adopted by the European Union, has also complied with the IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
In our opinion the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRS, of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 
31 December 2008 and of its profit for the year then ended.

Company Cash Flow Statement
for the year ended 31 December 2008 Notes to the Accounts
for the year ended 31 December 2008
1. Nature of operations
Nationwide Accident Repair Services plc and its subsidiaries’ (the Group) principal activity is the provision of support services to the motor insurance
industry. Currently, this includes the repair of motor vehicles in the Group’s wholly owned sites and the provision of accident claim management services.
The strategy for 2008 was to maintain the profitability of the core business, to achieve consistency in margins and to introduce new insurance companies
to branches where possible. The integration of newly acquired sites was also paramount. The Directors are pleased with the results for the year and this
strategy will be maintained in 2009.
The following is a list of the principal subsidiary undertakings of which Nationwide Accident Repair Services plc is either directly, or through subsidiary
undertakings, the beneficial owner of the whole of the equity share capital. All companies are engaged in motor trade activities. All are incorporated 
in England and Wales.
•
Nationwide Crash Repair Centres Limited
•
Nationwide Crash Repair Centres (Staff) Limited
•
Network Services (Nationwide) Limited
•
Mobile Vehicle Repairs Limited (trading as Mobile Solutions)
•
Nationwide Fast Fit Plus Limited (previously W Harold Perry Limited)
2. General information
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as
adopted by the EU and as developed and published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
The measurement basis for individual items has been noted in the accounting policies below.
3. Summary of accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The accounting policies have remained unchanged from the previous year.
It should be noted that accounting estimates and assumptions are used in preparing the financial statements including the carrying amount of
goodwill (note 11) and provisions (note 21). Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions,
actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates. The following significant judgement has been made in the financial statements: 
Intangible assets: Provisional fair values are placed on all property, plant and equipment at the date of acquisition, as certain asset values are required
to be estimated. No intangible asset arises on acquisition.
New standards and interpretations currently in issue but not effective for accounting periods commencing on 1 January 2009 have been reviewed.
IAS1 (Revised) will have an effect on the presentation of the statement of changes in equity and IFRS3 (Revised) on business combinations, where
transaction costs are required to be written off rather than included in the calculation of goodwill.
Consolidation
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has power to control the financial and operating policies, with a view to obtaining benefits. The
consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Parent Company as well as those entities controlled by the Group by 
full consolidation.
In addition, acquired subsidiaries and non subsidiary acquisitions are subject to the application of the purchase method. This involves the revaluation
at fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities, including contingent liabilities of the subsidiary, at the acquisition date, regardless of whether or
not they were recorded in the financial statements of the subsidiary prior to acquisition. On initial recognition, the assets and liabilities of the
subsidiary are included in the consolidated balance sheet at their fair values, which are also used as the bases for subsequent measurement in
accordance with Group accounting policies. Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the Group’s share of identifiable
net assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its subsidiaries are
eliminated and unrealised losses are eliminated, unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Amounts
reported in the financial statements of subsidiaries have been adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies adopted
by the Group.
The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement for their respective
periods of ownership. Inter-Company trading is eliminated from these accounts where appropriate. As permitted by section 230 of the Companies
Act 1985, an income statement is not presented for Nationwide Accident Repair Services plc. Profit for the year for Nationwide Accident Repair
Services plc (the Company) was £3,136,323 (2007: £3,099,096).
Income and expense recognition
Revenue is recognised upon the performance of the service once authority has been given by the customer to undertake this work. Intra-Group sales
and value added tax are excluded. 
Operating expenses (with the exception of the IAS 19 pension adjustment) are recognised in the income statement upon utilisation of the service.
Interest income and expenditure are reported on an accruals basis.
Goodwill
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

3. Summary of accounting policies continued
Property, plant and equipment
All property, plant and equipment is recognised at cost.
Buildings, fittings and furniture are carried at acquisition cost less subsequent depreciation and impairment losses.
The cost of property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight line basis taking into account estimated residual values. Both estimated
residual values and useful economic life are reviewed annually.
The useful lives of property, plant and equipment can be summarised as follows:
Land – Nil
Buildings – 5 to 25 years
Plant and equipment – 3 to 10 years
IT equipment – 2 to 5 years
Land is not depreciated as it has an unlimited useful economic life.
On adopting IFRS, the Group and Company have taken advantage of the transitional rule that allows previously revalued fixed assets to be deemed at cost.
Leases
Payments on operating leases are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis. Operating leases are those agreements where the risk and rewards
of ownership are not transferred to the lessee.
Impairment testing of goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment
The Group’s goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are subject to impairment testing.
For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-
generating units). As a result, some assets are tested individually for impairment and some are tested at cash-generating unit level. Goodwill is
allocated to those cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from synergies of the related business combination and represent the lowest
level within the Group at which management controls the related cash flows.
Individual assets or cash-generating units that include goodwill with an indefinite useful life or those not yet available for use are tested for
impairment at least annually. All other individual assets or cash-generating units are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The
recoverable amount is the higher of fair value, reflecting market conditions less costs to sell and value in use, based on an internal discounted cash
flow evaluation. Impairment losses recognised for cash-generating units, to which goodwill has been allocated, are credited initially to the carrying
amount of goodwill. Any remaining impairment loss is charged pro rata to the other assets in the cash-generating unit. With the exception of
goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist.
Inventories
Inventories comprise materials and direct labour. At the balance sheet date inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Inventories are valued using the weighted average cost. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less any
applicable selling expenses.
Accounting for income taxes
Current income tax assets and/or liabilities comprise those obligations to, or claims from fiscal authorities relating to the current or prior reporting
period, that are unpaid at the balance sheet date. They are calculated according to the tax rates and tax laws applicable to the fiscal periods to which
they relate, based on the taxable income for the year. All changes to current tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in
the income statement.
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences. Deferred tax is generally provided on the difference
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. However, deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition of
goodwill, nor on the initial recognition of an asset or liability unless the related transaction is a business combination or affects tax or accounting
profit. Deferred tax on temporary differences associated with shares in subsidiaries and joint ventures is not provided if reversal of these temporary
differences can be controlled by the Group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future. In addition, tax losses available to
be carried forward as well as other income tax credits to the Group are assessed for recognition as deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax liabilities are always provided for in full. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be able to be
offset against future taxable income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated, without discounting, at tax rates that are expected to apply to
their respective period of realisation, provided they are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is on the annual
share option is recognised as a deferred tax asset on the balance sheet.
Most changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in the income statement. Only changes in deferred
tax assets or liabilities that relate to a change in value of assets or liabilities that are charged directly to equity (such as the revaluation of land) are
charged or credited directly to equity.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand as well as short term highly liquid investments such as money market instruments and
bank deposits. Money market instruments are financial assets carried at fair value.

3. Summary of accounting policies continued
Financial assets
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are recognised, after initial recognition, at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, as
reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Equity
Share capital is determined using the nominal value of shares that have been issued.
Share premium includes any premiums received on the initial issuing of the share capital. Any transaction costs associated with the issuing of shares are
deducted from share premium, net of any related income tax benefits.
The revaluation reserve comprises gains and losses due to the revaluation of property, plant and equipment.
Retained earnings include all current and prior period results as disclosed in the income statement.
The capital redemption reserve was created on the acquisition by the Company of its own shares.
Share based payments
The Group operates two employee share option schemes. The fair value at the date at which the share options are granted is recognised in the income
statement on a straight line basis over the vesting period, taking into account the number of options that are expected to vest. In valuing the share
options the Group has utilised the Black-Scholes option pricing model for tranche 1 of the options and the Monte Carlo model for tranche 2 of the
options with the weighted average share price being factored into the model. The expected life of the options has been assumed to be three years for
tranche 1 and five years for tranche 2 with the options being exercisable between three and ten years. The model assumptions used are included
within note 20.
Pension obligations and short term employee benefits
Pensions to employees are provided through a defined benefit plan as well as a defined contribution plan.
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent
on one or more factors such as age, years of service and salary. The legal obligation for any benefits from this kind of pension plan remains with the
Group, even if plan assets for funding the defined benefit plan have been acquired. Plan assets may include assets specifically designated to a long
term benefit fund as well as qualifying insurance policies.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into an independent entity. The Group has no legal or
constructive obligations to pay further contributions after payment of the fixed contribution.
The asset/liability recognised in the balance sheet for defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation (DBO) at the
balance sheet date less the fair value of the plan assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised actuarial gains or losses and past service costs.
The DBO is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the DBO is determined by
discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which
the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
Actuarial gains and losses are not recognised as an expense unless the total unrecognised gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the obligation
and related plan assets. The amount exceeding this 10% is charged or credited to profit or loss over the employees’ expected average remaining
working lives. Actuarial gains and losses within the 10% corridor are disclosed separately. Past service costs are recognised immediately in the income
statement, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time (the vesting
period). In this case, the past service costs are amortised on a straight line basis over the vesting period.
The contributions recognised in respect of defined contribution plans are expensed as they fall due. Liabilities and assets may be recognised if
underpayment or prepayment has occurred and are included in current liabilities or current assets as they are normally of a short term nature.
Financial liabilities
The Group’s financial liabilities include bank loans and overdrafts, trade and other payables. They are included in balance sheet line items ‘long term
financial liabilities’ and ‘trade and other payables’. 
Trade payables are recognised initially at their fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, through the income statement, less 
settlement payments.
Dividend distributions to shareholders are included in ‘other short term financial liabilities’ when the dividends are approved by the shareholders’ meeting.
Other provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets
Other provisions are recognised when present obligations will probably lead to an outflow of economic resources from the Group and they can be
estimated reliably. Timing or amount of the outflow may still be uncertain. A present obligation arises from the presence of a legal or constructive
commitment that has resulted from past events. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Provisions are measured at the estimated expenditure required to settle the present obligation, based on the most reliable evidence available at the
balance sheet date, including the risks and uncertainties associated with the present obligation. Any reimbursement expected to be received in the
course of settlement of the present obligation is recognised, if virtually certain as a separate asset, not exceeding the amount of the related provision.
Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class
of obligations as a whole. In addition, long term provisions are discounted to their present values, where time value of money is material.
All provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.

3. Summary of accounting policies continued
Other provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets continued
In those cases where the possible outflow of economic resource as a result of present obligations is considered improbable or remote, or the amount to be
provided for cannot be measured reliably, no liability is recognised in the consolidated balance sheet, unless assumed in the course of a business combination.
These contingent liabilities are recognised in the course of the allocation of purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired in the business combination.
They are subsequently measured at the higher amount of a comparable provision as described above and the amount initially recognised, less any amortisation.
Probable inflows of economic benefits to the Group that do not yet meet the recognition criteria of an asset are considered contingent assets.
Investment in subsidiaries
Investments are valued at cost less any impairment and after deducting any dividends paid out of pre-acquisition profits.

Basic earnings per share
Basic earnings per share has been calculated using the net results attributable to the shareholders of the Company of £5,022,000 (2007: £5,071,000).
The weighted average number of outstanding shares used for the basic earnings per share amounted to 43,264,023 (2007: 44,864,001).
Diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share has been calculated using the net results attributable to the shareholders of the Company of £5,022,000  (2007: £5,071,000).
The weighted average number of outstanding shares used for diluted earnings per share amounted to 43,672,070 (2007: 46,108,171) and assumes the
exercise of all the share options detailed in note 20 since the date they were granted and the average market price of £1.23.

Dividends
During 2008, the Company paid dividends of £2,030,000 (2007: £1,840,000) to its equity shareholders. 
These comprised:
– a final dividend in respect of 2007 of 3.0p per share paid in June 2008 (£1,296,000); and
– an interim dividend in respect of 2008 of 1.7p per share paid in November 2008 (£734,000).
The Board is proposing a final dividend in respect of the results for the year ended 31 December 2008 of 3.3p per share.

Acquisitions
During 2008, the trade and assets of six bodyshop businesses were acquired in Scunthorpe, Gravesend and Redruth (February 08), Bristol and 
Kettering (August 08) and Perth (November 08).

Notes:
(a) On acquisition, the value of other intangible assets was considered and no value was attributed. The Directors have considered the value of 
intangible assets and determined that this was immaterial and that the goodwill arising related to expected synergies with the existing business 
and a skilled workforce but which are not separately recognised under IFRS.
(b) Provisional fair values were placed on all property, plant and equipment at the date of acquisition, as certain asset values were required to 
be estimated. 
The result included in the Group accounts in relation to these six acquisitions, following their acquisition was revenue of £4,957,000 and a loss 
before tax of £230,000. It is not possible to restate the revenue and profit of these acquisitions as if the acquisition had taken place as at 1 
January 2008, as the information cannot reliably be extracted from the accounting records.
(c) During the year, an adjustment of £21,000 was made to increase the goodwill of the Hull acquisition. This related to further costs of acquisition 
which were known but not quantifiable at that date.

15. Pension and other employee assets/obligations
The Group operates a defined benefit scheme and a defined contribution pension scheme in the UK which offers both pensions in retirement and death
benefits to members. Since 1 January 2002 the defined benefit scheme has been closed to new members. The assets of the schemes are administered by
trustees independent of the Group. The Company made contributions of £2,555,000 (2007: £2,465,000) to the defined benefit scheme during the year.
The defined benefit scheme was closed for future accruals on 31 July 2006 with active members transferred to a new defined contribution section of the
scheme. In 2005 the Company agreed with the trustees of the pension scheme to make annual contributions of approximately £2.3 million (increasing
annually by the Retail Price Index) with a view to eradicating the Scheme Specific Funding deficit over a period of approximately 7.5 years.
The Group has opted to amortise all actuarial gains and losses above the corridor (10% of the greater of assets and liabilities) over the future working
lifetime of the active membership.
A full actuarial valuation of the defined benefit scheme was carried out as at 31 December 2005 and was updated to 31 December 2007 by a qualified
independent actuary.
2008 2007 2006 2005
IAS 19 % % % %
The major assumptions used by the actuary were (in nominal terms):
Rate of increase in salaries n/a n/a n/a 3.3
Rate of increase in pensions – accrued pre 5 April 1997 3.0 3.0 3.0 3.0
Rate of increase in pensions – accrued post 5 April 1997 2.70 3.15 2.85 2.65
Discount rate 6.5 6.1 5.4 5.0
Inflation assumption 2.70 3.15 2.85 2.65
The assumptions used in determining the overall expected return of the scheme have been set with reference to yields available on government bonds and
appropriate risk margins. The pre and post retirement mortality assumptions use the A92 and PA92 tables respectively. The 1992 series of mortality tables
were published by the Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau and are based on mortality data from life assurance companies over the years 1991 to
1994 inclusive. The “A92” tables are based on the mortality experience of life assurance policyholders. The “PA92” tables are based on the mortality
experience of pension annuity policyholders.

The overall expected rates of return were determined by the Directors of the Group, with the advice of their actuarial advisers. The expected return 
available on equities has been taken as the dividend yield on the FTSE Actuaries All Share Index plus real dividend growth of 2.1% plus price inflation.

The basis for identifying impaired receivables is to consider those amounts which are overdue by more than 120 days and for which no cash has
been received after the year end. Past history has indicated that this policy is reasonable. In addition, a provision of £750,000 has been made to
provide against the debt of a customer that went into administration in March 2009 (see note 6).

20. Equity continued
The accounting policy for share based payments is included within note 3, and the following have been factored into the model:
Exercise prices of £1.11 and £1.165, expected volatility of 25%, dividend yield of 3.00%, equivalent risk free rate of return being the rate of return
on zero-coupon Government bonds with a term equal to the expected life assumptions.
The Company’s assumptions regarding the volatility of its shares have been based on a review of market and competitors’ volatility.
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are:
i) to safeguard the entity's ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for 
other stakeholders, and 
ii) to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk. The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of 
changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group
may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to reduce debt.

Group and Company
The Group and Company is exposed to a variety of financial risks which result from both its operating and investing activities. The Group and Company’s risk
management is coordinated at its headquarters and is regularly discussed by the Board of Directors. The Group and Company does not engage in the trading
of financial assets nor does it write options. The most significant financial risks to which the Group and Company is exposed to are described below:
i) Credit risk
The Group and Company’s trade and other receivables are monitored actively to avoid significant concentrations of credit risk. The Group varies its
credit terms with new customers in order to reduce this risk.
ii) Cash flow and interest rate risks
The Group and Company is in a cash positive situation and currently earns between 0.5% and 1.0% interest on its deposits. This interest earned is
dependent on bank rates and is not fixed. Other than this the Group and Company is not exposed to interest rate risk on its financial assets and
financial liabilities.
The Royal Bank of Scotland overdraft rate is only payable when the facility is utilised. The interest rate is dependent upon the bank base rate and is
not fixed.
iii) Market risk
The Group and Company hedge market risk by avoiding reliance on a few key customers. In addition, The Group and Company operate within a
vertical market, with the ability to influence a significant number of market sectors.

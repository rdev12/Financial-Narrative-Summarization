Annual Report & Accounts 
for the year ended 31 December 2004
2004 was an eventful year in the development
of the Bradford & Bingley Group.A new Group
Chief Executive was appointed in March and,
following a strategic review, five non-core
businesses were sold and a programme to cut
costs by £40 million was initiated. Performance
of the continuing core businesses was
satisfactory. Profit before tax and exceptional
items increased 6% to £280.2 million and
earnings per share before exceptional items
increased 8% to 31.0 pence per share.
There has been a cost attached to this
reorganisation amounting to £174.9 million
reducing the profits before taxation after these
costs to £105.3 million. Much of this
represents goodwill being written off,
consequently the impact on our regulatory
capital is comparatively small.The Board is
confident that the short-term pain of these
one-off exceptional costs will be rapidly offset
by the substantial cost savings and better
quality earnings in the future.
Steven Crawshaw was appointed Group Chief
Executive in March, following the departure of
the previous Group Chief Executive. Steven’s five
years with the Group, including his two years as
Managing Director of Lending and Savings,
preceded by his eight years of experience in the
mortgage industry, make him very well equipped
to lead the Company. In May the Board
announced the outcome of its strategic review
concluding with the aim to simplify and change
the future direction of the Group.
The main conclusions of this were to dispose
of our non-core businesses, to continue the
emphasis of our lending on the specialist
segments of the residential and other
“The Group has a clear strategy and an
appropriate structure. After an eventful year in
2004, 2005 offers great opportunity to build
value for the future.”
Rod Kent Chairman
Chairman’s statement
property markets, to refocus and simplify our
retail branch-based business and to reduce
costs in the core business by £40 million.
Dividend
The Board is pleased to propose a final
dividend of 11.4 pence per share for payment
on 6 May 2005 to shareholders on the register
as at 29 March 2005. If approved, the full year
dividend for 2004 will be 17.1 pence per
share, an increase of 4% (2003: 16.5 pence).
Lending
Our total managed lending balances increased
12% to £28.9 billion (2003: £25.9 billion) and
total new lending was a healthy £9.2 billion
(2003: £9.9 billion) including acquired assets.
Growth was primarily driven by the residential
lending business where we have continued to
build upon our strong position in several
specialist segments of the market.
Lending income and profit both showed
satisfactory growth, although Group net interest
margin continued to decline mainly driven by
narrower liability spreads as the Group’s funding
base was deliberately diversified and strengthened.
Our arrears have continued to be very low
by historical standards. Our arrears
performance compares well to overall
industry statistics for the book as a whole 
and in our buy-to-let portfolio.
Balance Sheet and Capital
We have increased our access to funding 
from the secured markets successfully launching
a€2 billion covered bond and establishing a
master trust securitisation programme in 2004.
These new funding platforms significantly
enhance our ability to source funding from new
and highly liquid financial markets. 3 Bradford & Bingley plc
Annual Report & Accounts 
for the year ended 31 December 2004
We will continue to balance our funding
needs from traditional wholesale sources, the
secured funding markets and by growing our
savings balances in 2005.
The Group remains well capitalised and capital
ratios are within target ranges.
Retail branch business
In our Retail branches we have started to
simplify and enhance our customer
proposition.We are looking to improve sales
procedures, product ranges, back office
processes and profitability.
Our new partnership with Legal & General is
an important step in the development of this
business.The combination of their experience
and comprehensive product range, alongside
that within our branches, gives our customers
better provision of investment and protection
products and improves overall profitability for
the Group.
Our branch-based mortgage broking business is
now operating under the new Financial Services
Authority (‘FSA’) regulations.We have revamped
the size and number of the various panels of
lenders and given complete transparency of fee-
charging to our customers.The trading name of
MarketPlace has been dropped.
We have re-energised our retail Savings
business, raising the profile of our product
range. In October we launched a new internet
based deposit account which has been very
successful. Overall, Savings balances grew by
£1.1 billion over the year, the first significant
progression since the flotation in 2000.
Regulation
In regulatory terms, 2004 was a particularly
significant year with the FSA taking
responsibility for mortgage regulation from
the 31 October, a challenge the Group passed
through smoothly.
The increasingly complex regulatory landscape is
an inescapable part of life as a financial services
organisation. Despite simplification of the
business, regulatory requirements will continue
to put pressure on costs and absorb
management time.
We were fined £650,000 by the FSA because
of non-compliant selling practices regarding the
sale of investment bonds by our Independent
Financial Advisers.We have redoubled our
efforts to ensure that we are fully compliant in
future with all requirements.The simplification
of our business should help in this regard.
We are continuing to prepare for the
forthcoming consequences of adopting
International Financial Reporting Standards.
We will communicate with the market as
appropriate during 2005 to discuss the
changes to the financial accounts but, at the
moment, do not believe the overall impact 
on earnings or capital will be material.
Board
In March, Christopher Rodrigues resigned as
Group Chief Executive to become CEO of Visa
International. I would like to express my thanks
to Christopher for his eight years of service
during which time the Group became a plc.
Following the decision to sell the non-core
businesses, Ian Darby resigned from the
Board in August. After continuing in his role
as Commercial Director, he will be leaving
the Group in August 2005.We thank him for
his contribution to the Group.The Board
now consists of myself as Chairman, five
Non-Executive directors and three 
Executive directors.
People
The sale of five businesses, accounting for roughly
half of the Group’s workforce, and the onset of
cost cutting measures have meant a difficult time
for employees in many parts of the business.
The professionalism of our people has shone
through during the year and is evidenced by
the smooth running of the core businesses,
the swift conclusion of the sale processes and
good progress in meeting cost targets.
Outlook
The Group is starting 2005 stronger and fitter
after the hard work carried out in 2004.We
have a clear strategy and an appropriate
structure.We are expecting the mortgage and
housing markets to moderate from the
exceptionally strong conditions seen in 2003
and 2004. Fundamentals in the secured
lending market are strong and we expect to
show continued growth in Lending. Our
branch-based Retail business offers good
growth potential from a relatively low base
and we will continue to improve our
customer proposition. 2005 offers great
opportunities to build value for the future.
Rod Kent
Chairman 4 Bradford & Bingley plc
Annual Report & Accounts 
for the year ended 31 December 2004
I was delighted to be appointed Group Chief
Executive by the Board in March. Following my
appointment I immediately instigated a
fundamental strategic review to look at the
shape of the Group, the changing nature of
our operating environment and how best to
create value for shareholders in the future.
The conclusions of this review were
announced to the market in May and revolved
around the main theme of building a simpler,
stronger, more profitable business. In order to
do this I concluded the Group should:
• continue to develop a strong specialist
Lending business;
• refocus and grow its branch-based Retail
business;
• dispose of businesses not core to its
operations; and
• reduce costs in the core business.
I felt the need for decisive action to be taken
which included the decision to dispose of
businesses that had formed part of the
strategy of the organisation since before the
float in 2000.
“We have started 2005 with a simpler business
focused on our core lending and retail
banking operations. Our hard work in 2004
has given us a stronger, healthier base for
building future growth.”
Steven Crawshaw Group Chief Executive
Group Chief Executive’s review
Although the non-core businesses held strong
positions in their respective markets they
were characterised by a number of factors
that did not meet with our objectives of
building a simpler, stronger business.These
included high cost gearing, high earnings
volatility, insufficient scalability and insufficient
synergy with the rest of the Group. In
addition, these businesses consumed
management and operational time far in
excess of their relative profit contribution.
We recognise cost cutting alone is not the
path to a strong, sustainable business.
Therefore, we will continue to invest in the
Group where we believe we can generate
growth and value.
We made rapid progress in 2004.This is a
tribute to the hard work put in across the
Group during what was, at times, a very
challenging period in many parts of our business.
Lending
We have continued to build on our core
proposition of lending focused on profitable
segments of the secured lending market.We
believe that good growth and attractive margins
are available in these markets and, by balancing
innovative product design with prudent risk
management, Bradford & Bingley can continue
to prosper.
Our balance sheet has continued to show
healthy growth with total managed lending
balances growing 12% to £28.9 billion (2003:
£25.9 billion).Total new lending during 2004
was slightly below the unusually high levels in
2003 when we took advantage of buoyant
conditions to add scale to the balance sheet.
This year new advances were £9.2 billion
(2003: £9.9 billion) including acquired assets.
Residential managed loan balances increased
14% to £23.6 billion (2003: £20.7 billion) and
total new residential lending was flat at £7.7 5 Bradford & Bingley plc
Annual Report & Accounts 
for the year ended 31 December 2004
billion (2003: £7.7 billion). Residential loans
accounted for 84% of total new lending in
2004 (2003: 78%).
Gross residential lending in the second half of the
year was impacted by the deceleration in the
market in the fourth quarter and disruption
surrounding the implementation of mortgage
regulation.We ran down our pipelines in
preparation for mortgage regulation to ensure a
smooth transfer to a new mortgage system on
the 31 October and to allow the intermediary
community to adjust to the new environment.
We maintained our margins and credit quality
requirements in the second half, preferring to
take on high quality loans rather than push for
volume as the market slowed.We also took
action to organise our Lending business in
preparation for the reduced levels of business
we are expecting in the near term. A slight
decline in the volume of portfolio acquisitions
to £1.3 billion (2003: £1.4 billion), and lower
volumes of new lending on the former
building society book (2004: £0.2 billion; 2003:
£0.4 billion) also contributed to more normal
levels of residential lending growth than we
saw in 2003.
We have a strong track record in the secured
lending market and, in particular, in specialist
mortgage products. In 2004 our market share
was 21.8% of the buy-to let market (2003:
24.6%) and we maintained our position in the
self-cert market.We have also continued to
build our new ‘Lifetime’ equity release product
and achieved a market share of around 14.1%,
consolidating our position as one of the
leading players in this rapidly growing area.
Commercial and Housing Association lending
balances increased slightly to £5.3 billion
(2003: £5.2 billion) whilst new loans fell to
£1.5 billion (2003: £2.2 billion).This segment
of our book accounted for 16% of total new
lending in 2004 (2003: 22%). During 2004 the
Commercial market was very competitive.
Consequently, we pulled back from making
loans where margins were compressed to
below the level that we believe to be in the
best interest of our shareholders. However,
we remain active in the commercial property
finance field and will continue to take
opportunities to lend profitably in the future.
Margins on new lending were maintained
during the year.This, together with the benefit
of continued balance sheet growth, generated
Lending income growth of 7% to £314.3
million (2003: £294.6 million) and profit before
tax growth of 9% to £249.6 million. However
Group net interest margin declined 23bp to
132bp (2003: 155bp) due to the impact of
changes in the mix of assets and liabilities on
the balance sheet as newer balances replaced
the mature elements of our book and as we
deliberately diversified our sources of funding.
During the last few years, arrears and
repossessions have been at unprecedentedly
low levels. In 2004 the level of arrears
increased, reflecting the tightening in the
interest rate environment. However, the
number of loans more than three months in
arrears at the year end still remains extremely
low by historical standards at 0.77% of loans
outstanding by number across the whole
book and similarly at only 0.52% for the buy-
to-let portfolio (2003: 0.99% and 0.25%
respectively).This compares favourably with
Council of Mortgage Lenders statistics for the
market as a whole of 0.82% and 0.63% for
buy-to-let. Our arrears and bad debts remain
low due to the high quality of the Group’s
loan collateral, lending policies, underwriting
procedures and collections processes.
Loan-to-value (‘LTV’) ratios on new residential
lending continue to be conservative at 74%
(2003: 77%) and the LTV ratio across the
whole book has increased slightly to 67% on 
an original basis and 45% on an indexed basis
(2003: 66% and 45% respectively). Income
multiples on new lending have also remained
conservative with averages of 2.6x single
income and 2.2x joint income (2003: 2.5x and
2.2x respectively).
Because of the extremely low levels of arrears
across the loan portfolio together with
recoveries against old loans that were previously
written off, the Group has had a small release
from provisions for bad and doubtful debts of
£2.0 million (2003: £6.6 million charge).We
maintain a conservative stance towards
provisioning seeking to ensure cover against all
identifiable, potential losses. Residential bad debt
provisions represent 0.21% of managed
residential assets (2003: 0.27%).
Balance Sheet and Capital
Income from Treasury & Reserves decreased
16% to £54.9 million (2003: £65.7 million) and
profit before tax decreased 19% to £46.7
million (2003: £57.6 million).The combination
of increasing interest rates and our rising cost
of funding has constrained earnings in this 
part of the Group during 2004.Total assets
increased 10% to £35.5 billion (2003: £32.2
billion) reflecting the growth in lending
balances.This has been funded by retail
deposit growth, secured and traditional
wholesale markets.
Our strategy is to diversify our funding to
promote a stronger balance sheet in the
medium-term. During 2004 we increased our
Savings product range and made a meaningful
addition to balances for the first time since the
Company floated.We have also entered new
secured funding markets.We issued €2 billion
of covered bonds in May and established a
master trust securitisation programme in
October with a £9 billion pool of mortgages,
against which we have already borrowed £2
billion.We intend this programme to form a
substantial element of our funding plans in the
future.These growth areas supplement our
active international fundraising activity in the 6 Bradford & Bingley plc
Annual Report & Accounts 
for the year ended 31 December 2004
wholesale markets.Although beneficial to the
structure and stability of the balance sheet in
the medium-term, our greater use of the
secured and retail markets has increased the
total cost of funding across the Group in the
short term.
Our capital position remains strong with a Tier
1 ratio of 7.3% and a total capital ratio of
13.1% (2003: 7.7% and 14.0% respectively).
Retail
Our Retail business has two key elements:
• Savings: providing a range of our own
Savings products, both in the branch and
through direct channels, and
• Core Distribution: providing a wide range 
of our own and other companies’ financial
services products mainly through our branch
network, but also through direct channels.
In combination, these two business areas have
performed well in 2004 generating a substantial
35% increase in profit before tax to £59.6
million (2003: £44.2 million).This has been
driven by profitability and from simplifying 
the business.
Our Savings business showed good
performance with net balance growth of £1.1
billion arising from our reinvigoration of this
business.We have become more competitive
and have raised our profile in the market.This
is the first meaningful growth in balances since
the float and our new internet savings channel
was an important part of this growth. Savings
income increased 6% to £121.0 million (2003:
£114.2 million) and profit before tax increased
35% to £32.5 million (2003: £24.0 million).
The refocus and simplification of our core
Distribution business included a reorganisation
of branch management structures,
simplification of sales processes, performance
management of low productivity advisers and
sale of the non-core businesses. Profit before
tax and exceptional items increased by 34%
to £27.1 million (2003: £20.2 million).
The investment and insurance agreement 
we announced with Legal & General in
November anticipated the opportunities open
to the Group under the new regulatory
regime.This innovative agreement moved the
Group away from being an independent
financial adviser.This, together with the
simplification of our continuing branch-based
mortgage broking business announced in
January 2005 has helped to reduce the
complexity and risk in the sales process.
There is still a lot of work to be done in the
Retail division over the course of 2005, but I
am confident that we will be able to grow
from our current, small base. However, this
business will always be a smaller component
of the Group than Lending.
Disposals
During the strategic review the Board
concluded that the property services
businesses (Estate Agency and SecureMove),
Charcol and the smaller mid-to-high net
worth IFA businesses (Charcol Holden
Meehan and Charcol Aitchison & Colegrave)
were not core to the Group’s operations and
should be sold.
We began to look for new owners for these
businesses in May.The disposal programme
was concluded with the sale of Charcol in
December.The sales were conducted swiftly
and we achieved reasonable value for each of
them given their performance and current
market circumstances. Exceptional costs of
£20.3 million and a loss on sale of £123.2
million, mainly the write-off of the associated
goodwill, have been incurred in 2004.
The non-core businesses contributed income
of £139.0 million while they remained part of
the Group (2003: £162.8 million) and made a
loss before exceptional items of £8.3 million
(2003: loss of £9.8 million). At the start of
2004 these businesses employed 3,670 people,
almost half of the Group’s total. Reducing the
number of employees by this order of
magnitude provides the opportunity to simplify
support functions across the Group.
Costs
A rigorous review of costs identified substantial
opportunities to reduce expenditure in the
core businesses by the end of 2005.The
Group is on track to remove £35 million of
expenditure in 2005, rising to £40 million in
2006 (at 2004 prices and volumes). Part of 
the one-off exceptional costs of £31.4 million
incurred in 2004 arises due to actions taken 
to reduce operating costs.
In addition to these cost initiatives, a further
£10 million annual cost saving is expected to
be realised from the partnership with Legal &
General announced in November.
The majority of the cost savings identified are
realisable as a consequence of simplifying the
organisation around fewer lines of business, a
smaller central overhead and more efficient
operation of front and back office processes.
The number of employees in the core business
has reduced, as expected, from 3,781 to 3,152
employees. Cost control activities should not
impact our plans for growth, the Lending and
Retail businesses will be the least affected.
Group Services operating costs showed an
increase of 11% to £77.0m (2003: £69.6m).This
was driven by increased activity in the Group
centre related to the disposal processes, cost
cutting initiatives, and an increase in the costs of
processing claims and compensation payments
for sales made in the past by our independent
advisory business.We expect our move away

Group Chief Executive’s review
from providing independent advice to a simpler,
multi-tied proposition will generate marked
improvements which, together with the other
cost measures already taken, will improve
performance in 2005.
Market outlook
Lead indicators and current trading show the
housing market is slowing from the unusually
strong rates of growth experienced in the last
few years, as five consecutive increases in the
Bank of England’s base rate have started to
take effect.We welcome this deceleration from
the unsustainable levels of growth experienced
in the last few years.
We anticipate that the housing market will
move into a period of consolidation with
reduced house price inflation and transaction
volumes for the next couple of years.
Housing market fundamentals however remain
strong. Interest rates and unemployment are
both likely to remain at historically low levels,
real household incomes should continue to
grow and housing demand is likely to outstrip
supply into the medium-term.
Low debt servicing costs mean that mortgage
affordability remains good and whilst we have
seen some signs of arrears rising, we do not
expect to see any material deterioration in
the near-term.
As house prices stabilise, rental levels are
rising in most parts of the country, tenant
demand has been sustained and rental yields
are hardening.We believe that these factors,
together with promised pension benefits, will
support the underlying level of demand in the
buy-to-let market.
Demographic indicators are positive for our
chosen markets. Household formation is rising,
flexibility in the labour market is increasing, the
pension crisis shows no sign of ending and the
Government is maintaining its ambitions for
further education. All these indicators support
continued and sustainable growth of the buy-
to-let, self-cert and lifetime segments of the
mortgage market.
Business outlook
We completed a great deal of groundwork in
2004 and have significantly changed the shape
and size of the Group for the better and grown
profits in the core business along the way.
Our challenge in 2005 is to continue the
work we started in 2004 and to build on the
stable foundations we have established for
future growth.
We will need to continue to grow our
Lending business and rebuild our pipeline,
to take forward the development of our
branch-based Retail business, to maintain the
momentum achieved in Savings, and to keep
control of costs.
The aim of these goals is to create a simpler,
stronger business that is better for our
shareholders and customers.

“We are pleased to have increased profits in
our core Lending and Retail businesses.”
Rosemary Thorne Group Finance Director
Summary
Group profit before tax and exceptional items
increased by 6% in 2004 to £280.2 million
from £264.0 million. Exceptional items include
£51.7 million exceptional costs and £123.2
million loss on sale. After exceptional items,
profit before tax was £105.3 million (2003:
£264.0 million).
The increase in profit before exceptional
items has been delivered through continued
strong performance in our core Lending and
Retail businesses and the initial impact of
wide-ranging cost reductions across the
Group. A small increase in net interest income
to £447.1 million was outweighed by a fall in
non-interest income, mainly due to the
disposal of the non-core businesses (described
as discontinued operations in these financial
statements). As a result, total income
decreased by £23.0 million to £715.2 million.
Operating costs decreased by £30.6 million to
£437.0 million and the net release from
provisions for bad debts of £2.0 million
Group Finance Director’s review
reflected recoveries and on-going low arrears
in our mortgage portfolio.
During 2004 we have implemented significant
changes to simplify the Group by selling the
non-core businesses and working to reduce
costs in our core operations.We have incurred
exceptional costs of £31.4 million in the core
business and £20.3 million in the non-core
businesses.The sale of the non-core businesses
also resulted in a loss of £123.2 million.After
these exceptional items, Group profit before tax
was £105.3 million compared to £264.0 million
in 2003.The Group’s total tax charge reduced
by £9.1 million before the exceptional tax credit
in 2003. Before the impact of exceptional items,
basic earnings per share increased to 31.0

rose to 16.4% from 15.1%. Basic earnings per
share fell to 5.2 pence per share from 32.4

an exceptional tax credit in 2003 and the impact
of the exceptional items incurred in 2004.
Net interest income
Net interest income increased by 3% to
£447.1 million. Growth in average interest-
bearing assets of 20% to £33.8 billion has
been key to this increase. Group net interest
margin fell to 1.32% in 2004 from 1.55% in
2003 reflecting changes in the mix of assets
and liabilities.
We saw continued growth in Lending with
managed assets growing by 12% to £28.9
billion.This, combined with the benefit of
strong growth in previous years, led to a
substantial improvement in income from this
part of the business.
Balances in our Savings business increased by
£1.1 billion.This increase, combined with rising
interest rates in the second half of the year,
led to an improvement in interest income
from Savings of £7.3 million in 2004.
Our Treasury business maintained higher levels
of liquidity throughout the year to provide
stable short-term balance sheet financing. In
addition, rising interest rates increased the cost
of short-term funding and allowed fewer
opportunities for advantageous hedging
positions. Consequently, interest income from
this area was lower.
In an environment of rising interest rates, the
yield on interest-earning assets grew by 21
basis points to 5.28%. However, our strategy
to diversify and strengthen the funding base
by increasing secured and retail funding,
alongside a small increase in the cost of
wholesale funding, all contributed to the cost
of interest-bearing liabilities increasing by 44
basis points to 4.12%. As a result, interest
spread declined by 23 basis points to 1.16%.
Non-interest income
The Group divested the five non-core
businesses between September and December.
The loss of these businesses is the main driver of
the fall in non-interest income of 11% to £268.1
million.Within this total, income from the
businesses that were sold fell by 15% to £139.0
million. Income within our retained core
businesses fell by 8% to £129.1 million, reflecting
slower growth in these markets.
Mortgage broking income fell to £19.3
million from £25.1 million in our core
business and by 36% to £28.9 million in the
discontinued business. Encouragingly, income
in the core business increased in the difficult
conditions of the second half of 2004
compared with the first half reflecting the
improvements made in that area.
Investment sales and income fell by 8%, arresting
the sharp declines in previous years though
investors showed continued reluctance to invest
in equity based products, the fall can partly be
attributed to the impact of a change in our

approach to this market.We have moved away
from providing independent advice to a simpler
proposition.This change required the retraining
of our advisers and prevented them being
available to customers in the last two months of
the year.Whilst reducing income in 2004, this
change significantly reduces the risk of
compensation claims in the future by simplifying
the product proposition through an
arrangement to provide investment and
protection products in our branches in
partnership with Legal & General.
General insurance income fell by 8% to 
£19.8 million due to lower volumes of business
from the reducing number of legacy building
society mortgages.
During 2004, other financial services income
improved as the initial signs of success were
evident from the widening of our product
range to include broking of personal loans and
credit cards. Commission earned on these
sales was £3.2 million in the first year of
providing these products, of which £2.5 million
was from the core business.
T otal Property Services income fell by 9%.This
reduction was due to the timing of the sales 
of these operations to Countrywide plc in
October giving only nine months’ sales in 2004
compared to the full year 2003.
Lending related income increased to £41.6
million from £37.0 million due to increased
income from securitisation vehicles, increased
fee income generated from new sales and our
larger residential mortgage portfolio.
Other non-interest income fell to £11.1 million
from £15.5 million.The largest part of this fall
was due to lower income from the sale and
leaseback of properties of £6.4 million
compared to £8.1 million in 2003.
Operating costs
Operating costs fell by 7%, with the Group
cost:income ratio improving to 61.1% from
63.3% and the cost:income ratio in the core
business improving to 50.3% from 51.3%.
Staff related costs fell by £19.8 million.This is
as a result of the combined effect of reducing
the number of people employed in the core
business from 3,781 to 3,152 at the end of
the year and the sales of the non-core
businesses.The cost saving generated by
improving the focus and efficiency of the core
business will yield further benefits in 2005.
Premises costs declined by 11% to £30.5
million.The main driver of this reduction is
again, the business disposals. Marketing and
other operating costs were similar year on
year for the Group as a whole.
Depreciation costs dropped significantly in the
year by 26% mainly due to removal of systems
and equipment as part of the restructuring of
the business.
The business disposals led to goodwill and
premium amortisation reducing by 14% as the
Group wrote off the goodwill associated with
the discontinuing businesses.
Exceptional items
Exceptional costs of £31.4 million were
incurred in continuing operations, of which
£7.7 million was due to redundancy costs
associated with the cost reduction programme
in the core business.The remainder is a
provision for potential compensation payments
to customers for business written in the past
by our independent advisory business.
A further £20.3 million exceptional costs were
incurred in discontinued operations.Within this
total, £13.4 million is to provide for future
compensation claims by customers for business
written in the non-core operations.The
remainder is the cost of writing off assets that
are no longer required as a result of the sale
of the non-core businesses.
A loss on sale of £123.2 million was incurred
for the non-core business disposals.The surplus
of consideration over net assets sold of £9.7
million was offset by goodwill write-offs of

million.These costs included redundancy costs
for staff not transferring with the divested
businesses, separation and termination costs for
IT, property and vehicle contracts and
professional fees.
Bad Debt Provision
Reflecting the quality of our lending portfolio,
a release of £2.0 million has been made to
the Profit and Loss account during 2004.This
is due to the low level of arrears across our
loan portfolio plus recoveries against balances
previously written off as bad debts.The Group
continues to take a conservative approach to
lending and provisioning.
T otal provisions on the balance sheet have
reduced in 2004.The amount we set aside to
provide against losses in our residential
mortgages, securitised mortgages and
commercial loan portfolios totals £53.1 million
(0.18% of the total lending managed assets), a 
reduction of £7.6 million overall.The amount of
specific provision against loans in arrears
decreased by £2.5 million to £3.0 million.This
reduction was due to the continuing low levels
of arrears and house price inflation in addition
to increased recoveries across our loan
portfolio. General provisions against the
statistical likelihood of losses across all our
portfolios have declined overall by £5.1 million,
this reduction largely arising within our
securitisation vehicles.The low level of
provisions is the result of our lending policies
and the benign conditions experienced in the
markets in which we operate. Despite interest
rates increasing in 2004, the market remains
stable and the economic conditions favourable.
Taxation
The tax charge for 2004 was different to the
standard rate of corporation tax in the UK
(30%).The differences are explained in the
following table.
Based upon a profit on ordinary activities
before tax and exceptional items of £280.2
million (2003: £264.0 million), the total tax
charge is £77.0 million (2003: £72.5 million
excluding exceptional tax credit).This equates
to an underlying effective tax rate of 27.5%
(2003: 27.5%).

Business segment performance
Lending
The Lending business continued to deliver
strongly, increasing pre-tax profits by 9% to
£249.6 million demonstrating that our selective
lending strategy continues to reap rewards.
The balance sheet has continued to show
healthy growth with total managed lending
balances growing 12% to £28.9 billion (2003:
£25.9 billion).
Gross new lending, including book acquisitions,
fell by 7% to £9.2 billion with portfolio
acquisitions reducing by around £0.1 billion
and commercial property advances reducing
by £0.7 billion. New residential lending of 
£7.7 billion was in line with last year.
T otal redemptions were £6.1 billion, of which
£4.8 billion related to residential lending, a
redemption rate of 23.1%. Buy-to-let loans
typically have longer average lives and lower
redemption rates than traditional mortgages. In
2004 this remains the case, and the redemption
rate on our buy-to-let loans was 14.2%
compared to 24.5% for the UK mortgage
market as a whole. Self-cert loans tend to have
a shorter average life of around three years but
are priced accordingly. Our standard mortgages
continued to redeem at a rate in line with the
market as a whole. Commercial property
redemptions increased significantly by £0.6
billion, reflecting the competitive nature of the
market. Net interest income grew by 6% to
£272.7 million as income from our growing
mortgage book flowed through. Net interest
margin in Lending fell from 1.17% to 1.07% 
as income from increased balances was partly
off-set by margin declines due to increased cost
of funds and the on-going decline of the back
book. Interest spreads on our selective lending
products continued to remain high relative to
the majority of the mortgage market.
Increased fee generation from new residential
loan origination, higher redemption fees and
income from the securitisation vehicles
combined to increase non-interest income
within the Lending business by 12% to £41.6
million, helping total lending income to grow by
7% to £314.3 million.
Operating costs increased by £6.8 million, mainly
due to the cost of changing processes and
systems in readiness for mortgage regulation
impacts during the final quarter of 2004.
The mix of new lending reflects our
commitment to developing the business within
niche sectors of the market that provide an
attractive risk/reward balance. Residential new
lending, including portfolio acquisitions, was
split 62% buy-to-let loans, 27% self-cert loans,
9% standard loans with the remaining 2%
being other specialist loans (2003: 62%, 20%,
12%, 6% respectively).

Group Finance Director’s review
Residential managed balances at the year end
were split 53% buy-to-let loans, 15% self-cert
loans, 26% standard loans with the remaining
6% being other specialist loans (2003: 44%,
10%, 40%, 6% respectively).
Our Commercial Property and Housing
Association lending business saw modest growth
in 2004.We made the decision in the first half of
the year to play a limited role in these markets
due to the tough trading conditions as a result of
investment funds switching part of their
portfolios away from equities into other assets,
including property.As a result, redemptions were
high in the year at £1.4 billion. New lending
activity in the second half helped to increase
balances marginally by £0.1 billion in the year.
Commercial Property and Housing Association
accounted for 16% of new lending and 18% of
total managed loan balances.
Residential arrears
The level of arrears remains low. Over the last
few years, arrears and bad debts have fallen
consistently as interest rates have been reduced
to historically low levels, unemployment has
been low and house prices have consistently
increased. During 2004, bank base rates were
increased four times and, despite continued low
unemployment and house price increases,
arrears have inevitably started to rise.The
amount of arrears across our portfolio remains
very low and our provisions are adequate to
ensure any losses are well contained.
Treasury and Reserves
Treasury and Reserves income fell in 2004 to
£54.9 million. Interest rates rose throughout
the year, as a consequence interest earnings
on the Group’s reserves increased. However
the downgrade in the Group’s credit rating in
the second quarter slightly increased the cost
of wholesale funding, lowering earnings.Total
funding from the wholesale markets
increased during the year, though its
percentage of the Group’s funding mix
remained broadly static at 43%.
In this challenging environment Treasury has
focused on diversifying the mix of funding, an
example being the issue of a €2 billion covered
bond in May 2004 and a new securitisation
issue of £2.0 billion. Operating costs 
increased only marginally to £8.2 million despite
the additional complexity and volume of
funding activity undertaken.
Retail
The shape of what was formerly the Group’s
Distribution business changed significantly in
2004.We are refocusing and simplifying our
core Retail business and have completed the
sale of non-core businesses.
In 2005 we will continue to offer our own
savings, mortgage broking and general insurance
services through our branch network, internet
and direct channels plus investment and
protection services through Legal & General
advisers based in our branch network.
The effect of selling the non-core businesses
part way through the year and the uncertainty
within these businesses during sale and
transition periods has reduced both total
income and expenses.The main aim of the
substantial change in the core Retail business
is to improve its profitability, and it is
encouraging that the profit before tax and
exceptionals from this business increased by
almost 50% to £51.3 million.
Looking forward, the Retail business will consist
of Savings and Core Distribution.These two
business lines are predominantly operated
through our branch network, supported by
other channels.They will, in future, be

Savings
There was strong growth in deposits during
2004 with balances increasing by £1.1 billion
to £16.2 billion.We improved customer
targeting in the branch network and
generated significant balance inflows in the
final quarter following the launch of 
a new internet savings account.This growth 
in balances enabled income to be improved
by 7% to £119.5 million.
Operating costs were well controlled and
remained static with profit before tax
increasing to £32.5 million from £24.0 million.
Continuing (core) Distribution
During the year we refocused this business
with the aim of improving profitability.The
changes made have been at the expense of
top line revenues but have brought a
significant reduction in costs to £49.3 million
(2003: £67.2 million) as the sales management
and support processes have been streamlined.
Profit before tax increased 34% to £27.1
million and the operating margin has improved
from 23% to 36%, showing a much healthier
business moving into 2005.
Discontinued (non-core) Distribution
T otal income within our non-core businesses
for mortgage broking, wealth and general
insurance products fell by 27% to £35.3 million.
T otal income from our property services
businesses fell by 9% to £103.7 million.These
falls mainly reflect the fact that the businesses
were disposed of part way through the year.
A loss before tax and exceptional items of 
£8.3 million was incurred (2003: £9.8 million).
Group Services
Income in Group Services fell to £9.6 million
from £13.5 million.The main element of this
income arises from an ongoing exercise to take
advantage of investor demand for commercial
property and reduce the size of the Group’s
property holding. Profit on sale of properties
totalled £10.5 million in 2004 (2003: £9.0
million). Of these amounts, £6.4 million and
£8.1 million respectively arose from the sale of 
property the Group subsequently leased back
for use in our Retail branch network.
Operating costs increased by £7.4 million,
largely as a result of the costs of handling and
paying compensation in respect of upheld
complaints regarding sales made in prior years
by our independent advisory operation.
Balance sheet
The Group’s total assets increased by 10% to
£35.5 billion during 2004.This increase, once
again, has been due to the success of the
Group’s lending strategy. Redemptions in the
former building society back book continued
with assets reducing by £1.7 billion, though this
rate of decline appears to have levelled out as
the book matures.The commercial property
business experienced difficult trading conditions
and, following a decision to pull back from the
market, assets remained stable. Liquid assets
increased significantly to £8.9 billion.A large part
of the increase is due to the policy to pre-fund
the maturity of a number of wholesale liabilities
occurring in early 2005.The balance sheet

Group Finance Director’s review
in our retail deposits increasing £1.1 billion to
£16.2 billion.The proportion of retail balances
within the Group’s funding mix has remained
stable at 42%. New funding was raised in 2004
through the issue of a cost effective €2 billion
covered bond in May.The continued residential
asset growth enabled the Group to continue to
diversify the liability mix and gain capital
efficiencies by borrowing a further £2.0 billion
of funding through securitised vehicles.
Capital structure
The strong performance of our Lending
business drove an increase in risk weighted
assets of 11.2% to £18.8 billion. Modest
increases in our capital base led to Tier 1 and
Tier 2 ratios reducing to 7.3% from 7.7% and
13.1% from 14.0% respectively.These ratios
are still within our internal targets and
comfortably above regulatory limits.
We continue to ensure that capital is efficiently
managed to equip the business to take
advantage of growth opportunities.We have an
active schedule of work aimed at preparing us
for the changes anticipated from the responses
of the European Union and the FSA to the
proposed Basel II capital adequacy framework.
International Financial Reporting Standards
Listed institutions will be required to report
their Annual Report and Accounts under
International Financial Reporting Standards
(‘IFRS’) for accounting periods commencing
on or after 1 January 2005.We intend to
present to investors and analysts the impact of
IFRS in the second quarter of 2005, following
the restatement of our 2004 accounts.
The overall impact on our restated 2004 profit
before tax and exceptional items is not
expected to be material.We are finalising our
approach to the application of IFRS but
consider that business fundamentals, including
our approach to economic hedging policies
and cashflows, will be substantially unchanged.
Uncertainty still remains on the exact
application of regulatory capital and taxation
rules to IFRS accounts, but we are remaining in
close contact with the FSA and Inland Revenue
with the support of our professional advisers.
Risk management and control
In the ordinary course of business, the Group
is exposed to, and manages a variety of risks,
with operational, credit, market and liquidity
risk being of particular significance.The
management of risk is fundamental to the
Group, with the Board having responsibility for
the overall system of internal control and for
reviewing its effectiveness.
The Board has delegated specific risk
monitoring and control responsibilities to the
Audit Committee, the Group Risk Committee
and the Asset & Liability Management
Committee (‘ALCO’).
Each business area within the Group is
responsible for the identification and assessment
of their particular risk exposures, and
implementing risk management policies, limits
and procedures as approved by the Board.
The key areas of risk the Group faces are
discussed below.
Operational risk
Operational risk is defined as the potential risk
of financial loss or impairment to reputation
resulting from inadequate or failed internal
processes and systems, from the actions of
people or from external events.The Group’s
business units manage this risk through
appropriate controls and loss mitigation actions,
including insurance.These actions include a
balance of policies, appropriate procedures and
internal controls to ensure compliance with laws
and regulations. In addition, specialist support
functions provide expertise in operational risk
areas such as information security, financial
services compliance, fraud management, security
and business continuity management.
Credit risk
Credit risk is defined as the potential of
financial loss if counterparties (borrowers) are
not able to meet their obligations as they fall

Annual Report & Accounts

due.The Group is firmly committed to the
management of this risk in both its lending
and wholesale money market activities. In its
core lending activities, the Group employs
sophisticated credit scoring, underwriting and
fraud detection techniques that support
sound credit decision making and work to
minimise losses. A proactive approach to the
identification and control of bad and doubtful
debts is maintained in the Credit Risk
Management and Credit Control areas.
Lending policies and limits are reviewed and
approved annually by the Board, with the
attendant credit risk processes defined and
managed centrally.The Group Risk Committee
ensures that any exposure to credit risk,
significant changes in policy, or expansion into
new areas of business remain within overall
risk exposure levels as agreed by the Board.
Authorised credit risk limits for wholesale
money market counterparties reflect the size,
depth and quality of a counterparty’s capital
base and, where published, credit ratings
assigned by the major credit rating agencies.
The policies and limits covering treasury
counterparty credit risk exposure are
reviewed and approved annually by the Board.
Social, environmental and ethical (‘SEE’) risks
Having identified the need to consider SEE risks
within our risk management and control
policies, our Group strategy function now
includes SEE risks on their monthly risk analysis.
Market risk
Market risk is defined as the potential adverse
change in Group income or Group net worth
arising from movements in interest rates,
exchange rates or other market prices. Market
risk exists to some extent in all of the Group’s
businesses. Effective identification and
management of market risk is essential for
maintaining stable net interest income.
Interest rate risk is the most significant form of
market risk to which the Group is exposed. It
arises from mismatches between the repricing
dates of the interest-bearing assets and
liabilities on the Group’s Balance Sheet, and
from the investment profile of the Group’s free
reserves.Treasury is responsible for managing
this exposure within the market risk exposure
limits set out in the Group’s policies.The
Group’s exposure to market risk is governed
by the Balance Sheet Management policy as
approved by the Board.This policy sets out the
nature of the market risks that may be taken
along with aggregate risk limits, and stipulates
the procedures, instruments and controls to be
used in managing market risk.
The Board has delegated responsibility for
managing the Group’s exposure to market risk
to the ALCO. It is the ALCO’s responsibility to
approve strategies for managing market risk
exposures and ensuring that Treasury
implements the strategies so that the exposures
are managed within the Group’s approved
policy limits.The ALCO meets regularly and
reviews reports and other analyses showing the
Group’s exposure to market risk.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group raises and invests funds in
currencies other than sterling. Accordingly,
foreign exchange risk arises from activities
related to the Group managing borrowing
costs and investment returns. As with interest
rate risk,Treasury is responsible for managing
this exposure within the limits as set out in
the Group’s policies.
Foreign exchange risk is managed primarily
through the use of currency swaps and forward
foreign exchange contracts. It can also be
managed, when appropriate, by foreign currency
denominated liabilities being matched with assets
denominated in the same foreign currency.
Liquidity risk
It is Group policy to ensure that funds are
available at all times to meet the Group’s
obligations, including the withdrawal of
customer deposits, the draw-down of customer
facilities and growth in the balance sheet.The
development and implementation of liquidity
policy is the responsibility of the ALCO.
The day-to-day management of liquidity is the
responsibility of Treasury, which provides
funding to, and takes surplus funds from, each of
the Group’s businesses as required. Liquidity
policy is approved by the Board and agreed
within a framework established by the FSA.
Regulatory guidelines and potential outflows of
funds drive the scope and nature of the Group’s
holdings of readily realisable liquid assets.
Derivatives
The Board, through the Balance Sheet
Management policy, has authorised the use of
certain derivative instruments for the
purposes of supporting the strategies and
operational business activities of the Group,
and for managing the risk of loss arising from
adverse changes in interest rates and foreign
exchange rates.
Detailed disclosures on interest rate risk,
foreign exchange risk, and the use of derivatives
are set out in Note 33 to the Financial
Statements in accordance with FRS 13,
‘Derivatives and other Financial Instruments’.

Corporate governance
The new Combined Code (the ‘Code’) was
issued by the Financial Reporting Council and
came into effect for reporting years
commencing on or after 1 November 2003.
Each provision set out in the new Code was
reviewed and, where necessary, steps were
taken to ensure that the Company would be
able to comply with the provisions.The
Directors are pleased to report that throughout
the year ended 31 December 2004, the
Company complied with the provisions of the
Code except with regard to the membership 
of the Remuneration Committee. For practical
reasons associated with appointing another
Non-executive Director to provide fully
independent membership, Rod Kent remained 
a member of the committee until 31 January
2004. He was replaced by Ian Cheshire.This
Corporate Governance Report coupled with
the Directors’ Remuneration Report, explains
how the Company has applied the governance
principles set out in the Code.
The Board
The Directors satisfied the main and supporting
principles and provisions of the Code by
adopting the following procedures and policies:
• The Board met twelve times during the year.
This included one meeting devoted entirely
to strategic matters. In addition, the Chairman
held two meetings with the Non-executive
Directors without the Executive Directors
being present. One meeting of the Non-
executive Directors chaired by the Senior
Independent Director was also held without
the Chairman present.
• The roles of Chairman and Group Chief
Executive are distinct and the offices are held
by different people – Rod Kent and Steven
Crawshaw respectively.The roles of each are
recorded in writing and have been agreed by
the Board.
• The Board consists of a Non-executive
Chairman, five independent Non-executive
Directors and three Executive Directors.The
five independent Non-executive Directors
bring wide experience from varied
backgrounds to the workings of the Board
and the Board considers that all independent
Directors meet the independence criteria set
out in the Code.
• The recognised Senior Independent Director
is George Cox, who took on this role at the
beginning of 2004.
• The purpose of the Board is to govern the
Group’s strategic direction, supervise its
operational management and define and
monitor acceptable risk parameters for the
Group.The Board has adopted a structure of
mandates, granted to individuals and
committees throughout the Group, whilst
retaining specified matters for its exclusive
decision.The specified matters include the
approval of interim and final financial
statements, the approval of recommendations
in connection with the payment of dividends,
approval of corporate governance
arrangements, the approval of the Group’s
strategic direction and the approval of various
policies to be adopted by the Group.The
mandate structure enables authorised
individuals to approve levels of expenditure
and commit to contracts or other
agreements in the normal course of business.
• The Board reviews its constitution every year
and during 2004 the Chairman introduced
and took the lead role in the evaluation of
the performance of the Board, the principal
committees and the performance and
commitment of each Director.The process
included detailed questionnaires, one-to-one
interviews with the Chairman and a full
discussion at a Board Meeting. George Cox,
the Senior Independent Director, led the
Non-executive Directors in the evaluation of
the Chairman.The views of the Executive
Directors were taken into account and a
separate meeting, at which the Chairman was
not present, was held for the purpose.
All Directors are subject to election by
shareholders at the first AGM after their
appointment by the Board and each Director is
subject to re-appointment every three years in
accordance with the Articles of Association.The
Board has decided that Rod Kent, Nicholas
Cosh and Steven Crawshaw will retire by
rotation and seek re-appointment by
shareholders at the AGM in 2005. Following
the evaluation process these re-appointments
were considered by the Nominations
Committee which recommended to the Board
that the performance of the three individuals
concerned was effective and that their
commitment exemplary. Further information
about the recommended re-appointments is
included in the Notice of the AGM.
• An appropriate training programme is
established for new Directors to ensure that
they are fully conversant with their
responsibilities as a Director and with the
business of the Group. During 2004, Louise
Patten, as a new Director, attended induction
meetings, presentations and visits to various
sites to enhance her understanding of the
Group.Throughout their period in office all
Directors are updated on Group business, the
competitive and regulatory environment in
which it operates and other changes as they
occur, via presentations at Board or committee
meetings, as appropriate.
• All Directors have access to the advice and
services of the Company Secretary who is
responsible for ensuring that Board
procedures, and applicable rules and
regulations are observed.The Company
Secretary also assists the Chairman in
Bradford & Bingley is committed to high standards
of corporate governance in its business. 24 Bradford & Bingley plc

facilitating the Directors’ training.The Directors
are able to take independent professional
advice at the Company’s expense.
Principal Board committees
The Directors govern the Group through
Board meetings and a number of committees,
each of which has detailed terms of reference.
The three principal Board committees are the
Audit, Remuneration and Nominations
Committees.The Audit and the Remuneration
Committees comprise only independent Non-
executive Directors.The terms of reference of
all these committees are available on request to
the Registered Office and by visiting the the
‘Corporate Governance’ section within the ‘Our
Business’ part of the www.bbg.co.uk website.
The Audit Committee monitored the
effectiveness of the Group’s risk management
processes and its financial and other internal
control systems, including effective internal
audit, risk management and compliance
functions. In particular, the committee received
regular reports on the key risks to the business
arising from the cost base review and the
disposals of the non-core businesses.The
committee also reviewed the Group’s
accounting policies, financial statements and
external reporting responsibilities as well as
monitoring the implementation of the response
to new mortgage regulation introduced during
2004. It met with the external auditors and
received all reports by them formerly
addressed to the Group.The committee
reviewed the arrangements for staff to raise
concerns about possible improprieties in the
area of financial reporting or other issues.The
committee also undertook corporate
governance and other duties as required under
the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000
and applicable regulations made under it.As a
result of the evaluation of the operation of the
Audit Committee, a number of administrative
changes were introduced to further improve
the execution of its responsibilities.
The Committee also considered the position
of the auditors including any risk of conflict of
interest.The Group recognises the importance
of internal and external auditor independence
and has adopted principles to safeguard this,
as follows:
• the Group will continue, where appropriate, to
use the external auditor for non-audit work;
• the Group recognises the need for
transparency around the services being
provided and for a central independent
overview.This is provided by the Audit
Committee which monitors audit and non-
audit fees paid; and
• there is an appropriate approval process for
non-audit work to ensure the auditors’
independence is not compromised.
The members of the committee are Stephen
Webster (Chairman), Ian Cheshire and
Nicholas Cosh.The Board is satisfied that at
least one member of the committee has
recent and relevant financial experience.
The Remuneration Committee reviewed the
remuneration policy for the Group, the
contractual arrangements of the Executive
Directors and the Chairman’s remuneration.
The Committee also reviewed the structure of
the share plans operated by the Company and
the grants of options and awards made under
the schemes established by the Company.
(Further detail is provided in the Directors’
Remuneration Report on pages 28 to 36).The
members of the committee are George Cox
(Chairman), Ian Cheshire and Louise Patten.
The Nominations Committee reviewed the
composition of the Board and recommended
Directors for re-appointment at the AGM
based on the performance evaluation results.
Whilst no new external appointments were
considered during 2004, the existing succession
plans were utilised when Christopher
Rodrigues resigned as Group Chief Executive
in March.The Board unanimously agreed to
appoint Steven Crawshaw as Group Chief
Executive based on the succession plans.The
members of the committee are Rod Kent
(Chairman), Nicholas Cosh, George Cox,
Louise Patten and Steven Crawshaw (from
April 2004 to replace Christopher Rodrigues).

shareholder base, whether to institutional
investors, private or employee shareholders.The
Summary Financial Statement, which details key
facts about the Group’s performance, is
distributed to those private shareholders who
have requested it.All Annual Reports and AGM
documents, announcements, presentations and
press releases are available on our
www.bbg.co.uk website.The Company engages
in two-way communication with institutional
shareholders, fund managers and analysts to
discuss publicly available information on its
strategy, performance and policies.The Board
receives feedback on these communications
from the Directors attending the meeting, and is
also regularly apprised of comments from
institutional shareholders and analysts so that all
Directors can develop a balanced understanding
of the issues and concerns of shareholders.The
Chairman and Senior Independent Director are
available to meet shareholders on request and
will ensure that the Board is aware of any
shareholder concerns not resolved through the
usual investor communications routes.The
Senior Independent Director, together with the
Chairman, attended a series of meetings with
major shareholders early in 2004 to discuss the
introduction of a new incentive plan prior to it
being considered at the AGM.
At each AGM there is a review of the Group’s
performance and the Board welcomes the
opportunity to gather the views and take
questions from shareholders.
In connection with the AGM, the Company
discloses the level of proxy voting (including for,
against and abstentions), separates resolutions
and has a policy that the committee chairmen
should attend the Meeting. In addition, the
Notice of the AGM and any related papers are
sent out to arrive at least 20 business days
before the Meeting to ensure that shareholders
have sufficient time in which to consider the
items of business.
Internal control
The Board is responsible for the Group’s
system of internal control and for reviewing its
effectiveness.The system of internal control is
designed to ensure effective and efficient
operations and compliance with relevant laws
and regulations. Such a system can only
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance
against material misstatement or loss, as it is
designed to manage rather than eliminate the
risk of failure to achieve business objectives.
Throughout the year ended 31 December
2004 the Group has operated a system of
internal control, which includes an ongoing risk
management process for identifying, evaluating
and managing the significant risks faced by the
Group. During the year the Board has
continued to review and, where necessary,
update the risk management process and the
policies and procedures by which these
significant risks are managed.The Board has
also performed its annual assessment of the
effectiveness of internal controls.
Changes in financial regulation continue within
the industry, and the Group’s risk management
processes are designed to operate to ensure
that the Group responds appropriately both
to actual and proposed regulatory changes.
The Group’s management operate a risk
management process, producing a Group-wide
risk profile that identifies the Group’s significant
risks, the probability of those risks occurring and
their impact should they occur, and has the
prime responsibility for the design and operation
of suitable controls and mitigating actions.The
risk management process is complemented by a
formalised reporting and escalation process for
control issues. Internal audit has a key role in
maintaining the control environment by
providing independent assurance on the
effectiveness of the Group’s internal control
systems.The Group Risk Committee oversees
the risk management process, considers the
Group-wide risk profile regularly and receives
monitoring reports to update it on progress.
Further information on risk management and
control is set out on pages 16 and 17.
The Group is committed to developing and
maintaining an appropriate risk management
culture in all areas.This is achieved through an
organisational structure with clear reporting
lines and governed by appropriate business
monitoring mechanisms, codes of conduct and
policy statements.
The system of internal control has been in
place throughout 2004 and up to the date of
approval of the Annual Report & Accounts. It
accords with the guidance from the Turnbull
Committee. In reviewing the effectiveness of
this system, the Board takes into account the
work of the Audit Committee, which receives
reports from the Group Risk Committee on
the Group’s significant risks and how these are
being managed.The Board also considers
reports from internal audit, external audit,
compliance and management on the system of
internal control, adherence to regulatory
requirements and material control weaknesses,
together with actions taken to address them.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee reports
on the outcome of each meeting to the Board,
where appropriate, and the Board also receives
minutes of these Committee meetings.
Going concern
The Directors confirm they are satisfied 
that the Company has sufficient resources 
to continue in operation for the foreseeable
future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt
the going concern basis in preparing the
Financial Statements. 26 Bradford & Bingley plc

Doing the right thing in the marketplace
Our philosophy for doing business in 2004
remained constant – finding what is best for
the customer.
We have undergone a strategic refocus
towards our core businesses of specialist
lending and branch-based provision of financial
services. Bradford & Bingley’s Retail business
now offers one of the widest ranges of both
financial services products and providers on
the High Street.We are committed to
providing good value, competitively 
priced products for our customers.
In last year’s CSR report, we stated the goal 
of increasing access to Socially Responsible
Investment (‘SRI’) products.With the
announcement of our partnership with 
Legal & General, Bradford & Bingley and its
customers are able to access the SRI funds
offered by Legal & General.
Mortgage Express is the specialist lending arm
of Bradford & Bingley. It provides a range of
specialist mortgages including buy-to-let, lifetime
and self-certified. It has the largest buy-to-let
customer base in the UK and a strong position
in the lifetime mortgage market.This is a
solution for homeowners over the age of 60
who want to release some of the equity they
have built up in their properties to enhance
their lifestyle in retirement.
Mortgage Express is a member of Safe Home
Income Plans (‘SHIP’). SHIP is the UK’s leading
professional body for equity release providers,
launched in 1991 and dedicated entirely to
the protection of planholders and promotion
of safe home income and equity release plans.
Mortgage Express observes the SHIP Code 
of Practice which has been welcomed by 
Age Concern. More details about SHIP are
available on its www.ship-ltd.org website.
Our Housing Finance business has continued
lending to housing associations, not-for-profit
organisations which provide homes for those
in housing need.We have provided loans to
over 135 housing associations and now
finance approaching 100,000 social rented
homes throughout the UK (2003: 130 housing
associations, 90,000 social rented homes).
Doing the right thing in the workplace
Our employment practices continue to reflect
the human rights standards enshrined in the
United Nations Universal Declaration of
Human Rights and the International Labour
Organisation Conventions, and cover such
items as minimum working age, working
hours, health and safety and discrimination.
We believe it is important to promote diversity
and equality across all aspects of working life
and we support the sharing of best practice
and success.We are members of Employers’
Forum on Disability, Employers’ Forum on Age,
Race for Opportunity and Opportunity Now.
We were awarded the ‘two ticks’ symbol by the
Employment Service in June 1995.This
publicises our commitment to people with
disabilities. Using the ‘two ticks’ symbol means
we are working towards the guidelines in the
Employment Service Code of Good Practice
on the Employment of Disabled People.
Women now occupy 44% of management roles
(2003: 36%) and 23% of senior management
roles (2003: 19%) within the Group.Women
represent 22% of the Board (2003: 18%).
Ethnic minorities make up 11% of our
workforce (2003: 13%) and occupy 7% of
management roles (2003: 9%). Bradford 
& Bingley continues to support and work 
with Quest for Economic Development
(‘QED’), an organisation supporting the South
Asian community within the UK.We provide
prayer rooms at our main operational sites for
all our employees and information on different
religions and cultures with dates of religious
festivals and events has been published on our
intranet site to help in raising awareness and
We are committed to conducting our business
in a socially responsible manner. 27 Bradford & Bingley plc

understanding amongst all our employees.
We ensured that we addressed the impact of
the Disability Discrimination Act in time for its
implementation in October 2004. Employees
completed a national programme of training
to ensure they were aware of the implications
of the Act and could offer the highest level of
service to all our customers.
We now have induction loops in all branches,
and have improved wheelchair access and
introduced power assisted doors across the
branch network.We continue to provide
customers with literature in different formats,
such as Braille, audio and large print. In
conjunction with the Royal National Institute
for the Deaf (‘RNID’) we provide sign
language and a manual interpreting service
and offer RNID’s Typetalk service.
In 2004, we re-launched our Flexible Working
Policy. Although the legal right to request
flexible working applies to eligible employees
with children under six or disabled children
under eighteen, Bradford & Bingley has
extended the policy to allow all employees to
request flexible working.
The health and safety of all Bradford & Bingley
employees is very important to the Group.
We are committed to being proactive in the
prevention of work related ill health and
injuries and to fostering a positive culture of
wellbeing. Robert Dickie, Group Operations
Director, is the Board Director responsible for
health and safety.
We continue to encourage employees to
benefit from the Group’s success through
share schemes. Currently, 52% of employees
hold at least one Sharesave account (2003:
52%), enabling employees to save to buy
Bradford & Bingley shares.
In addition to carrying out our annual survey of
all staff, we encourage and value feedback from
staff and have continued to develop our online
feedback scheme which guarantees a reply to
staff within two working days.We also promote
the feedback scheme through our internal
magazine, Frontline, which is distributed to staff.
Doing the right thing in the community
This year, Bradford & Bingley saw an increase
in the investment in the community
programme of 27% to £1.3 million; (2003:
£1.0 million) and it was the fifth consecutive
year that we invested over £1 million into the
communities in which we live and work.We
have continued to focus on two main areas of
support; preventing and alleviating the causes of
homelessness and employee involvement.
Preventing and alleviating the causes of homelessness
Bradford & Bingley has continued to work
closely with Shelter, the UK campaigning
charity for homeless and badly housed people.
We were delighted this year to receive
recognition for our partnership with Shelter
when Business in the Community awarded us a
‘Big Tick’ in their Awards for Excellence under the
category of the Healthy Communities Award for
building dynamic inclusive communities.
In addition to working with Shelter, Bradford 
& Bingley became a national partner of
Business Action on Homelessness (‘BAOH’),
an action group of Business in the Community.
Steven Crawshaw, Group Chief Executive, is
the Group’s representative on the executive
board of BAOH.
Employee involvement
Bradford & Bingley has seen a large increase in
employee involvement in 2004.All employees
are able to apply for funds to match their own
fundraising efforts. In 2004 we increased the
amount that would be matched to the first
£250 of funds raised per employee (2003:
£200) and 147 employees received matching
totalling £26,908, an increase of 8.6% on 2003
(2003: £24,770).
Bradford & Bingley also match employee
donations through our payroll-giving
programme, Give As Y ou Earn.We continued to
promote the scheme to new and existing
employees via online and internal promotions.
We have seen an increase both in take up and
amount donated and we now have 8.8% of our
workforce donating via Give As Y ou Earn (2003:
8.5%) and we matched £65,900 of employee
donations (2003: £49,335).We also expanded
our reading volunteer scheme to cover
employees in Barnet.We now support three
primary schools across the UK by sending
volunteers into the schools to spend time
reading on a one-to-one basis with pupils over a
ten week period, during which time we have
seen reading ages improve dramatically.
Doing the right thing in the environment
During 2004, Bradford & Bingley commissioned
its first external environmental audit, which 
was carried out by Casella Stanger and was
conducted against the requirements of ISO
14001, the international standard for
environmental management.
The audit recognised that Bradford & Bingley’s
business activities have a relatively low
environmental risk, and indicated the scope for
future objectives and targets.
In 2004 Bradford & Bingley decided to reduce its
environmental impact by starting a process of
making certain departments Carbon Neutral®.
Four departments carried out extensive
information gathering to assess the environmental
footprint of their departments and, following this
collation of information, we worked with Future
Forests to offset the carbon emissions of these
departments by a programme of tree planting.
CSR, Investor Relations, Public Relations and
Housing Finance departments thus all became
Carbon Neutral® departments in 2004. It is the
intention of Bradford & Bingley to increase the
number of departments who are Carbon
Neutral® in 2005. 28 Bradford & Bingley plc
Annual Report & Accounts 
for the year ended 31 December 2004
Directors’ remuneration report
The following report has been prepared in
accordance with the Directors’ Remuneration
Report Regulations 2002 (the ‘Regulations’)
and approved by the Board for agreement
with shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee
The role of the Remuneration Committee
(the ‘Committee’) is to assist the Board in the
development and application of remuneration
policy for the Chairman, the Chief Executive
and Executive Directors.The Committee also
reviews and approves overall remuneration
policy for all staff.The belief is that neither
Directors’ remuneration nor staff pay can be
considered in isolation from one another.
The overall aim of the Committee is to
ensure that the Group has remuneration
policies which attract and retain the right
executives and staff, and which incentivise
them to deliver strong performance in pursuit
of the Group’s plans and objectives.
Committee membership
The Committee is now composed entirely of
independent Non-executive Directors, as
detailed in the table below:
George Cox (Chairman) All year
Rod Kent 1 Jan – 31 Jan 2004
Nicholas Cosh 1 Jan – 11 Feb 2004
Ian Cheshire Commenced 
11 Feb 2004 
Louise Patten All year
George Cox was appointed chairman of the
Committee in November 2003.The Group
Chief Executive, Steven Crawshaw, is
normally invited to attend Committee
meetings for those items other than his own
arrangements. In addition, Andrew Law
(General Manager, Human Resources) is also
available to provide advice.
Attendance at meetings during 2004 is
recorded in the Corporate Governance section
of this Annual Report & Accounts.
Advisers
The Monks Partnership is the Committee’s
appointed independent adviser and provides
no other services to the Group.Towers Perrin
provides external advice to the Board and the
Committee on executive compensation levels,
structure and design.Towers Perrin also
provides services to the Group on employee
reward, retirement and administration. Mercer
Human Resource Consulting is appointed as
the Company’s pension scheme actuaries and
provides advice to the Company on its
pension arrangements.Watson Wyatt
Consultants provide advice to the Committee
on pensions issues.
Remuneration policy 
The Committee considers total remuneration
as its primary measure of reward, and seeks to
provide median remuneration for on target
performance, with the potential to achieve
upper quartile remuneration for outstanding
performance.T otal remuneration for
executives, therefore, is geared heavily towards
performance, whilst base salary increases are
kept in line with those given to all Group
employees.With effect from January 2004, the
Committee has sought to simplify the 
previous arrangements by replacing the three
earlier incentive schemes with a single scheme
that links together short and long
term elements. In particular, the Committee
has determined that share options should no
longer form part of executive remuneration.
In making these changes the Committee has
taken account of the views of shareholders
as well as ongoing developments in
corporate governance and best practice.
The resulting remuneration package
comprises two main components:
• fixed pay, i.e. base salary and benefits
including pension; and
• variable pay, i.e. short-term incentive
delivered in the form of cash and deferred
shares, and a long-term incentive in the form
of matching shares, delivered through a single
scheme, the Executive Incentive Plan (‘EIP’).
The longer term elements of the earlier,
discontinued schemes will still apply in the
current and following two years, so the full
effect of the simplified approach will not be felt
in terms of simplified reporting immediately.
As Figure 1 illustrates, at ‘target’
performance levels, where matching shares
commence to vest, a significant proportion
(48%) of the total remuneration package is
dependent on performance. Similarly, at
‘upper end’ performance, the variable pay
element accounts for over three-quarters of
the total package.
Similar to last year, the relative importance
of performance and non-performance
related elements of remuneration for the
purposes of the Regulations, have been
determined according to a number of
assumptions on the Company’s share price
growth over the next three years. For the
purposes of this year’s chart the value of
pensions has been excluded in calculating
benefits, as these values can vary significantly
from year to year and person to person.
Going forward, therefore, the main
remuneration principles are to:
• provide Executive Directors and senior
executives with competitive levels of total
remuneration with respect to comparable
companies in UK financial services sector
when shareholders benefit from high
returns; and 29 Bradford & Bingley plc
Annual Report & Accounts 
for the year ended 31 December 2004
• facilitate Executive Directors building a
significant stake in the Company and hence
maintain alignment with shareholder interests.
The criteria and performance levels are set
at the start of each year. Once set, they
would not normally be adjusted during the
course of the year. However, in the first part
of 2004 they were changed in line with the
major overhaul of the Group’s strategy. New
criteria were added relating to the
reduction in the Group’s underlying cost
base and the new focus on the profitability
of the core businesses.
The following sections of this report address
the current elements of executive
remuneration, the previous executive incentive
plans where grants that were made in 2001 to
2004, executive benefits, contracts and variable
pay plans open to all employees.
Fig.1-T otal remuneration at ‘target’ performance
T otal remuneration at ‘upper end’ performance
Current elements of remuneration
Base salary
Base salaries for Executive Directors are
reviewed annually in April where consideration
of wider remuneration and employment factors
elsewhere in the Company are also taken into
account. In 2004, base salary increases were in
line with similar rates of increase in the rest of
the organisation and a similar policy will be
adopted for 2005. Base salary is the only
element of pay that is pensionable.
The Executive Incentive Plan
In 2004, the Committee proposed and the
shareholders approved the replacement of
the current short and long-term incentive
plans for senior executives with the new EIP
which is a single plan that encompasses both
annual and three-year performance.
The EIP will apply to those individuals 
whose personal performance has a
significant impact on the Group’s results,
namely the Executive Directors and other
senior executives (16 in total).
Short-term performance component
Under the EIP , the short-term component is
composed of two parts.
Under the first part, a bonus with an ‘on-
target’ payout of 30% of base salary up to a
maximum of 60% of base salary can be paid
in cash as a reward for the achievement of
pre-determined short-term performance
measures during the year.
The second part consists of an equivalent
amount of deferred shares, which will form a
stake in the longer-term future of the Company.
However, these shares will not vest for three
years, and if a participant leaves the Company,
they will have no automatic right to the shares.
The performance measures selected to
support year-on-year improvement for 2004
were Group profit before tax and exceptional
items, cost and operational measures.
Long-term performance component
If the Company performs well during the
three-year deferral period, participants will be
entitled to an additional award of matching
shares.The performance conditions,
determining the level of match to be applied
to the bonus relating to 2004 performance
(paid in 2005), will be as follows:
Performance Share Match
Compound EPS growth No match
< RPI + 3% pa
Compound EPS growth 1 x match
= RPI + 3% pa
Compound EPS growth 2 x match
= RPI + 5% pa
Compound EPS growth 3 x match
> or = RPI + 8% pa
Matching is calculated on a pro-rata basis
between the above points.The maximum
number of matching shares will be three
matching shares for each deferred share.
Normally, the assessment of short-term,
current year performance would not take
account of exceptional items and the measure
for long-term performance would be the
improvement in basic EPS. However, given the
fundamental change in strategy introduced in
the first part of 2004, it was decided to adjust
for the exceptional items relating to
implementation of the change and exclude
these from the measures.This aligned the
incentives for the executives with what the
Group wanted to achieve during the year and
also avoided setting an artificially low starting
point, in terms of EPS, against which to
measure future, long-term progress.
Previous executive incentive plans
Following the introduction of the new EIP , it is the
intention that no new awards will be made to

existing employees under the Share Option Plan
and Performance Share Plan. Existing awards
under both plans will continue to vest according
to the current terms of each plan.This transitional
phase will last until 2007/8, by which time the last
of these previous schemes will have ‘run off’, and
the shares granted under the first EIP award will
have reached the end of their deferred period.
Final awards under the Performance Share
Plan (‘PSP’) were made in February 2004 to
Executive Directors and 16 other senior
executives. Awards under the PSP will vest
subject to out-performing similar financial
services companies over the longer-term, as
measured by Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’).
The 2004 comparator group is:
Alliance & Leicester Lloyds TSB 
Aviva Northern Rock
Barclays Old Mutual 
Countrywide Prudential
Egg Royal & Sun Alliance
HBOS Royal Bank of Scotland
Legal & General Abbey*
*share price frozen at delisting in November 2004
Under the terms of the 2004 PSP , Executive
Directors received a ‘standard’ award up to a
maximum of one-times basic salary and a
‘stretch’ award of up to a further one-times
basic salary.
Shares are released depending on the
Company’s TSR performance relative to the
performance of the comparator group
companies at the end of three years.There
are different release criteria for the standard
and stretch awards. Under the standard award,
30% vests for median performance rising on a
straight line basis to full vesting for upper
quartile performance. Under the stretch
award vesting commences above median
performance and rises on a straight line basis
such that full vesting occurs at the 85th
percentile or above. Notwithstanding the
comparative TSR performance, the Committee
must also be satisfied that the underlying
financial performance of the Company
warrants vesting.There are no provisions for
re-testing within the rules of the scheme.
The 2001 PSP award vested in full in 2004.The
Company’s TSR performance, relative to the
performance of the comparator group
companies, exceeded an upper quartile position,
and as such, a full award vested. Further details
are contained in the PSP table on page 35.
Final grants of share options were made in 2003,
including Executive Directors who received
option grants to the face value of their basic
salary. In order for the these share options to
become exercisable, the Company’s earnings per
share growth must exceed the increase in the
retail price index by at least 9% over a three
year period.The definition of earnings per share
(‘EPS’), used to assess performance for 2004, is
basic EPS, which assumes earnings to be the
profit of the Group after all payments, including
taxation, are made.This measure was chosen as
the most significant measure of the Company’s
overall financial performance at the time of the
grant. If the performance condition has not been
achieved at the end of three years, the test may
be repeated on three further consecutive
occasions, otherwise the options lapse.
Benefits
In line with typical market practice, executive
benefits are provided in the form of a
company car (or cash allowance), housing
allowance, private medical insurance and
permanent disability and accident insurance.
The pension arrangements for Executive
Directors were reviewed in 2004 and from
April 2005 will require an employee
contribution to maintain existing accrual levels.
In the case of Robert Dickie, pension is
accrued at retirement based on one-fortieth 
of the base salary paid over the prior twelve
months (‘final salary’) for each year of
pensionable service up to 7 August 2003, and
one-thirtieth thereafter. For Steven Crawshaw
and Rosemary Thorne, pension benefits accrue
at one-fortieth for service up to 31 December
2000, and at one-thirtieth thereafter.
The pension scheme provides a lump sum
death-in-service benefit of the higher of four
times basic salary or four times earnings in the
previous tax year, together with spouse’s or
dependants’ pensions.
All final salary pension schemes are coming
under external pressure in relation to tougher
funding requirements, changes in pension
scheme legislation to achieve ‘simplification’ and
changes in state pension age, a reduction in
investment returns and from significant increases
in life expectancy.With this in mind, the pension
arrangements for all employees in the final
salary pension scheme (including Executive
Directors) will change with effect from 1 April
2005, when an optional employee contribution
will be introduced. In addition, the normal
retirement age will increase from 60 to 65.
Contracts
In line with Group policy, all Executive
Directors have service contracts that expire at
their respective normal retirement age, but
the Company has the right to give 12 months’
notice of termination (or payment in lieu) and
the Director may give 6 months’ notice.
Executive Directors receive a maximum of 12
months’ basic salary and other benefits in the

event of the Company terminating the
contract without notice for any reason other
than gross misconduct (when there will be no
compensation).The principle is applied that all
legal and contractual arrangements are met
upon termination, with no additional payments.
The date of each service contract and the age
of each current Executive Director (as at 31
December 2004) are shown in the table on
page 30.
Employee variable pay plans 
The Company continues to encourage wider
share ownership through the use of a savings
related share option scheme and through the
award of restricted shares to key, high-performing
individuals. In 2004 half our employees (including
Executive Directors) participated in the savings
related share option scheme.
Restricted shares are allocated to 
employees following achievement of specified
performance measures.The shares are released
to individuals in tranches annually in three
years following the award or on the third
anniversary of the award, depending on the
conditions under which they are awarded. In
line with the Remuneration policy, in particular
the desire to reward employees through
variable pay, the Group Profit Sharing Plan was
replaced by incentive arrangements specific to
each line of business to help optimise the
reward spend across the Company.
The implementation of IFRS is likely to have
some effect on the application and
measurement of some of the performance
conditions within our variable pay schemes.
The Remuneration Committee will keep these
under review with the aim of applying
consistent treatment across the performance
periods within these plans.
Chairman and Non-executive Directors’ fees 
Fee levels for the Chairman are determined by
the Remuneration Committee with reference
to a similar peer group used for Executive
Directors and other senior executives.
Consistent with current best practice, the
Chairman is not eligible to participate in any
form of performance-related incentive plan.
Fee levels for the Non-executive Directors are
determined by a Committee, the current
membership being Steven Crawshaw,
Rosemary Thorne and Rod Kent.T owers Perrin
provides independent advice on best practice
and market fee levels, taking into account the
responsibilities and time commitment of each
Non-executive Director.
The Non-executive Directors do not participate
in any incentive arrangements and none of them
have a service contract. Each receives a letter of
engagement indicating that their initial term of
appointment will be three years. Non-executive
Directors do not receive any other benefits.
Non-executive directorships 
Executive Directors who hold non-executive
directorships in other companies are permitted
to retain their earnings from these posts.
Rosemary Thorne is a Non-executive Director of
Cadbury Schweppes plc.The Non-executive
Directors of Cadbury Schweppes have chosen to
utilise a percentage of their fees (between 50%
and 60%) to purchase shares in the Company,
which are bought within five business days of
each relevant payment.
Each Non-executive Director has undertaken
to hold such shares during the term of his or
her appointment. Rosemary received a fee of
£14,000 for the period of her appointment
from 6 September 2004 to 2 January 2005.
Performance graph 
Bradford & Bingley is now a constituent member
of the FTSE 250 Index rather than the FTSE 100
index.T o reflect this change, the Company has
also decided to change TSR comparator groups
for the purpose of the Regulations. Figure 2
therefore shows Bradford & Bingley’s TSR
compared with the companies comprising the
FTSE 250 Index for the period from flotation on
4 December 2000 to 31 December 2004.
Use of TSR comparator groups to measure
performance only applies to earlier executive
incentive plans.
Compliance
This report sets out the framework of our
remuneration policies and the tables show
how this framework is applied to each
individual Director in the year under review.
The tables on pages 32 to 36 have been

Notes
Pension disclosures are reported above in accordance with the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.The transfer values reported
above reflect the capital value of the relevant pension assessed under market conditions at the end of 2004 and 2003 respectively.The increase in
accrued pension entitlement represents the change in the annual pension to which each Director is entitled as a result of changes in pensionable
earnings, excluding inflation, and increases in pensionable service.
The accrued pension figure for Steven Crawshaw allows for the fact that his total pension at normal retirement date will be restricted to 2/3rds
of his final pensionable salary (‘FPS’), offset by his retained benefits held in other pension schemes.The accrued pension figure for Robert Dickie
allows for the fact that his pension at normal retirement date will be restricted to 2/3rds of his FPS, offset by his retained benefits held in other
pension schemes and a change of accrual rate backdated to 1 August 2003.The transfer values for Steven Crawshaw and Robert Dickie have
been restated as at 31 December 2003 to reflect the restated accrued pension figures.
Christopher Rodrigues left the Group on 31 March 2004 with a deferred pension of £113,250.
Under the terms of the contract agreed with the Group, Ian Darby will continue to receive Group pension contributions until his contract expires
on 12 August 2005.
In 2004 pension payments to former Directors amounted to £0.3m (2003: £0.2m). 34 Bradford & Bingley plc

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The following statement, which should be read
in conjunction with the statement of the
Auditor’s responsibilities on page 38, is made by
the Directors to explain their responsibilities.
The Directors are required by the Companies
Act 1985 to prepare Financial Statements for
each financial year which give a true and fair
view of the state of affairs of the Company
and the Group as at the end of the financial
year and of the profit or loss for the financial
year.The Directors are required to prepare
the Financial Statements on the going concern
basis unless it is not appropriate.
The Directors consider that, in preparing 
the Financial Statements on pages 39 to 74,
they have used appropriate accounting
policies, consistently applied and supported 
by reasonable and prudent judgements 
and estimates and that all accounting 
standards which they consider applicable 
have been followed.
The Directors have responsibility for 
ensuring that the Company keeps accounting
records which disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position
of the Company and which enable them to
ensure that the Financial Statements comply
with the Companies Act 1985.
The Directors have general responsibility 
for taking such steps as are reasonably open 
to them to safeguard the assets of the 
Group to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities.

Independent auditor’s report
to the members of Bradford & Bingley plc
We have audited the financial statements on
pages 39 to 74.We have also audited the
information in the directors’ remuneration
report on pages 32 to 36.
This report is made solely to the company’s
members, as a body, in accordance with
section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our
audit work has been undertaken so that we
might state to the company’s members those
matters we are required to state to them in an
auditor’s report and for no other purpose.To
the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not
accept or assume responsibility to anyone
other than the company and the company’s
members as a body, for our audit work, for this
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors 
and auditors
The directors are responsible for preparing the
Annual Report and the directors’
remuneration report. As described on page 37,
this includes responsibility for preparing the
financial statements in accordance with
applicable United Kingdom law and accounting
standards. Our responsibilities, as independent
auditors, are established in the United Kingdom
by statute, the Auditing Practices Board, the
Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority,
and by our profession’s ethical guidance.
We report to you our opinion as to whether
the financial statements give a true and fair view
and whether the financial statements and the
part of the directors’ remuneration report to be
audited have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985.We
also report to you if, in our opinion, the
directors’ report is not consistent with the
financial statements, if the company has not kept
proper accounting records, if we have not
received all the information and explanations
we require for our audit, or if information
specified by law or the Listing Rules regarding
directors’ remuneration and transactions with
the group is not disclosed.We review whether
the corporate governance statement on pages
23 to 25 reflects the company’s compliance
with the nine provisions of the 2003 FRC Code
specified for our review by the Listing Rules, and
we report if it does not.We are not required to
consider whether the board’s statements on
internal control cover all risks and controls, or
form an opinion on the effectiveness of the
group’s corporate governance procedures or its
risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in
the Annual Report, including the corporate
governance statement and the unaudited part
of the directors’ remuneration report, and
consider whether it is consistent with the
audited financial statements.We consider the
implications for our report if we become aware
of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the financial statements.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with
Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence
relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements and the part of the
directors’ remuneration report to be audited.
It also includes an assessment of the significant
estimates and judgements made by the
directors in the preparation of the financial
statements, and of whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the group’s
circumstances, consistently applied and
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to
obtain all the information and explanations
which we considered necessary in order to
provide us with sufficient evidence to give
reasonable assurance that the financial
statements and the part of the directors’
remuneration report to be audited are free
from material misstatement, whether caused by
fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming
our opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in
the financial statements, and the part of the
directors’ remuneration report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair
view of the state of affairs of the company
and the group as at 31 December 2004 and
of the profit of the group for the year then
ended; and
• the financial statements and the part of the
directors’ remuneration report to be audited
have been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985.

Annual Report & Accounts 
for the year ended 31 December 2004
Notes to the financial statements
1. Principal accounting policies
The accounting policies have been reviewed in
accordance with the requirements of Financial
Reporting Standard (‘FRS’) No.18 ‘Accounting
Policies’.The Directors consider that the
accounting policies set out below remain most
appropriate to the Company’s circumstances,
have been consistently applied, and are
supported by reasonable and prudent
estimates and judgements.
(a) Basis of preparation 
The accounts have been prepared in
accordance with applicable accounting
standards and decisions of the Urgent Issues
Task Force (‘UITF’) under the historical cost
accounting convention. In addition the accounts
have been prepared in accordance with the
special provisions of Part VII Chapter II of the
Companies Act 1985 applicable to banking
companies and banking groups and in
accordance with the Statements of
Recommended Practice (‘SORPs’) issued 
by the British Bankers’Association.
UITF Abstract 17 ‘Employee Share Schemes
(revised)’ and UITF Abstract 38 ‘Accounting for
ESOP T rusts’ have been fully adopted by the
Group.This adoption has not had any significant
impact on the results for the year or net assets
of the Group. Note 2 provides further detail on
the effect of the adoption.
(b) Basis of consolidation 
The Group accounts consolidate the accounts
of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings,
and other companies which are considered by
the Directors to be quasi-subsidiaries as defined
in FRS No. 5 ‘Reporting the Substance of
Transactions’, all of which have co-terminous
accounting periods.Where subsidiaries have
been acquired during a period, their results have
been consolidated in the financial statements
from the date of acquisition.Where subsidiaries
have been disposed during a period, their results
have been consolidated in the financial
statements up to the date of disposal.
(c) Goodwill 
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary
undertakings represents the difference between
the fair value of the consideration and the
aggregate of the fair values of the separate net
assets acquired. Goodwill is included within
intangible fixed assets and is amortised over a
period appropriate to each acquisition, not
exceeding 20 years.
Any unamortised goodwill on disposal of a
subsidiary undertaking or joint venture is
charged against the sale proceeds.
Impairment reviews are conducted at the end
of the first full year after the year of acquisition
in accordance with accounting standards, or
when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may
not be fully recoverable or the amortisation
period may have reduced.Any shortfalls are
added to the amortisation of goodwill in the
year of the impairment review.
(d) T axation 
The charge for taxation is based on the profit
for the year and takes into account taxation
deferred because of timing differences between
the treatment of certain items for taxation and
accounting purposes. Full provision is made for
deferred taxation in accordance with FRS 19
‘Deferred T ax’.
(e) Fixed assets and depreciation 
The cost of additions and major alterations to
land and buildings, equipment, fixtures and
motor vehicles is capitalised.
Depreciation is provided so as to write off the
cost, less the estimated residual value, of tangible
fixed assets over their useful economic lives.
Depreciation is provided as follows:
• freehold and long leasehold buildings at 2%
per annum on a straight-line basis;
• short leasehold properties are amortised over
the remainder of the lease for a period up to
50 years on a straight-line basis;
• fixtures and fittings at 20% per annum on a
straight-line basis;
• motor vehicles at 25% per annum on a
reducing balance basis;
• computer equipment at rates ranging from
20% to 33% per annum on a straight-line basis;
• software licences of an enduring nature at
rates ranging from 20% to 33% per annum 
on a straight-line basis;
• system development at 20% per annum on a
straight-line basis;
• internet development costs for transactional
based websites at 50% per annum on a
straight-line basis; and
• other equipment and major alterations 
to buildings at 10% per annum on a 
straight-line basis.
Any impairment in the value of freehold and
long leasehold land and buildings is dealt with
through the Profit and Loss Account as it arises.
(f) Leasing 
Rentals under operating leases are charged to
administrative expenses in the year in which the
expenditure is incurred.Assets acquired under 
finance leases are capitalised at fair value at the
start of the lease, with the corresponding
obligations being included in other liabilities.The
finance lease costs charged to the Profit and
Loss Account are based on a constant periodic
rate as applied to the outstanding liabilities.
(g) Debt securities 
Debt securities intended for use on a continuing
basis in the Group’s activities are classified as
investment securities and are stated at cost as
adjusted for the amortisation of any premiums
or discounts arising on acquisition, which are
amortised over the period to redemption on a
level yield basis.Any such amortisation is
included in interest receivable. Provision is made
for any impairment in value. Debt securities are
accounted for on a trade date basis. Each
investment in a structured investment vehicle
(‘SIV’) is individually reviewed to ensure the
accounting treatment is appropriate.
Where the SIV is considered to have minimal
management discretion, the Group recognises
its share of the SIV’s underlying assets and
liabilities. In other cases they are treated as debt
securities. Interest on these vehicles includes a
margin above the coupon rate to reflect profits
earned by the underlying investment.
(h) Pension and post retirement benefits 
The Group charges pension and other post
retirement costs against profits in accordance
with Statement of Standard Accounting
Practice (‘SSAP’) 24 ‘Accounting for Pension
Costs’ using an actuarial method and
assumptions designed to provide for the
anticipated costs over the remaining service
lives of the employees in the scheme.This
method ensures that the regular costs
represent a relatively equal proportion of the
current and expected future pensionable
payroll in the light of current actuarial
assumptions.Any SSAP 24 prepayment or
liability is included in prepayments and accrued
income or other liabilities as appropriate, with
all charges to the Profit and Loss Account,
including interest, in administrative expenses.
Variations from regular cost are spread over the
remaining service lives of current employees in
the scheme.
(i) Provisions for bad and doubtful debts
Provisions for losses on residential loans and
advances to customers are made at the year
end.The basis for determining the level of
provisions is to provide for all reasonably
foreseeable losses that exist in the portfolio at
the date of calculation. 44 Bradford & Bingley plc
Annual Report & Accounts 
for the year ended 31 December 2004
Notes to the financial statements
1. Principal accounting policies – continued
(i) Provisions for bad and doubtful 
debts – continued
Specific provisions for residential lending are
created for cases with arrears to debt ratios of
2.5% or greater.The potential shortfall is
calculated from the outstanding mortgage debt
plus costs of repossession less the estimated
property value with a discount valuation factor
for forced sale.The potential shortfall for each
case is adjusted to reflect the probability of
loss.This adjustment reflects historical
performance except for specialist lending
where, because this area of lending is not yet
mature, probabilities of loss are predicted by
reference to the credit scoring system.
The specific provision for properties in
possession is based on the contracted/agreed
sale price or sale valuation with adjustment
for expenses of sale and income from
insurance policies.
Specific provisions for the commercial
portfolio are calculated on all cases which are
three or more months in arrears. A probability
of loss, dependent on the severity of the
arrears, is applied on a case-by-case basis.
Loans and advances are written off where
there is no realistic prospect of recovery.
General provisions are raised to cover losses
which are judged to be present in loans and
advances at the balance sheet date, but which
have not been specifically identified as such.
The general provision also takes into account
the economic climate in the market and the
level of security held.
Interest charged to all residential and
commercial loans which are in arrears or in
possession, and where the interest is expected
to be irrecoverable, is suspended from other
interest receivable and similar income.
(j) Debt securities in issue and capital
instruments
Debt securities in issue are stated at cost as
adjusted for the amortisation of any premiums
or discounts arising on issue, which are
amortised over the period to redemption on
a level yield basis. Any such amortisation is
included in interest payable.
Premiums or discounts on capital 
instruments are amortised over the period 
to the instruments’ maturity at a constant 
rate and included in interest payable.The
unamortised amounts are deducted from 
the relevant liability. In the event of early
repayment, the unamortised issue cost is
charged to interest payable.
(k) Investments in subsidiary undertakings
Bradford & Bingley plc’s investments in
subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost.
(l) Foreign currencies 
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currency that have been hedged by means of
matching foreign currency contracts are
translated at the exchange rate inherent in
those contracts.Where assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currency have not 
been hedged, they are translated at the rate of
exchange at the balance sheet date.Any gains
or losses are included in interest receivable or
payable depending on the underlying instrument
being an asset or liability.
(m) Mortgage indemnity insurance 
Charges to borrowers in respect of high loan-
to-value advances are paid to a wholly owned
captive insurance company. In the Group
accounts these charges are treated as deferred
income and deducted from loans and advances
to customers.The income deferred is released
to interest receivable on a level yield basis over
the life of the mortgage.
(n) Incentives to customers 
Cashbacks, interest discounts and other
incentives to customers are amortised against
interest receivable over the early redemption
clawback period of these products commencing
from the date of completion. Unamortised
incentives are held within prepayments and
accrued income and other liabilities.
(o) Acquisition of mortgage portfolios
Premiums paid on the acquisition of mortgage
portfolios are held within other assets and
amortised over the estimated economic life of
the underlying asset.Where such mortgage
portfolios are acquired as part of a company
purchase, the resulting charge is included within
administrative expenses.Where such mortgage
portfolios are acquired as a result of a specific
asset purchase, the resulting charge is deducted
from interest receivable.
(p) Loans and advances to customers subject
to non-recourse funding 
Loans and advances to customers subject to
non-recourse funding are included in the
Balance Sheets using the linked presentation
method. Such balances are stated at book value.
The profit on ordinary activities before taxation
is included within other operating income in the
Consolidated Profit and Loss Account.The same
provisioning policies as stated in note (i) above
apply to these loans.
(q) Off-balance sheet financial instruments 
Off-balance sheet financial instruments are
entered into by the Group for hedging
purposes to reduce the risks arising on
transactions entered into in the normal course
of business.The effectiveness of this hedging is
reviewed on a regular basis.The income or
expense arising from off-balance sheet financial
instruments entered into for hedging purposes
is recognised in the accounts in accordance with
the accounting treatment of the underlying
transaction or transactions being hedged.
Where off-balance sheet instruments are
terminated prior to the underlying hedged
transaction terminating, any profits or losses
realised upon early termination are deferred
and matched against the income or
expenditure arising from the underlying
hedged transaction over the remaining period
of the hedged item. If the underlying hedged
transaction is extinguished or terminated, the
remaining unamortised gains or losses on the
hedge are recognised in the Profit and Loss
Account immediately.
The Group does not undertake transactions for
trading or speculative purposes and
consequently all off-balance sheet financial
instruments are classified as hedging contracts.
(r) Income recognition 
• Interest income is recognised in the Profit and
Loss Account as it accrues except where
interest is suspended as set out in accounting
policy note (i) above.
• Commercial lending fees charged in lieu of
interest are recognised in the Profit and Loss
Account as interest receivable as they fall.
• Residential lending fees and commissions
receivable are recognised in the Profit and
Loss Account on receipt within Fees and
Commissions Receivable.
• Commission receivable from Regulated
Financial Services products is recognised as
income within Fees and Commissions
Receivable when the policy goes ‘on risk’, net
of any provision for repayment in the event of
termination by the customer.
• Procurement fees from sale of mortgages are
recognised when the house sale completes
and the mortgage becomes active.
• Client fees are recognised on the exchange of
contract for the relevant property.
• Estate Agency fees on sales of new and
second hand homes are recognised on
exchange of contracts.
(s) Fees payable 
Fees payable to brokers and agents in respect
of the sale of Bradford & Bingley mortgages are
fully expensed as incurred. 45 Bradford & Bingley plc

for the year ended 31 December 2004
2. Change in Accounting Policy
(a) Urgent Issues Task Force (‘UITF’) Abstract 17 ‘Employee Share Schemes (revised)’ and UITF Abstract 38 ‘Accounting for ESOP Trusts’
The Group has implemented the requirements of UITF Abstract 17 ‘Employee Share Schemes (revised)’ in 2004. As a result, the charge to the profit
and loss account in respect of shares and share options granted to employees that are expected to be met from shares held by employee share
trusts is now based on the difference between the value on the date of grant and the exercise price. Previously where shares were purchased to
meet these obligations the charge was based on the carrying value of shares.
The Group has also implemented the requirements of UITF Abstract 38 ‘Accounting for ESOP Trusts’ in 2004.As a result, holdings of ordinary shares in
Bradford & Bingley plc owned by the Group’s employee share ownership trusts, are now shown as a deduction from shareholders’ funds. Previously
they were shown as own shares in the Balance Sheet with a charge to the Profit and Loss Account for costs of shares acquired above their eventual
realisable value. Purchases and sales of Bradford & Bingley plc ordinary shares are now accounted for as movements in shareholders’ funds.
These changes in accounting policy which have been accounted for as a prior year adjustment have a cumulative impact on opening reserves at
1 January 2003 of a decrease of £21.7m.The effect is also to decrease administrative expenses and increase profit before tax by £1.0m in 2003.
The cumulative impact on profit attributable to shareholders is £2.9m.

Notes to the financial statements
33. Derivatives and other financial instruments
(a) Financial instruments and risk management
The Group’s core business is to provide its customers with financial products appropriate to their needs, from mortgages and savings accounts to long-
term investment products and insurance products.The Group uses wholesale financial instruments to invest in liquid assets and to raise funds from
wholesale money markets in support of its retail savings and mortgage operations.These instruments also allow it to manage the risks arising from
these business activities.The Group has a well established formal structure for managing risks which includes formal risk policies, risk limits, reporting
structures, mandates and control procedures.The Group’s approach to risk management and control is set out within the Financial Review on pages 16
to 17.The Board delegates the management of all aspects of market and liquidity risk to the Asset and Liability Management Committee (‘ALCO’).
Financial instruments used by the Group for risk management purposes include off-balance sheet or derivative instruments. Such instruments are
used only to limit the extent to which the Group will be affected by changes in interest rates and exchange rates. As part of its responsibilities,
ALCO approves the use of specified off-balance sheet instruments within approved limits and business activities.
The Group does not undertake transactions for trading or speculative purposes and consequently all off-balance sheet financial instruments are
classified as hedging contracts.The principal off-balance sheet instruments used by the Group in managing its balance sheet risk exposures are
interest rate swaps, interest rate options, interest rate futures, cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts.These are used
to protect the Group from exposures arising principally from fixed and capped rate mortgage lending, fixed rate savings products, deposit funding,
foreign currency exposure and investment activities.The duration of off-balance sheet contracts is generally short to medium-term and their
maturity profile reflects the nature of exposures arising from underlying business activities.
At the year end the Group had no net material exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations or changes in foreign currency interest rates.
(b) Interest rate sensitivity gap
A positive interest rate sensitivity gap exists when more assets than liabilities re-price during a given period. Although net interest income tends to
benefit from a positive gap when interest rates are rising (and a negative gap when rates are falling), the actual effect will depend upon a number
of factors, including the extent to which repayments are made earlier or later than the next reset or maturity date.The following tables analyse
the re-pricing periods of Group assets and liabilities at 31 December 2004 and 31 December 2003:

Where a market exists, market values have been used to determine the fair value of debt securities issued and held.Where no market exists,
discounted cash flow techniques have been used to determine the fair value using market interest rates for the relevant assets.The fair values of
off-balance sheet financial instruments have been determined using market interest rates in discounted cash flow techniques. Fair values of interest
rate caps and collars have been calculated using option-pricing models. 67 Bradford & Bingley plc

35. Retirement benefits
(a) Pension schemes
The Company operates a funded defined benefit staff pension scheme, the Bradford & Bingley Staff Pension Scheme (‘the principal scheme’),
administered by trustees, which is a closed scheme.The fund is independent from those of the Company. The normal pension age of employees
in the scheme is 60 years. Pension costs in the principal scheme are assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary using the
projected unit method.The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 31 October 2003.The aggregate actuarial value of the scheme’s
assets was sufficient to cover 110% of the aggregate benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The aggregate market value of the scheme’s assets held at 31 October 2003 was £352.6m.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments and
the rates of increase in salaries and pensions.The rate of return on investments has been assumed to exceed the rate of salary increases by 2.75%
per annum and to exceed the rate of present and future pensions increase by 3.25% per annum.This latter assumption is different from that used
by the Company and Trustees in determining the contribution rate to the scheme where the investment return is assumed to exceed the rate of
pension increase by 2.25% per annum.
The pension charge takes account of the surpluses disclosed, which are amortised over a period of 11.5 years, being the estimated average
remaining service life of pension scheme members.
The Group also operates one further defined benefit scheme which is not material.
The Group operates a defined contribution scheme, the Bradford & Bingley Group Pension Plan.The fund is independent from those of the Company.
The total pension cost for the Group was £11.1m (2003: £12.8m).
There were no liabilities or prepayments associated with the defined contribution scheme at the year end (2003: £Nil).
(b) Other post-retirement benefits
The Company provides concessionary rate mortgages and health care benefits to some of its pensioners.The cost of health care benefits is
provided for in accordance with the stated accounting policy.The cost of concessionary rate mortgages is not significant and is recognised in the
Profit and Loss Account as it is incurred.
(c) FRS 17 ‘Retirement Benefits’
Whilst the company continues to account for pension costs in accordance with SSAP 24 ‘Accounting for Pension Costs’, the following transitional
disclosures are required by FRS 17 ‘Retirement Benefits’.
The major assumptions used in this valuation were:
2004 2003 2002

(c) FRS 17 ‘Retirement Benefits’ – continued
The SSAP 24 valuation at 31 October 2003 has been updated by the actuary on an FRS 17 basis at 31 December 2004. The demographic
assumptions have not been changed from the ones used in the 31 October 2003 valuation. In particular, the mortality assumptions have not been
updated to reflect the latest available projections.
In respect of the pension scheme, more than one employer contributes to the scheme. As the Group is unable to identify the share of the
underlying assets and liabilities of all subsidiaries in the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis and as prescribed by FRS 17, it has elected
the multi-employer exemption.
The fair value of the schemes’ assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short-term and may be subject to significant change before they are
realised, and the present value of the schemes’ liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and thus inherently uncertain, were:

The total number of members in the scheme as at 31 December 2004 was 616.
Private medical costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary.The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme was as

Notes
(a) In order to analyse net interest by business segment, a transfer price is applied to the internal funding or liquidity requirement of each
segment. Interest rates used for transfer pricing have been determined to retain the interest rate risk within Treasury. Costs have been
assigned to each segment based on resources consumed.Transfer pricing in respect of mortgage origination by the Distribution segment has
been determined on the basis of market rates for such activity.
(b) Exceptionals have not been allocated across business segments since they are the consequence of Group level decisions.
(c) For the purposes of segmental information, net assets have been allocated to Lending, Savings and Distribution on the basis of the regulatory
capital framework.The segments are not allocated capital during the normal course of business, therefore segmental profits do not relate to
these net assets.
(d) The Group operates entirely within the retail financial services sector and accordingly no segmental analysis of turnover has been presented.
Please refer to the Financial Review for more information on segmental performance.

ShareGift
Many investors find themselves owning parcels
of shares in quantities so small that it would
cost more to sell them than they are worth.
They may therefore be too small to do
anything with, but may still bring a tax liability
on any dividends paid and unwanted annual
reports and other documents.
Bradford & Bingley plc supports ShareGift, which
is administered by The Orr Mackintosh
Foundation (registered charity number 1052668).
Any shares that you donate to ShareGift will be
transferred into the name of The Orr Mackintosh
Foundation, who will aggregate them, sell them
when possible and donate the proceeds to a
growing list of charities. Since ShareGift was
started, over £5 million has been given to more
than 700 different charities.
If you would like to use ShareGift, or receive
more information about the scheme, please
visit their website at www.ShareGift.org.uk,
or call 0207 337 0501, or write to The Orr
Mackintosh Foundation, 46 Grosvenor Street,
London W1K 3HN.

the address held by the Registrar. If you wish

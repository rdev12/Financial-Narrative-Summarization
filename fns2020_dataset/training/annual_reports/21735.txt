The industry has faced a 
challenging couple of years 
due to the fall in oil price. 
However , a modest recovery 
has seen renewed interest in 
growth opportunities. With 
our Darwin project having  
a break-even oil price of $40 
per barrel, we are optimistic 
that we can attract partners 
to help with its appraisal  
and development

COMPANY OVERVIEW
Darwin
Darwin is a significant, 
liquids rich, gas condensate 
discovery. The reservoir 
comprises high quality, 
laterally continuous shallow 
marine sands. The trap 
consists of two tilted fault 
blocks. The discovery is 
exceptionally imaged on 
3D seismic, where the 
hydrocarbons are marked 
by a clear flat spot and 
amplitude conformance 
to structure.
Near-Field Prospectivity
The Company has a strong portfolio of exploration 
prospects that provides future growth potential. 
Within a 15km radius of the discovery well, we have 
identified a number of amplitude supported 
prospects that have a total un-risked P50 recoverable 
resource estimate of over a billion barrels.

DARWIN COMMERCIALISATION 
The scoping engineering study completed in 2016 demonstrated 
that, if successfully appraised, Darwin could be commercialised by 
a straightforward FPSO development utilising proven, off-the-shelf 
technology. The plan would be to produce the liquids and re-inject the 
dry gas back into the reservoir. An initial development could target 270 
million barrels of condensate, requiring just 4 production wells and 3 gas 
re-injectors. A leased FPSO would be located in either 2000m of water, 
above the discovery, or in 1100m of water using a 14km subsea flowline. 
Initial condensate production would be 56,000 bpd. Estimated capex: 
$1.36 billion (including 25% contingency).

Mar 2017
The dramatic fall in oil price during 
2014 posed significant challenges 
for the industry. Companies 
responded by reducing their capital 
expenditure and strengthening 
their balance sheets. A major focus 
has been to reduce the cost of 
production, leading many companies 
to restructure their portfolios, 
exiting high cost projects and 
building positions in low cost 
options such as onshore US oil shale 
plays. Companies are striving to 
be low on the industry cost curve, 
thereby gaining resilience against 
future oil price fluctuations.
During 2016 the oil price rallied 
a little, underpinned by OPEC’s 
agreed cuts in production. This has 
encouraged some companies to 
start looking for growth projects 
again in order to replace their 
declining reserves.
DARWIN’S POSITION ON THE 
INDUSTRY COST CURVE 
The engineering study completed 
in 2016 scoped out an FPSO 
development for the Darwin 
discovery, providing cost estimates 
to input into our project economic 
models. Using these costs we can 
see that Darwin is positioned low 
on the global cost curve, with a 
break-even oil price of $40 per barrel 
(this includes a 25% contingency 
in the capex). This is due to the 
attractive fiscal terms offered by the 
Falkland Islands Government and 
the quality of the Darwin reservoir 
that requires a low number of 
development wells to be drilled 
and therefore minimising capex.

OUR BUSINESS
Borders & Southern’s aim is to discover 
hydrocarbons and monetise them for the benefit 
of all its stakeholders. We can create value through 
exploration and appraisal success, progressing 
discoveries through to production.
Our key strengths Delivering our business
Asset quality
Through early opportunity identification and capture, 
the Company holds a very strong acreage position within the 
South Falkland Basin. We have a 100% interest in 3 Production 
licences (10,000 square kilometres) within the optimal part of  
the basin. The licences contain our Darwin discovery along with 
a multi-billion barrel prospect inventory.
Licence extension
In the first half of the year we received confirmation from the Falkland Islands Government that our 
licences had been extended. Production Licences PL018, PL019 and PL020 have been extended by 
three years without any additional work programme commitment. The expiry date is now October 2020. 
A further extension could be achieved by committing to additional work, such as drilling more wells. The 
Discovery Area licence, relating to Darwin East, has been extended by four years so that the expiry date 
is now January 2022. 
T echnical rigor 
We have a small, experienced in-house team, which is 
supplemented by expert consultants. Great care is taken to 
acquire the right type of data and highest quality data possible, 
applying leading-edge technology to address the key technical 
issues. This technical discipline led to the Company being 
successful with its first exploration well.
Reservoir modelling 
We completed a reservoir engineering study that evaluated potential development scenarios, including 
full-field (Darwin East and Darwin West combined) and phased developments (where either Darwin East 
or Darwin West would be developed first). The optimum location for appraisal and development wells 
were assessed and the volume of recovered hydrocarbons and rates of production determined. The 
output from this work fed into a facilities design project and the economic modelling of the discovery. 
One of the scenarios considered an initial development of 270 million barrels of condensate using 4 
production wells and 3 gas re-injector wells, delivering an initial production rate of 56,000 bpd.
Commercial discipline 
The Company has no debt and has maintained a strong balance 
sheet and a low overhead. Strong financial controls are in place. 
Every effort is made to spend our limited financial resources 
wisely, negotiating robust contracts and focusing funds on 
activities that will help progress our project from discovery 
through to development.
Facilities design 
The scoping facilities engineering study demonstrated that, if successfully appraised, Darwin could be 
commercialised by a straightforward FPSO development, utilising proven, off-the-shelf technology. 
Cost estimates were received from the various engineering contractors. Two different options were 
assessed for the FPSO location: in 2,000 metres of water or 1,100 metres of water (using a 14 kilometre 
subsea flowline). Cost estimates for both options were comparable. The total estimated capex required 
for the 270 million barrel development is $1.36 billion (including 25% contingency). This gives a break-
even oil price of $40 per barrel. If the 25% contingency within the capex estimate is not required then the 
break-even oil price would be appreciably lower.
Risk management 
Robust risk management provides a foundation in all that we  
do. Care is taken to identify, monitor and mitigate against the 
different types of risk that the business encounters. We have 
demonstrated that we can operate deep water wells safely  
and with due respect to the environment. We build strong 
relationships with all our stakeholders.
Farm-out
The fall in oil price has had a significant impact on our ability to secure partners and funding for the next 
phase of operations. In the last couple of years, deep water projects have received less attention, as the 
industry has switched towards onshore low cost unconventional plays. However, deep water project 
costs have been reducing and the attention is now returning. Our break-even oil price is certainly 
competitive against global pre-sanction projects. Therefore, we are confident that our attractive 
economics, combined with our outstanding sub-surface case, will attract the necessary investment to 
progress Darwin through to development. Engagement with interested companies continues. 05 Borders & Southern Petroleum plc

Repeatable
Growth
The first stage is to access new 
opportunities, either through Licence 
Rounds or Open Door policies. Early 
entry into a basin and play fairway is 
important so as gain a sizeable footprint 
in the most prospective parts of the 
basin. Rigorous technical work is critical 
at this stage in order to mitigate the 
initially high sub-surface risks.
Borders & Southern gained early entry into 
the South Falkland Basin, originally licencing 
20,000 square kilometres. Our specific aim 
was to test the large folds and tilted fault 
blocks located south of the Falkland Islands. 
We were confident that a regional Jurassic 
to Early Cretaceous marine source rock 
would be present and that we would find 
large structural closures, so the main risk on 
entry was reservoir presence and quality. 
After drilling our first well, this risk was 
removed as all play elements in the basin 
were proved. We now believe our acreage is 
located in the optimum part of the basin for 
hydrocarbon generation and entrapment.
The early stages of exploration are 
all about making the right choices of 
data acquisition. Given that financial 
resources are finite for all companies, 
acquiring the right type of data, amount 
of data and quality of data is critical for 
risk mitigation. Rigorous petroleum 
systems analysis of the acquired data is 
then important to determine the best 
plays, high-grade the prospect inventory 
and ultimately establish the best drilling 
locations to test the play fairways.
Borders & Southern has acquired 2,541 
square kilometres of high quality PSDM 3D 
seismic data. This has allowed us to evaluate 
and high-grade all the play fairways. We 
selected two independent plays for the 
initial drilling programme. The first well, 
Darwin, tested Aptian shallow marine sands 
within a tilted fault block. This resulted in 
a significant, liquids rich, gas condensate 
discovery. The second well, Stebbing, tested 
Tertiary aged reservoirs within a simple four-
way dip closed anticline. This well had strong 
hydrocarbon shows, but failed to reach its 
main reservoir objective.
If a discovery displays the potential for 
commerciality, the next stage will be its 
appraisal. All the data collected during 
the exploration drilling programme are 
evaluated and integrated into the sub-
surface interpretations. An appraisal 
well programme will be designed to 
constrain the resource estimates and 
assess the distribution and deliverability 
of the reservoir. Typically, coring and 
flow testing of the reservoir will be 
undertaken. The appraisal programme 
provides the basic data required for 
development planning. 
The data collected during our 2012 drilling 
campaign has been fully integrated 
into our sub-surface analysis. Darwin is 
an exceptionally imaged hydrocarbon 
accumulation. This clear definition on 3D 
seismic will help in its appraisal. Options 
for appraisal well locations have been 
determined and well designs completed. 
As soon as partners and funding have been 
secured, the appraisal programme will be 
able to proceed. 
 
If the appraisal drilling confirms the 
commerciality of the discovery, the 
next stage will focus on the engineering 
aspects of the project. Design concepts 
for a development will be evaluated 
and selected and detailed cost analysis 
completed. Pre-FEED and FEED 
studies will be undertaken prior to a 
final investment decision. This leads to 
the execution of the development and 
ultimately the start of production.
As part of our assessment of Darwin’s 
commerciality, we have already completed 
two scoping development studies. These 
indicate that the discovery could be 
commercialised by a straightforward FPSO 
development, utilising proven, off-the-shelf 
technology. The liquids will be produced 
and exported to market whilst the dry 
gas re-injected back into the reservoir. 
Several development scenarios have been 
considered and contractor cost estimates 
received. The completed scoping studies 
will provide a good foundation for future 
detailed engineering work. 
Once a working petroleum system has 
been established by the discovery of 
hydrocarbons, the objective is to add 
value through follow-up discoveries. 
Using the knowledge gained through the 
exploration and appraisal phases, the 
prospect inventory can be high-graded 
and drilled up. 
Borders & Southern has a very strong 
prospect inventory. Management’s total  
un-risked P50 recoverable resource 
estimate for near-field prospects (those 
within 15 kiliometres of the discovery) is over 
a billion barrels. Many of these are amplitude 
supported. Substantial upside occurs 
outside of the near-field prospect inventory. 
The Company intends to test additional 
exploration prospects as soon as possible, 
but its priority is to progress its discovery 
through to development. 
Our strategy is focused on frontier or  
emerging basins where substantial volumes  
of hydrocarbons are yet to be discovered.  
Our aim is to make significant discoveries  
and progress them through to development. 07 Borders & Southern Petroleum plc

CEO’S ST A TEMENT
Throughout 2016 we maintained a 
disciplined budget, whilst strengthening 
our technical and commercial case and 
continuing with our efforts to farm-out 
the Company’s Falkland Islands project. 
The year-end cash balance of $9.65 million 
(31 December 2015: $14 million) was 
impacted by significant changes in the US 
Dollar-Sterling exchange rate. Most of the 
Company’s funds are held in Sterling to 
reflect its ongoing expenditures. The drop in 
the value of the pound, resulted in a nearly 
$2 million reduction in the reported cash 
balance and increased the loss by the same 
amount. The 2016 Administrative expense 
of $1.74 million, comparing favourably 
against the previous year ($1.97 million in 
2015), partially reflects the impact of the 
exchange rate. 
Borders & Southern’s objective is to be a 
successful explorer, finding hydrocarbons 
and monetising them for the benefit of all 
its shareholders and stakeholders. The 
first stage was realised in 2012 when we 
announced a significant, liquids rich, gas 
condensate discovery (Darwin). Subsequent 
technical analysis proved the scale of 
the discovery. Management’s current 
un-risked P50 Best Estimate resource is 
3.5 tcf of wet gas in place with 360 million 
barrels of recoverable condensate. 
The second stage, of monetising the 
discovery, has been slower in achievement 
as competent partners are sought to help 
fund Darwin’s appraisal and development. 
Our ability to deliver on this has been 
impacted by the 2014 fall in oil price and the 
dramatic reduction in capital expenditure 
by the industry in the subsequent period. 
During the last year, the oil price has made 
a modest recovery, underpinned by OPEC’s 
agreed cuts in production. As a response, 
many of the large and mid-sized companies, 
who have spent the last couple of years 
reducing their costs and strengthening 
their balance sheets, are now considering 
growth objectives again. This gives us 
grounds for optimism that we can complete 
a successful farm-out and get back to an 
operational phase and the appraisal drilling.
We believe that the Darwin discovery 
and its surrounding exploration portfolio 
compares very favourably against other 
global opportunities. Our technical 
and commercial work during 2016 was 
directed to test our project’s commercial 
competitiveness. Through facilities 
engineering studies and reservoir modelling 
we demonstrated that the break-even oil 
price for an initial 270 million barrel FPSO 
phased Darwin development would be 
$40 per barrel. If the 25% contingency 
included within the estimated $1.36 billion 
capex is reduced, through more detailed 
engineering work, the break-even oil price 
would be appreciably lower. The attractive 
economics are largely influenced by the 
Falkland Islands Government’s fiscal terms 
and the requirement for only a limited 
number of development wells due to the 
laterally continuous, high quality reservoir 
and extremely mobile hydrocarbon phase.
HOWARD OBEE
CHIEF E XECUTIVE
The robust economics and 
compelling sub-surface  
case give us a real sense of 
optimism for progressing 
Darwin through to a 
successful development
HOWARD OBEE, CHIEF E XECUTIVE
Over the last few years global exploration 
success rates have decreased significantly. 
Discovery volumes have been skewed 
towards dry gas, with new large liquids finds 
being relatively scarce. In this context, 
the Darwin condensate is an important 
resource. Through meticulous technical 
and commercial work, we have continued 
to take risk out of the project, to enhance 
its attractiveness to third parties. At 
the same time, we have matured the 
Company’s exciting prospect inventory, 
which provides significant scope to add 
to the discovered volumes. As previously 
reported, management’s un-risked P50 
Best Estimate recoverable resource for 
near-field prospects (not including Darwin), 
those located within a 15km radius of the 
discovery well, exceed 1 billion barrels. Many 
of these prospects are supported by seismic 
amplitude anomalies and are considered 
by management to be relatively low risk. 
The largest prospect within the near-
field inventory and the current most 
likely candidate for an exploration well, 
following Darwin appraisal, is Sullivan. 
Stratigraphically older than the Darwin 
reservoir, in a section not yet penetrated by 
a well, the prospect is defined by a strong 
seismic amplitude anomaly measuring 
120 square kilometres. The AVO response 
is very similar to that associated with 
the Darwin discovery. If this anomaly 
does represent another gas condensate 
accumulation, then Management’s 
un-risked P50 Best Estimate volumes 
comprise 5.6 tcf of gas in place with 473 
million barrels of recoverable condensate. 
In addition to the near-field prospects, 
significant exploration potential exists in the 
rest of the Company’s acreage in a range of 
structural and stratigraphic prospects. The 
scale and quality of the prospect inventory 
will provide considerable growth options 
for the Company in years to come. But in 
the near term, we will maintain our capital 
discipline during this extended period of

PRINCIPAL RISKS 
AND UNCERT AINTIES
RISK STATUS KEY 
(*RS refers to Risk Status)
Risk increase
Risk unchanged
Risk decrease
Risk Nature of Risk RS Mitigation
SUB-SURFACE
Exploration for oil and gas is inherently 
risky and whilst many of these risks can 
be mitigated, they cannot be eliminated.
The Company has demonstrated that it takes 
a disciplined approach to exploration using 
latest technologies and industry experts to 
undertake the necessary technical work. 
HEAL TH SAFETY AND 
ENVIRONMENT
Conducting operations in a remote, 
environmentally sensitive location present 
many challenges.
Prior to operations, detailed risk assessments 
and mitigation plans are put in place. Policies, 
plans and actions closely follow industry’s 
best practice.
FUNDING
The Company continues to have a strong 
balance sheet with sufficient funds for 
overheads in the foreseeable future. The 
challenge is to secure funds for the Darwin 
appraisal programme
The recent engineering study demonstrated 
that Darwin’s is one of the lowest cost 
projects in terms of break even oil price. 
Therefore we are confident of securing 
funding.
OIL PRICE
Rapid changes in commodity prices have a 
material impact on the industry in terms of 
economics and capital spending
The oil price appears to have settled in a 
$50-$55/bbl range and costs across the 
industry have reduced to reflect this. Darwin  
is a very attractive investment proposition  
at these oil prices.
KEY PERSONNEL
As a small company, it is reliant upon a small 
number of experienced personnel.
The Company has service contracts with key
employees that provide for notice periods 
that would allow sufficient time to source
replacements. Also, the Company has a wide 
network of experienced contractors.
SUPPLY CHAIN
The geographical location and political 
backdrop provide logistical challenges.
Several drilling campaigns have now been 
undertaken over the last decade so the supply 
chain has been well tested.
POLITICAL
Argentina continue to challenge the 
sovereignty of the Falkland Islands.
The British Government consistently provides
strong support for the Falkland Islanders’ 
right to determine their own future. Recent 
discussions between the UK and Argentinian 
governments have been more supportive.

Borders & Southern recognises that an 
effective Board facilitates the efficient 
discharge of the duties imposed by law on 
Directors and contributes to the delivery 
of the Company’s strategic objectives. 
Accordingly, Borders & Southern has 
structured its Board so that it:
• has a proper understanding of, and the 
competencies to deal with, the current 
and emerging issues in the Company’s 
business; 
• exercises independent judgement; and
• effectively reviews and challenges 
management’s performance.
 
The Board currently comprises the 
Chairman, two Executive Directors and  
one Non-Executive Director. Each of 
the Executive Directors has extensive 
knowledge of the oil and gas industry 
combined with general business and 
financial skills. All of the Directors bring 
independent judgement to bear on issues  
of strategy, performance, resources, key 
appointments and standards. The Board 
meets regularly throughout the year and all 
the necessary information is supplied to the 
Directors on a timely basis to enable them  
to discharge their duties effectively. 
All Directors retire by rotation.
I regularly review the composition and 
structure of the Board to ensure it both 
meets industry good practice and is fit for 
purpose given where the Company is in 
terms of its development and scale.
MY ROLE AS CHAIRMAN
I was appointed Chairman of the Company 
at its inception. As Chairman, I am 
responsible for the effective running of  
the Board and for ensuring that it plays  
a constructive role in the development of 
the Company. Together with the Chief 
Executive Officer, I also set and run the 
agenda for Board meetings. 
ROLES OF THE NON-EXECUTIVE 
DIRECTOR
Nigel Hurst-Brown brings a wealth of 
business experience to the Board and its 
Committees. He provides independent 
views on the Company’s performance, 
operations and strategy. 
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Board has a Remuneration Committee 
comprising two Non-Executive Directors.

Committee and their attendance at

meetings of the Remuneration Committee 
during 2016 are detailed in the Directors’ 
Report.
The strategy of the Remuneration 
Committee is to ensure the Company: 
• remunerates fairly and responsibly. 
Borders & Southern’s policy is to ensure 
that the level and composition of 
remuneration for all employees is 
competitive and reasonable;
• includes both short term and long term 
performance-based components in its 
remuneration practices; and
• benchmarks its remuneration with 
comparable companies.
AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Board has an Audit Committee 
comprising two Non-Executive Directors. 
The members of the Audit Committee and 
their attendance at meetings of the Audit 
Committee during 2016 are detailed in the 
Directors’ Report.
The objectives of the Audit Committee  
are to ensure:
• the accuracy and integrity of the financial 
statements and related disclosures;
• the keeping of adequate books, records 
and internal controls;
• the auditor is independent and is qualified 
and its performance is monitored; and
• compliance with legal and regulatory 
requirements.
INSURANCES
The Company has taken out Directors’ and 
Officers’ insurance that provides insurance 
cover for all Directors and senior officers  
of the Company. This insurance is reviewed 
annually.
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
At this stage in its development, the 
Company is focusing on the development  
of its existing Darwin discovery. As and 
when the Company moves into production, 
financial, operational, health and safety and 
environmental KPIs will become relevant  
and will be reported and measured  
as appropriate.
The Directors do, however, closely monitor 
certain financial information, in particular 
overheads and cash balances, as set out  
in the CEO’s statement.

Financial instruments
Details of the use of financial instruments by the Company and its subsidiary undertaking are contained in note 20 of the financial 
statements.
Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ report, the Strategic report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared the 
Group and Company financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union. Under Company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. The Directors are also required to 
prepare financial statements in accordance with the rules of the London Stock Exchange for companies trading securities on AIM.
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
• state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue 
in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

Website publication
The Directors are responsible for ensuring the annual report and the financial statements are made available on a website. Financial 
statements are published on the Company’s website in accordance with legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements, which may vary from legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance and integrity of the Company’s 
website is the responsibility of the Directors. The Directors’ responsibility also extends to the ongoing integrity of the financial statements 
contained therein.
Auditor
All of the current Directors have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any information needed by the 
Company’s auditor for the purposes of its audit and to establish that the auditor is aware of that information. The Directors are not aware of 
any relevant audit information of which the auditor is unaware.
BDO LLP has expressed its willingness to continue in office and a resolution to reappoint them will be proposed at the annual general meeting.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
• the Parent Company’s financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

1 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below and have been consistently applied 
to all years presented.
These consolidated and parent financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs and IFRIC interpretations) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as adopted by the European Union and with 
those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies preparing their accounts under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
New and revised standards effective for 31 December 2016 year end
There were no new standards issued in respect of the year ended 31 December 2016 that were relevant for adoption by the Group.
New and revised standards issued but not effective for 31 December 2016 year end
At the date of authorisation of this report the following standards and interpretations, which have not been applied in this report, were in issue 
but not yet effective:
 
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective date for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018);
• IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with customers (effective date for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018);
• IFRS 16 Leases (effective date for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019);
• IAS 12 (amended) Recognition of Deferred Tax Asset for Unrealised Losses;
• IAS 7 Disclosure Initiative; and
• IFRS 2 (amended) Classification and Measurement of Share-based Present Transactions.
The Group considers that the only Standard that may have any impact is IFRS 9. The new Standard will replace existing accounting Standards. 
It is applicable to financial assets and liabilities and will introduce changes to existing accounting concerning classification, measurement and 
impairment (introducing an expected loss method). The Group considers that whilst IFRS 16 may impact on the Group, the effect will not be 
significant as the operating leases held by the Group are of low value.
The Group is not revenue generating thus there is no impact of IFRS 15 as there are no revenue contracts in place.
The Group will adopt the above Standards at the time stipulated by that Standard. The Group does not at this time anticipate voluntary early 
adoption of any of the Standards.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is 
exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power 
over the entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that 
control ceases. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line 
with those used by other members of the Group. All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on 
consolidation.
Business combinations
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations by the Group. The consideration transferred for the 
acquisition of a business is the fair value of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. The 
consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition 
related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination 
are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
Going concern
The Directors are of the opinion that the Group has adequate financial resources to enable it to undertake its planned programme of 
exploration and appraisal activities for a period of at least 12 months.
The Company’s investments in subsidiaries
The Parent Company’s subsidiaries are carried at cost less amounts provided for impairment.
Finance income
Finance income consists of interest on cash deposits and foreign exchange gains.

Directors’

Strategic
Report
Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The 
chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been 
identified as the Board of Directors.
Property, plant and equipment
Office equipment is initially recorded at cost. Depreciation is provided on office equipment so as to write off the cost, less any estimated 
residual value, over their expected useful economic life as follows:
Office equipment 33.33%
Assets are depreciated from the date of acquisition and on a straight-line basis.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure
The Group applies the requirements of IFRS 6 Exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources in respect of its exploration and evaluation 
expenditure. The requirements of IFRS 6 are not applied to expenditure incurred by the Group before legal title to explore for and evaluate 
hydrocarbon resources in a specific area, generally referred to as pre-licence expenditure. Likewise the Group do not apply the requirements 
of IFRS 6 after the point at which the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting hydrocarbons are demonstrable.
The costs of exploring for and evaluating hydrocarbon resources are accumulated and capitalised as intangible assets by reference to 
appropriate cash-generating units (CGU), generally referred to as full cost accounting. The Group has determined that their operating 
licences are recognised in one CGU. A CGU is not larger than an operating segment as determined in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating 
Segments.
Capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure may include, amongst other costs, costs of licence acquisition, third party technical 
services and studies, seismic acquisition, exploration drilling and testing but do not include general overheads. Any property, plant and 
equipment (PPE) acquired for use in exploration and evaluation activities is classified as property, plant and equipment. However, to the 
extent that such PPE is consumed in developing an intangible exploration and evaluation asset the amount reflecting that consumption is 
recorded as part of the cost of the intangible exploration and evaluation asset.
Intangible exploration and evaluation assets are not depreciated and are carried forward, subject to the provisions of the Group’s impairment 
of exploration and evaluation policy, until the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting hydrocarbons are demonstrable. At 
such point exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment and any impairment loss is recognised before reclassification of the 
assets to a category of property, plant and equipment.
Impairment of exploration and evaluation expenditure
The Group’s exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount 
of the exploration and evaluation assets may exceed the assets recoverable amount.
In accordance with IFRS 6 the Group firstly considers the following facts and circumstances in their assessment of whether the Group’s 
exploration and evaluation assets may be impaired:
• whether the period for which the Group has the right to explore in a specific area has expired during the period or will expire in the near 
future, and is not expected to be renewed;
• whether substantive expenditure on further exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources in a specific area is neither budgeted nor 
planned;
• whether exploration for and evaluation of hydrocarbons in a specific area have not led to the discovery of commercially viable quantities  
of hydrocarbons and the Group has decided to discontinue such activities in the specific area; and
• whether sufficient data exists to indicate that although a development in a specific area is likely to proceed, the carrying amount of the 
exploration and evaluation assets is unlikely to be recovered in full from successful development or by sale.
If any such facts or circumstances are noted, the Group, as a next step, performs an impairment test in accordance with the provisions of IAS 
36. In such circumstances the aggregate carrying value of the exploration and evaluations assets is compared against the expected 
recoverable amount of the CGU. The recoverable amount is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs of disposal. The Group has 
identified one cash-generating unit. In accordance with the provisions of IFRS 6 the level identified for the purposes of assessing the Group’s 
exploration and evaluation assets for impairment may comprise one or more cash-generating units.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of  
a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.

Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into US Dollars at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into US Dollars at the closing rates at the reporting date and 
the exchange differences are included in the statement of comprehensive income. The functional and presentational currency of the parent 
and all Group Companies is the US dollar.
Operating leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Share-based payments
The fair value of employee share option plans is calculated using the Black-Scholes pricing model. Non-employee options granted as part of 
consideration for services rendered are valued at the fair value of those services. Where information on the fair value of services rendered is 
not readily available, the fair value is calculated using the Black-Scholes pricing model.
In accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payments the resulting cost is charged to the statement of comprehensive income over the vesting 
period of the options. The amount of charge is adjusted each year to reflect expected and actual levels of options vesting.
Where equity-settled share options are awarded, the fair value of the options at the date of grant is charged to the statement of 
comprehensive income over the vesting period. Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity 
instruments expected to vest at each reporting date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based 
on the number of options that eventually vest. Market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the options granted.
As long as all other vesting conditions are satisfied, a charge is made irrespective of whether the market vesting conditions are satisfied. The 
cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to achieve a market vesting condition.
Where the terms and conditions of options are modified before they vest, the increase in the fair value of the options, measured immediately 
before and after the modification, is also charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the remaining vesting 
period.
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value. Subsequent measurement depends on the designation of the instrument, as follows:
• trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective rate of interest,  
net of allowances for impairment;
• trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective rate of interest;
• financial instruments issued by Group Companies are treated as equity only to the extent that they do not meet the definition of  
a financial liability;
• the Group’s and Company’s ordinary shares are all classified as equity instruments; and
• cash and cash equivalents consist of cash at bank on demand and balances on deposit with an original maturity of three months or less. 
Taxes
The major components of tax on the profit or loss include current and deferred tax.
Current tax is based upon the profit or loss for the year adjusted for items that are non-assessable or disallowed and is calculated using tax 
rates that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the reporting date.
Tax is charged or credited to the statement of comprehensive income, except where the tax relates to items credited or charged directly to 
equity, in which case the tax is also dealt within equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the statement of financial position differs 
to its tax base.
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the 
difference can be utilised.
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and 
are expected to apply when deferred tax liabilities and assets are settled or recovered.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts  
of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. If in the future 
such estimates and assumptions, which are based on management’s best judgement at the date of the financial statements, deviate from 
the actual circumstances, the original estimates and assumptions will be modified as appropriate in the year in which the circumstances change. 
Where necessary, the comparatives will be reclassified from the previously reported results to take into account presentational changes.
Management has made the following judgements which have the most significant effects on the amounts recognised in the financial 
statements:
Recoverability of exploration and evaluation costs
Expenditure is capitalised as an intangible asset by reference to appropriate CGUs and is assessed for impairment when circumstances 
suggest that the carrying amount may exceed its recoverable value. This assessment involves judgement as to:
(i) the timing of future development of the asset;
(ii) funding structures and financing costs of development;
(iii) commercial development opportunities for extracting value from the asset; and
(iv) modelling inputs such as the appropriateness of discount rates, reserve and resource estimates, oil and gas pricing predictions, etc.
With regards to the Parent Company financial statements – impairment of financial assets:
Investment in subsidiaries
The Company has an investment in a subsidiary. Investments are valued at cost, less allowance for impairment. Impairment reviews are 
performed annually. The assessment of recoverability involves judgement.

3 Basic and dilutive loss per share 
The calculation of the basic and dilutive loss per share is based on the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the weighted 
average number of shares in issue during the year. The loss for the financial year for the Group was $3,604,000 (2015 – loss $2,599,393) and 
the weighted average number of shares in issue for the year was 484,098,484 (2015 – 484,098,484). During the year the potential ordinary 
shares are anti-dilutive and therefore diluted loss per share has not been calculated. At the statement of financial position date, there were 
7,050,000 (2015: 6,150,000) potentially dilutive ordinary shares being the share options (see note 7 for further details).
4 Segment analysis
The Company operates in one operating segment (exploration for oil and gas) and in substantially one geographical market (the Falkland 
Islands), therefore no additional segmental information is presented.
Of the Group’s total non-current assets, office equipment is based in the UK and all other non-current assets are located in the Falkland 
Islands.

Of the $48,000 (2015 – $90,000) share-based payment charge included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, $48,000 
(2015 – $90,000) has been charged in respect of share options granted to staff (including Directors) in the current and prior years. 
6 Directors’ emoluments
The Directors’ emoluments for the year are as follows:
2016
$ 000
2015
$ 000
Directors’ fees 620 691
Share-based payments – equity settled 1 –

The fees and share-based payments made to each Director are disclosed in the Remuneration Committee Report. During the year, the 
highest paid Director received total remuneration of $344,486 (2015- $383,281). 
In 2013, the Group granted 600,000 share options to an employee of the Group with a total fair value of $84,203. Of this amount, $16,687 has 
been expensed during the year. The options vest after three years and expire after 10 years.
In 2014, the Group granted 1,400,000 share options to an employee of the Group with a total fair value of $49,071. Of this amount, $30,225 
has been expensed during the year. The options vest after three years and expire after 10 years. During 2014, 1,400,000 that had been issued 
to the same employee were cancelled.
In 2016, the Group granted 1,000,000 share options to a Director of the Group with a total fair value of $6,714. Of this amount, $582 has been 
expensed during the year. The options vest after three years and expire after 10 years.
Because of the difficulty in measuring the fair value of the services received, this has been determined by reference to the fair value of the 
options granted. A Black-Scholes model has been used to determine the fair value of options granted (see note 7).

Factors that may affect future tax charges
The Group has a deferred tax asset of approximately $1,022,473 (2015 – $671,128) in respect of unrelieved tax losses of approximately 
$6,014,546 at 31 December 2016 (2015 – $3,728,488). The rate of tax used in the calculation of the deferred tax asset is 17% (2015 – 18%).
The deferred tax asset has not been recognised in the financial statements as the timing of the economic benefit is uncertain.

20 Financial instruments
The main risks arising from the Group’s operations are cash flow interest rate risk, foreign currency translation risk and credit risk. The Group 
monitors risk on a regular basis and takes appropriate measures to ensure risks are managed in a controlled manner.
Liquidity is not considered to be a risk due to the sufficient cash funds readily available by the Group at the year end.
The Group is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial instruments. This note describes the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for managing those risks and the methods used to measure them. There have been no substantive changes in the Group’s 
exposure to financial instrument risks, its objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks or the methods used to measure them 
from previous periods unless otherwise stated in the note.
Principal financial instruments
The principal financial instruments used by the Group from which financial instrument risk arises, held by category, are as follows:
• other receivables;
• cash and cash equivalents; and
• trade and other payables.
The fair values of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2016 and as at 31 December 2015 are materially equivalent to the 
carrying value as disclosed in the statement of financial position and related notes.
a) Cash flow interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk from monies held at bank and on deposit at variable rates. The considerations below and 
the figures quoted are the same for both Group and Company.
The Group’s financial assets and liabilities accrue interest at prevailing floating rates in the United Kingdom or at pre-arranged fixed rates,  
as described further below. The Group does not currently use derivative instruments to manage its interest rate risk.
At 31 December 2016 the Group held cash at bank and in deposits under its control of $9,644,090 (2015 – $14,011,005) which forms the 
majority of the Group’s working capital. Of the cash at bank and in deposit $372,613 (2015 – $13,011,005) relates to deposits placed with 
banking institutions that are available on demand which carry interest at prevailing United Kingdom deposit floating rates. The balance 
represents restricted deposits of $9,271,477 (2015 – $1,000,000) with a weighted average fixed interest rate of 0.2% (2015-0.2%) for three 
months. If there was 1% change in interest rates the impact on the statement of comprehensive income would be $92,714 (2015 – $10,000). Borders & Southern Petroleum plc

b) Foreign currency translation risk
The operational currency of the oil and gas exploration and evaluation activities of the exploration subsidiary is the US$. The consolidated 
financial statements are presented in US$ as this best reflects the economic environment of the oil exploration sector in which the Group 
operates. Foreign exchange risk arises because the Group’s services and treasury function is UK sterling, which results in gains or losses on 
retranslation into US$. To minimise this foreign currency risk cash balances are held in both £ sterling and US$.
The foreign currency profile of financial assets and liabilities of the Group and the Company are as follows:

UK£ of $113,500 (2015 – $28,300) for the Group and Company. 
c) Credit risk
Neither the Group nor the Company have sales customers so formal credit procedures are not usually relevant. Recently the Company sold 
some its inventory held in The Falkland Islands and monies due from this were outstanding at year end. These balances were partially offset 
by monies owed by the Company to the same entity. Credit risk on cash balances is managed by only banking with reputable financial 
institutions with a high credit rating. The only significant concentration of credit risk on an ongoing basis is cash held at bank and the 
maximum credit risk exposure for the Group and Company is detailed in the table below:

Capital
The objective of the Directors is to maximise shareholder return and minimise risk by keeping a reasonable balance between debt and equity. 
To date the Group has minimised risk by being purely equity financed. The Group considers its capital to comprise its ordinary share capital, 
share premium, accumulated retained deficit and other reserves.

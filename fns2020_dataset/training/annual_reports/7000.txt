Halfords has core competences in marketing, branding, store retailing, 
distribution and international sourcing which allow value to be 
generated through high quality products via a combination of range, 
competitive prices and expert services both in our Retail stores and 
Autocentres garages.
Our goal of growing profitable top line revenues in the medium and 
long-term follows our strategic thread of “Helping and Inspiring our 
Customers with their Life on the Move” and encompasses Supporting 
Drivers of Every Car, Inspiring Cyclists of Every Age and Equipping 
Families for their Leisure Time. This is delivered through our Car 
Maintenance, Car Enhancement, Car Servicing, Cycling and Travel 
Solutions categories and Halfords has good opportunities for growth, 
consolidating fragmented markets with a national store network and 
strong brand management and supplementing this with well-trained, 
knowledgeable and service orientated colleagues in-store.
Evolving buyer trends have been met by developing a dynamic web 
offer which enables customers to buy online and have their goods 
delivered to a local store or direct to home. Customers can also reserve 
products online and then collect in-store, offering further opportunities 
for our colleagues to interact with our customers.
Augmenting our Retail offer with additional in-store repair and fitting 
services further encourages colleague/customer interactions, providing 
opportunities to upsell and attach accessories to our products whilst 
improving customer service and loyalty and increasing average 
transaction values.
 Halfords has good opportunities for 
growth, consolidating fragmented markets 
with a national store network chain and 
strong brand management. 
 Halfords is a trusted brand 
in the automotive sector. 
Halfords is a trusted brand in the automotive sector and our move 
into garage servicing in 2010 was a natural extension to the Halfords 
business model. Car Servicing has similar market drivers to our 
successful Car Maintenance category and over the last three years 
we have grown the business from 224 to 287* autocentres providing 
service, repair and MOTs. Halfords provides services at more affordable 
prices than most franchised garages and more comprehensively than 
many independent garages.
As a retailer Halfords makes a profit from the combination of low-
cost sourcing and our supply chain coupled with excellent marketing 
skills and a national store network, leveraging these skills in the car 
service sector. We source direct from suppliers around the world who 
manufacture products to our designs and rigid specifications and our 
distribution team use their specialist knowledge to group and ship 
products in line with the our sales plans. 
We also create value for our customers by keeping our cost 
structure as efficient as possible. The size of our operation means 
that we can get advantages of scale and run our back office functions 
at least costs.
Our brand is one of our greatest strengths and our strategy is to 
leverage this as we grow our Group. We provide a single face to 
customers so they can continue to connect with the Halfords brand 
across our offer and, through new products, services and channels, 
enjoy a great customer experience.

Market Review
 The Halfords Group 
has a unique place in the 
UK; through its Retail and 
Autocentres divisions the 
Group operates in a number 
of diverse marketplaces. 
Halfords Market Review
The Halfords Group has a unique place in the UK; through its Retail 
and Autocentres divisions the Group operates in a number of diverse 
marketplaces.
Within the Retail segment of the business, Halfords differentiates itself 
in the markets of automotive, cycling and outdoor leisure across its 
three strategic pillars of Supporting Drivers of Every Car, Inspiring 
Cyclists of Every Age and Equipping Families for their Leisure Time. 
With 466 locations, Halfords has a favourable market position, being 
located less than 20 minutes away from 90% of the UK population. 
Halfords.com, in combination with these stores and their experienced 
staff, creates multiple channels and configurations for customers, with 
in-store Reserve & Collect gathering pace in FY13.
The past 12 months has offered a number of one-off opportunities and 
challenges that have affected a lot of Halfords’ core markets. From 
once in a lifetime national events to record breaking (for all the wrong 
reasons) weather, FY13 has certainly been a year of note.
Supporting Drivers of Every Car
The automotive market was largely unaffected by the exceptional 
occurrences of FY13, with only slight developments in the 
macroeconomic environment. 
The number of cars in the car parc increased by c.1%, yet the service 
market shrank slightly as consumers maintain tight spending control. 
The increased size of the car parc offers opportunities in the value-
driven auto aftercare market though. With bulbs, blades and batteries 
(“3Bs”) becoming increasingly complex to fit on new vehicles and the 
DIY approach to fixing cars shrinking with each generation of new 
drivers, the 3Bs fitting market is worth around £950m. With fitting 
services in demand throughout FY13, Halfords is uniquely placed to 
provide a value and hassle-free “Do It For Me” (“DIFM”) level of service 
that more and more drivers are set to need.
Since the acquisition of Autocentres, Halfords has also consolidated 
and strengthened its position in the c.£9bn servicing market. That 
market was made up of c.22,000 garages in 2012, but that number is 
consolidating, with outlet numbers dropping between 1% and 2% 
per annum. Meanwhile, Halfords opens between 20 and 30 new 
centres each year.
In the auto accessories and enhancement market, there are a number 
of growth stories and opportunities in new technology too. The Sat Nav 
market is slowing its decline with a bottoming out of the price deflation 
that has occurred over recent years, and new technologies are coming 
through which will necessitate an update for many Sat Nav users.
Halfords has also made gains in audio equipment thanks to reduced 
competition on the high street, and with the digital switchover on 
the horizon, this looks set to continue. No other business can match 
Halfords’ skillset and price on Audio fitting and Sat Nav set-up and 
demonstration.
Halfords has also recently cemented its position as the UK’s top online 
retailer for child car seats, scoring highest in an investigation by Which? 
into the best buying and fitting advice available.
 With bulbs, blades and batteries becoming 
increasingly complex to fit on new vehicles 
and the DIY approach to fixing cars shrinking 
with each generation of new drivers, the 3Bs 
fitting market is worth around £950m.  07

Providing safety first whilst introducing children to a ‘life on the move’
Inspiring Cyclists of Every Age
Whilst it is unlikely UK cycling will see another year like 2012 any time 
soon, with the first ever British Tour de France winner followed by 
another hugely successful performance from Team GB’s cyclists at the 
London 2012 Olympics, its popularity is expected to grow.  
With household names such as Sir Bradley Wiggins and Victoria 
Pendleton achieving further success and increasing their popularity, 
and break-out stars such as Jason Kenny and Laura Trott emerging, 
British cycling has never had so many inspirational ambassadors.
However, these events occurred during an extremely poor year for 
weather. The Met Office reported that, apart from 2011, it was the 
coolest summer since 1998, and the wettest summer for 100 years.
These contrasting fortunes make it extremely difficult to measure the 
exact impact of the Olympics, but what is clear is that the cycling 
market is buoyant. A Mintel report has estimated that the market 
reached c.£700m in 2012, and is set to grow by around 23% over 
the next five years. This can be added to the c.£700m cycling parts, 
accessories and clothing (“PACs”) market and c.£100m cycling repair 
market, which Halfords is also competitive in.
Within the cycling market itself, while already the largest for family 
and kids’ bikes, FY13 has seen Halfords increase its presence in the 
premium market. 
With a strong brand, increasingly skilled workforce, a growing range 
of products, an extensive national network of stores and a burgeoning 
web presence, Halfords’ credibility as a place for Inspiring Cyclists of 
Every Age is improving.
Equipping Families for their Leisure Time
The third of Halford’s strategic pillars is spread across several 
fragmented markets, which can be grouped under the umbrella of 
camping and outdoor leisure, while also encompassing a wide variety 
of strategically chosen leisure impulse products.
 Through its size and network, 
Halfords can offer a greater depth of 
range, competitive prices and convenient 
locations. 
Since 2009, with the lingering effects of the financial crisis “staycations” 
have become popular in the UK. Continued tough economic 
circumstances and low consumer confidence has seen the UK 
camping market grow consistently ever since, with a 2012 Mintel report 
estimating that there were almost 20 million trips taken by UK residents 
in 2011.
Halfords has built on the back of this trend, offering a unique 
combination of products and solutions. Through its size and network, 
Halfords can also offer a greater depth of range, competitive prices and 
more convenient locations.
While the leisure market also suffered greatly due to the adverse 
weather in FY13, Halfords has good opportunities to improve its 
outdoor offering, with increasing awareness of Halfords as the retailer 
of choice for leisure equipment. 08

This has been another difficult year for the UK consumer and Halfords 
was also faced with its own particular challenges. Our customers 
continued to have their discretionary incomes squeezed and high 
fuel prices and insurance costs once again resulted in a decrease in 
miles driven by our automotive customers. Whilst reluctant to blame 
the weather, the wet summer and record cold winter were certainly 
not conducive to the pursuit of outdoor activities by our cycling 
and camping customers! Nevertheless, the spirit of the nation was 
uplifted by the joy and the resounding success of the Olympics and 
Paralympics. All of these macro factors had, in their own way, an effect 
on the performance of Halfords and provided us with both challenges 
and opportunities.
Group revenues increased by 1.0% with a decline in Retail sales 
of 0.9% offset by 13.5% growth in Autocentres. In Retail, the Car 
Maintenance category grew strongly, Cycling was down marginally, Car 
Enhancement declined at a much lower rate than in prior years and 
Travel Solutions, which includes our camping products, also declined. 
The growth in sales for Autocentres was due to our investments which 
have increased market share, boosted tyre sales and added 23 new 
centres. Group gross margin was unchanged at 54.8% with a marginal 
rise in Retail and a decrease in Autocentres, due primarily to product 
mix. Total underlying operating costs rose by 6.2% due to investment 
in colleague headcount, recruitment and training, increased occupation 
costs, a rise in marketing spend and investment in new Autocentres. 
Interest costs also rose. As a result, underlying profit before tax 
decreased by 21.9% to £72.0m and basic EPS by 17.8% to 27.7p 
per share. Free cash flow of £71.8m was generated and net debt was 
down £28.6m to £110.6m with net debt to EBITDA at 1.1 times.
In July 2012, the Board felt that a change at the top of the organisation 
was necessary and David Wild, who had been Group Chief Executive 
since August 2008, left the Company. I was asked by the Board to step 
up as Interim Executive Chairman until a new Group Chief Executive 
was in place. In October 2012, Matt Davies joined Halfords as CEO 
and I resumed my non-executive role in November 2012. We are 
delighted with Matt’s appointment. It follows his considerable success 
at Pets at Home where he had been CEO for some eight years. We 
were particularly taken by the exceptional colleague engagement 
and customer service levels he had achieved at Pets at Home. These 
were two areas that had worryingly slipped in Halfords and the extent 
became more evident to me during my executive tenure; it was 
therefore critical that this be urgently addressed.
Following his appointment, Matt was tasked with reviewing the current 
strategy and plans for the business and the organisational capability. 
This has now been completed and the outcome – set out below – is 
fully supported by the Board who, along with Matt’s executive team, 
were an integral part of the review process.
Firstly, the three pillars of the existing strategy were considered to be 
sound but were redefined to the following to inject more passion and a 
clearer purpose:
 ■ Supporting Drivers of Every Car
 ■ Inspiring Cyclists of Every Age
 ■ Equipping Families for their Leisure Time.
Secondly, it was considered that the plans in place for the Autocentres 
business to increase its network by 20 to 30 centres per annum and 
invest in capability were also sound, and that the returns that would be 
generated and the opportunities to continue to take market share were 
attractive.

Driving attachment sales and return customers with bike care plans
For the Retail business, the review underscored the need to invest in 
our colleagues to enable them to best serve customers and to invest 
in our store, operations and IT infrastructures. The most pressing need 
was to address the root causes of our less than optimum service 
offer and ethic. Crucially, the key to success was to put in place plans 
to deliver top line growth that, in turn, would restore profitability and 
produce attractive and sustainable returns for our shareholders. These 
plans, which have been named Getting Into Gear 2016, are fully laid 
out in the Annual Report and will be implemented over the next three 
years. They are summarised as follows:
 — Service Revolution: introducing a marked step change in the 
quality of our service offer by investing in training, staffing and in-
store capability.
 — The H Factor: reasserting our authority across our key categories 
to excite our customers.
 — Stores Fit to Shop: investing in our store estate to raise standards 
and improve our customer experience.
 — 21st Century Infrastructure: investing in systems and 
infrastructure.
 — Click with the Digital Future: creating a contemporary and 
competitive service-led digital offer.
The specific initiatives underpinning these plans are now in place and 
the key milestones, or KPIs, by which we will measure our progress are 
set out in this report. Crucially, both our annual and long-term incentive 
plans will be similarly aligned. Over the three year period it is envisaged 
that some £100m of Retail Capital Expenditure will be necessary, 
c.£40m more than prior run rates. In addition, revenue investment of 
£7m–£14m will be made in FY14 primarily in our colleague capability; 
however, this will be dependent upon performance and revenue 
generation. This will have the inevitable consequence on earnings and 
cash flows in the next three years but will set up the business for an 
attractive and sustainable future in the years ahead.
We have carefully considered the financial implications of the new 
strategy and concluded that, given the need to maintain a robust 
balance sheet and our desire to rebuild our dividend cover to a more 
sustainable level, our dividend should be rebased. The Board has thus 
recommended a final dividend of 9.1 pence per share, a reduction of 
35.0% on the prior year, resulting in a full-year dividend of 17.1 pence, 
down 22.3%. The intention would be to reset the full year dividend 
for the next three years to around 14 pence per share which would 
enable us to remain within our gearing target of net debt to EBITDA of 
1.5 times and, over the period, converge towards a more sustainable 
dividend cover of 2 times.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all of our 12,000 
colleagues for their patience and commitment during a difficult year. 
Also, I thank them for the enthusiastic manner in which they have 
embraced the new direction and for their dedication to raising service 
levels for our customers. The new executive team under Matt is 
taking shape well and they are up for the challenges and opportunities 
ahead. Lastly, I would like to thank my Board colleagues for their 
dedication, counsel and support in what has been a very eventful 
year. Paul McClenaghan, who left the Board last month, did so with 
our best wishes.
In conclusion, the new financial year has started in a positive vein 
and encouraging progress is already being made on some of our key 
initiatives. Most notably, however, is the sense of purpose, excitement 
and engagement that is evident throughout the organisation – this 
bodes well for the years ahead.

Group Strategy and Key Performance Indicators
Halfords has a very clear place in the UK retail market. It is an iconic 
British brand with a fantastic heritage, having over 100 years’ presence 
on the retail High Street, both in cycling and aftermarket car products.

Our Group strategy is built on the Halfords vision that We Help and 
Inspire our Customers with their Life on the Move. However, as we 
have continued to develop this strategy we are now looking to deliver 
this vision and to maximise returns for our shareholders by focusing on 
the specific priorities required to create a sustainable business servicing 
our customers’ needs for many years to come.
Group Strategy Description
The execution of our three-pillared strategy remains central to our aim 
to build a sustainable business that not only drives profitable top line 
sales growth in the medium to long-term, but also seeks to promote a 
strong culture of work ethic and enjoyment with a focus on colleague 
development, combined with a determination to provide exceptional 
customer service, thus adding value for both our customers and our 
shareholders.
However, we have refocused these pillars to deliver clear purpose and 
definition to our customers and create a passionate and emotional 
connection between them, our colleagues and our products.

Within these three pillars our strategy is to drive top line sales growth 
from our core business. In Retail this means our 466 stores, our Retail 
website and product categories in which we hold leading market 
positions and in our Autocentres business through our 283 autocentres 
and halfordsautocentres.com. We intend to do this by focusing on our 
Getting Into Gear 2016 programme, the key elements of which are:
1. Service Revolution;

Demonstrating full solutions with combined storage and cycle transport systems
Group Strategy continued
By delivering these we aim to ensure that our customers see Halfords 
as the No.1 destination for all of the products that we offer, thus 
enhancing our customers’ use of their car, their bikes and their leisure 
activities.
We aim to Support Drivers of Every Car by re-establishing Halfords 
as the auto-specialist, providing the products, services and expertise 
required to take the hassle out of motoring and making driving 
more enjoyable. We are able to encourage our customers to do it 
for themselves or alternatively we are able to do it for them. We are 
dedicated to providing the right level of service for our customers from 
stocking the right products both in-store and online at competitive 
prices, complemented by a 7 days a week on-demand fitting service 
within our Retail stores to a full service and repair offer through the 
national coverage afforded by our Autocentres garages.
With our heritage in bikes we aim to Inspire Cyclists of Every Age with 
our unsurpassed product ranges and brands and with quality service 
and expertise and we will continue to offer these products and services 
whether it be to customers who are purchasing their first bike or a 
top-of-the-range Boardman or Pinarello racing bike. We aim to build on 
our service and brand credentials as well as providing a wide range of 
PACs — contributing to the growing popularity of cycling as a healthy 
and environmentally friendly form of transport.
With the development of our own ranges of camping equipment (such 
as Urban Escape), the continued supply of Gelert camping equipment 
and accessories and the enhancement of our caravanning accessories 
we will seek to Equip Families for their Leisure Time. The demand for 
a more active leisure time and the desire for the enjoyment of simple 
family pleasures, such as camping and caravanning gives Halfords the 
opportunity to engage with our customers and help them make the 
most of their time outdoors and to help them get there.
As part of our three-pillared strategy and supported by our key 
priorities we will continue to offer a unique range of products which 
is constantly innovated and extended. This is to be matched by an 
unparalleled honest and trustworthy service delivered by our 
well-trained, enthusiastic and knowledgeable colleagues in-store, at 
the Autocentres and online to help our customers, from novices to 
enthusiasts, work out exactly what they need. Our unique store fitting 
service and competitive Autocentre repair service gives customers the

Introduction
Halfords Retail sales performance in FY13 reflected a demanding 
trading environment. Sales were affected by unseasonal weather in 
the first and last quarters and by a summer of sport in between which 
particularly benefitted cycle sales. In the year under review, Halfords 
Retail delivered three quarters of positive like-for-like (“LfL”) sales 
growth, following a number of consecutive negative LfLs in preceding 
quarters, supported by online Retail revenue growth of 15.9%.
Our Autocentres performance was satisfactory against a backdrop of a 
declining market and particular challenges in the fleet sector.
Throughout the period the business has taken advantage of the 
opportunities presented and we have focused on improving our offer 
through service. Particular progress was made in the Car Maintenance 
category where we have invested in training and extra colleagues to 
carry out our wefit fitting service; this has driven extra sales.
FY13 Review
Summary of Group Results
Sales were £871.3m, up 1.0% and up 0.3% on an LfL basis. Group 
gross margin was flat at 54.8%. Total underlying operating costs rose 
by 6.2% due to the continuing inflationary environment, our strategic 
investments to support our Retail service offer and the continued 
expansion of our Autocentres business. Underlying Group earnings 
before interest, tax and non-recurring items were £78.1m, which 
compares with £97.2m in FY12. Profit before tax and non-recurring 
items was £72.0m and earnings per share before non-recurring items 
were 27.7p, down 21.9% and 17.8% respectively.
Group inventory and capital expenditure continued to be managed 
tightly, with Retail stocks down 9.2% on the prior year. Autocentres 
inventory was £1.3m, flat on the prior year. The cash flow performance 
was robust with free cash flow of £71.8m generated against £70.4m in 
the prior year. Net debt at the year-end was down £28.6m to £110.6m, 
with net debt:EBITDA remaining at a ratio of 1.1:1.
The Board has recommended a final dividend of 9.1 pence per share, 
a reduction of 35.0% on the prior year (FY12: 14.0 pence). If approved, 
this will be paid on 2 August 2013 to shareholders on the register at 
the close of business on 5 July 2013. The proposed full-year dividend 
is 17.1 pence (FY12: 22.0 pence). The 35.0% reduction of the final 
dividend would have the effect of similarly rebasing future dividend pay-
outs. It is anticipated that the FY14 full-year dividend would be reset 
to around 14 pence per share and that the full-year dividend would 
potentially remain around this level as the business approaches nearer 
2x dividend/earnings cover over the medium term. This would reflect 
a more-sustainable level for the business, the requirement to invest as 
set out later and the maintenance of a robust balance sheet.
Retail
Sales for the year were £745.5m, down 0.9% on the prior year and 
down 0.7% on an LfL basis. The sales mix and continued focus on cash 
returns resulted, as expected, in a broadly-flat Retail gross margin.
Cycling
After a disappointing start to the year, it was a particularly strong summer 
for Cycling sales. The enthusiasm surrounding British successes in 
the Tour de France, Olympics and Paralympics helped fuel a stronger 
demand for cycles, cycle products and cycle accessories and we 
capitalised on this with our agile trading stance. The strong demand for 
premium cycles continued throughout the year, particularly our exclusive 
Boardman and Pendleton ranges. We were pleased to add to our ranges 
with the introduction of Pinarello cycles, the brand ridden by Team Sky 
and used by Sir Bradley Wiggins to win the Tour de France.
During the second half overall cycle sales were affected by a poorer 
Christmas for kids and mainstream bikes, which continued into the final 
quarter as the prolonged winter weather delayed the start of the family 
cycling season. Cycling LfL sales were down 0.6% for the year. Online 
Cycling Parts, Accessory and Clothing (“PACs”) sales were up 26.5% in 
the final quarter as we began to introduce new ranges ready for a full-
scale launch of our enhanced PACs proposition in the new financial year.
Car Maintenance
LfL sales of Car Maintenance products and services grew by 5.1%, 
helped by the prolonged period of winter weather. Demand for our 
wefit service continues to build as we invest in this category and more 
customers look to us for expert help with basic Car Maintenance 
solutions. We fitted 35.2% of the bulbs, wiper blades and batteries we 
sold, up 890 basis points on last year. We invested in training, payroll, 
colleague numbers and national marketing to fulfil the demand and 
make more customers aware of our unique offer. The 3Bs parts and 
labour market is estimated to be worth around £950m and we only 
have a c.11% share*. In the year we also leveraged our market-leading 
position with timely promotions like our deals on Castrol oil.

Strategy
Encouraging engagement with qualified staff
 We now fit 35.2% of the 
bulbs, wiper blades and 
batteries (“3Bs”) we sell, 
up 890 basis points on 
last year. 
Car Enhancement
In Car Enhancement LfL sales decreased by 4.2%. This was a much 
slower rate of decline than in previous periods. Sat Nav sales have been 
a significant drag on the business over the last few years but during the 
second half of the year sales were flat. We also made market-share gains 
in both Sat Nav and Car Audio. Audio sales grew by an encouraging 
2.8% due to good execution and the authority of our range, established 
through our close partnership with the world’s leading technology 
brands. We are closer to the significant medium-term opportunity around 
Digital Radio and further share gains here mean we have now captured 
around three-quarters* of this growing market.
Travel Solutions
There was reduced demand for camping and touring products due to 
the generally poor weather both last summer and this spring. Our Travel 
Solutions category saw an LfL sales decline of 6.8%. One highlight was 
the sale of breathalysers during the summer and again this spring as 
they became a requirement for Continental travel and motorists visited 
Halfords for our exclusive Alcosense range. Child Car Seats remain a 
product range facing intense pricing and competitive pressure and, 
during the year, we continued to manage this category for cash.
Online
Online revenues grew by 15.9% and represented 10.3% of Retail sales 
which compares with 8.9% in the prior year. We continue to focus 
on improving our online experience for customers and we invested 
in website capability; for instance the launch of a new search engine, 
Fred Hopper, that will make it easier for online shoppers to search 
and navigate our site. We also introduced our new 24-hour Reserve 
& Collect service and rebalanced our promotions to focus more on 
product price rather than percentage discounting.
Autocentres
Autocentres sales were £125.8m, up 13.5% overall and represented 
a 7.0% LfL uplift on the prior year. The second-quarter LfL sales 
growth of 12.4% was the strongest since we acquired the business in 
February 2010 and the business has now enjoyed nine consecutive 
quarters of LfL growth.
Growth was driven by our investment in marketing, the development 
of our tyre proposition, our exclusive brakes4life offer and the 
contribution from new centres. The significant increase in lower-margin 
tyre sales resulted in a 221bps decline in gross margin, with margins in 
our non-tyre business benefitting from scale.
We continue to acquire new retail customers whilst retaining a high 
level of existing customers. However, fleet-customer acquisition has 
been less satisfactory with material short-term challenges in this sector. 
Twenty-three new centres were opened in the year bringing our total at 
the end of the year to 283 centres. We will continue to selectively and 
appropriately invest in new centres to significantly grow our network 
over the years ahead, targeting a further 20 to 30 new openings in 
FY14.
Halfords Business Review
Introduction
The fall in Group profitability over recent years illustrates the need 
for sustainable and profitable revenue growth over the medium and 
long-term to offset ongoing cost inflation. We must strengthen our 
proposition and customer offer in an environment where shopping 
patterns are changing and competition is increasing. As a result 
the Board asked me to carry out a review of the business with the 
management team and bring forward a plan to reposition Halfords to 
meet the challenges now and that lie ahead.
My conclusion is that Halfords is a good business with a clear strategic 
framework in place. However, there is some repositioning necessary to 
move Halfords from being good to being great; we must act now. Our 
single most important objective is to drive profitable sales growth and 
to do this through leveraging our expertise.
Following our review we have launched Getting Into Gear 2016, 
a clear programme of operational plans designed to significantly 
improve our Retail customer experience. This programme will focus 
on supporting our colleagues to deliver consistent friendly expertise, 
improve our store environment, strengthen the authority of our offer 
and build our infrastructure and digital capabilities. The investment 
required is anticipated to reduce short-term Retail profitability but is 
designed to deliver sustainable revenue and profit growth together with 
sustainable shareholder value.

Three-Pillared Strategy
Last year Halfords launched a new strategy that focused on three 
core pillars:
 ■ Friend of the Motorist
 ■ Best Cycle Shop in Town
 ■ Starting Point for Great Getaways
We believe this is the right strategic framework and the new 
programme of activity we are initiating is designed to support and 
drive these three pillars which we have redefined slightly to introduce a 
clearer purpose and more passion.
Our mission is to Help and Inspire Customers with their Life on the 
Move. The existing pillars have evolved to become:
 ■ Supporting Drivers of Every Car
 ■ Inspiring Cyclists of Every Age
 ■ Equipping Families for their Leisure Time
Our two critical pillars are Auto and Cycling with the third pillar giving 
us the flexibility to extend our range, introduce innovative products and 
leverage space. Ninety percent of our focus needs to be on Auto and 
Cycling as these markets are significant and, with good execution, we 
can grow our share as well as the overall market.
Halfords Autocentres
A central part of our strategy of Supporting Drivers of Every Car is our 
newest business, Halfords Autocentres.
Halfords is a trusted brand in the automotive sector, so the move into 
garage servicing was a natural extension of the Halfords business 
model. We now offer customers end-to-end solutions, from car parts 
to the fitting of bulbs, blades and batteries in our Retail stores and full 
servicing, MOTs and repairs at our Autocentres.
Our review concluded that our strategy for Autocentres is sound and 
the Autocentres business provides a significant growth opportunity 
for the Group. However, we also concluded that the short-term profit 
expectations discussed at the time of acquisition were overly optimistic. 
These short-term expectations didn’t fully consider the implications of 
a rapid expansion of the chain through new-centre openings, nor the 
impact of the auto-aftercare market environment which has been more 
difficult than expected in the period since acquisition. The economic 
down turn has particularly hit motorists through escalating fuel and 
insurance costs. In response motorists have reduced mileage and cut 
back on other costs where possible – including car servicing. As a 
result we estimate the overall market has contracted by around 5% in 
the last three years*.

Strategy
Despite this Halfords has grown its Autocentre retail LfL sales by 4.3% 
in the same period, over 9% better than the market. This was achieved 
through better use of existing Autocentres capacity. We have recruited 
thousands of new customers by rebranding the estate and nationally 
advertising. We also offer customers a wider range of products like 
tyres and our innovative brakes4life offer.
The Auto-Aftercare market provides Halfords with an opportunity for 
further growth. It is estimated to be worth around £9bn* and Halfords 
only has a small share – our 283 centres represent less than 2% of 
the market.
The market is also highly fragmented and capacity is declining. There 
are some 22,000 garage sites and 1–2% leave the market each year. 
The complexities of new cars and the investments required make it 
more difficult for small operators to compete. By contrast Halfords has 
increased Autocentre chain numbers by around 27% since acquisition 
and invested heavily to support growth.
Halfords is well placed to take market share. We are a recognised 
strong brand in Auto-Aftercare which is a key advantage – as trust 
is one of the main factors affecting motorists’ choice of garages. So 
our proposition of dealership quality work at more affordable prices, 
supported by a high level of customer service is a compelling one. We 
can also leverage national advertising and cross-sell between Retail 
and Autocentre customers.
The short-term issue for the business is the drag created by our 
new-centre opening programme. Our core centres are performing 
well and, as we expand, our buying leverage creates value. However, 
the contribution from new centres is outweighed by the investments 
needed for the opening programme. It is predominantly these new-
centre investments that are holding back overall short-term profitability 
together with investments in the infrastructure to support a business 
growing at the pace of Autocentres.
Having reviewed the business, we believe that Autocentres is a great 
growth opportunity for us. We have a clear strategy for the future 
being executed by the Autocentres management team and we can 
build a business of significant scale. Operationally we will increase 
what we sell to our existing customers by focusing services on the 
“Big4”: Service, MOT, Repair and Tyres. We will support these sales 
through innovations like Sunday openings, new product packages and 
refreshing our website to make booking a service or selecting a tyre 
even easier.
Through proven marketing routes we will drive more footfall to our 
Autocentres. We will grow our share of the fleet market by developing 
our presence with existing customers and attracting and developing 
new customers.
Our new-centre opening programme will continue with 20–30 new 
centres planned per annum requiring a capital investment of around 
£6m per annum. We also anticipate that the market will return to 
growth as maintenance and repairs return to more normalised levels. 
Over the medium-term we expect to see profitability build as critical 
mass is reached in the business.

Halfords Retail
Our review of Halfords Retail addresses the significant challenges we 
face and sets out a programme of activity to reposition the business; to 
move us from good to great as we prepare Halfords for the future and 
put it on a path to consistently drive profitable top-line growth.
Halfords has a very strong place in UK retail. We have an excellent 
brand that shoppers in Britain have grown up with and there’s no doubt 
in a customer’s mind what Halfords stands for and what we sell. We 
are the nation’s leading cycle retailer, selling over 1m cycles a year 
and we are the go-to destination for motorists. So our products and 
services are relevant for today’s customers and key parts of our offer, 
especially those which are service related, are unique to Halfords.
The categories in which Halfords operates provide good opportunities 
for growth. For instance, the Cycle market is buoyant and the 
popularity of Cycling is growing. The market for Cycles is worth around 
£700m* and Halfords has a c.20–25% share*. The market for PACs 
is a similar size; we only have c.15% share in this market. Last year 
the entire Cycling market grew by 8.5% and over the next five years 
is anticipated will grow by around 23%**. In the Cycle Repair market, 
worth c.£100m*, we estimate having only a c.8% share. Our focus in 
FY13 on Cycle Repair produced sales growth of 25.3% and we are 
implementing a strategy for further growth in this category in FY14.
Halfords also has good potential for growth in Retail Car Maintenance. 
The 3Bs parts and labour market is estimated to be worth around 
£950m* and we only have a c.11% market share. Wefit is a unique 
offer and we have invested in colleagues, training, advertising and held 
wefit weekends to raise awareness. The 50.5% growth this year in the 
number of 3B fitting jobs and the associated growth of 10.9% in parts 
sales illustrate how much customers welcome this service and what an 
area of ongoing opportunity it is.
Halfords is in a strong position to make the best of these market 
opportunities if we can present the right offer to customers. We 
have great expertise and heritage and a nationwide store network. 
Meanwhile our global sourcing infrastructure can supply excellent 
products from the world’s leading manufacturers at least-cost to our 
customers – for instance our exclusive range of Boardman cycles, 
which combine industry-leading designs with prices that are around 
15% lower than a cycle of comparable specification.
Our sales are supported by a core of colleagues who are 
knowledgeable experts. On our day the service we provide is hard to 
beat. However, our review shows that service levels are inconsistent 
and this and other aspects of the Halfords experience frustrate 
customers; many are now choosing to shop elsewhere.
One measure of this is the Halfords Net Promoter Score, which 
assesses the propensity of customers to recommend our services to 
others. The Halfords score was, until very recently, close to that of a 
value retailer; this is a long way adrift from the score of a specialist, 
where we ought to be.
Meanwhile the competition is escalating in our core categories, such 
as from online Cycling specialists. As a result our profitability is being 
eroded. In the last 13 quarters, 10 have seen Retail LfL sales declines. 
Our revenues have gone from c.£812m in FY10 to c.£746m in FY13.
Halfords must generate profitable revenue growth over the medium and 
long-term; the key action that will drive sales is better customer service. 
We have thousands of amazing people but we haven’t supported them 
to do the job they aspire to. This was evident in the 12,000 comments 
we received in last year’s Colleague Engagement Survey which was 
packed with suggestions on how to support colleagues in their roles 
and help them help customers.
Our conclusion is that we must focus on customer service and deliver 
a great customer experience. To do this we have to improve colleague 
engagement, develop their friendly expertise consistently across our 
estate and use it to drive sales. Through our colleagues’ product 
knowledge and our range authority we can re-build our credentials as 
a specialist retailer. We must also improve our stock availability, retail 
disciplines, our store environment and overall customer experience. 
All these improvements must be made as we position ourselves for a 
digital future.
Our focus is to create a business with belief in the quality of its 
products and services and where friendly expertise is at its core.
To deliver this the Getting Into Gear 2016 programme has been 
launched and is specifically designed to drive profitable and sustainable 
top-line growth. Whilst a lot of work is already underway the complete 
programme will take around three years to deliver.
Group Chief Executive Officer’s Review continued
 
 Service is at the heart 
of our proposition as we 
estimate two thirds of our 
products require some level 
of assistance.

Strategy
 
Getting Into Gear 2016
Getting Into Gear 2016 has the following key elements for our Retail 
business:
1. Service Revolution – introducing a step change in customer 
service across Halfords stores.
2. The H Factor – reasserting our proposition authority to Support 
Drivers of Every Car, Inspire Cyclists of Every Age and Equip 
Families for their Leisure Time.
3. Stores Fit to Shop – investing to raise the Halfords store estate to 
a standard that is acceptable and operable.
4. 21st Century Infrastructure – systems and infrastructure to 
support service and sales.
5. Click with the Digital Future – creating a service-led digital 
proposition.
1. Service Revolution
Service is Halfords’ key area of focus. Service is at the heart of our 
proposition as we estimate around two-thirds of our Retail products 
require some level of assistance. Increasingly we are making a merit of 
this and service is becoming a product in its own right.
The level of service we aspire to is something that supermarkets will 
never be able to deliver. It also gives us a competitive advantage 
over the online, pure-play retailers who have no stores or colleagues 
on the ground to support their sales. But we have to improve to deliver 
the promise.
Friendly, expertise-based service is fundamental to profitable and 
sustainable sales growth. When customers have a better experience 
at Halfords they will spend more with us and recommend us to their 
friends. The Service Revolution will ensure customers are served by 
colleagues who are enthusiastic about their role at Halfords and the 
products and services we offer.
Unfortunately, we have let other pressures and processes get in 
the way of service and our focus on recruitment, development and 
retention has not been what it should be; consequently colleague 
turnover is very high.
Our new programme makes our people a focus of our KPIs and our 
store-incentives programme will now be linked to service as well as 
sales. We are changing the way we recruit and develop, revising rotas 
and scheduling and amending contracted hours to make sure we 
always have colleagues available to serve customers.
We are opening new Halfords Academies to provide the training 
that colleagues need; we are also launching 3-Gears, a qualification 
programme that trains and rewards colleagues for gaining expertise.
Gear 1
Gear 1 applies to all colleagues and is completed over their first three-
month period with Halfords. We use structured e-learning modules 
that cover retail skills, product knowledge and customer service. The 
outcome is that all store colleagues will be qualified to serve customers.
Gear 2
Gear 2 involves a nine-month training programme which leads to an 
expert level of product knowledge, with a specialism in either Auto & 
Leisure or Cycling. Tuition is both through e-learning and face-to-face 
training programmes. There are regular refresher courses for Gear 2 
colleagues and a pay award for those who attain this level.
Gear 3
Gear 3 colleagues are our Gurus. They are product experts who are 
qualified to train others. They keep their skills and knowledge current 
and market leading - through workshops, attending product and trade 
shows and by linking with and visiting suppliers. Our Gurus also receive 
leadership development and a pay award. We anticipate having two 
Gurus per store.
The 3-Gears programme profoundly changes our expectations of our 
colleagues and sends a clear message on the focus of their role and 
the importance we place on helping them succeed.
This particular investment is one of the most important we will make 
as we commit a total of £7m Retail operating-cost investment in FY14 
across the Service Revolution and the pay review. A further £7m of 
operating cost will be invested in Retail colleagues this year across  30

Growing success with extended range of Pendleton branded bikes
Group Chief Executive Officer’s Review continued
Cycle Repair, Fitting and incentives, depending on volumes and 
performance.
To give customers better service we are also working on our basic retail 
disciplines. We have not been delivering to a high enough standard on 
many of these; that is now changing.
There is a lot of work underway to improve our retail disciplines. For 
instance we are removing unnecessary task from colleagues so they 
can focus more time on customers. Store-friendly deliveries will take 
place out of hours and won’t interfere with service. Deliveries will also 
be organised in a way that takes less time to check in and unload. 
Finally we are moving to pick-friendly warehouses so colleagues can 
easily find and replenish stock.
We also know that availability has been a key area where our service 
has disappointed customers. To improve we have introduced efficient 
hand-held scanners in each store that support us counting stock and 
maintaining the overall integrity of our stock file.
The business is currently holding an historic low of stock as a result of 
some improved processes and old stock clear-outs; however, in some 
areas this has impacted store availability and overall trading capability. 
During FY14 we anticipate investing an incremental £15m–20m in 
Retail stock. Part of this is natural rebuild but the majority will support 
improved in-store availability and our ambitions in PACs.
2. The H Factor
Reasserting our proposition authority is a priority we are labelling the 
H Factor.
Halfords has some award-winning products in many areas of the 
business but our analysis concludes we need to do even better 
for our customers. This means better product development and 
design, stronger value and better space allocation to support growth 
opportunities in new or existing ranges.
By the end of the summer we plan to have rebalanced c.100 stores, 
moving child seats downstairs in stores with mezzanine floors, 
releasing space to cycling, better segmenting our Cycle offer and 
reallocating space away from the Car Enhancement category.
Our research also demonstrates the need to focus on our core areas 
and to rebuild our credentials as a specialist retailer across the Auto 
and Cycling ranges. We believe more authority is a route to competitive 
advantage and that specialism is something we should celebrate.
Innovation is key and we will work harder to delight our customers and 
colleagues. We plan more special buys and to use our third pillar to 
trade against. For instance we have just bought 1,000 inflatable kayaks 
that we will retail at £99.99 as an exciting addition for family holiday 
adventures this summer.
Our initiatives within our motoring pillar include a new partnership with 
battery supplier, Yuasa, to introduce electronic diagnostic terminals into 
every store. This allows us to reset a car’s electronic system after work 
on the battery of a modern stop/start car, something no other retailer is 
doing on such a large scale.
The government is expected to commit to a digital radio switch-over 
later this year. We are preparing for this opportunity with new audio 
ranges built through excellent relations with the world’s leading radio 
manufacturers.
To Inspire Cyclists of Every Age we are planning to make this The Year 
of the Cycle at Halfords, building on the momentum created around 
the Olympics last year. We have a series of range re-launches planned, 
including our exclusive Voodoo and Boardman ranges. We are adding 
several new models to the successful Pendleton range and later in the 
year we are re-launching a new range of Apollo bikes. We have also 
just been appointed by Sky as their technical partner for Sky Rides 
across the country. This will help promote our Cycle Repair offer to the 
150,000 participating cyclists alongside the Sky brand.
Meanwhile the launch of 15,000 PACs lines is going live this month and 
we are advertising our Cycle Repair offer on the radio and in the press.
To Equip Families for their Leisure Time we have just launched our 
new camping range, incorporating Vango for the first time, a brand 
synonymous with camping, as well as a new range of camping 
accessories.
This momentum will continue, with greater innovation to create more 
excitement for our customers.
 Halfords has some award 
winning products in many 
areas . . . better product 
development and design, 
stronger value.  31

Strategy
3. Stores Fit to Shop
We have reviewed our store estate and concluded there is no good 
reason to reduce our store numbers significantly, as c.99% of our 466 
stores generate a cash profit.
Our focus on driving profitable sales growth will keep the number of 
loss-making stores to a minimum. Over the next three years we will 
resize where we get the opportunity and will close a few stores as part 
of business as usual. We plan to make the space we occupy work 
harder and utilise our estate to support our digital ambitions. Nearly 
90% of online transactions are already picked up in-store; once in 
store, we have the advantage of offering extra service.
We do need more stores in Greater London where we are currently 
under-represented. Over the coming years we will focus on achieving a 
higher level of store-penetration inside the M25.
We intend to maximise lease flexibility so we can manage our estate 
efficiently from a trading perspective. This involves securing more 
break clauses on lease renewals with our landlords and leveraging our 
position to mitigate rent-increase pressures.
In summary we don’t anticipate any significant change in overall store 
numbers.
In terms of the look and feel of our stores there’s a lot of work to 
do. Much of our estate is no longer at an acceptable standard of 
presentation and significantly lags behind our customers’ expectations, 
especially cyclists, where a fresh and modern store environment is 
so important.
Last year we began to design a store format for the future with a trial 
of a number of so-called ‘laboratory stores’. We have reviewed the 
progress of these stores throughout the year. There are some very 
positive learnings but overall we don’t believe the design is right for 
roll-out. We have initiated a project to define a format that combines 
a more coherent customer journey, a focus on one centralised desk 
to support sales and service, introduces more live displays, brings our 
Cycle Repair and wefit offer to the fore and supports us to trade the 
overall store environment harder.
Work is well underway and we expect to have three stores up and 
running in the new format (York, Coventry and Evesham) by the end 
of the summer; we anticipate c.10–15 stores in the new format by the 
end of FY14.
Over the next three years we expect to fully refurbish c.150 stores and 
modernise all our cycling departments. This will require an investment 
of c.£50m of capital expenditure.
4. 21st Century Infrastructure
The business has successfully completed the reorganisation of our 
distribution network around a central distribution centre in Coventry 
and a specialised cycle centre in Redditch. We are now focusing our 
supply-chain work on supporting our service in-store, consistent 
stock availability and digital ambitions. We have started a trial of 
air-lock deliveries where stock is delivered overnight, to be worked on 
before the store opens in the morning so that it doesn’t detract 
from colleagues serving customers and doesn’t incur the costs of a 
night shift.
We are also reviewing our multichannel infrastructure as well as the 
operations of our fleet. Like many other retailers, the Halfords IT system 
has much room for improvement. Our systems have been modified to 
reflect increasing demands but are no longer suitable for our current 
or future needs. In the short-term, we have a number of ‘must do’ 
core projects to complete, including a data-centre relocation, a SAP 
upgrade and a new store voice and data network. We are investing in 
our IT infrastructure and have recently recruited an IT Director to lead 
this work.
Together with our digital plans we will invest c.£38m of capital 
expenditure over the next three years in our IT and Digital plans.
5. Click with the Digital Future
Building our digital proposition is a key route to driving future top-line 
growth and maintaining our ongoing relevance.
Our ambition is to create a service-led digital proposition. Of all retailers 
Halfords has the opportunity to be truly multichannel – combining 
the best of the web with friendly expertise in-store. Our digital review, 
in conjunction with an external consultancy, shows that our current 
multichannel proposition doesn’t provide a satisfactory customer 
experience. We are therefore putting in place a schedule of work that 
centres on a new website aligned around our three strategic pillars so 
that customers can shop in dedicated product zones. The site will be 
optimised for tablets and mobile devices, as these currently account 
for around 24% of online Retail sales; usage is expected to double over 
the next few years. We will also develop community features, live chats, 
integrated dynamic content, improved customer account management 
and help pages.
We are working to improve our online fulfilment, especially on Reserve 
& Collect, stock availability, our returns capabilities and staff training 
to improve service levels in-store. Our recent focus on stock in the 
second half of the year has already resulted in improvements in our 
Reserve & Collect net promoter scores.
Investment
Through our review we believe we now have the right key priorities and 
have detailed and clear action plans in place.
We have the opportunity to be a specialist retailer with real service and 
product authority in core categories. Our ranges will be more innovative 
and will be designed to excite and delight customers. Our stores will 
be more inspirational environments where customers want to shop 
and where they will be greeted by knowledgeable colleagues who offer 
friendly expertise.
Under Getting Into Gear 2016 we will be investing around £100m 
in Retail capital expenditure over three years which is an incremental 
£40m against previous run-rate guidance. Around £50m of the 
investment will be targeted directly at stores.
We also intend to invest around £21m in Retail operating costs in FY14 
over and above our FY13 expenditure, of which c.£11m is volume and 
performance dependent. Key elements of this will be to support the 
Service Revolution and to support an uplift in LfL sales. 32

Halfords engaging the next generation of cyclists through our Kids Holiday Bike Clubs
The new management team is taking shape. Rob Swyer was 
appointed as Retail Director, David Durie as Marketing Director, 
Anna Barsby as IT Director and, most recently, Emma Fox as 
Commercial Director.
The 3-Gears programme was launched to our store managers at our 
recent spring conference and the first training has taken place. Our 
new recruitment website is already in operation and our new store 
format plan is taking shape.
We have appointed a new advertising agency, Mother; they are 
currently working on our summer campaign.
We have begun trialling out-of-hours delivery to stores.
Thousands of new PACs lines are being launched online this month, 
which is the culmination of a long period of planning and preparation.
We have also started to improve our credentials within the communities 
in which we operate. We have run a series of Kids Bikes Workshops 
over the Easter period, teaching thousands of kids basic bike 
maintenance skills and hopefully enthusing the next generation of 
cyclists and Halfords customers.
Conclusion
Our review concludes that Halfords fulfils an important role for its 
customers. Their busy lives and leisure time rely on the products and 
services that we provide. We have a huge competitive advantage if we 
can deliver on our promise of friendly expert service and inspire and 
excite more people to shop with us.
The plans we are putting in place are essential to reposition Halfords 
to meet the challenges ahead. We are targeting delivering profitable 
revenue growth over the medium and long-term.
There is a lot of activity now underway at Halfords to execute this 
programme. At this stage we anticipate that profits in FY14 may reduce 
as we invest. It is anticipated that Group EBITDA may not exceed 
current levels until FY16.
The Board is acutely aware of the importance of Halfords’ dividend to 
our shareholders. However, our need to invest whilst maintaining both 
an appropriate level of earnings cover and a robust balance sheet has 
led the Board to recommend a rebasing of the dividend. Taking this 
action will ensure Halfords has a robust foundation on which to build 
and to maximise longer-term shareholder returns.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all of our colleagues for 
their immense contribution and commitment to the progress of our 
business and the implementation of our plan to reposition Halfords.

Transforming Halfords
Halfords is a good business with 
a really clear strategic framework 
in place. However, there is some 
repositioning necessary to move 
Halfords from being good to being 
great. Our single most important 
objective is to drive profitable 
sales growth over the medium and 
long-term, and to do this through 
leveraging our expertise.
Over the next three years we shall 
be delivering a programme to make 
Halfords great!
This programme – Getting Into Gear 
2016 – is specifically designed to 
drive profitable top line growth and 
will transform Halfords.

Service Revolution
Enhancing value through expert advice
To deliver the step change we want to achieve in customer experience, 
we have embarked upon a series of changes to how we get the best 
from our people.
The service revolution is made up of the following key activities
 ■ improving our approach to recruiting the very best people
 ■ providing a structured development programme for all – our 3-Gears 
programme
 ■ paying colleagues based on level of skill and expertise
 ■ incentivising all colleagues in-store to drive sales and a great 
customer experience through net promoter scores (“NPS”)
 ■ reducing time spent on non-value adding tasks and increasing 
customer contact
Recruiting the very best people – we have streamlined our recruitment 
process, trained all store managers to recruit, introduced the latest 
screening techniques to ensure we hire colleagues with the right 
attitude – people who love customers.
The 3-Gears programme – all colleagues now undertake a structured 
three month induction (Gear 1), followed by a nine month programme 
(Gear 2) which includes workshops, e-learning and demonstrated 
expertise on the shop floor. By the end of the financial year we will 
also have launched Gear 3 for a limited group of colleagues which 
will establish them as real technical experts in automotive & leisure or 
cycling.
 These changes will allow colleagues to 
deliver friendly expert service to customers 
and are key to driving our top line growth. 
Learn to Earn – once Gear 2 is reached, colleagues will receive a 
meaningful increase in pay, so long as they maintain the higher level 
of expertise. Similarly with Gear 3. The benefit of this approach is that 
colleagues will be motivated to learn more and maintain their skills, the 
increased pay will also help with attraction of high calibre people and 
improve retention levels, all of which benefit customer experience.
One bonus scheme for all – all store colleagues are now incentivised to 
drive the top line and to improve the customer experience (measured 
through NPS and mystery shopping). The scheme targets are based 
quarterly and accumulated through the year, but paid out annually, 
which again helps with improving colleague retention.
Task reduction – as well as increasing contract time for customer 
service advisers, we are reducing tasks that have no direct benefit to 
customers (smarter deliveries, less administration, etc.) so that we can 
use our time better to serve customers.
These changes will allow colleagues to deliver friendly expert service to 
customers and are key to driving our top line growth.

The H Factor — reasserting our proposition authority
Over the years Halfords had become the natural destination for 
Automotive, Cycling and Travel Solution products and services that we 
offer; however, more recently this authority in our range and products 
has waned as our proposition no longer inspired our customers and 
our service levels were inconsistent.
However, we have the building blocks to once again be the “place to 
shop” for our products and to give our customers the confidence that 
“what they want”, we stock. We already stock great cycling products; 
from kids’ bikes, family bikes, and commuter bikes right up to the 
premium Boardman and Pinarello bikes. We also carry a wide range of 
automotive after-market products from car cleaning to bulbs, blades 
and batteries through to our Halfords Autocentres garages providing a 
wide range of service, maintenance and repair expertise. Our camping 
brands, including Gelert, CampingGaz, Outwell, Vango and our own 
brand Urban Escape, provide families with the equipment to enjoy their 
leisure time.
We are driven by the need to bring passion and excitement back to 
our stores, we need to attract customers back to browse our stores, 
be excited by the innovative products on offer, by the solutions we can 
offer them in their busy lives and be awed by the level of specialism 
and associated knowledge and expertise of our colleagues.
 By the end of the summer we will 
have rebalanced some 100 stores with a 
focus of moving child seats downstairs in 
stores, releasing space to cycling, better 
segmenting our Cycle offer and taking 
space away from car enhancement. 
  
Consequently over the next few years we are going to restore and 
celebrate our specialism in our the three core pillars. We will continue 
Supporting Drivers of Every Car by increasing our coverage of the 
UK car parc, and looking to reduce delivery time to our stores for 
the product lines we don’t regularly carry. This will complement and 
supplement our 3Bs fitting offer where we have seen the number of 
jobs grow by c.32% in FY13 as more of our customers become aware 
of this cost-effective, hassle-free solution to their busy lives. We will 
continue to Inspire Cyclists of Every Age with our wide ranging cycle 
offer from our range of children’s bikes and matching accessories; such 
as the Apollo Cupcake bike, helmet & bell through to our premium 
brands of Boardman and the recently introduced Pinarello.
We will seek to mirror our success in our 3Bs fitting offer by committing 
resources in-store and developing our 3-Gears programme to build 
our cycle repair offer, delivering a significant revenue stream and 
increasing our authority as a comprehensive cycle shop. By the end 
of the summer we will have rebalanced some 100 stores with a focus 
of moving child seats downstairs in stores, releasing space to cycling, 
better segmenting our Cycle offer and taking space away from car 
enhancement. Our customers will be able to find what they want when 
they want it, engaging with knowledgeable colleagues who can build 
trust and confidence and revenues.
In providing trustworthy solutions to our customers, supporting their 
use of both the car and the bike, Halfords is already Equipping Families 
for their Leisure Time and as we continue to develop this area from 
camping products to caravan accessories, we will continue to look to 
excite both colleagues and customers through the introduction of new 
leisure products that build on Halfords’ authority in bikes and cars and 
drives revenue growth in this area.
All of this must recreate and enhance the H Factor: the confidence 
and trust with which customers can turn to Halfords as the natural 
destination for their automotive, cycling and leisure products.

Stores Fit to Shop
We need to bring passion and excitement back to our stores! Do our 
customers shop at Halfords because they need to or because they 
enjoy the visit? A large number of our stores are not of an acceptable 
standard, they lag behind our customers’ expectations, fuelling the 
impression that our offer is tired and boring.
During last year we announced a trial of laboratory stores and whilst 
these were successful in certain areas, e.g. cycle segmentation, 
collection points, changing rooms, we concluded that these models 
are not the answer to revitalising our estate; that we could do better. 
We need to make the stores less sterile and we want to build an 
emotional connection with our customers, a desire to shop at Halfords, 
an anticipation of shopping in pleasant surroundings, and an eagerness 
to use our stores as a means to shop Halfords in different ways, be 
that in-store or online. A place to enjoy the shopping experience rather 
than endure it.
We plan to step change the improvement in store environment to 
surpass customer expectations, to make them warm agreeable places 
to shop. It is important that our stores feel fresh and modern and 
support the digital customer, the smartphone user, and the online 
buyer. Approximately 90% of our online sales are collected in-store. 
We must also leverage our store space better to maximize our sales 
opportunities. We will continue to invest in cycle segmentation, 
provide changing rooms to support our cycle clothing ambitions, a 
major revenue growth opportunity, build our authority in 3Bs through 
dedicated product zones and also extend these product specific zones 
to other products such as child seats. Helping our customers shop our 
stores for the products they want and need supported by dedicated 
and knowledgeable colleagues.
To help us in this ambition we have initiated programme 50:39. A 
programme, named after Sir Bradley Wiggins’ winning time in the 
Olympic Time Trial event and designed to deliver engagement with our 
customers’ shopping experience by implementing the learnings from 
specific laboratory-store successes. These stores will up the level of 
emotional engagement, provide a more coherent customer journey, 
focus on one centralised desk to support sales and service, introduce 
more live displays, bring our cycle repair and wefit offer to the fore and 
support us to trade the overall store environment harder.  
All this must create a compelling environment that excites customers, 
improves the experience and emotional engagement of our customers 
and our colleagues in-store, and bring passion back to Halfords!
FY14 Operational Milestones
 ■ 10–15 full store refits.
 ■ 75 Cycling departments brought up to date.
 ■ 20–30 Autocentres opened.
 These stores will up the level of 
emotional engagement and provide a 
more coherent customer journey.

Our Supply Chain and IT infrastructure needs to support our service 
focus in-store and our digital ambitions. 
Our IT systems are out of date and in need of upgrading. In common 
with many retailers new business opportunities have been supported 
to bespoke changes to existing systems. As a result our systems 
landscape is complex and expensive to maintain with changes to 
support new business opportunities taking too long to implement and 
being too costly.
Our Supply Chain needs to adapt to deliver better on shelf availability 
and ensure colleagues can focus on serving customers rather than 
being blinded by the task of stocking shelves. We also need to put 
in place the capacity and capability to support our ambitious digital 
growth strategy and make the customer experience seamless between 
stores and online.
 We have started a trial of airlock 
deliveries where stock can be delivered 
overnight. 
We have started a trial of airlock deliveries where stock is delivered 
overnight and can be worked first thing in the morning before the store 
opens. We intend to roll this to further stores over the next 12 months.
To improve availability we have invested in new hand-held scanners 
in each store that together with new processes support us counting 
stock and maintaining the overall integrity of our stock file. We’re also 
getting back to a real focus on good old-fashioned stock management 
disciplines. 
We’ve already started a number of core IT infrastructure projects 
including the upgrade of SAP , the installation of a new faster store 
network and the move of our data centre. Beyond these we will look 
to invest in world class, scalable systems that support our digital and 
service growth ambitions in order to drive profitable sales growth.

Click with the Digital Future
To support our 21st century ambitions of interacting with our 
customers in as many exciting ways as possible and thereby driving 
engagement and revenue growth, we need to embrace the digital 
future. Our young customers may not be embracing the automobile as 
their parents once did, but they are the i-generation seeking innovative 
ways of shopping and interacting with products.
Halfords is well placed to take advantage of this phenomenon 
with most of our products being well suited to online display and 
demonstration and we are able to offer 2.5 times more SKUs (stock-
keeping units) online than in-store. The mobile version of our site 
enables our customers to research and purchase online while they are 
on the move. Mobile traffic and revenues have experienced significant 
growth and over 40% of all visits and almost a third of our online sales 
are now through these devices. The Halfords App and quick response 
(“QR”) codes at the point of sale are other mobile innovations that we 
have introduced to enhance our customers’ buying experience; they 
can scan barcodes and access rich content like videos and product 
information, or get help in finding the right part for their make and 
model of vehicle. We have experienced over 800,000 visits to our App 
last year and around 15,000 QR codes were scanned.
However, unfortunately, even with all this work the multichannel 
experience provided to our customers remains average at best. As 
mentioned earlier our logistics solution does not support our ambitions 
and we experience strong competition in certain categories from pure 
play retailers.
 We must invest in our digital future to 
make Halfords a market leading integrated 
multichannel business centred around our 
three pillars. 
We had mixed success in FY13 where we have seen a sustained 
increased online participation in Baby & Child products, Bikes, PACs 
and Car Parts, although online participation lags behind the wider 
market in other categories. However, we continue to see compelling 
revenue opportunities in PACs and Camping.
With our ambition to drive profitability revenue growth over the medium 
and long-term we must invest and improve our web-based offer. 
Over the next 12 months we plan to provide a much better website 
experience. It will be aligned around our three product pillars so if you 
are a cyclist, you will shop in a dedicated cycling site where we won’t 
be trying to sell you engine oil – maybe just a few energy bars.  This will 
then develop into a cycle shop we can be proud of by the end of 2014 
with community features, live chat and integrated dynamic content. 
This redesign will make our site easier to search and navigate, provide 
personalised merchandising and create passion in our products 
through online communities. It will attract more customers; inspire, 
inform and convince customers to buy our products; enable them to 
transact and checkout easily and securely; and with the right support 
will ensure that goods are delivered/collected on time. This will ensure 
a pleasing shopping experience that results in customers returning to 
the site.

The “FY13” accounting period represents trading for the 52 weeks to 
29 March 2013 (“the year”). The comparative period “FY12” represents 
trading for the 52 weeks to 30 March 2012 (“the prior year”).
Group revenue in FY13, at £871.3m, was up +1.0% and comprised 
Retail revenue of £745.5m and Autocentres revenue of £125.8m. This 
compared to FY12 Group revenue of £863.1m, which comprised Retail 
revenue of £752.3m and Autocentres revenue of £110.8m.
Group gross profit at £477.1m (FY12: £472.8m) represented 54.8% 
of Group revenue (FY12: 54.8%), reflecting an increase in the Retail 
business of 12 basis points (“bps”) and a gross margin of 63.7% 
(FY12: 65.9%) in the Autocentres business.
Total Operating costs before non-recurring items increased to 
£399.0m (FY12: £375.6m), of which Retail represented £323.4m 
(FY12: £307.0m), Autocentres £73.8m (FY12: £66.4m) and unallocated 
costs £1.8m (FY12: £2.2m). Unallocated costs represent amortisation 
charges in respect of intangible assets acquired through business 
combinations (the acquisition of Nationwide Autocentres Ltd in 
February 2010), which arose on consolidation of the Group.
Net finance costs for the year were £6.1m (FY12: £5.0m).
Group Profit Before Tax and non-recurring items for the year was down 
21.9% at £72.0m (FY12: £92.2m).
Net non-recurring expenses of £1.0m (FY12: income £1.9m) during 
the year represented costs of £1.2m in respect of two onerous lease 
contracts, asset impairment costs of £0.8m to support the “Stores 
Fit to Shop” initiative, and non-recurring income of £1.0m from the 
partial release of the Focus DIY lease guarantee provision, recognised 
as a non-recurring cost in FY11, resulting from better than anticipated 
settlements.
Group Profit Before Tax for the year after non-recurring items was 
down -21.9% at £72.0m (FY12: £92.2m).

Strategy
Cycling revenues were down 0.4% with the benefit of the Olympics 
offset by poor early-summer and final-quarter weather.
Car Maintenance revenues were up +5.1%, primarily driven by the 
success of the Bulbs, Blades and Batteries (“3Bs”) fitting initiative, and 
helped by extended cold winter conditions.
Car Enhancement revenues were down -4.2%, a significantly better 
comparable performance than in recent years, with growth in Audio 
and a reduced decline in Sat Nav sales.
Travel Solutions revenues were down -6.8%, with camping revenues 
being impacted by the lack of any conducive summer weather 
conditions. Child car seats declined due to the continued focus on 
managing the category for cash.
Revenue for the Retail business is split by category below:
FY13
(%)
FY12
(%)
Cycling 29.6 29.5 
Car Maintenance 32.6 30.8
Car Enhancement 24.9 25.8

Gross profit for the Retail business at £397.0m (FY12: £399.8m) 
represented 53.3% of sales, 12bps up on the prior year (FY12: 53.1%). 
This was a result of increased Car Maintenance parts and fitting 
revenues, with lower levels of shrinkage as a result of the focus on 
Retail disciplines in the period. Sales of winter chemicals also enhanced 
gross margin, though there were a number of opposing influences, 
including the intra-category mix within Car Enhancement and the 
increased focus on the exit of old inventories. The success of lower-
margin premium-cycle sales also had a dilutive impact on margin.
The Retail gross margin is anticipated to decline by 125–175bps in 
FY14 reflecting the normalisation of mix, more aggressive ongoing 
clearance, plus increased activity to emphasise our value credentials. 
This includes increased use of “WIGIGs” (“when it’s gone it’s gone”) 
and establishing more ‘KVI’ (key value indicators) products. The 
decline also includes the impact of the full-scale launch online of 
third-party-branded, lower-margin Cycling parts, accessories and 
clothing (“PACs”) and the continued influence of premium-bike sales. 
The adverse pressures will be partly offset by the continued focus on 
higher-margin Car Maintenance fitting and Cycle Repair.
It is anticipated that Halfords Retail will continue to generate a gross 
margin of over 50% throughout the medium-term.
Operating costs before non-recurring items were £323.4m 
(FY12: £307.0m), up 5.3% on the prior year. The breakdown is set 
out below.
FY13

Support Costs 69.7 61.3 +13.7%
Total Operating Costs 
before non-recurring items 323.4 307.0 +5.3%
Note: To align this year’s cost breakdown, the above figures reflect a prior year reallocation 
of carriage costs from Store Occupancy to Warehouse & Distribution upon the launch of 
the 24-hour Reserve & Collect fulfilment proposition, and a realignment of Warehouse & 
Distribution management costs from Support Costs to Warehouse & Distribution.
In line with the objective to capture the Car Maintenance parts and 
fitting market opportunity, payroll hours were invested in 3Bs fitting 
activity during the year with over 450 additional fitters recruited in time 
for winter peak trading. This, together with investment in training time 
in both technical and employee engagement skills, and the underlying 
uplift in national minimum-wage rates, led to a +6.2% increase in Store 
Staffing costs.
Store Occupancy costs increased by +1.5% year on year. Business 
rate increases of +2.2% and continued pressure from upward-only rent 
reviews were partially mitigated by continued rent negotiations and a 
reduction in other property-related costs.
Warehouse & Distribution costs increased by +3.6% driven by the 
anticipated increase in carriage costs associated with the enhanced 
24-hour multichannel fulfilment offering launched in March 2012.
Support Costs increased by +13.7% as a result of the investment 
in improved recruitment and training in stores and enhanced 
Support Centre capability (Procurement, IT, Human Resources and 
Multichannel), with particular expertise associated with the launch of 
 Group revenue in FY13, at 
£871.3m, was up 1.0% and 
comprised Retail revenue 
of £745.5m and Autocentres 
revenue of £125.8m. Supporting City Centre cycle racing through the Halfords Cycling Tour Series 2012 48

the extended range of PACs. The one-off costs associated with the 
change of Chief Executive, Commercial Director and Retail Director 
were also included within Support Costs.
To support Halfords’ plans the Board anticipates a year-on-year 
increase in FY14 Retail operating expenses of around +6%, a 
significant proportion of which is dependent on volumes/performance. 
Some of the costs associated with these plans are expected to 
increase further in FY15 with, for example, the annualisation of pay 
awards linked to the newly-launched 3-Gears training programme.
It is anticipated that Halfords Retail will generate low double-digit 
EBITDA margins throughout the medium term (FY13: EBITDA Retail 
margin 12.7%).

Autocentres generated total revenues of £125.8m (FY12: £110.8m), 
an increase of +13.5% on the prior year. Non like-for-like centres 
generated £8.3m of incremental revenue in the year. Twenty-three 
new Autocentres opened in the year and took the total number of 
Autocentre locations to 283 as at 29 March 2013. The increase in 
revenues from the like-for-like centres reflected the impact of enhanced 
media support and investment, growth in tyre sales, as well as the 
success of online bookings which represented 12% of total FY13 
Autocentres revenues.
Gross profit at £80.1m (FY12: £73.0m) represented a gross margin 
of 63.7% against a prior year margin of 65.9%, driven primarily by 
increased volumes of lower-margin tyre sales, which represented 
15.8% of total sales (FY12: 11.2%). Underlying Service, MOT and 
Repair margins were underpinned by improvements in parts buying.
It is anticipated that Halfords Autocentres will deliver a broadly-flat 
gross-margin performance throughout the medium-term.
Autocentres’ underlying operating profit was down 10.0% at £6.3m 
(FY12 £7.0m) reflecting the continuing investment in the business  
in capability and training, the cost associated with the opening of  
23 new centres together with the related expansion of the support-
centre structure. Halfords is committed to the continued investment in 
the Autocentres business to secure long-term growth and has targeted 
the opening of a further 20–30 new centres in FY14. Autocentres’ 
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and non-
recurring items in FY14 is expected to be marginally ahead of that 
in FY13.
It is anticipated that Halfords Autocentres will generate a mid-to-
high single-digit EBITDA margin throughout the medium term (FY13: 
EBITDA Retail margin 7.0%).
Portfolio Management
The store and centre portfolio at the end of the year comprised 466 
stores (end of FY12: 467) and 283 Autocentres (end of FY12: 260).

Strategy
With the exception of nine long leasehold and two freehold properties 
within Autocentres, the Group’s operating sites are occupied under 
operating leases, the majority of which are on standard lease terms, 
typically with a five to 15-year term at inception and with an average 
lease length of 7.5 years.
In the year, one store was closed (Preston, Ribbleton Lane) in line with 
its lease expiry; no Autocentres were closed.
Net Non-Recurring Expenses
The following table outlines the components of the net non-recurring 
expenses incurred in the year.

Onerous lease charges (1.2) —
Asset impairment charges (0.8) —
Release of Focus DIY lease guarantee 
provision 1.0 1.9
Net non-recurring (expenses)/income (1.0) 1.9
Onerous lease charges of £1.2m in respect of two properties were 
recognised during the year, reflecting the challenging property market 
for vacant properties, and the high cost to exit lease agreements.
£0.8m of assets from certain stores were impaired as a result of the 
investment in laboratory-store development.
At the end of FY11, an exceptional charge of £7.5m was recognised 
in respect of a provision for property leases to which Halfords was a 
guarantor, triggered by the demise of the Focus DIY retail chain. At  
30 March 2012 the provision was £3.1m, reflecting the settlement 
of a number of leases and utilisation for ongoing rent, insurance and 
service charges, and had reduced further at 29 March 2013 to £1.0m 
as a result of a £1.0m release relating to a lease settlement and £1.1m 
utilisation.
Finance Expense
The net finance expense was £6.1m (FY12: £5.0m). The expense 
included a £0.8m accelerated amortisation of facility fees in the current 
year. This follows the Board’s decision to refinance the bank facility, 
which expires in November 2014. The underlying net finance expense 
was broadly flat year-on-year and the net financing cost in FY14 is 
anticipated to be marginally lower compared to FY13.
Taxation
The taxation charge on profit for the financial year was £18.3m (FY12: 
£25.7m), including a £0.1m charge (FY12: £0.9m) in respect of tax on 
non-recurring items. The full-year effective tax rate of 25.7% (FY12: 
27.3%) is higher than the UK corporation tax rate (24.0%) principally 
due to the non-deductibility of depreciation charged on capital 
expenditure and other permanent differences arising in the year. 
The FY14 effective tax rate is anticipated to be 23–24%.
Earnings Per Share (“EPS”)
Basic EPS before non-recurring items was 27.7 pence (FY12: 33.7 pence), 
a 17.8% decrease on the comparable year. Basic EPS after non-recurring 
items was 27.2 pence (FY12: 34.2 pence). Basic weighted-average shares 
in issue during the year were 194.3m (FY12: 199.9m).
Dividend
The Board has recommended a final dividend of 9.1 pence per share, 
a reduction of 35.0% on the prior year (FY12: 14.0 pence). If approved, 
this will be paid on 2 August 2013 to shareholders on the register at 
the close of business on 5 July 2013. The proposed full-year dividend 
is 17.1 pence (FY12: 22.0 pence). 
The 35.0% reduction of the final dividend would have the effect of 
similarly rebasing future dividend pay-outs. It is anticipated that the 
FY14 full-year dividend would be reset to around 14 pence per share 
and that the full-year dividend would potentially remain around this level 
as the business approaches nearer 2x dividend/earnings cover over 
the medium term. This would reflect a more-sustainable level for the 
business, the requirement to invest and the maintenance of a robust 
balance sheet
Capital Expenditure
Capital investment in the year totalled £18.8m (FY12: £19.7m) 
comprising £13.2m in Retail and £5.6m in Autocentres. Consistent with 
prior years, management has continued to adopt a prudent approach 
with regard to capital investment and has focused on investments 
generating material returns.
Within Retail, £5.8m was invested in stores, including the laboratory 
store concepts, relocations and right-size activity, and general capital 
spend relating to store roofing/flooring and security. Additional 
investments in Retail infrastructure included a £5.0m investment in IT 
systems, with further development in the online proposition, £1.4m in 
logistics and £1.0m in central facilities.

Halfords Group plc 
Annual Report & Accounts 2013

www.halfords.annualreport2013.com
A further £5.6m (FY12: £4.5m) was invested in Autocentres to drive 
the centre roll-out plan and upgrade centre equipment, especially in 
relation to the delivery of the tyre-fitting proposition.
The Retail capital expenditure requirement in FY14 is anticipated to 
be around £32m, whilst the respective investment in Autocentres is 
anticipated to be around £6m. 
To support the delivery of Getting Into Gear 2016, Retail capital 
expenditure is expected to total around £100m between FY14 and FY16.
Inventories
Group inventory held at the year-end was £133.2m (FY12: £146.7m), 
down -9.2% on the prior year. Autocentres inventory was £1.3m, flat 
on the prior year.
The management of inventory remains a key area of focus for the Retail 
business; however, management recognises the need to ensure that 
availability meets customer expectations and supports the business’s 
profitable-sales growth aspirations. During FY14 we anticipate investing 
£15–20m in extended levels of Retail inventory.
The Autocentres business model is such that only small levels of 
inventory are held within the centres, with most parts being acquired on 
an as-needed basis.
Cash Flow and Borrowings
The Group has continued its strong track record of operating cash 
generation.
Net cash generated from operating activities in the year was £93.5m 
(FY12: £89.7m). After taxation, capital expenditure and net finance 
costs, free cash flow of £71.8m (FY12: £70.4m) was generated.
Reported net debt was lower than anticipated due to the expectation 
of settlement of a number of prior-year outstanding tax computations 
in FY13. These account for c.£20m and are fully provided for within the 
balance sheet; it is anticipated that this provision will crystallise in FY14.
Group net debt of £110.6m (FY12: £139.2m) represented a year-on-
year decrease of £28.6m. At this level, the ratio of Net Debt to 12-month 
EBITDA was 1.1:1 (FY12: 1.1:1). It is anticipated that this ratio will reach 
no more than c.1.5:1 throughout the medium-term.
The current bank loan facility expires in November 2014. The Board 
has approved refinancing of the Group’s debt funding in the current 
financial year.
Treasury Policy
The Group’s treasury department’s main responsibilities are to:
 ■ Ensure adequate funding and liquidity for the Group;
 ■ Manage the interest risk of the Group’s debt;
 ■ Invest surplus cash;
 ■ Manage the clearing bank operations of the Group; and
 ■ Manage the foreign exchange risk on its non-sterling cash flows.
Treasury activities are delegated by the Board to the Finance Director 
(“FD”). The FD controls policy and performance through the line 
management structure to the Group Treasurer and by reference to 
the Treasury Committee. The Treasury Committee meets quarterly to 
monitor the performance of the Treasury function.
Policies for managing financial risks are governed by Board approved 
policies and procedures, which are reviewed on an annual basis.
The Group’s debt management policy is to provide an appropriate 
level of funding to finance the Business Plan over the medium term at 
a competitive cost and ensure flexibility to meet the changing needs 
of the Group. Details of the Group’s current borrowing facilities are 
contained in note 15.
The key risks that the Group faces from a treasury perspective are as 
follows:
Market Risk
The Group’s exposure to market risk predominantly relates to interest, 
currency and commodity risk. These are discussed further below. 
Commodity risk is due to the Group’s products being manufactured 
from metals and other raw materials, subject to price fluctuation. The 
Group mitigates this risk through negotiating fixed purchase costs 
or maintaining flexibility over the specification of finished products 
produced by its supply chain to meet fluctuations.
Interest Rate Risk
The Group’s policy aims to manage the interest cost of the Group within 
the constraints of the Business Plan and its financial covenants. The 
Group’s borrowings are currently subject to floating rate interest rates 
and the Group will continue to monitor movements in the swap market.

Halfords Group plc 
Annual Report & Accounts 2013

Strategy
If interest rates on floating rate borrowings (i.e. cash and cash equivalents 
and bank borrowings which attract interest at floating rates) were to 
change by + or – 1% the impact on the results in the Income Statement 
and equity would be a decrease/increase of £1.0m (FY12: £1.2m).
Interest rate movements on deposits, obligations under finance leases, 
trade payables, trade receivables, and other financial instruments do 
not present a material exposure to the Group’s balance sheet.
Capital Risk Management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the 
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide 
returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to 
maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may 
adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to 
shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. Between 
April 2011 and April 2012, the Group managed its capital structure 
partly through a share buy-back scheme.
The Group manages capital by operating within debt ratios. These ratios 
are lease adjusted net debt to Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation 
and Amortisation (“EBITDA”) and fixed charge cover. Lease-adjusted net 
debt is calculated as being net debt and leases capitalised at eight times, 
as a multiple of EBITDA plus operating lease charges. Fixed charge 
cover is calculated as being EBITDA plus operating lease charges as a 
multiple of interest and operating lease charges.
Credit Risk
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit 
exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date 
was £32.1m (FY12: £28.6m).
Foreign Currency Risk
The Group has a significant transaction exposure with increasing, direct 
sourced purchases from its suppliers in the Far East, with most of the 
trade being in US Dollars. The Group’s policy is to manage the foreign 
exchange transaction exposures of the business to ensure the actual 
costs do not exceed the budget costs by more than 10% (excluding 
increases in the base cost of the product).
The Group does not hedge either economic exposure or the translation 
exposure arising from the profits, assets and liabilities of non-sterling 
businesses whilst they remain immaterial.
During the 52 weeks to 29 March 2013, the foreign exchange 
management policy was to hedge via forward contract purchase 
between 75 and 80% of the material foreign exchange transaction 
exposures on a rolling 12-month basis. Hedging is performed through 
the use of foreign currency bank accounts and forward foreign 
exchange contracts.
Pension Liability Risk
The Group has no association with any defined-benefit pension 
scheme and therefore carries no deferred, current or future liabilities 
in respect of such a scheme. The Group operates a number of Group 
Personal Pension Plans for colleagues.
Liquidity Risk
The Group ensures that it has sufficient cash or loan facilities to meet all 
its commitments when they fall due by ensuring that there is sufficient 
cash or working capital facilities to meet the cash requirements of the 
Group for the current Business Plan. The minimum liquidity level is 
currently set at £30m, such that under Treasury Policy the maximum 
drawings would be £270m of the £300m available facility.
The process to manage the risk is to ensure there are contracts in 
place for key suppliers, detailing the payment terms, and for providers 
of debt, the Group ensured that such counterparties used for credit 
transactions held at least an ‘A’ credit rating at the time of refinancing 
(November 2010). Ancillary business, in the main, is directed to the five 
banks within the club banking group. At the year-end four of the banks 
within this group maintained a credit rating of A– or above, in line with 
Treasury Policy. The counterparty credit risk is reviewed in the Treasury 
report, which is forwarded to the Treasury Committee and the Treasurer 
reviews credit exposure on a daily basis.
The risk is measured through review of forecast liquidity each month by 
the Treasurer to determine whether there are sufficient credit facilities 
to meet forecast requirements, and through monitoring covenants on a 
regular basis to ensure there are no significant breaches, which would 
lead to an “Event of Default”. Calculations are submitted bi-annually 
to the club bank agent. There have been no breaches of covenants 
during the reported periods.

Like all businesses, our Group faces risks and uncertainties that could impact the achievement of the Group’s strategy.
These risks are accepted as being a part of doing business and the Board recognises that the nature and scope of these risks can change and so 
regularly reviews the risks faced by the Group as well as the systems and processes to mitigate them.
The Corporate Governance report on pages 72 to 81 describes the systems and internal control processes through which the Directors identify, 
assess, manage and mitigate risks.
Key Risks and Uncertainties
Senior Management colleagues assess risks on a department-by-department basis using a variety of techniques to identify risk. The likelihood and 
impact of these risks are considered and scored against a recognised framework dependent upon their effect on the achievement of our corporate 
strategies.
Mitigation
Responsibility for taking the necessary actions to manage risk is delegated to appropriate colleagues in the business, with Executive manager 
sponsor involvement. The Risk Register is monitored and updated with current and ongoing mitigation on a regular basis.
Report and Review
The Executive Committee and the Board consider the risks reported within the Risk Register and review and monitor new risks and all mitigating 
actions to ensure that the status of risk mirrors the levels of risk that the Board is willing to take in achieving the Group’s strategic objectives.

Economic
The economy is a major influence on consumer 
spending. Trends in employment, inflation, 
taxation, consumer debt levels, weather and 
interest rates impact consumer expenditure in 
discretionary areas. Changes in Government 
policies (e.g: Cycle2Work, DAB switchover) may 
also affect our consumers’ ability to benefit from 
our products and services.
The Group mitigates these risks by focusing on 
maintaining the “defensive” characteristics of its 
“needs driven” product groups and by ensuring 
that its stores and centres are the key destination 
for its core products and services. We also ensure 
that we have representation with Governmental 
decision-makers in the areas supporting our core 
categories.
Business Strategy
The aim of the Group’s business strategy is to 
deliver long-term value to our shareholders. 
The Board understands that if the strategy 
and vision are inappropriately formulated and 
communicated and if the necessary resources 
are not put in place then the business will suffer.
The budgetary and planning process aims to 
deliver the Group’s growth targets and business 
plans are developed to ensure these targets are 
achieved and that they are resourced appropriately. 
Regular access to industry experts and monitoring 
of performance against plan is carried out by both 
the Executive managers of the Company and the 
Board to ensure targets are being achieved and 
that they remain relevant to and focused on the 
Group Strategy.
Competition
The retail industry is highly competitive and 
dynamic. The Group competes with a wide 
variety of retailers of varying sizes and faces 
competition from UK retailers, in both stores and 
online, as well as international operators. The 
Car Servicing market is a service-based market 
with a number of different-sized providers where 
“Trust” is extremely important to customers. 
Failure to compete with competitors on areas 
including price, product range, quality, service 
and “trustworthiness” could have an adverse 
effect on the Group’s financial results.
The Board is aware of the risks faced from UK 
retailers, both in-store and online, and from 
the national car-servicing network and seeks 
to continually strengthen its “own-brand” and 
“sub-brand” retail offer and develop opportunities 
to differentiate the Halfords offer and deliver an 
honest and trustworthy service. Our Click with the 
Digital Future initiative will provide an improved 
multichannel experience.
Compliance
The Group operates in an environment governed 
by legislation, standards and codes in areas 
including, but not limited to, trading, advertising, 
product quality, health and safety, hazardous 
substances and data protection.
The Group has a Quality Assurance and 
Commercial Regulatory team that manage 
legal and regulatory control processes both 
in-house and externally to advise and take action 
on existing and emerging risk management issues. 
Our various Codes of Practice regulate our behaviour 
in our dealings with all stakeholders including 
customers, suppliers and colleagues and our 
attitudes toward such areas as the environment and 
ethical trading.
Changing Customer Preferences
Some of the products that Halfords sells, 
particularly in the Car Enhancement category, 
are subject to rapidly changing consumer 
preferences. Products such as children’s cycles 
face competition from alternative products 
(such as games consoles) and some of 
the products that the Group sells are non-
discretionary in their nature and predicting 
future trends is difficult.
Halfords has recruited experienced, 
knowledgeable colleagues who can identify 
and interpret trends and consequently respond 
in a timely manner to changes in consumer 
preferences. Colleagues also monitor 
developments in alternative products and our 
forecasts reflect the latest assumption in these 
areas. We are continually looking at ways of 
moving into new merchandising opportunities 
to mitigate technology changes and to improve 
forecasting and planning to ensure we meet our 
customers’ changing needs. Our H Factor initiative 
will improve product development and design. 54

Reputation
The Halfords name is a key asset of the business 
and as the largest operator in its markets, 
expectations of the Group are high. Failure to 
protect the Group’s reputation and brand could 
lead to a loss of trust and confidence. This could 
result in a decline in the customer base and 
affect the ability to recruit and retain good people.
Ultimately the protection of Halfords’ brand and 
position in its core markets will be sustained 
by unique and extensive product offerings 
and a multichannel approach to sales in our 
stores and a high-service-based customer 
proposition in our stores and autocentres. 
This is complemented by training from Cytech 
(Cycles), RoSPA, and the Institute of Motor 
Industries, ensuring that colleagues at both 
stores and centres are capable of supporting 
the Halfords brand. Training will be further 
enhanced by our Service Revolution initiative.
Reliance on Foreign Manufacturers
Halfords sources a significant proportion of the 
merchandise it sells in its stores from outside of 
the UK, either directly or via third-party suppliers. 
Consequently, the Group is subject to the risks 
associated with international trade (particularly 
those which are common in the import of goods 
from developing countries) including, but not 
limited to, inflation, currency fluctuation, the 
imposition of taxes or other charges on imports, 
the exposure to different legal standards, the 
burden of complying with a variety of foreign laws 
and changing foreign government policies and 
natural disasters.
Extensive research is conducted into quality 
and ethics before the Group procures products 
from any new country or supplier. The Group’s 
strong management team in the Far East has 
been recruited locally and understands the local 
culture, market regulations and risks and we 
maintain very close relationships with both our 
suppliers and shippers to ensure that disruption 
to production and supply are managed 
appropriately.
Product and Service Quality
The Board recognises that the quality and 
safety of both our products and services in our 
stores and autocentres is of critical importance 
to us and that any major failure will affect 
consumer confidence. We recognise that if our 
products are seen to be or perceived to be 
of poor standard or of poor value for money 
then customers will look to obtain these from 
our competitors. There is also the risk that our 
service proposition fails due to inconsistent 
levels of service at individual stores and 
individual centres, or through unavailability of 
stock as a result of disruption to the supply 
chain (e.g: unavailability of a distribution centre).
The Group constantly seeks to enhance its 
position as the store or centre of first choice 
in each of the markets that it serves. Halfords 
continues to invest in both its existing estate 
to ensure that it remains contemporary and in 
constant product innovation to meet customer 
needs. In addition, the Group’s market leading 
in-store wefit proposition provides a range of 
services at a lower cost to our customers than 
that provided by competitors. Our Autocentre 
business continually seeks to provide 
innovative solutions for their customers, such 
as brakes4life. We also have an established 
training infrastructure to ensure that our 
colleagues receive ongoing product and service 
training this will be enhanced by our Service 
Revolution initiative. In our centres the training 
of our technicians to provide high quality 
motor vehicle repairs is enhanced through an 
apprenticeship programme and accredited 
Automotive Technician training. Sixty per cent 
of our centres workshop colleagues hold a 
Motor Industry qualification. Repairs are subject 
to extensive quality assurance processes. The 
business has developed and tested continuity 
plans. Stocking a vast range of bulbs covering most of the UK car market

Information Technology (“IT”) Systems  
and Infrastructure
In common with most businesses, Halfords is 
dependent on the reliability and suitability of 
a number of important IT systems where any 
sustained performance problems, particularly 
with regard to stores, centres or warehouse, 
multichannel and distribution systems, could 
potentially compromise our operational capability 
for a period of time. With ambitious growth plans 
for our multichannel offer, our trading capacity 
could be affected by internal and external 
systems’ resilience and interdependencies.
Extensive controls are in place to maintain 
the integrity of our systems and to ensure 
that systems changes are implemented in 
a controlled manner. Halfords’ key trading 
systems are hosted within a secure data centre 
operated by a specialist company remote from 
our Support Centre. These systems are also 
supported by a number of disaster recovery 
arrangements including a comprehensive 
backup strategy, and a hotlink secure data 
centre hosted outside the UK, with additional 
access to a further data support centre 
elsewhere in the UK in case of a major incident. 
We have recently recruited an IT Director to 
oversee enhancements to our IT infrastructure.
Dependence on Key Management 
Personnel
The success of the Group’s business depends 
upon its senior management closely supervising 
all aspects of its business, in particular, the 
operation of the stores and autocentres, 
including the appropriate training of in-store and 
centre colleagues, and the design, procurement 
and allocation of merchandise.
Our Remuneration Policy outlined on page 
83 details the strategies in place to ensure 
that high calibre Executives are attracted 
and retained. The Group looks to improve its 
senior manager cadre through operating a 
talent management process to help individuals 
achieve their full potential within Halfords and to 
ensure that appropriate succession plans are in 
place to meet the future needs of the business. 
At a junior level the Group continues to invest 
in graduate programmes and store/centre 
colleague training and development. 56

Corporate Responsibility Report
Aim to Win and Earn Trust – Corporate Responsibility
Halfords aims to contribute positively to the communities and 
environment in which we operate. We recognise that acting responsibly 
in all our operations, and towards our colleagues, customers and 
stakeholders, also benefits our business and our brand. Throughout 
the year our Commercial Director was responsible for ensuring that 
our corporate responsibility policy was aligned with the strategic aims 
of our business. Executive management monitors achievement of 
related KPIs. 
Recognising that ultimately Halfords is a business and so our 
focus is on operating our business to provide our customers with 
high quality products and services, and to generate value for our 
shareholders, we continually strive to improve upon the management 
of our environmental, social and corporate governance impact. It is 
essential that we live our values by continually monitoring our exposure 
and responding to safeguard not only our business, but also the 
environment and the societies in which we operate.
In support of this, we have been looking to expand our corporate 
responsibility initiatives in recent years. During the period, we 
commenced a work inclusion programme with Bikeworks, which is 
discussed further at page 61, and appointed a dedicated Community 
& CSR Manager to develop the opportunities that Halfords has to 
make a positive contribution to our local communities, as described at 
page 60. Further information will be made available on our Corporate 
Website as the developments progress and will be described fully in 
next period’s annual report and accounts.
Work as a Team — Workplace
Colleagues
As the many faces of our business, our colleagues are fundamental 
to the achievement of our customer experience ambitions. We strive 
to be an employer of choice, where commitment to good service 
standards and our values is both celebrated and rewarded. Our 
colleagues are expected to be customer-focused, helpful individuals 
who work as a team to earn trust of our customers in our product and 
service knowledge so inspiring our customers to invest in products 
and services from our stores and autocentres – in so doing our 
colleagues aim to win. In return for this, we offer our colleagues equal 
opportunities to work in a fulfilling and stimulating environment and 
further develop their careers within the Group on the basis of merit.
To provide our colleagues with the knowledge to empower them to 
confidently deliver great service, c.80% of our Retail fitting colleagues 
(excludes store managers and duty managers) are accredited 
(2013: 6,092; 2012: 5,780), whilst around 60% (2012: c.60%) of our 
Autocentres colleagues hold an industry-recognised qualification. 
There are currently 160 apprentices (2012: c.140) participating in 
the Autocentres training academy apprenticeship programme, a 
three-year fully funded technician programme leading to the Institute 
of Motor Industry NVQ 3 and Diploma, as well as an Automotive 
Technician Accreditation assessment. Our IMI accredited Academy of 
Learning delivers a range of technical and management qualification 
opportunities to Autocentres colleagues.
Our new 3-Gears programme also introduces a training and colleague 
qualification programme that puts expertise at our core and has the 
potential to revolutionise our approach to building colleague expertise 
and our customers’ experience.

Diversity amongst our Colleagues
We are committed to operating as an equal opportunities organisation 
whilst recognising that the nature of our business is more likely to 
attract certain profiles of colleagues than others. Our commitment to

Accessibility
As a household brand, our stores and autocentres should be 
accessible to customers and colleagues alike. We work hard to deliver 
our products and services in surroundings that are as comfortable and 
convenient to work and shop in as possible.
Health and Safety Management
Halfords is committed to high standards of occupational health and 
safety to minimise the risk of injuries and ill health to employees, 
contractors, customers, visitors and others who come into contact 
with the business. Our overall annual incident rate remains below the 
benchmarks of the industries we operate in.
Think Customer — Marketplace
We are committed to helping and inspiring our customers with their life

servicing and initiatives, such as brakes4life, a lifetime replacement 
of brake pads and brake shoes, at our autocentres.
 ■ Supporting the Automotive Technician Accreditation (ATA) scheme 
to ensure our technicians’ knowledge remains current, enabling 
them to deliver efficient servicing to our customers
We recognise that whilst our customers seek quality, reliable products 
and/or services at reasonable prices, they also expect us to carry 
out business responsibly. We work hard to ensure that our products 
meet our high standards, which are consistent with or stronger than 
relevant legislation, international conventions and codes of practice. 
For example, our autocentres fit parts which meet OE standards not 
only maintaining the warranties on our customers’ vehicles but meeting 
legislative requirements. In addition, we have our own quality control 
systems in place as well as a mystery shopper programme to ensure 
that our expected standards are upheld. The external organisations 
VOSA and Trading Standards also monitor our activities. We also take 
advantage of opportunities to work closely with trade associations, 
research institutes, standards authorities, universities and government 
organisations to improve performance standards and safety, and 
develop and influence best practice. For example, our Autocentres 
CEO is heavily involved in the VOSA modernisation programme. 58

The potential impact that our business could have on our stakeholders 
and the wider world is considered throughout the product or services’ 
lifecycle when we make decisions on choice of offer, packaging and 
procedures. One such example is that the majority of our products 
are imported so we are careful to monitor our carbon emissions and 
restrict our use of airfreight. Typically we ship products, which once 
landed in the UK, travel via rail to our Distribution Centres in the 
Midlands.

Be Helpful — The Environment
We recognise that our business can have a direct, as well as an 
indirect, effect on the environment. We are committed to understanding 
any impact that our products, stores, autocentres, Support Centre and 
delivery fleet have on the environment so that we can work to improve 
the management of them. We acknowledge that in some cases such 
environmental impact management can result in improved performance 
within our supply chain. We have identified the following areas as 
overall objectives in managing our environmental responsibilities:

Inspire Others — Community
Charity of the Year
Across our stores and autocentres, we partnered with Cancer 
Research UK for a two-year period, ending on 29 March 2013. 
Activities in the past year included the CycleSlam, colleague donation 
stations in all stores and autocentres, auctions and participation in their 
Dryathlon campaign.
Apprenticeships
We operate the largest independent Apprentice Scheme in the motor 
industry via our autocentres. In twenty years of operation, we offered 
employment to the majority of apprentices who completed the three-
year scheme.
A dedicated Community & CSR Manager was appointed in January 
2013 to look at how the Group engages with its local community and 
in so doing inspires others. In recent months, the following initiatives 
have been launched:
Re~Cycle
At the beginning of April 2013, Halfords began a long-term partnership 
with Re~Cycle, a UK charity that sends unwanted bikes to Africa. In 
some areas of Africa, a bike can be the only means of transport and 
owning a bike enables people to travel to work, school and carry 
goods and passengers, whilst small scale farmers and traders can 
reach customers further afield. The bikes can similarly be an invaluable 
resource for travelling health workers and provide access to training 
and employment, helping to improve lives in a sustainable way.
However, bikes can be too expensive for the majority and additionally 
the skills to maintain them might not exist, whereas millions of unused 
bikes go to waste in sheds and garages in the UK. Through our 
partnership, we plan to work with Re~Cycle to build on the fantastic 
work it has already achieved since 1997 to increase the number of 
bikes sent to Africa and also raise funds to help the charity grow.
BEN
In our Autocentres we agreed a long-term partnership with BEN, 
the dedicated charity for those who work, or have worked, in the 
automotive and related industries, as well as their dependants. 
Kids Bikes Workshops
At the beginning of Easter, we began to offer a free Kids Holiday Bike 
Club for children to help create closer links with each store’s local 
community. Run during the school holidays, the workshops show 
children – and their parents – the key things to check on a bike, 
providing a perfect starting point for children to go back home and, 
together with their parents, make sure their bikes are safe. Over Easter, 
nearly 2,500 children, plus their parents, attended a workshop.

Bikeworks 
Bikeworks & Halfords changing lives through cycling
Bikeworks began working in partnership with Halfords in the summer 
of 2012 with Halfords supporting Bikeworks’ “Cycle into Work” 
programme which gives individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds 
the opportunity to change their lives around and gain employment in 
the cycling industry.
Bikeworks conducts outreach work in the community where individuals 
undertake short “Build a Bike” courses learning the basics of bike 
maintenance. Participants then have the opportunity to apply to 
join the full “Cycle into Work” programme where trainees are put 
through a programme of accredited training in cycle mechanics and 
customer service alongside “soft” skills training in communication and 
interpersonal skills.
Towards the end of Cycle into Work trainees undertake work 
placements within Halfords stores which if successful can develop into 
permanent roles.
So far Halfords has helped Bikeworks to achieve these outcomes:
 ■ 48 people have completed Build a Bike courses
 ■ 20 individuals have gone through the Cycle into Work programme
 ■ 9 graduates have so far secured employment at Halfords stores
 ■ 18 trainees successfully completed work placements at Halfords 
stores.
On 6 March 2013, our new CEO Matt Davies attended a graduation 
ceremony at Bikeworks where successful graduates were presented 
with a tool kit worth £150 supplied by Halfords. The event was a great 
success. Taking away a quality tool kit meant a lot to individuals as 
recognition of their success and hard work.
Case study — Leo
 Leo is a young man from Hackney, East London. Before 
coming to Bikeworks Leo had not been involved in any training or 
employment for some time.
Leo progressed really well through Cycle into Work showing 
strong ability in cycle mechanics ultimately gaining level 2 City & 
Guilds accreditation with flying colours. During his time on Cycle 
into Work Leo also successfully completed a work placement at 
Halfords Stoke Newington and is now employed on a full-time 
basis at Halfords in Tottenham.
The work we have been doing with Halfords has been a fantastic 
partnership. Not only are we helping our trainees secure a better 
future but at the same time supporting Halfords’ desire to become 
famous for cycling by providing skilled mechanics to the business 
so it’s a win win situation.
We believe that by working together we can achieve much more 
over the next few years and are excited about the future of the 
partnership. 
Dave Miller — Managing Director (Bikeworks)

Profits and Dividends
The Group’s results for the year are set out in the Consolidated Income 
Statement on page 104. The profit before tax on ordinary activities was 
£71.0m (2012: £94.1m) and the profit after tax amounted to £52.7m 
(2012: £68.4m). The Board proposes that a final dividend of 9.1 pence 
per ordinary share be paid on 2 August 2013 to shareholders whose 
names are on the register of members at the close of business on 
5 July 2013. This payment, together with the interim dividend of 
8 pence per ordinary share paid on 24 January 2013, makes a total 
for the year of 17.1 pence per ordinary share. The total final dividend 
payable to shareholders for the year is estimated to be £17.7m. 
Computershare Nominees (Channel Islands) Limited, trustee of the 
Halfords Employee Share Trust, has waived its entitlement to dividends.
Performance Monitoring
The delivery of the Group’s strategic objectives is monitored by the 
Board through KPIs and the periodic review of various aspects of the 
Group’s operations. The Board considers the KPIs listed on pages 8 
to 13 are appropriate measures for the delivery of the strategy of the 
Group via its Retail and Autocentres divisions.

period ended 29 March 2013 and unless otherwise stated at the date 
of this Annual Report:

the AGM.
(1) 
As Paul McClenaghan resigned his directorship on 12 April 2013, he will not be offering 
himself for re-election.
Directors’ Interests
The Directors’ interests in shares and options over shares in the 
Company are shown in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 82 
to 101. In line with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, each 
Director has notified the Company of any situation in which he or she 
has, or could have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly 
may conflict, with the interests of the Company (a situational conflict). 
These were considered and approved by the Board in accordance with 
the Company’s Articles of Association and each Director informed of the 
authorisation and any terms on which it was given.
Directors’ Indemnities
The Company maintains liability insurance for its Directors and officers. 
The Directors of the Company, and the Company’s subsidiaries, have the 
benefit of a third-party indemnity provision, as defined by section 236 of 
the Companies Act 2006, in the Company’s Articles of Association.
Auditor
At the 2012 AGM, KPMG Audit Plc was appointed as the Company’s 
Auditor. KPMG Audit Plc has indicated its intention to notify the 
Company of its orderly wind down of business so that this statutory 
entity would cease to act as Auditor of the Company. A resolution 
proposing the appointment of KPMG LLP , an intermediate parent of 
KPMG Audit Plc, is expected to be contained in the Notice of the AGM 
and will be put to the shareholders at the meeting.
Disclosure of Information to the Auditor
So far as the Directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information 
of which the Auditor is unaware and the Directors have taken all 
reasonable steps to ascertain any relevant audit information and ensure 
the Auditor is aware of such information. The Directors are responsible 
for maintaining the integrity of financial information including this Annual 
Report, together with other financial statements, presentations and 
announcements on the Company’s corporate website. Legislation 
in the UK concerning the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.  
 The Group’s strategic 
objectives are monitored by the 
Board through KPIs and the 
periodic review of various aspects 
of the Group’s operations.

Going Concern
With effect from 5 November 2010 the Group secured a four-year 
£300m revolving credit facility (extendable by a further year) and at 
29 March 2013 the Group had undrawn borrowing facilities of £197m 
(30 March 2012: £160m). The Group’s previous and current committed 
borrowing facilities contain certain financial covenants, which 
have been met throughout the period. The Group’s forecasts and 
projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading 
performance, show that the Group should be able to operate within 
the level of its borrowing facilities and covenants for the foreseeable 
future. As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well 
placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the uncertain 
economic outlook. The Directors have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future, hence they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing the Financial Statements.
Colleagues
The Group has established a framework of colleague communications, 
including a monthly colleague magazine, to provide colleagues with 
information on matters of concern to them and business performance, 
as well as to encourage the engagement of every colleague in the 
Board’s commitment to high standards of customer care and service 
provision. This is reinforced via training initiatives across the business, 
details of which can be found on pages 29, 37 and 56, and the 
facilitation of colleague share ownership via a Sharesave Scheme.
The Group is dedicated to the principle of equal opportunity in 
employment. No potential or current colleague receives less favourable 
treatment on grounds such as gender, marital status, race, ethnic 
origin, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or age, or is disadvantaged 
by conditions or requirements which cannot be shown to be justified. 
Fair and equitable employment policies are applied which seek to 
promote entry into, and progression within, the Group. The basis for 
all appointments is personal ability and competency relevant to the 
specific job criteria.
Full and fair consideration is given to employment applications by 
disabled persons wherever suitable opportunities exist, having 
regard to their particular aptitudes and abilities. Training and career 
development support is provided where appropriate. Should a 
colleague become disabled, efforts are made to ensure their continued 
employment with the Group and retraining provided if necessary.
A whistleblowing policy and procedure enables colleagues to report 
concerns on matters affecting the Group or their employment, without 
fear of recrimination. In addition, the Group takes a zero-tolerance 
approach to matters of discrimination, harassment and bullying in all 
aspects of its business operations, including in relation to gender, race, 
national origin, disability, age, religion or sexual orientation. Appropriate 
policies and procedures are in place for reporting and dealing with such 
matters.
Donations
During the year the Group contributed £50,000 (2012: £50,000) to 
charities in the UK, including donations to BEN, a charity supporting 
individuals and families linked to the motor industry and associated 
trades, and Cancer Research UK, its Charity Partner until the end of 
the financial year.
The Group’s policy is not to make any donations for political purposes. 
However, the Companies Act 2006 defines the term “donations” very 
widely and, as a result, certain expenses legitimately incurred as part 
of the process of talking to Government at all levels and making the 
Group’s position known are now reportable. Although during the year 
no such expenditure or political donations were made, resolutions were 
passed at the 2012 Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) that provided for 
limited authority for such expenditure, such authority remaining valid 
until the earlier of 29 September 2013 or the conclusion of the AGM 
to be held in 2013, and as such the Company will be asking for this 
limited authority to be renewed at the AGM to be held on 30 July 2013.

Governance
Supplier Payment Policy
The Group does not follow any formal code of practice on payment, 
agreeing terms and conditions for transactions when orders for goods 
or services are placed, and including relevant terms in contracts, 
as appropriate. These arrangements are adhered to when making 
payments, subject to the terms and conditions being met by suppliers. 
The number of trade creditor days outstanding as at 29 March 2013 
for the Group was 57 days (2012: 59 days). The Company is a holding 
company and has no trade creditors.
Contractual or Other Arrangements
The Directors consider that there are no contractual or other 
arrangements, such as those with major suppliers, which are likely to 
influence, directly or indirectly, the performance of the business and 
its value.
Share Capital
Details of the Company’s share capital, including changes during the 
year in the issued share capital and details of the rights attaching 
to the Company’s ordinary shares, are set out in Note 20 on page 
134. All ordinary shares, including those acquired through Company 
share schemes and plans, rank equally with no special rights. All 
shareholders are entitled to attend and speak at the general meetings 
of the Company, appoint proxies, receive any dividends, exercise voting 
rights and transfer shares without restriction. There are no known 
arrangements which may restrict the transfer of shares or voting rights.
The Company has term and revolving credit facilities which require 
the Company in the event of a change of control to notify the facility 
agent and, if required by the majority lenders, these facilities may be 
cancelled. The Company does not have agreements with any Director 
or employee that would provide compensation for loss of office or 
employment resulting from a takeover except that provisions of the 
Company’s share schemes and plan may cause options and awards 
granted to Directors and employees under such schemes and plans to 
vest on a takeover.
Rules relating to the appointment or removal of the Directors, and their 
powers, are contained within the Company’s Articles of Association, 
which in accordance with legislation can only be changed with 
shareholder approval.
Major shareholders
At 29 March 2013, the Company’s register of substantial shareholdings
showed the following interests of 3% or more of the Company’s issued 
ordinary shares:

authorising the Company to purchase a maximum of 19,906,322 
shares, representing less than 10% of the Company’s issued share 
capital at 19 June 2012, such authority expiring at the conclusion of 
the AGM to be held in 2013.
Annual General Meeting
The AGM will be held at the Crowne Plaza Birmingham NEC, Pendigo 
Way, National Exhibition Centre, Birmingham, B40 1PS on Tuesday

Statement of Compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code
For the period ended 29 March 2013 the Board considers that the 
Group has complied fully with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
2010 except where Dennis Millard stood in as Interim Executive 
Chairman between 18 July 2012 and 21 November 2012 as described 
on page 74 and except with respect to the ongoing service of 
Keith Harris and Bill Ronald as described on page 75. The Code is 
published by the Financial Reporting Council from whom paper and 
downloadable versions can be obtained via its website: 
www.frc.org.uk. We have outlined in this report how we have complied 
with the five main principles of the Code using the same headings as 
the main sections of the Code. 
 As a Board we are committed to 
continually reviewing and refreshing 
the Group’s Corporate Governance 
framework. Examples throughout 
the year were the implementation 
of stronger Delegated Authority 
arrangements and the Group 
Treasury and Tax Strategy and policy 
documents.

Corporate Governance Report
To allow for effective decision-making within the Group, the Board maintains a schedule of matters formally reserved for its decision, coupled with a 
schedule delegating other decisions to its Committees, Executive Directors and management. In summary:
Matters Reserved 
for the Board
Include:
 ■ Authority e.g. division of responsibilities and review of its 
own performance.
 ■ Strategy and Management e.g. approval of the annual 
operating and capital expenditure budgets and any material 
changes thereto.
 ■ Structure and Capital e.g. changes to structure or listing 
status.
 ■ Investor Relations
 ■ Contracts e.g. significant corporate transactions.
 ■ Audit, Financial Reporting and Controls e.g. reviewing

responsibilities; these are summarised on pages 78 to 81.
Available on our Corporate Website.
Executive Directors
and Management
Day-to-day decisions are delegated to the Executive Directors 
and management via established procedures for approving 
decisions within business functions. Examples of decisions 
delegated in this way are approval of adverts, signature of 
day-to-day contracts, engaging of new suppliers, entering into 
tenders and promotional activity.
A formal delegated authorities document confirms 
how and by whom approval can be obtained and what 
evidence is required of such approval. This document 
has been reviewed during the year, and tighter controls 
have been put in place. 22357-04  11/06/2013 MIDDLE Proof 11

Corporate Governance Report continued
The Board recognises that it is preferable that the position of Chairman 
and Chief Executive are not held by the same individual and maintains 
a clear division of the responsibilities of these two roles. However, from 
18 July 2012 to 21 November 2012 Dennis Millard acted as Interim 
Executive Chairman whilst the Company undertook a search for a 
new Chief Executive. It was felt that Dennis Millard was best placed to 
lead the Company during this brief period of four months due to his 
knowledge and experience of the Company. Following the presentation 
of the Group’s interim results on 21 November 2012 the Company 
returned to the position of having a separate Chairman and Chief 
Executive in compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors are responsible for providing independent 
challenge and rigour to deliberations by:
 ■ contributing to strategy discussions;
 ■ considering the reporting of performance by managers against 
agreed goals and objectives, and providing critique where 
necessary;
 ■ ensuring the financial information, risk management and controls 
processes of the Group are appropriately vigorous;
 ■ undertaking regular meetings with senior management and periodic 
visits to stores and autocentres;
 ■ meeting together regularly without the Executive Directors present; 
and
 ■ considering Executive Director remuneration and succession 
planning.
The Senior Independent Director, Bill Ronald:
 ■ is available to act as an intermediary for the other Directors or a 
sounding board for the Chairman as required;
 ■ leads meetings with the other Non-Executive Directors without the 
Chairman at least annually to appraise his performance; and
 ■ can be contacted by shareholders if direct contact with the 
Chairman, Chief Executive or other Executive Directors has 
not alleviated their concerns, or if such contact would not be 
appropriate.
Concerns over any unresolved business can be recorded on behalf 
of a Director in the minutes of the relevant meeting. At the time of 
resignation, a Non-Executive Director is able to raise any concerns in 
a written letter to the Chairman who will bring such concerns to the 
attention of the Board. 22357-04  11/06/2013 MIDDLE Proof 11

The Composition of the Board
The Directors possess an appropriate combination of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge of the Company to collectively act in 
the best interests of the Company via the Board and its Committees, 
without responsibilities or decision-making being dominated by any 
one individual or small group. Each Director commits sufficient time 
and attention as is necessary to discharge their duties.

All the Non-Executive Directors are considered by the Board to 
be independent in character and judgement. As at 17 May 2013, 
both Keith Harris and Bill Ronald will have served as Non-Executive 
Directors of the Company for nine years. The Board acknowledges 
that under the UK Corporate Governance Code it should determine 
whether service of more than nine years from the date of first election 
of each individual affects their independence. The Board considers 
that both Keith Harris and Bill Ronald continue to be independent in 
character and judgement. Nevertheless a process has commenced to 
recruit two new Non-Executive Directors to replace both Bill Ronald 
and Keith Harris in the year ahead and thus both Keith Harris and Bill 
Ronald will offer themselves for re-election.

Diversity
The Terms of Reference of the Nomination Committee state that 
potential candidates should be considered “on merit and against 
objective criteria, and with due regard for the benefits of diversity 
on the Board, including gender”. The Board, which includes one 
female member, considers the background and experience brought 
to the Board by each individual to contribute to its diversity. In any 
recruitment, the Board prefers to select the best-qualified candidate 
to provide the Board with the support and expertise required to 
implement its long-term strategy, rather than to fulfil any fixed quota.
In recommending new appointments to the Board, the Nomination 
Committee considers the existing balance of skills, knowledge and 
experience on the Board, the capabilities of the nominees and the 
time they have available to commit to the Company when making 
recommendations to the Board.

Development and Support
An induction programme is maintained for new Directors, which is 
tailored to include briefings on the activities of the Group and visits to 
operational sites. The Chairman, with the assistance of the Company 
Secretary, prepared a comprehensive induction programme for Matt 
Davies when he joined the Company. This included: extensive store 
and distribution centre visits and on-site discussions with store and 
distribution centre colleagues; one-to-one meetings with the senior 
management teams; and the provision of induction materials covering 
the operational and organisational structure of the business, as well as 
the strategic aims and key initiatives of the Company.
Ongoing resources available to the Directors to maintain and develop 
their knowledge are:
 ■ membership of the Deloitte Academy, a training and guidance 
resource for boards and directors;
 ■ a programme of head office and store visits through the period;
 ■ regular reviews with the Chairman to identify any training and 
development needs;
 ■ advice and the services of the Company Secretary on governance, 
relevant legislative changes affecting the business or their duties as 
directors; and
 ■ access to independent professional advice at the Company’s 
expense.

Evaluation
Egon Zehnder International (“EZI”) conducted a Board Effectiveness 
Review (the “EZI report”) during May 2012. The process comprised:
 ■ circulation of a pre-discussion guide
 ■ meetings of c.2 hours between EZI and each Board member and 
the Company Secretary
 ■ review of the EZI report with the Chairman
 ■ circulation of the EZI report to the Board
 ■ discussion of the EZI report at the Board meeting in June 2012 with 
EZI consultants in attendance
 ■ individual feedback to the Chairman from EZI and the Senior 
Independent Director
 ■ individual feedback to the other Directors from the Chairman
The overall conclusion of EZI was that the levels of engagement 
and openness throughout the process were very high and EZI 
were encouraged that the Board were so keen to enhance Board 
effectiveness. The Board remains mindful of the conclusions of the EZI 
report and continues to look for ways to improve.
Re-election
In compliance with the Code and the Company’s Articles of 
Association, all Directors on the Board as at 29 March 2013, except for 
Paul McClenaghan, will seek re-election at the Company’s AGM. Matt 
Davies who was appointed to the Board on 4 October 2012 will offer 
himself for election at the AGM.

Board Committees
The Board discharges some of its responsibilities via Nomination, Audit 
and Remuneration Committees, and more detail about these follows 
this section. The Company Secretary also acts as the secretary to each 
Committee. Whilst not entitled to attend, other Directors, professional 
advisors and senior management attend when invited to. The Auditor 
attends certain Audit Committee meetings by invitation. No member 
is present at Nomination and Remuneration Committee discussions 
pertinent to them.
Senior members of the finance and treasury teams manage the day-to-
day treasury needs of the Group via a Treasury Committee chaired by 
the Finance Director.
Final market announcements are approved prior to release via a 
Disclosure Committee made up of a minimum of two Directors.
Other ad hoc committees may be set up by the Board to consider 
specific issues.
Directors and their Other Interests
Each Director has notified the Company of any situation in which he or
she has, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or
possibly may conflict, with the interests of the Company (a situational
conflict). These interests were considered and approved by the Board
in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association and each
Director was informed of the authorisation and the terms on which it
was given. All Directors are aware of the need to consult with the
Company Secretary regarding any further possible situational conflict
that may arise so that prior consideration can be given by the Board as
to whether or not such conflict will be approved.
Details of the Directors’ service contracts, emoluments, the interests of
the Directors and their immediate families in the share capital of the

Internal Control and Risk Management
Overall responsibility for the system of internal control, reviewing its 
effectiveness and ensuring that there is a process to identify, evaluate 
and manage any significant risks that may affect the achievement of 
the Group’s strategic objectives lies with the Board.
The Board and the Audit Committee have reviewed the effectiveness 
of the Group’s internal control and risk management systems in 
accordance with the Code for the period ended 29 March 2013, 
and up to the date of approving the Annual Report and Financial 
Statements. The internal control and risk management system is 
designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failing to achieve 
business objectives and can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, 
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The internal audit function principally reviews the effectiveness of 
the controls operating within the business by undertaking an agreed 
schedule of independent audits each year. The Audit Committee 
determines the nature and scope of the annual audit programme at 
the beginning of each calendar year and revises it from time to time 
according to changing business circumstances and requirements.
Whilst directed by Andrew Findlay, the Company’s Finance Director, 
the internal audit function is independent in action and reporting, with 
direct line of communication to the Audit Committee Chairman. The 
findings of the independent audits are reported initially to Executive 
management and any necessary corrective actions are agreed. 
Summaries of these reports are presented to, and discussed with, 
the Audit Committee along with details of progress against action plans 
as appropriate.
During the period ended 29 March 2013, the Company engaged 
KPMG to support the internal audit process. KPMG do not perform 
a management role. An experienced in-house Head of Internal Audit 
and Risk was appointed in October 2012 and it is planned that 
following further recruitment, the annual audit plan for future years 
will be completed by an in-house team supplemented by specialist 
consultants as necessary.
The assessment and control of risk are considered by the Board to be 
fundamental to achieving corporate objectives. An ongoing process for 
identifying and evaluating the significant risks faced by the Group and 
the effectiveness of related controls has been established by the Board 
to ensure an acceptable risk/reward profile across the Group. The key 
elements of this process which cover both the Retail and Autcocentres 
businesses are:
 ■ a comprehensive system of monthly reporting from key Executives, 
identifying performance against budget, analysis of variances, major 
business issues, key performance indicators and regular forecasting;
 ■ well-defined policies governing appraisal and approval of capital 
expenditure and treasury operations;
 ■ reviews of key business risks and of management’s controls and 
plans to mitigate these risks; and
 ■ an annual corporate governance confirmation made to the Board by 
senior Executives on the effectiveness of the identification of major 
risks and of the monitoring of internal controls within their areas of 
responsibility.
During the year, we reviewed our risk management system. Key 
elements now include:
 ■ oversight by the Head of Internal Audit and Risk;
 ■ regular meetings and workshops to identify and discuss key risks 
and mitigations with a broad sample of Group senior management 
and Executives;
 ■ review of the corporate risk register in terms of completeness and 
accuracy with Executive team; and
 ■ Audit Committee discussion of the latest corporate risk register and 
the risk management system with subsequent reports to the Board.
During the financial period to 29 March 2013 and up to the date of this 
report the risk management system considered the Company’s Risk 
Register and its alignment with the Company’s key strategic objectives, 
reporting the findings to the Board. The Board considered its appetite 
for risk in relation to the top 30 risks determining that the risks and 
mitigating actions were appropriate to the level of risk that was both 
acceptable to, and incumbent within, a FTSE 250 business. More 
information on the Company’s key risks and uncertainties is shown on 
pages 52 to 55.

The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for:
 ■ Making recommendations to the Board on the Company’s policy on 
remuneration of Executive Directors, the Company Secretary and 
members of its Executive management team.
 ■ Determining specific remuneration packages for each of the 
Chairman, the Executive Directors and Company Secretary of 
the Company and such members of senior management as it is 
delegated to consider including pension rights; any compensation 
payments; and the implementation of Executive incentive schemes. 
In accordance with the Committee’s Terms of Reference, no 
individual may participate in discussions relating to their own terms 
and conditions of service or remuneration.
Further information on the activities of the Remuneration Committee 
is set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 82 to 101. 
A resolution to approve the Directors’ Remuneration Report will be 
proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
Relations with Shareholders
During the period ended 29 March 2013 Bill Ronald served as the 
Company’s Senior Independent Director. The Senior Independent 
Director is available to meet shareholders upon request if they have 
concerns that contact through the normal channels of the Chairman or 
the Executive Directors has failed to resolve, or for which such contact 
is inappropriate.
During the period under review the Chief Executive, Finance Director 
and Chairman have met with analysts and institutional shareholders 
to keep them informed of significant developments and report to the 
Board accordingly on the views of these stakeholders. Each of the 
other Non-Executive Directors is also offered the opportunity to attend 
meetings with major shareholders and would do so if requested by any 
major shareholder.
The Company’s investor relations programme includes formal 
presentations of full year and interim results and meetings with 
individual investors as appropriate. Independent feedback from these 
meetings is provided to the Board. The Company Secretary also brings 
to the attention of the Board any material matters of concern raised by 
the Company’s shareholders, including private investors.
The Interim Report and the Annual Report and Financial Statements 
are the primary means of communication during the year with all of 
the Company’s shareholders. The Board recognises the importance 
of the Internet as a means of communicating widely, quickly and cost-
effectively and a Corporate and Investor Relations website facilitates 
communication with shareholders. Information available online includes 
copies of the full and half-year financial statements, press releases, 
corporate governance information, the Terms of Reference for the 
Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees and the Matters 
Reserved for the Board. The Company’s financial calendar and other 
shareholder information, which are also available online, are set out on 
page 147.
The Board welcomes the opportunity to meet with shareholders and 
to hear their views and answer their questions about the Group and 
its business at the Company’s AGM which will be held on Tuesday, 
30 July 2013 at the Crowne Plaza Birmingham NEC, Pendigo Way, 
National Exhibition Centre, Birmingham, B40 1PS. The Chairmen of the 
Remuneration, Nomination and Audit Committees will be present at the 
AGM and will be in a position to answer questions relevant to the work 
of those Committees. It is the Company’s practice to propose separate 
resolutions on each substantial issue at the AGM. The Chairman will 
advise shareholders on the proxy voting details at the meeting.

Dear shareholder,
FY13 continued to be a challenging year for many retailers. At Halfords 
we responded to these challenges by announcing in April 2012 a 
revised strategy to deliver a sustainable business.
This, therefore, has been a year of embedding the processes, 
procedures and incentives across the business to deliver this new 
strategy. 
During the year David Wild resigned, and following this resignation the 
Board recruited Matt Davies as the new CEO. He was appointed to the 
Board in October 2012.
In light of these changes, the Committee has looked to ensure that our 
Remuneration Policy is appropriate not only to attract and retain a high-
calibre CEO, but to incentivise all colleagues to deliver a sustainable 
business based on the Company’s strategy, leading ultimately to an 
increase in shareholder value.
The Committee has faced three major challenges during the year.
1. Recruitment arrangements for the new CEO
In attracting a new CEO the Committee looked not only at the annual 
package required to attract a high-calibre individual, but also at how 
to incentivise that individual against the need to develop a sustainable 
business and shareholder value, aligning his remuneration with these 
goals. More details about these arrangements can be found on pages 
85 and 96 to 97. The Committee therefore decided it was appropriate, 
as part of his recruitment package, to make him a CEO Co-investment 
award.
On recruitment the new CEO invested £500,000 in Halfords shares. He 
was then awarded a maximum matching share award of 3.5 times his 
investment. These matching shares may vest over a period between 
three and five years from award based on achieving stretching share 
price performance targets. The Committee believes this plan was 
necessary to recruit this high-calibre individual and will incentivise him 
to generate significant value for shareholders.
2. Annual Bonus performance measures
As set out in the Remuneration Report last year, the Committee 
decided to include in 2012/13 bonuses an element based on the 
achievement of key strategic goals which the Committee ultimately 
believes will lead to the creation of shareholder value. The bonus 
is therefore based 75% on PBT and 25% on strategic goals. For 
2013/14, the Committee determined that the strategic objectives 
would be linked to the delivery of the Company’s strategy of delivering 
sustainable and profitable revenue growth through Helping and 
Inspiring our Customers with their Life on the Move and the delivery of 
the Getting Into Gear 2016 programme. 
3. Review of the performance measures for the Performance 
Share Plan (“PSP”)
Our strategic focus for the medium-term is on putting in place 
the foundations to deliver a sustainable business, focusing on an 
authoritative range of products, colleague and service excellence, 
digital participation and helpful store environments with the ultimate 
goal of delivering profitable top line revenue growth and therefore 
creating shareholder value. As a consequence, during the year the 
Committee reviewed the performance measures used for the PSP . The 
Committee determined that Total Shareholder Return and Earnings per 
Share were no longer the most suitable mechanisms for measuring and 
incentivising the successful delivery of this strategy. 
The Committee is currently consulting with shareholders regarding the 
most suitable performance conditions for use in aligning the Executives 
with the delivery of the Company’s strategy, these proposed changes 
and final details will be provided in a Stock Exchange announcement, 
once finalised, and next year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report.  
Remuneration received in respect of 2012/13
A salary review conducted during the year resulted in an increase of 
1.8% in October 2012 for all colleagues except the Executive Directors.
The CEO earned a bonus of 37.5% of salary and the Executive 
Directors earned bonuses of 20% of salary. The Committee determined 
that this level of bonus was appropriate, reflecting strong performance 
against key strategic objectives during the year. PSP awards granted 
in 2010 will lapse in 2013 because the EPS and TSR targets were 
not met.
Remuneration reporting
In light of industry consultations in 2012 and the publication of draft BIS 
regulations, which will apply for Halfords for the 2013/14 year-end, the 
Committee has sought to introduce new disclosures into the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report. We hope shareholders find these changes 
useful.
Priorities for 2013/14
The priorities for the Committee in the forthcoming year continue to be 
to ensure that the Company’s policy is aligned with the strategy and 
long-term sustainable success of the business.
In summary the Committee has dealt with a number of changes 
over the last year both specific to the Company and in response 
to Government consultations and is committed to ensuring that 
the Company’s remuneration arrangements are designed to drive 
sustained shareholder value and that the proper levels of transparency 
are maintained.
Yours faithfully

Executive Remuneration Policy
The Remuneration Committee seeks to support the delivery of the Group’s corporate strategy through establishing appropriate remuneration 
arrangements. Our goal is to build a strong long-term business by delivering ongoing sales growth and sustainable shareholder returns through the 
delivery of authoritative ranges of products, colleague and service excellence, digital participation and helpful store environments.
Consequently, the overall remuneration policy of the Committee, and of the Board, is to provide remuneration packages for Executive Directors and 
other senior managers in the Group which:
 ■ Attract and retain – Enable the Group to attract and retain management of the right calibre with the necessary financial, retail, customer service, 
and digital skill sets required to deliver a sustainable business model and drive shareholder returns. Remuneration arrangements are set at 
levels which are appropriate to achieve this goal without paying more than is necessary. Benchmarking exercises are undertaken at appropriate 
intervals to inform the position of executives’ pay relative to the market, and without seeking to “match the median” to identify and mitigate the 
risk of losing strong performers.
 ■ Variable pay linked to the delivery of the strategy – Provide management with the opportunity to earn competitive remuneration through annual 
and long-term variable-based pay arrangements that are designed to support delivery against key strategic objectives.  Performance measures 
are aligned with strategic goals so that remuneration arrangements are transparent to Executives, shareholders and other stakeholders. 
Different elements of executive pay are delivered over the short and longer terms and are designed to ensure that a substantial proportion of the 
Executives’ remuneration is variable and performance-related.
 ■ Executives as shareholders – Align management’s interests with those of shareholders by incentivising management to deliver the Group’s 
long-term strategy of a sustainable, growing business and thus enhance shareholder value. A significant portion of reward is delivered in shares 
to create alignment of interests. 
 ■ Sustainable performance – Remuneration arrangements are designed to support the sustainable delivery of performance and to prevent 
excessive risk taking.
The overall balance is illustrated on page 86.

Remuneration Policy for New Hires
When hiring a new Executive Director, the Committee will seek to align the remuneration package with the above policy. However, to ensure that 
the right calibre of individual is appointed to the Board the Committee retains discretion to make remuneration proposals that are outside this 
standard policy where it considers it is necessary to do so. In determining the appropriate arrangements the Committee may look to benchmark 
the role and remuneration against its peer group and may also take into account other relevant factors such as the remuneration levels of other 
Executive Directors and the type of remuneration being offered. 
The Committee may also make arrangements to compensate the new Executive for ‘loss’ of existing remuneration benefits when leaving a 
previous employer. In doing so the Committee may take account of the form in which they were granted, the relevant performance conditions and 
the length of the time that the performance periods have to run.
Remuneration Arrangements in Different Performance Scenarios
As outlined above, the remuneration policy is designed to ensure that a substantial proportion of the Executive Directors’ remuneration is variable 
and performance-related. By linking the remuneration of the individual Executive Director to the performance of the Company, the Board seeks, as 
far as possible, to motivate that individual towards superior business performance and shareholder value creation, and to only pay rewards when 
these goals have been realised. Performance measures are aligned with strategic goals so that remuneration arrangements are transparent to 
Directors, shareholders and other stakeholders.
The charts below illustrate remuneration arrangements in different performance scenarios. The assumptions for each scenario are outlined below:
Threshold performance ■ Fixed pay (base salary, benefits and pension) only
On-target performance ■ Fixed pay
 ■ 90% of salary annual bonus payout for CEO, 60% of salary annual bonus payout for Finance Director
 ■ 100% of salary payout under the Performance Share Plan
 ■ CEO only – Award annualised by one-third to take account of one-off nature of award, 30% of matching share 
award vests
Stretch target performance ■ Fixed pay
 ■ 150% of salary annual bonus payout for CEO, 100% of salary annual bonus payout for Finance Director
 ■ 225% of salary payout under the Performance Share Plan

Share Arrangements in Place
The Company had adopted three share plans: The Halfords Sharesave Scheme; the Halfords Company Share Option Scheme (“CSOS”), a market 
value share option plan; and the Halfords Performance Share Plan (“PSP”).
In 2012 the Company also made the new CEO a one-off Co-Investment Share Award. This was made under Listing Rule 9.4.2, where the 
long-term incentive scheme arrangements are for an “individual whose appointment as a director is being contemplated and the arrangement is 
established specifically to facilitate, in unusual circumstances the recruitment and retention of the relevant individual”. It is currently not intended 
that further Co-Investment Share Awards will be made.
While committed to the use of equity-based performance-related remuneration as a means of aligning Directors’ interests with those of 
shareholders, the Committee is aware of shareholders’ concerns on dilution through the issue of new shares to satisfy such awards. Therefore, 
when reviewing remuneration arrangements, the Committee takes into account the effects such arrangements may have on dilution. Halfords 
intends to comply with the ABI guidelines relating to the issue of new shares for equity incentive plans. The current 10 year shareholder dilution 
is 3.34%.

May 2004 An all-employee SAYE scheme in which all Executive

The Committee considered the principles behind

concluded that the current scheme remains appropriate. 
Options are granted at an exercise price not less than 
80% of market value at the date of grant. Options may 
not normally be exercised until the option holder has 
completed his or her savings contract (normally three 
or five years) from the date of commencement of the 
savings contract. Executive Directors may also join the 
Halfords Sharesave Scheme. During the year awards 
were granted under the SAYE to participating eligible 
employees in the United Kingdom, Ireland and 
Hong Kong.

The CSOS is a market value option plan which 
incentivises senior management to grow the share 
price. Options are granted at an exercise price not less 
than market value at the date of grant and are normally 
subject to performance. Currently, vesting of options is 
subject to an earnings per share hurdle.

Executive Directors’ Service Agreements 
Term
The Company’s policy in relation to contractual terms on termination, and any payments made, is that they should be fair to the individual, the 
Company and shareholders. Failure should not be rewarded and the departing Executive’s duty to mitigate loss should be fully recognised. The 
Committee periodically reviews the Group’s policy on the duration of Directors’ service agreements, and the notice periods and termination 
provisions contained in those agreements. The Company is aware that companies are encouraged to consider notice periods of less than  
12 months, and in contracting with the new CEO it was agreed that a notice period of six months was appropriate. The notice periods of the 
other Executive Directors remain limited to 12 months. The Committee will continue to review this policy, to ensure that it is more in line with the 
Company’s overall remuneration policy.

Early Termination of contract
No compensation would be payable if a service contract were to be terminated by notice from an Executive Director or for lawful early termination 
by the Company. The Company may terminate any of the above service agreements in accordance with the appropriate notice periods. In the 
event of early termination (other than for a reason justifying summary termination in accordance with the terms of the service agreement) the 
Company may (but is not obliged to) pay to the Executive Director, in lieu of notice, a sum equal to the annual value (six months for the CEO) of the 
Executive Director’s then salary, benefits and pension contributions, which he would have received during the contractual notice period, the sum 
of which shall be payable in 12 monthly instalments (six for the CEO). In respect of any bonus entitlement earned during a financial period prior 
to termination of employment this will be calculated by the Remuneration Committee, if the Director is deemed by the Committee to be a Good 
Leaver, on a pro rata basis by reference to their period of service in the financial period in which their employment is terminated. If the Director’s 
employment is terminated in circumstances that the Committee reasonably believes that they cannot be designated a Good Leaver the Director 
shall forfeit any entitlement to a bonus payment.
Mitigation in Termination
In such instances the Executive Director shall use their best endeavours to secure an alternative source of remuneration, thus mitigating any loss 
to the Company, and shall provide the Board with evidence of such endeavours upon their reasonable request. If the Director fails to provide such 
evidence the Board may cease all further payments of compensation. To the extent that the Executive Director receives any sums as a result of 
alternative employment or provision of services while he is receiving such payments from the Company, the payments shall be reduced by the 
amount of such sums. In Good Leaver circumstances the Executive Director might be offered a lump sum termination payment paid at the time 
they cease employment which in all cases will be less than he would receive if he were to be paid his annual salary over 12 months (six months for 
the CEO).
Change of Control
The service agreements of Executive Directors do not provide for any enhanced payments in the event of a change of control of the Company.

Loss of Office Payments
The Company’s policy towards exit payments is that under no circumstances will they exceed the contractual obligations afforded to the Executive 
Director and contained within their contract of employment. There are a number of ways in which an Executive Director can leave the business and 
each circumstance is dealt with differently in respect of how exit payments are calculated.

The treatment of outstanding share awards in the event that an Executive Director leaves is governed by the relevant share plan rules. The following

satisfactory performance, which is evaluated annually.
No compensation would be payable to a Non-Executive Director if his or her engagement were terminated as a result of him or her retiring by 
rotation at an Annual General Meeting, not being elected or re-elected at an Annual General Meeting or otherwise ceasing to hold office under the

Outside Appointments
Halfords recognises that its Executive Directors may be invited to become Non-Executive Directors of other companies. Such non-executive duties 
can broaden experience and knowledge which can benefit Halfords. Subject to approval by the Board, Executive Directors are allowed to accept 
non-executive appointments and retain the fees received, provided that these appointments are not likely to lead to conflicts of interest. David 
Wild is a Non-Executive of Premier Foods plc and between 31 March 2012 and 19 July 2012 received fees of £17,161 and Matt Davies is a Non-
Executive Director of Dunelm Group plc and between 4 October 2012 and 29 March 2012 received fees of £15,000.
Remuneration Arrangements elsewhere in the Group
The remuneration policy for executive managers in the Group is similar to the policy for Executive Directors as set out in this report — a substantial 
proportion of remuneration is performance related in order to encourage and reward superior business performance and shareholder returns and 
remuneration is linked to both individual and Company performance. Basic salary is targeted at normal commercial rates for comparable roles and 
is benchmarked at appropriate intervals. Bonuses of up to 100% of salary can be earned on the same basis as the Executive Directors. Senior 
Executives immediately below the Board also benefit from participation in the PSP .
Increases to Executive managers’ base salaries are considered at the same time as all other colleagues across the Group and other than 
benchmarking increases to ensure that the Group is attracting and retaining the right calibre of executive, increases are in line with all colleagues. 
Increases have been as follows — October 2012: 1.8% (Executive Directors: £Nil), April 2012: 2% (Executive Directors: 2%).
All of the Group’s c.12,000 colleagues are eligible to join the Halfords Sharesave Plan (SAYE) after they have served one complete month’s service. 
At the same time they are all eligible for some form of quarterly or full year bonus, although the type, limits and performance conditions vary 
according to job level. Senior managers and other key management individuals are invited to join the Company Share Option Scheme.
In 2012/13 all newly appointed colleagues and other existing colleagues who had experienced a ‘joining-trigger’ event were eligible to join 
the Halfords Pension Plan 2009. All members of the Pension Plan are required to make a minimum contribution of 3% and the Company also 
contributes a minimum of 3%, dependent on length of service and seniority. The Company has also made plans to auto enrol all other colleagues 
as appropriate.
Dialogue with Shareholders
The views of our shareholders are very important to the Committee and it is our policy to consult with our largest shareholders in advance of 
making any material changes to the executive remuneration arrangements. The Committee is currently consulting with major shareholders 
regarding the proposed changes to the PSP performance conditions. 92

How the remuneration policy will be implemented for 2013/14
Base salary
Base salaries were last reviewed with effect from 1 October 2012 when no increases were awarded to Executive Directors. Current salaries are as 
follows:
CEO £500,000
Finance Director £280,500
In reviewing Executive Directors’ responsibilities the Committee determined that the Group’s Finance Director, Andrew Findlay, had assumed Board 
responsibility for a number of areas of the business, most importantly that of IT. This was considered by the Board to be a vital role in the delivery 
of the Company’s Getting Into Gear 2016 programme and as such the Committee considered it appropriate that Andrew receive an increased 
salary from 1 October 2013 of £325,000.
Annual bonus
The annual bonus opportunity for 2013/14 will remain unchanged as follows:
CEO ■ Maximum opportunity of 150% of base salary
 ■ two-thirds paid in cash
 ■ one-third paid in Halfords shares deferred for 
three years
Finance Director ■ Maximum opportunity of 100% of base salary
 ■ Paid in cash
The annual bonus for 2013/14 will continue to be based 75% on Profit Before Tax (“PBT”) performance and 25% based on performance against 
strategic objectives. PBT targets range from 92% of budget, where payment is zero, to 106% of budget for maximum payment.
The Committee reviews the goals included in the strategic objectives portion of the bonus to ensure that remains appropriate. For 2013/14 the 
Committee determined that the strategic objectives should be linked to the delivery of the Company’s  long-term strategic goal is to deliver growth 
in top line revenues. The Executive Team have considered the Getting Into Gear 2016 programme discussed on pages 29 to 32 and 34 to 35 
and have identified measures that will determine the successful delivery of each initiative and these also represent the strategic non-financial KPIs 
that will form part of the Executive Team’s 2013/14 annual bonus plan.

business in the future, focusing on an authoritative range of products, colleague and service excellence, digital participation and helpful store 
environments with the ultimate goal of delivering profitable top line revenue growth and therefore creating shareholder value. As a consequence 
during the year the Committee reviewed the performance measures used for the PSP and determined that Total Shareholder Return and Earnings 
Per Share were no longer the most suitable mechanisms for measuring and incentivising the successful delivery of this strategy. 
Core awards made under the PSP will continue to be 150% of base salary with the opportunity to earn up to 1.5x this level if exceptional 
performance is achieved. 
The Committee is currently consulting with shareholders regarding these proposed changes and details will be provided in a Stock Exchange 
announcement when finalised and in next year’s report. 22357-04  11/06/2013 MIDDLE Proof 11

Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
Salary and Benefits
The last Group-wide salary review was undertaken in October 2011 which took into account remuneration trends, candidate quality and job 
location in markets in which the Group had recently recruited. With respect to the Executives, the salary review also considered executive 
remuneration market trends and benchmarking. Salary increases not exceeding 2% were made to all Group colleagues, including some Executive 
Directors in April 2012 following no increases in the previous 12 months. In October 2012 the Group reverted to the normal review timing and 
further increases of 1.8% were made to Group colleagues; however, Executive Directors were excluded from this round of increases.
Annual Bonus for 2012/13 
Annual Bonus for 2012/13 for the Finance Director and Commercial Directors was based 75% on Group PBT and 25% on key strategic projects. 
These key projects included delivering an increase in the Company’s Fitting proposition; increasing the range of parts, accessories and clothing on 
offer in the Company’s Cycling category; the development of new store formats; driving the Autocentres business; and improving both Colleague 
and Customer engagement with the Halfords brand. 
Annual Bonuses reported in the above table and payable in May 2013 for the financial period ended 29 March 2013 were calculated as follows.

The Remuneration Committee have discretion to judge whether they believe that each of these projects has been attained and to the extent that

been realised: 
— Fitting proposition; Increase in Revenues from Fitting by 36%. 100% —

On appointment, the Committee agreed that the CEO should participate in an annual bonus for his period from appointment on 4 October 2012 to 
the end of the financial year, 29 March 2013. His maximum bonus opportunity for this period was set at 50% of this normal maximum (i.e. 75% of 
his full year base salary), with two-thirds paid in cash and one-third deferred into shares for a period of three years. Fifty per cent of the bonus was 
based on PBT performance and 50% was based on the delivery of key personal performance objectives which were considered by the Committee 
to be key objectives for the initial period of his tenure. These included reviewing and formulating a new strategy, undertaking a review of the 
executive committee organisational capability and improving employee engagement.
 
The Committee reviewed the achievement of the new CEO’s bonus targets and concluded that he had met all of the personal performance 
objectives set on his appointment in October 2012. The key objectives included: a review of the business and the formulation of a new strategy;  
a review of  the organisational capability of the business; the creation of a new executive management team; and, a positive movement in the 
Colleague Engagement score (which increased from 64% to 77%). Although the Group achieved profits in line with the guidance that was indicated 
to the market after the new CEO’s appointment, it was considered by the Committee that, given the profit performance of the Group relative to 
original budget and initial market guidance, no award for the profit element of his bonus be made. Thus 50% of the available pro rata bonus was 
payable, of which one-third would be deferred into shares.
The Committee reviewed the annual bonus payout in the context of the performance of the underlying business during the year and the delivery 
against strategy and determined that the level of bonus paid was appropriate in this context. 22357-04  11/06/2013 MIDDLE Proof 11

Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
TSR and EPS performance is assessed on an independent basis. However, to ensure that the PSP continued to support sustainable performance, 
the multiplier for one measure is only applied if performance is at least at the threshold level for the other measure. The companies included in the 
TSR comparator group for awards granted in 2010 are as follows: 
Brown Group; Carpetright; Carphone Warehouse; Debenhams; Dignity; Dixons Retail plc (formerly DSG International); Dunelm Group; Game Group 
(de-listed on 3 April 2012); Greggs; Home Retail Group; JD Sports Fashion plc; Darty (formerly Kesa Electricals); Kingfisher International; Marks & 
Spencer Group; Morrison (WM); Mothercare; Next; Sainsbury (J); Sports Direct; Tesco; WH Smith.
Based on TSR performance between 27 March 2010 and 29 March 2013, Halfords was ranked 16th against the comparator group and therefore 
no portion of the TSR element of the award will vest. EPS growth between FY10 and FY13 was below that of RPI over the same period and 
therefore no portion of the EPS element of the award will vest. The 2010 PSP award will therefore lapse in full in August 2013.
Outstanding PSP awards
PSP awards granted in 2011 and 2012 are subject to the same performance conditions as those outlined above for the 2010 PSP award. The 
companies included in the TSR comparator group are based on the FTSE 350 general retail and food retail companies on the date of grant. 
CEO Co-Investment Award
On appointment the Company made the CEO a Co-Investment Award, the details of which are set out in the Stock Exchange announcement 
issued on his appointment. This Award is designed to recruit and retain an executive of calibre required to run the business and to incentivise the 
CEO to deliver exceptional shareholder value creation through the achievement of share price performance targets. 
This plan was adopted for the sole purpose of making a one-off award to the Group’s new CEO and was adopted under Listing Rule 9.4.2 where 
the long-term incentive scheme arrangements are for an “individual whose appointment as a director is being contemplated and the arrangement 
is established specifically to facilitate, in unusual circumstances, the recruitment and retention of the relevant individual”. It is currently intended that 
no further awards either to the Group’s CEO or other executives will be made under this plan. 
Under the Plan the CEO invested £500,000 into Halfords shares, acquiring 164,056 shares at 302.22p per share. The CEO was then awarded 
a maximum matching award of 3.5✕ the number of invested shares (574,196 shares). Subject to continued employment these shares may vest 
up to a third in November 2015, up to two-thirds in November 2016 and in full in November 2017, depending on the following Threshold (30% 
vesting) and Maximum (100% vesting) share price performance targets of Halfords: 
November Threshold Maximum
2015 350p 400p
2016 385p 440p
2017 425p 485p
Share Price performance will be assessed using the average mid-market closing share price for the 30 days following the announcement of the 
Interim results for the relevant year (normally November). At each relevant vesting date the CEO may decide to either exercise any portion of the 
award that has vested based on performance at that time (in which case any unvested shares in that tranche in respect of which the share price 
target has not been met will lapse) or roll forward that tranche in full to be subject to performance testing at the next vesting date. In the latter case 
(“roll-forward”) the Participant will forfeit the right to exercise any awards that had become capable of vesting at the earlier vesting date.
Matching shares were granted in the form of nil cost options. Vested options can be exercised until the 10th anniversary of the date of grant. 
Matching shares may accrue additional shares related to dividends.

Governance
Prior to vesting the Committee will satisfy themselves that the achievement of the Share Price Target is a genuine reflection of the Company’s 
underlying financial performance and may adjust the level of vesting accordingly. The Committee may determine that Matching Shares can be 
scaled back before exercise for circumstances such as material misstatement, the individual being responsible for serious reputational damage to 
the Company, or in circumstances where the Company suffers serious losses. 
The Committee believes that the design of the plan is appropriate and necessary to recruit an individual of the CEO’s calibre and that the structure 
will incentivise him to drive exceptional business performance.
Shareholding guidelines
The Committee believes that it is important that Executive Directors are also long-term shareholders in the business because as such Executives 
are incentivised to deliver the corporate strategy, thus creating value for all shareholders.

Financials Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in Respect of the Annual 
Report & Accounts 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the 
Group and Parent Company financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Parent 
Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law 
they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and 
have elected to prepare the Parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with UK Accounting Standards and applicable law  
(UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and Parent Company and of their 
profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and Parent 
Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
 ■ select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
 ■ make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 ■ for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
 ■ for the Parent Company financial statements, state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Parent 
Company financial statements; and
 ■ prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless 
it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Parent 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Parent Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Parent Company and enable them to ensure 
that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and 
detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible 
for preparing a Directors’ Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report and 
Corporate Governance Statement that comply with that law and those 
regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ Responsibility Statement
The Directors confirm to the best of their knowledge:
a) the financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS, as 
adopted by the European Union, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Company and 
the Group; and
b) the business review includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Company and 
the Group, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties faced.

Financials General Information
Halfords Group plc is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom. The consolidated financial statements of the Company as at and for the period 
ended 29 March 2013 comprise the Company and its subsidiary undertakings.
Statement of Compliance
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU 
(“adopted IFRSs”).
Basis of Preparation
The consolidated financial statements of Halfords Group plc and its subsidiary undertakings (together “the Group”) are prepared on a going 
concern basis for the reasons set out in the Directors’ Report on page 70, and under the historical cost convention, except where adopted IFRSs 
require an alternative treatment. The principal variations relate to financial instruments (IAS 39 “Financial instruments: recognition and 
measurement”) and share based payments (IFRS 2 “Share-based payment”).
The financial statements are presented in millions of UK pounds, rounded to the nearest £0.1m.
The accounts of the Group are prepared for the period up to the Friday closest to 31 March each year. Consequently, the financial statements for 
the current period cover the 52 weeks to 29 March 2013, whilst the comparative period covered the 52 weeks to 30 March 2012.
Basis of Consolidation
Subsidiary Undertakings
Subsidiary undertakings are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They cease to be consolidated from the 
date that the Group no longer has control. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of 
an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. EBTs are accounted for and consolidated on the basis that the Parent has control, thus the 
assets and liabilities of the EBT are included on the Company balance sheet and shares held by the EBT in the Company are presented as a 
deduction from equity.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised 
losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
The financial statements of all subsidiary undertakings are prepared to the same reporting date as the Company. All subsidiary undertakings have 
been consolidated.
The principal subsidiary undertakings of the Company at 29 March 2013 are detailed on page 141 in note 4 to the Company balance sheet, which 
can be found on page138.
Business Combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair 
values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control 
of the acquiree. Acquisition related costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which the costs are incurred.
The identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 “Business 
Combinations” are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the 
Group’ s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. If, after reassessment, the Group’ s interest in 
the net fair value of these elements exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Revenue Recognition
Retail
Retail revenue comprises the fair value of the sale of goods and services to external customers, net of value added tax, rebates, promotions and 
returns. Revenue is recognised on the sale of goods when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer 
and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. Revenue on goods delivered is recognised when the customer accepts delivery and on 
services when those services have been rendered.
Car Servicing
Car Servicing revenue comprises the provision of servicing to external customers, net of value added tax, rebates and promotions. Revenue is 
recognised at the point at which those services have been rendered.
Promotions and Returns
The Group operates a variety of sales promotion schemes that give rise to goods and services being sold at a discount to standard retail price. 
Revenue is adjusted to show sales net of all related discounts. A provision for estimated returns is made representing the profit on goods sold 
during the year which are expected to be returned and refunded after the year-end based on past experience. Revenue is reduced by the value of 
sales returns provided for during the year.

Annual Report & Accounts 2013
online version
www.halfords.annualreport2013.com Finance income
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested. Income is recognised, as it accrues in profit or loss, using the effective interest rate method.
Non-recurring Items
Non-recurring items are those items that are unusual because of their size, nature or incidence. The Group’s management considers that these 
items should be separately identified within their relevant income statement category to enable a full understanding of the Group’s results.
Earnings Per Share
The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss 
attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for 
own shares held. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares outstanding, adjusted for own shares held, for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which comprise share options granted 
to employees.
The Group has also chosen to present an alternative earnings per share measure, with profit adjusted for non-recurring items. A reconciliation of 
this alternative measure to the statutory measure required by IFRS is given in note 9.
Foreign Currency Translation
Functional and Presentation Currency
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the Group’s presentation currency, and are rounded to the nearest 
hundred thousand, except where it is deemed relevant to disclose the amounts to the nearest pound. Items included in the financial statements of 
the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency).
Transactions and Balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date, 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. 
Translation differences on monetary items are taken to the income statement with the exception of differences on transactions that are subject to 
effective cash flow hedges, which are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are retranslated at the exchange rate at the 
date that the fair value was determined. Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised in profit or loss, except for differences 
arising on qualifying cash flow hedges, which are recognised in other comprehensive income.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to sterling at the exchange rate at the reporting date. The income and expenses of 
foreign operations are translated to sterling at an average exchange rate. Foreign currency differences are recognised in other comprehensive 
income and a separate component of equity. When a foreign operation is disposed of, the relevant amount in equity is transferred to profit or loss.
Employee Benefits
i) Pensions
The Halfords Pension Plan is a contract based plan, where each member has their own individual pension policy, which they monitor 
independently. The Group pays fixed contributions and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. The costs of contributions to 
the scheme are charged to the income statement in the period in which they arise.
ii) Share based Payment Transactions
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share based compensation plans.
The fair value of the employee services received under such schemes is recognised as an expense in the income statement. Fair values are 
determined by use of an appropriate pricing model and incorporate an assessment of relevant market performance conditions.
The amount to be expensed over the vesting period is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and non-market 
vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet 
the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of share incentives that are expected to vest. The impact of the revision 
of original estimates, if any, is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Taxation
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it 
relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted, 
at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Financials Accounting Policies continued
The tax base of an asset is the amount that will be deductible for tax purposes against any taxable economic benefits that will flow to an entity when it 
recovers the carrying amount of the asset. If those economic benefits will not be taxable, the tax base of the asset is equal to its carrying amount.
The tax base of a liability is its carrying amount, less any amount that will be deductible for tax purposes in respect of that liability in future periods. 
In the case of revenue which is received in advance, the tax base of the resulting liability is its carrying amount, less any amount of the revenue that 
will not be taxable in future periods.
Deferred taxation is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and 
their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, if the deferred taxation arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability 
in a transaction other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not 
accounted for. Deferred taxation is calculated using rates that are expected to apply when the related deferred asset is realised or the deferred 
taxation liability is settled.
Deferred taxation assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised.
Dividends
Final dividends are recognised in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by shareholders. Interim equity 
dividends are recognised in the period in which they are paid.
Intangible Assets
i) Goodwill
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less 
any accumulated impairment losses. An impairment charge is recognised in profit or loss for any amount by which the carrying value of goodwill 
exceeds its recoverable amount.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies 
of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there 
is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
For acquisitions prior to 3 April 2010 costs directly attributable to business combinations formed part of the consideration payable when calculating 
goodwill. Adjustments to contingent consideration, and therefore the consideration payable and goodwill, are made at each reporting date until the 
consideration is finally determined.
Acquisitions after this date fall under the provisions of “Revised IFRS 3 Business Combinations (2009)”. For these acquisitions transaction costs, 
other than share and debt issue costs, will be expensed as incurred and subsequent adjustments to the fair value of consideration payable will be 
recognised in profit or loss.
ii) Computer Software
Costs that are directly associated with identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, and that will generate economic benefits 
beyond one year are recognised as intangible assets. These intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment 
losses. Software is amortised over three to five years depending on the estimated useful economic life.
iii) Acquired Intangible Assets
Intangible assets that are acquired as a result of a business combination are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date, provided they are 
identifiable and capable of reliable measurement.
Amortisation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, other than goodwill, from the 
date that they are available for use, since this most closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied 
in the asset. The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows:
 ■ Brand names and trademarks: 2 years;
 ■ Customer relationships: 5 to 15 years; and
 ■ Favourable leases: over the term of the lease
Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial year-end and adjusted if appropriate.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment is held at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is provided to write off the cost, less residual value, on a straight-line basis over their useful 
economic lives as follows:
 ■ Leasehold premises with lease terms of 50 years or less are depreciated over the remaining period of the lease;
 ■ Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the period of the lease to a maximum of 25 years;

Halfords Group plc 
Annual Report & Accounts 2013
online version
www.halfords.annualreport2013.com  ■ Motor vehicles are depreciated over 3 years;
 ■ Fixtures, fittings and equipment are depreciated over 4 to 10 years according to the estimated life of the asset;
 ■ Computer equipment is depreciated over 3 years; and
 ■ Land is not depreciated.
Depreciation is expensed to the income statement within operating expenses.
Residual values, remaining useful economic lives and depreciation periods and methods are reviewed annually and adjusted if appropriate.
Impairment of Assets
Tangible and intangible assets that are subject to amortisation and depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s 
carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. 
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-
generating units). For goodwill, an annual impairment review is performed at each balance sheet date.
Leases
Finance Leases
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. 
Finance leases are capitalised at the lease’ s inception at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease 
payments. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate on the finance balance outstanding. 
The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in borrowings. The interest element of the rental is charged to the income 
statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.
Operating Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments 
made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. The benefit of incentives 
from lessors is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Landlord Surrender Payments
Payments received from landlords in respect of the surrender of all or part of units previously occupied by the Group, that do not represent an 
incentive for future rental commitments, are recognised in the income statement on the exchange of contracts, where there are no further 
substantial acts to complete.
Sublease Income
The Group leases properties from which it no longer trades. These properties are often sublet to third parties. Rents receivable are recognised by 
offsetting the income against rental costs accounted for within selling and distribution costs in the income statement.
Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories is based on the weighted average cost principle and 
includes expenditure incurred in inventories, adjusted for rebates, and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location.
Provisions
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it 
is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected 
future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The 
unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance cost.
Details of the provisions recognised and the significant estimates and judgements can be seen in note 17.
Where the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset when the reimbursement is certain.
Financial Instruments
Financial Assets
The Group’s financial assets include cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables. All financial assets are recognised when the Group 
becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
i) Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts 
due according to the original terms of receivables. The amount of the provision is determined as the difference between the asset’s carrying 
amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, and is recognised in the income statement in operating expenses.

Financials Accounting Policies continued
ii) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, and other short-term highly liquid investments with original 
maturities of three months or less. For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents includes bank overdrafts in 
addition to the definition above.
Financial Liabilities and Equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
The Group’s financial liabilities comprise trade and other payables and borrowings. All financial liabilities are recognised initially at their fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
i) Bank borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the borrowing. 
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is 
recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Finance cost comprises interest expense on borrowings, unwinding of the discount on provisions and the cost of forward foreign exchange 
contracts.
ii) Trade payables
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
iii) Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded as the proceeds are received, net of direct issue costs. Own shares consist of shares held 
within an employee benefit trust and are recognised at cost as a deduction from shareholders’ equity. Subsequent consideration received for the 
sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the sale proceeds from the original cost being taken to revenue 
reserves. No gain or loss is recognised in the Group Income Statement on transactions in own shares held.
iv) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage risks arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to the purchase of 
overseas sourced products. The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The Group uses the derivatives 
to hedge highly probable forecast transactions and therefore the instruments are designated as cash flow hedges.
Derivatives are recognised at fair value on the date a contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value. The effective 
element of any gain or loss from remeasuring the derivative instrument is recognised directly in the hedging reserve.
The associated cumulative gain or loss is reclassified from the Group Statement of Changes in Equity and recognised in the Group Income 
Statement in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects the Group Income Statement. Any element of the 
remeasurement of the derivative instrument that does not meet the criteria for an effective hedge is recognised immediately in the Group Income 
Statement within finance income or costs.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss 
existing in other comprehensive income at that time remains in other comprehensive income and is recognised when the forecast transaction is 
ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was 
reported in other comprehensive income is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 
12 months or as a current asset or liability, if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months.
Estimates and Judgements
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based 
on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis 
of making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ 
from the estimates.
The judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are 
detailed below:

22357-04  11/06/2013 BACK Proof 11
Halfords Group plc 
Annual Report & Accounts 2013
online version
www.halfords.annualreport2013.com Impairment of Assets
Goodwill and other assets are subject to impairment reviews based on whether current or future events and circumstances suggest that their 
recoverable value may be less than their carrying value. Recoverable amount is based on a calculation of expected future cash flows, which 
includes management assumptions and estimates of future performance. Details of the assumptions used in the impairment review of goodwill and 
other assets are explained in note 10.
Allowances Against the Carrying Value of Inventories
The Group reviews the market value of and demand for its inventories on a periodic basis to ensure that recorded inventory is stated at the lower of 
cost and net realisable value. In assessing the ultimate realisation of inventories, the Group is required to make judgements as to future demand 
requirements and to compare these with the current or committed inventory levels. Assumptions have been made relating to the timing and 
success of product ranges, which would impact estimated demand and selling prices.
Sensitivities to the assumptions for specific product lines are not expected by management to result in a material change in the overall allowances.
Provisions
Provisions include residual amounts for the Central Europe exit, property related liabilities and other trading liabilities. These provisions are 
estimates of the actual costs of future cash flows and are dependent on future events. Any difference between expectations and the actual future 
liability will be accounted for in the period when such determination is made. Assumptions made are detailed in note 17.
Intangible Asset Valuations
The measurement of fair values on a business combination requires the recognition and measurement of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities. The key judgements involved are the identification of which intangible assets meet the recognition criteria as set out in IAS 38, 
the fair values attributable to those intangible assets, excluding any buyer-specific synergies, and the useful lives of individual intangible assets. The 
useful lives of intangibles assets relating to customer relationships involves judgement as to customer retention rates applicable.
The carrying amount of these assets and liabilities can be seen in the notes to the financial statements on pages 118 to 143.
Adoption of new and revised standards
The following standard is applicable to the Group and has been adopted in the current period as it is mandatory for the year ended 29 March 2013 
but either has no material impact on the result or net assets of the Group or is not applicable.
 ■ IAS 12 (Amendment): “Income taxes” — The amendments introduced a presumption, for deferred tax purposes, that recovery of the carrying 
amount of an investment property will normally be through sale.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted
The following standards and interpretations have been published, endorsed by the EU, and are available for early adoption, but have not yet been 
applied by the Group in these financial statements. The Group does not believe the adoption of these standards or interpretations would have a 
material impact on the consolidated results or financial position of the Group.
 ■ IAS 1 (Amendment): “Presentation of financial statements” amends how components of other comprehensive income are presented. The 
amendments require the grouping of items of other comprehensive income into items that might be reclassified to the income statement in 
subsequent periods and items that will not be reclassified to the income statement in subsequent periods.
 ■ IFRS 7 (Amendment): “Financial Instruments: Disclosures” amends disclosure requirements to require information about all recognised financial 
instruments that are set off in accordance with paragraph 42 of IAS 32.
 ■ IFRS 10: “Consolidated financial statements” replaces the guidance of control and consolidation in IAS 27 and SIC 32: Consolidation — 
special purpose entities. The core principle that a consolidated entity presents a Parent and its subsidiaries as if they were a single entity 
remains unchanged, as do the mechanics of the consolidation.
 ■ IFRS 11: “Joint arrangements” requires joint arrangements to be accounted for as a joint operation or as a joint venture depending on the 
rights and obligations of each party to the arrangement. Proportionate consolidation for joint ventures will be eliminated and equity accounting 
will be mandatory.
 ■ IFRS 12: “Disclosure of interests in other entities” requires enhanced disclosures of the nature, risks and financial effects associated with the 
Group’s interests in subsidiaries, associates, joint arrangements and unconsolidated structures entities.
 ■ IFRS 13: “Fair value measurements” explains how to measure fair value and aims to enhance fair value disclosures. The standard does not 
change the measurement of fair value but codifies it in one place.
 ■ IAS 27 (Revised): “Separate financial statements” makes revisions to the requirements for separate financial statements prepared by a Parent 
or an investor in a joint venture or associate.
In addition to the above, amendments to a number of standards under the annual improvements project to IFRS have been endorsed by the EU 
but not yet adopted. None of these amendments are expected to have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements.

Financials Notes to the Financial Statements
1. Operating Segments
The Group has two reportable segments, Retail and Car Servicing, which are the Group’s strategic business units. Car Servicing became a 
reporting segment of the Group as a result of the acquisition of Nationwide Autocentres on 17 February 2010. The strategic business units offer 
different products and services, and are managed separately because they require different operational, technological and marketing strategies.
The operations of the Retail reporting segment comprise the retailing of automotive, leisure and cycling products through retail stores. The 
operations of the Car Servicing reporting segment comprise car servicing and repair performed from autocentres.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker is the Executive Directors. Internal management reports for each of the segments are reviewed by the 
Executive Directors on a monthly basis. Key measures used to evaluate performance are Revenue and Operating Profit. Management believes 
that these measures are the most relevant in evaluating the performance of the segment and for making resource allocation decisions.
The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group’s reportable segments. Performance is measured based on segment 
operating profit, as included in the management reports that are reviewed by the Executive Directors. These internal reports are prepared in 
accordance with IFRS accounting policies consistent with these Group Financial Statements.
All material operations of the reportable segments are carried out in the UK and all material non-current assets are located in the UK. The 
Group’s revenue is driven by the consolidation of individual small value transactions and as a result Group revenue is not reliant on a major 
customer or group of customers. All revenue is from external customers.

A non-recurring expense of £7.5m was incurred in 2011. This expense related to the creation of a provision for the potential liabilities arising from lease guarantees provided by Halfords prior 
to July 1989. The guarantees were provided to landlords of properties leased by Payless DIY (now part of Focus DIY) when both Halfords and Payless DIY were under ownership of the Ward 
White Group. Focus DIY entered into administration in May 2011. In the current year the continued settlement of the Group’s guarantor obligations has resulted in a release of £1.0m (2012: 
£1.9m) of the original amounts provided.

Impairment charge in respect of property, plant and equipment where the carrying amount of these assets has been deemed to exceed the recoverable amount.
(d) 
The tax charge of £0.1m represents a tax rate of 24% applied to non-recurring items after adjusting for the non-deductibility of the asset impairment charge and settlements to release 
Halfords from its guarantor obligations under the leases. The prior period represents a tax charge at 26% on all current year non-recurring items plus a prior year tax charge of £0.4m arising 
from the non-deductibility of two payments made to landlords to release Halfords from its guarantor obligations under those leases.

A reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 26% to 25% (effective from 1 April 2012) was substantively enacted on 5 July 2011, and 
further reductions to 24% (effective from 1 April 2012) and 23% (effective from 1 April 2013) were substantively enacted on 26 March 2012 
and 3 July 2012 respectively. This will reduce the Company’s future current tax charge accordingly. The deferred tax asset at 29 March 2013 
has been calculated based on the rate of 23% substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The March 2013 Budget announced that the rate will further reduce to 20% by 2015 in addition to the planned reduction to 21% by 2014 
previously announced in the December 2012 Autumn Statement. It has not yet been possible to quantify the full anticipated effect of the 
announced further 3% rate reduction, although this will further reduce the Company’s future current tax charge and reduce the Company’s 
deferred tax asset accordingly.
In this financial period, the UK corporation tax standard rate was 24% (2012: 26%).
The effective tax rate of 25.7% (2012: 27.3%) differs from the UK corporation tax rate principally due to the non-deductibility of depreciation 
charged on capital expenditure and other permanent differences arising in the period.
The tax charge of £18.3m (2012: £25.7m) includes a charge of £0.1m (2012: £0.9m) in respect of tax on non-recurring items, as detailed 
in note 5.
An Income tax charge of £0.7m (2012: £0.3m) on other comprehensive income relates to the fair value of forward currency contracts 
outstanding at the year end. No other items within other comprehensive income have a tax impact.
The Group engages openly and proactively with tax authorities both in the UK and internationally where the Group trades and sources 
products. The Group’s Tax Policy is reviewed annually by the Board and is shared with HM Revenue & Customs (‘‘HMRC’’). The Group is fully 
committed to complying with all of its tax payment and reporting obligations throughout the business.
 
In FY13 the contribution to the UK Exchequer from both taxes paid and collected exceeded £147.2m with the main taxes including 
corporation tax £16.9m, net VAT £61.8m, PAYE £16.3m, Employees National Insurance Contributions £7.9m, Employers National Insurance 
Contributions £10.1m and Business Rates £34.2m.

In addition, the Directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the financial period ended 29 March 2013 of 9.10p per share (2012: 
14.00p per share), which will absorb an estimated £17.7m (2012: £27.2m) of shareholders’ funds. It will be paid on 2 August 2013 to 
shareholders who are on the register of members on 5 July 2013.
9. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares in issue during the period. The weighted average number of shares excludes shares held by an Employee Benefit Trust (see note 20) 
and has been adjusted for the issue/purchase of shares during the period.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive 
potential ordinary shares. These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price 
of the Company’s ordinary shares during the 52 weeks to 29 March 2013.
The Group has also chosen to present an alternative earnings per share measure, with profit adjusted for non-recurring items because it 
better reflects the Group’s underlying performance.

Included in computer software are internally generated assets of £0.3m (2012: £0.3m). Product rights of £0.2m, which are fully amortised, 
have been included within Brand names and trademarks.
Goodwill of £253.1m (2012: £253.1m) arose on the acquisition of Halfords Holdings Limited by the Company on 31 August 2002 and is 
allocated to the Retail segment. The goodwill relates to a portfolio of sites within the UK which management monitors on an overall basis as a 
group of cash-generating units. Goodwill of £69.7m arose on the acquisition of Nationwide Autocentres on 17 February 2010 and is allocated 
to the Car Servicing segment. The goodwill relates to a portfolio of centres within the UK which management monitors on an overall basis as a 
group of cash-generating units being Car Servicing.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of the Nationwide Autocentres is attributable to (a) future income to be generated from new retail, fleet 
customer contracts and related relationships, (b) the workforce, (c) the value of immaterial other intangible assets and (d) operating synergies.
The recoverable amount of goodwill is determined based on “value-in-use” calculations for each of the two groups of cash-generating units, 
being Retail and Car Servicing. This is the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, 
which is not higher than the Group’s operating segments as reported in note 1. These calculations use cash flow projections based on 
financial budgets approved by management covering a three-year period with growth no higher than past experience and after consideration 
of all available information, incorporating the strategies and risks of each segment.
The key assumptions, to which the group of cash-generating units’ recoverable amounts are most sensitive, used to determine value-in-use 
of goodwill held at 29 March 2013 and 30 March 2012 are as follows:
Retail Car Servicing
Notes 2013 2012 2013 2012
Discount rate 1 8.1% 10.5% 9.0% 10.8%
Growth rate 2 0.0% 0.0% 1.0% 0.0%
Notes:
1 Pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections.
2 Growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the three year budget period.
The Directors are confident that a reasonably possible change in the key assumptions, including a +/- 1.0% change in the discount rate, 
would not cause the carrying amounts to exceed the recoverable amounts.

22.3 14.9
The Group does not have any individually significant customers and so no significant concentration of credit risk.
Based on historic default rates and extensive analysis of the underlying customers’ credit ratings, the Group believes that no impairment 
allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables not past due or past due by up to 30 days.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value. Financial assets in the scope of 
IAS 39 include all trade receivables and £6.2m (2012: £2.7m) of other receivables.

The Central Europe exit provision represents the costs associated with the closure of all seven stores trading in the Czech Republic and 
Poland.
Property related provisions consist of costs associated with vacant property, rent reviews and dilapidations. Also included are prior period 
non-recurring costs (note 5) relating to liabilities in respect of previous assignments of leases where the lessee has entered into administration 
subsequent to the period end. In the current year the continued settlement of the Group’s guarantor obligations has resulted in a release of 
£1.0m (2012: £1.9m) of the original amounts provided.
Other trading provisions comprise a sales returns provision and a provision for the costs associated with the cessation of the stand-alone 
cycle concept, including closure of stores where necessary.
Restructuring provisions
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring either 
has commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating losses are not provided for.
Key assumptions within the Central Europe exit provision were the timing of the exit from leases that were contracted into, the timing of 
redundancies and the extent of dilapidation costs. The sensitivities to these assumptions were not considered material due to the time value 
of money being minimal over the period over which the costs would be incurred.
Property related provisions
A provision for vacant properties is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the 
unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected 
cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Group 
recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract. The main uncertainty is the timing of the amounts payable, and 
the time value of money has been incorporated into the provision amount to take account of this sensitivity.
Provision is also made for loss-making stores and autocentres which management does not expect to become profitable.
A rent review provision is recognised when there are expected to be additional obligations as a result of the rent review, which forms part of 
the Group’s unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the lease contracts. The provision is based on management’s best estimate of 
the rent payable after the review.
Key uncertainties are the estimate of the rent payable after the review has occurred. Sensitivity to this uncertainty is not expected to be 
material to the provision in total.
A dilapidations provision is recognised when there is an expectation of future obligations relating to the maintenance of leasehold properties 
arising from events such as lease renewals or terminations.
Key uncertainties are the estimates of amounts due. Sensitivity to this uncertainty is not expected to be material to the provision in total.

Treasury Policy
The Group’s treasury department’s main responsibilities are to:
 ■ Ensure adequate funding and liquidity for the Group;
 ■ Manage the interest risk of the Group’s debt;
 ■ Invest surplus cash;
 ■ Manage the clearing bank operations of the Group; and
 ■ Manage the foreign exchange risk on its non-sterling cash flows.
Treasury activities are delegated by the Board to the Finance Director (“FD”). The FD controls policy and performance through the line 
management structure to the Group Treasurer and by reference to the Treasury Committee. The Treasury Committee meets quarterly to 
monitor the performance of the Treasury function.
Policies for managing financial risks are governed by Board approved policies and procedures, which are reviewed on an annual basis.
The Group’s debt management policy is to provide an appropriate level of funding to finance the Business Plan over the medium term at a 
competitive cost and ensure flexibility to meet the changing needs of the Group. Details of the Group’s current borrowing facilities are 
contained in note 15.
The key risks that the Group faces from a treasury perspective are as follows:

The Group’s exposure to market risk predominantly relates to interest, currency and commodity risk. These are discussed further below. 
Commodity risk is due to the Group’s products being manufactured from metals and other raw materials, subject to price fluctuation. The 
Group mitigates this risk through negotiating fixed purchase costs or maintaining flexibility over the specification of finished products produced 
by its supply chain to meet fluctuations.

www.halfords.annualreport2013.com Interest Rate Risk
The Group’s policy aims to manage the interest cost of the Group within the constraints of the Business Plan and its financial covenants. The 
Group’s borrowings are currently subject to floating rate interest rates and the Group will continue to monitor movements in the swap market.
If interest rates on floating rate borrowings (i.e. cash and cash equivalents and bank borrowings which attract interest at floating rates) were to 
change by + or – 1% the impact on the results in the Income Statement and equity would be a decrease/increase of £1.0m (2012: £1.2m).
Interest rate movements on deposits, obligations under finance leases, trade payables, trade receivables, and other financial instruments do 
not present a material exposure to the Group’s balance sheet.
Capital Risk Management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns 
for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to 
shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. Between April 2011 and April 2012, the Group managed its capital structure 
partly through a share buy-back scheme.
The Group manages capital by operating within debt ratios. These ratios are lease adjusted net debt to Earnings Before Interest, Tax, 
Depreciation and Amortisation (“EBITDA”) and fixed charge cover. Lease adjusted net debt is calculated as being net debt and leases 
capitalised at eight times, as a multiple of EBITDA plus operating lease charges. Fixed charge cover is calculated as being EBITDA plus 
operating lease charges as a multiple of interest and operating lease charges.
Fair Value Disclosures
The fair values of each class of financial assets and liabilities is the carrying amount, based on the following assumptions:
Trade receivables, trade payables and 
finance lease obligations, short-term 
deposits and borrowings
The fair value approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these 
instruments, using an interest rate of 7.1% for long-term finance lease obligations. 
Long-term borrowings The fair value of bank loans and other loans approximates to the carrying value reported in the 
balance sheet as the majority are floating rate where payments are reset to market rates at 
intervals of less than one year. 
Forward currency contracts The fair value is determined using the market forward rates at the reporting date and the outright 
contract rate.
Fair Value Hierarchy
Financial instruments carried at fair value are required to be measured by reference to the following levels:
 ■ Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
 ■ Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or 
indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
 ■ Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
All financial instruments carried at fair value have been measured by a Level 2 valuation method.
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities are as follows:
2013
£m
2012
£m
Cash and cash equivalents 7.9 13.4
Loans and receivables 22.3 14.9
Forward exchange contracts used for hedging (assets) 1.9 0.3

Trade and other payables — held at amortised cost (121.6) (109.9)
Borrowings at amortised cost (104.0) (141.0)
Finance leases (11.2) (11.5)
Total financial liabilities (236.8) (262.4)
Trade and other payables within the scope of IAS 39 include all trade payables, all other payables and £30.6m (2012: £23.6m) of accruals and 
deferred income.

Credit Risk
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date 
was £32.1m (2012: £28.6m) as detailed in the table above.
Foreign Currency Risk
The Group has a significant transaction exposure with increasing, direct sourced purchases from its suppliers in the Far East, with most of the 
trade being in US dollars. The Group’s policy is to manage the foreign exchange transaction exposures of the business to ensure the actual 
costs do not exceed the budget costs by more than 10% (excluding increases in the base cost of the product).
The Group does not hedge either economic exposure or the translation exposure arising from the profits, assets and liabilities of non-sterling 
businesses whilst they remain immaterial.
During the 52 weeks to 29 March 2013, the foreign exchange management policy was to hedge via forward contract purchase between 75% 
and 80% of the material foreign exchange transaction exposures on a rolling 12-month basis. Hedging is performed through the use of foreign 
currency bank accounts and forward foreign exchange contracts.
The carrying amount of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date is as follows:
29 March 2013 30 March 2012
USD
£m

Group’s derivatives are denominated.

A strengthening/weakening of sterling, as indicated, against the USD at 29 March 2013 would have increased/(decreased) equity and profit or 
loss by the amounts shown above. This analysis is based on foreign currency exchange rate variances that the Group considered to be 
reasonably possible at the end of the reporting period. The analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain 
constant.
There are no material movements in the income statement. The movements in equity relates to the fair value movements on the Group’s 
forward contracts that are used to hedge future stock purchases.
Pension Liability Risk
The Group has no association with any defined-benefit pension scheme and therefore carries no deferred, current or future liabilities in respect 
of such a scheme. The Group operates a number of Group Personal Pension Plans for colleagues.

www.halfords.annualreport2013.com Liquidity Risk
The Group ensures that it has sufficient cash or loan facilities to meet all its commitments when they fall due by ensuring that there is sufficient 
cash or working capital facilities to meet the cash requirements of the Group for the current Business Plan. The minimum liquidity level is 
currently set at £30m, such that under Treasury Policy the maximum drawings would be £270m of the £300m available facility.
The process to manage the risk is to ensure there are contracts in place for key suppliers, detailing the payment terms, and for providers of 
debt, the Group ensured that such counterparties used for credit transactions held at least an “A” credit rating at the time of refinancing 
(November 2010). Ancillary business, in the main, is directed to the five banks within the club banking group. At the year-end four of the banks 
within this group maintained a credit rating of A- or above, in line with Treasury Policy. The counterparty credit risk is reviewed in the Treasury 
report, which is forwarded to the Treasury Committee and the Treasurer reviews credit exposure on a daily basis.
The risk is measured through review of forecast liquidity each month by the Treasurer to determine whether there are sufficient credit facilities 
to meet forecast requirements, and through monitoring covenants on a regular basis to ensure there are no significant breaches, which would 
lead to an “Event of Default”. Calculations are submitted bi-annually to the club bank agent. There have been no breaches of covenants 
during the reported periods.
The contractual maturities of finance leases are disclosed in note 11. All trade and other payables are due within one year.

The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share at 
meetings of the Company. All shares rank equally with regard to the Company’s residual assets.
During the current period the Company’s share capital decreased by 320,000 shares (2012: decreased by 12,602,776 shares). During the 
period the Company repurchased and cancelled 320,000 shares, and no new shares were issued in the period. There has been no significant 
impact on share premium as a result of the share transactions, with share premium remaining at £151.0m (2012: £151.0m).
In total the Company received proceeds of £0.8m (2012: £2.1m) from the exercise of share options.
Interest in Own Shares
At 29 March 2013 the Company held in Trust 4,651,810 (2012: 4,932,009) of its own shares with a nominal value of £46,518 (2012: 
£49,320). The Trust has waived any entitlement to the receipt of dividends in respect of its holding of the Company’s ordinary shares. The 
market value of these shares at 29 March 2013 was £15.0m (2012: £15.4m). In the current period no shares (2012: 5,449,620 shares) were 
repurchased and transferred into the Trust, with 280,199 reissued on exercise of share options.
Translation Reserve
The translation reserve comprises all foreign currency differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations.
Capital Redemption Reserve
The capital redemption reserve has arisen following the purchase by the Company of its own shares and comprises the amount by which the 
distributable profits were reduced on these transactions in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
Hedging Reserve
The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related to 
hedged transactions that have not yet occurred.
21. Share Based Payments
The Group has four share award plans, all of which are equity-settled schemes:
1. Halfords Company Share Option Scheme
The CSOS was introduced in June 2004 and the Company has made annual grants since. Options are granted with a fixed exercise price 
equal to the market price of the shares under option at the date of grant. The contractual life of an option is 10 years.
Options granted will become exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to the achievement of a three year performance 
condition. For grants up to 150% of basic salary the options can only be exercised if the increase in earnings per share (“EPS”) over the period 
is not less than the increase in the Retail Price Index (“RPI”) plus 3.5% per year. In the case of grants in excess of 150% of basic salary, the 
excess can only be exercised in full if the increase is not less than RPI plus 10% per year. Exercise of an option is subject to continued 
employment.
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility of a peer group of companies since the IPO in June 2004. The expected life is the 
average expected period to exercise. The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds.
Options were valued using the Black–Scholes option-pricing models. No performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations.
2. Halfords Sharesave Scheme
The SAYE is open to all employees with eligible employment service. Options may be exercised under the scheme if the option holder 
completes his saving contract for a period of three years and then not more than six months thereafter. Special provisions allow early exercise 
in the case of death, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or because the Company or business which employs the option holder is 
transferred out of the Group, or in the event of a change in control, reconstruction or winding up of the Company.
Options were valued using the Black–Scholes option-pricing models.

Halfords Group plc 
Annual Report & Accounts 2013

www.halfords.annualreport2013.com 3. Performance Share Plan
The introduction of a Performance Share Plan (“PSP”) was approved at the Annual General Meeting in August 2005 awarding the Executive 
Directors and certain senior management conditional rights to receive shares. Annual schemes have been approved for each year from 2005.
The extent to which such rights vest will depend upon the Company’s performance over the three year period following the award date. The 
vesting of 50% of the awards will be determined by the Company’s relative total shareholder return (“TSR”) performance and the vesting of the 
other 50% by the Company’s absolute EPS performance against RPI. The Company’s TSR performance will be measured against the FTSE 
350 general retailers as a comparator group. No retesting will be permitted.
The TSR element of the options granted under the schemes has been valued using a model developed by Deloitte. The Deloitte model uses 
the Group’s share price volatility, the correlation between comparator companies and the vesting schedule attaching to the PSP tranche rather 
than generating a large number of simulations of share price and TSR performance to determine the fair value of the award using a Monte 
Carlo model.
For 2009 awards onwards, the Committee has recommended the reinvestment of dividends earned on award shares, such shares to invest in 
proportion to the vesting of the original award shares. This is in line with best practice as contained in the ABI guidelines on Executive 
remuneration. Following this recommendation the shares awarded in 2010 and 2011 under the Performance Share Plan earned final dividends 
of 14p per share and were reinvested in shares at a cost of £2.13 per share. Shares awarded in 2010, 2011 and 2012 under the PSP earned 
interim dividends of 8p per share and were reinvested in shares at a cost of £3.54 per share.
4. Co-Investment Share Plan
In 2012 the Company adopted the Halfords Group plc 2012 Co-Investment Plan. This plan was adopted for the sole purpose of making a 
one-off award to the Group’s new CEO. No further awards either to the Group’s CEO or other Executives will be made under this plan.
On 4 October 2012 the new CEO purchased 164,056 Halfords Group plc shares at a price of 302.22 pence per share and will be entitled to 
receive Matching Shares equivalent to a maximum of 3.5 times this investment. Subject to continued employment these shares may vest up 
to a third in November 2015, up to two-thirds in November 2016 and in full in November 2017, depending on the following Threshold (30% 
vesting) and Maximum (100% vesting) share price performance by Halfords:
November Threshold Maximum
2015 350p 400p
2016 385p 440p
2017 425p 485p
Matching Shares have been granted in the form of nil cost options, with the participant having until the tenth anniversary of the date of grant 
to exercise the options, and will lapse on a pro rata basis if the required number of Investment Shares is not retained to the final vesting date.
At each relevant vesting date the participant can decide to exercise any portion of the award that has vested based on the performance at 
that time (in which case any unvested shares in that tranche in respect of which the share price target has not been met will lapse) or roll 
forward that tranche in full subject to performance testing at the next vesting date. In the latter case the participant will forfeit the right to 
exercise any awards that had become capable of vesting at the earlier vesting date.
The Participant will be entitled to receive an amount equivalent to the dividends that would have been paid either in cash or on a reinvested 
basis in shares during the period from grant to exercise in respect of the number of Matching Shares that vest.
The Barrier Black–Scholes Model is an adapted Black–Scholes Model and is used to calculate the estimated fair values of the Co-Investment 
Plan Options to include the impact of the share price based performance conditions. Using this method the fair value of the options granted 
has been estimated to be £1.35 per share.
The Group Income Statement charge recognised in respect of share-based payments for the current period is £0.1m (2012: £2.4m).
The following tables reconcile the number of share options outstanding and the weighted average exercise price (WAEP) for all share award 
plans except for the Co-Investment Plan, details of which are covered above.

The accounts of the Company are prepared for the period up to the Friday closest to 31 March each year. Consequently, the financial statements 
for the current period cover the 52 weeks to 29 March 2013, whilst the comparative period covered the 52 weeks to 30 March 2012. The 
accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention, except where Financial Reporting Standards require an alternative treatment in 
accordance with applicable UK accounting standards and specifically in accordance with the accounting policies set out below. 
A consolidated cash flow statement has been included in the Halfords Group plc consolidated accounts. The Company has therefore taken 
advantage of the exemption under FRS 1 (revised 1996) “Cash flow statements” not to produce a cash flow statement.
EBTs are accounted for under UITF 32 and are consolidated on the basis that the Parent has control, thus the assets and liabilities of the EBT are 
included on the Company balance sheet and shares held by the EBT in the Company are presented as a deduction from equity.
The Company has taken the available exemption not to provide disclosures required by FRS 29 “Financial instruments: disclosures”.
Share based Payments
The Company operates a number of equity-settled, share based compensation plans that are awarded to employees of the Company’s subsidiary 
undertakings.
In accordance with UITF Abstract 44 “FRS 20 (IFRS 2) — Group and treasury share transactions” the fair value of the employee services received 
under such schemes is recognised as an expense in the subsidiary undertaking’s financial statements, which benefit from the employee services. 
The Company has recognised the fair value of the share based payments as an increase to equity with a corresponding adjustment to investments.
Fair values are determined using appropriate option pricing models. The total fair value recognised is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for 
which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is 
based on the number of awards that do meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.
At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimates of the number of share incentives that are expected to vest. The impact of the 
revision of original estimates, if any, is recognised as an adjustment to equity, with a corresponding adjustment to investments, over the remaining 
vesting period.
Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at the original cost of the investments. Provision is made against cost where, in the opinion of the 
Directors, the value of the investments has been impaired.
Dividends
Final dividends are recognised in the Company’s financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by shareholders. Interim 
equity dividends are recognised in the period they are paid.

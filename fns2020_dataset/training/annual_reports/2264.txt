Y our board has again fully reviewed and
approved BOC’s strategy , which is being
effectively implemented by T ony Isaac and his
management team.The strategy has seen
BOC confirm its leading position in Asia,
develop a strong base in China and invest
strongly in other growth markets. It has seen 
a continuing commitment to safety and to
improve the efficiency and environmental
performance of our operations. It has 
seen the divestment of underperforming 
businesses allied to a well implemented
acquisition strategy .
Rewarding our shareholders
In 2005 BOC raised its first interim dividend to 15.9p. Combined 
with the second interim dividend of 25.3p, this represents an increase
of three per cent on the previous year as we continue to build 
our dividend cover towards two-times over the medium term.
Y our board has decided to raise the first interim dividend to be 
paid on 1 February 2006 by 2.5 per cent to 16.3p.
I have updated the graphs I have shown here every year since 2001.
They show BOC’s total shareholder return since October 2000
compared with the FTSE100 and our major gases competitors.
We have continued to outperform the FTSE100. Industrial gases
companies have proved to be a rewarding investment over recent
years and in the last year or so we have matched our competitors’
performance, although a gap remains from earlier years. In his 
review,T ony Isaac will explain in more detail how we have 
progressed this year .
Corporate Governance
This year your company has completed its work to comply with 
one new set of requirements, the Combined Code on Corporate
Governance, and has made good progress on two others, namely
changing over to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
and meeting the provisions of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
The quarterly results to be announced in February 2006 will be 
the first in accordance with IFRS.We estimate that meeting the
requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley cost your company some 
£10 million this year .We are likely to spend the same next year 
before the costs reduce somewhat. BOC has to comply with these
provisions because we are registered in the US, but being a complex
and diverse business working globally means that the cost of such
compliance is very high.
Next year we will, in common with all UK companies, publish an
operating and financial review (OFR) as part of our annual report.
The intention of the OFR is to help you, our shareholders, assess our
strategies and the likelihood of their success.
External checks and reporting requirements may help but I believe
the best assurance for shareholders is to ensure high standards of
integrity and transparency throughout the organisation, overseen by 
a strong and independent group of non-executive directors. BOC 
has both of these. It has a strong and well-implemented Code of
Chairman’s statement
Implementing our
strategy effectively Chairman’s statement 05
Conduct and a management team committed to the principles of
accountability , collaboration, transparency and stretch, known in 
BOC as ACTS.
Y our board regularly reviews the management of our social,
environmental and ethical risks.These have now been integrated into
the company’s overall risk management programme. Each year our
performance is judged against criteria set by the UK’s Business in the
Community (BiTC).T o be as transparent as possible we publish on
our website, boc.com, both our comprehensive submission to BiTC
and its independent assessment of our performance.
An important feature of BOC’s corporate responsibility programme
is to enable people at all levels of the organisation to become involved
and support things that matter to them. Our joint giving scheme is an
example.This year countries around the Indian Ocean suffered from
the appalling effects of the tsunami. Our businesses in the countries
affected responded immediately with medical oxygen and with 
other practical help. BOC extended its joint giving scheme to match
two-to-one our employees’ donations to the relief effort for both the
tsunami and hurricane Katrina. BOC again responded when the
Pakistan earthquake struck in October 2005. In total the community
of BOC gave over £570,000 to the tsunami appeal and we await the
final totals for hurricane Katrina and the Pakistan earthquake.
One of our US subsidiaries, along with other companies in the
welding products industry , has been the subject of allegations that
manganese in welding fumes causes Parkinson’s disease or symptoms
similar to Parkinson’s.Again this year there were no adverse jury
verdicts; the only adverse jury verdict was in 2003 and this is the
subject of appeal in the Illinois court system.
Board of Directors
We appointed two new executive directors this year: Kent Masters,
chief executive for Industrial and Special Products, joined the board 
in March, replacing John Walsh who resigned to return to his native
United States; and Alan Ferguson joined in September as Group
finance director in place of René Médori who resigned to take up a
similar role at Anglo American. Rebecca McDonald was appointed 
as a non-executive director in July . Rebecca is president, gas and
power , for BHP Billiton. During the year two non-executive directors
resigned: Iain Napier , following his appointment as deputy chairman of
Imperial T obacco, and Julie Baddeley because of increasing demands
on her time. John Walsh and René Médori each served BOC for
some 20 years, Iain Napier and Julie Baddeley for a somewhat shorter
time, and I would like to thank them all for their contributions.
Every year we review the performance of the board and each
individual director . In alternate years, which included 2005, we 
conduct these reviews with external facilitation.They confirmed that
each director contributes effectively and is committed to his or her
role at BOC.
Thanks
BOC’s 30,000 people around the world provide products and
services that are essential to everyday life. I thank them for their
dedication and professionalism. I thank the customers they serve for
entrusting their business to BOC. I thank all those with whom we
work and in the communities where we operate for their support.
And I thank you, our shareholders, for your continuing support.

BOC
FTSE100 2005 was a year of underlying strong
performance punctuated by events that
challenged and brought out the best in 
BOC and its people.We continue to see an
accelerating rise in energy prices, the move of
manufacturing activity from higher- to lower-
cost economies and relatively slow growth in
an historical context for the semiconductor
industry . Faced with these long-term trends
we have responded by investing for growth
while concentrating on energy efficiency ,
cost containment and high levels of 
customer service.
In the year , the biggest structural change in the Group was the
reduction in our ownership of Afrox hospitals. Elsewhere, among 
the highlights, we continued our penetration of the north American
refinery market with a string of new hydrogen orders, maintained the
pace of our developments in China, and saw BOC Edwards enter
into an important customer relationship in Korea. In contrast, events
such as the Asian tsunami, the London bombings, hurricane Katrina
and most recently the Pakistan earthquake saw BOC businesses
helping where they could, notably with medical gases, and BOC
people giving freely of their time and money .
Against this background BOC produced good results, with turnover
similar to last year at £4,605 million, adjusted operating profit down
three per cent to £564.2 million, adjusted profit before tax down one
per cent at £505.7 million and record adjusted earnings per share of
67.5p. Adjusted figures eliminate exceptional items.Y ear-on-year
comparisons at constant currency show the performance of our
businesses in the markets where they operate without any distortions
from changes in the sterling exchange rate. Our statutory results
include exceptional items and reflect currency movements and on this
basis turnover was similar to last year with operating profit down by
three per cent and profit before tax up by 44 per cent.
Our two gases lines of business, Process Gas Solutions and Industrial
and Special Products, contribute over 80 per cent of Group operating
profit and both of them made good progress. Process Gas Solutions
continues to increase the percentage of its business that comes from
long-term tonnage schemes, with the emphasis recently on winning
hydrogen contracts and building on our strong position in Asia, and
particularly in China.There has been a steady flow of new orders 
with some £500 million of new plant due to enter service over the
next couple of years. Our Process Systems team works closely with
customers to identify and deliver solutions for their industrial gases
needs.This approach has seen us win a disproportionate share of 
the new business available. In China our success has been founded 
on our willingness to enter joint ventures with our key customers,
enabling us to share the risks and rewards of China’s industrial growth.
Our joint venture plant building operation, Linde BOC Process Plants,
gives us reliable and cost-effective plant to fulfil our customers’ needs.
This year Process Gas Solutions grew turnover by 16 per cent and
adjusted operating profit by nine per cent.
Chief executive’s review
06 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 Industrial and Special Products continues to extract value from its
extensive distribution network and its high standards of product
stewardship.The core industrial business continues to evolve as
manufacturing processes change.We now offer a wider range of
products and services to our industrial customers.We have
developed sizeable businesses based on liquefied petroleum gas
(LPG) and in several of our markets we are taking advantage of similar
opportunities for safety products. Our medical business, which serves
hospitals and delivers oxygen therapy to patients in their homes, is
continuing to grow, particularly in Asia.The special products portfolio
is also developing well, serving growth markets with products such 
as helium, packaged chemicals, refrigerants and propellants. Industrial
and Special Products saw turnover decline by four per cent following
the sale of the US packaged gas business last year , while adjusted
operating profit rose by six per cent as profitability improved in 
the US.
BOC Edwards’ core semiconductor market remained broadly stable
without returning to the activity levels seen last year . Despite this,
BOC Edwards continued to improve its market position and
embarked on a restructuring programme to achieve cost savings.
It saw an increase in turnover of two per cent with adjusted operating
profit down 21 per cent.
Gist saw some organic growth from new and existing customers
and towards the end of the year it expanded into Europe 
with the acquisition of  Van Dongen, a temperature-controlled
transport business operating in a number of countries.
In November 2005 it extended until 2011 its contract to
manage the distribution of Marks & Spencer’s chilled and
ambient food.This provides long-term security for a significant
portion of Gist’s business. Gist’s turnover for the year 
rose eight per cent while adjusted operating profit fell by 
two per cent, impacted by higher pension and compliance costs.
In March we disposed of most of our shareholding in Afrox
Healthcare Limited to a consortium led by two major black
empowerment investors. Our African Oxygen Limited subsidiary
retains a 20 per cent interest in the business.We received the disposal
proceeds in March.Afrox Healthcare was a large employer and its
disposal has reduced the number of Group employees by over
10,000.The disposal also had the effect of reducing the Group’s
earnings per share by approximately one penny this year and an
expected further one penny in 2006.
We had another good year for cash generation, helped by the Afrox
Healthcare disposal.With our strong balance sheet we are in a good
position to fund our growth projects, notably the ones already won by
Process Gas Solutions and those still in the pipeline.
Safety remains our number one priority . It is unacceptable that anyone
is hurt in the course of our business and we continue to emphasise
that safety must be 100 per cent of our behaviour , 100 per cent 
of the time.At the start of this report we set out our objectives as a
Group.We intend to outperform our competitors and to do this we
must be the employer of choice for talented people.We are working
hard on all aspects of our business to achieve these objectives.
Three members of the executive management board resigned 
this year . René Médori became group finance director for Anglo
American plc while John Walsh and Rob Lourey returned with their
families to new jobs in their home countries of the United States 
and Australia respectively . I wish all of them success in their new
careers and thank them for their contributions to BOC. Kent Masters
was appointed chief executive, Industrial and Special Products, in
March and James Cullens joined the executive management board in
April as Group human resources director .Alan Ferguson joined us as
Group finance director in September from Inchcape plc.
I thank our employees for their hard work over the past year and for
their continued emphasis on high standards of customer service.
I thank our customers, our shareholders, our suppliers and those with
whom we work on a daily basis. BOC contributes to the economic
life of many countries around the world and I thank you all for helping
us to do so.

Group five  year record 13 Introduction
The BOC Group began its business life over 100 years ago as the Brin’s Oxygen Company.The company was
incorporated in England in 1886 and adopted its present name on 1 March 1982.
A technology to extract oxygen from the air in commercial quantities had just been developed and in 1886
the Brin brothers started production at a factory in Westminster, London.T wo uses had already been found for
oxygen. One was to intensify limelight, which was then used in theatres.The other was to assist patients’ breathing
during and after surgery. New technology was soon developed that allowed air to be separated into all its major
components - nitrogen, oxygen and argon. By 1960, industrial gases were in widespread use and BOC’s business
was firmly established.T onnage plants were supplying steelworks with oxygen and the customer base had been
broadened to extend from metal cutting and welding to food and medicine.The business had also spread 
overseas with subsidiaries or associated companies as far away as Australia and South Africa. During the 1980s,
BOC’s South African subsidiary began to invest in private hospitals.This diversification was the basis of the Afrox
hospitals segment.
BOC acquired the vacuum equipment company Edwards High Vacuum International Limited in 1968 and this
formed the basis of what was to become the BOC Edwards line of business today.
The BOC Distribution Services business (now called Gist) was first established in 1970, initially providing a
chilled food distribution service for Marks & Spencer and relying upon distribution skills and liquid nitrogen chilling
technology, acquired as a result of BOC’s involvement in gases.
In 1978, BOC completed the acquisition of Airco Inc in America, a predominantly gases business that doubled
the Group’s size and brought BOC for the first time into the US gases market. In the period from 1970 to 1990
The BOC Group significantly increased its presence in the Asia/Pacific region through participation in several joint
ventures or associated companies. BOC established strong market positions in Thailand, Indonesia,T aiwan, the
Philippines, China and Korea.
An investment in 1982 gave BOC effective management control of the Japanese gases company Osaka 
Sanso Kogyo KK (OSK). BOC’s holding in OSK was raised to 97 per cent before BOC and Air Liquide merged
their industrial and medical gases businesses in Japan in January 2003. BOC’s subsidiary in Japan has retained a 
45 per cent interest in the joint venture company, which is called Japan Air Gases Ltd.
In the period from 1998 to 2001, BOC increased investments in its gases companies in Thailand, Indonesia 
and the Philippines by acquiring the interests of joint venture partners or minority shareholders.
The BOC Group has an international portfolio of companies operating and reporting as three lines of
business.These are Process Gas Solutions (PGS), Industrial and Special Products (ISP) and BOC Edwards.
In addition two separately managed specialist businesses,Afrox hospitals and Gist, are reported as business
segments. Until a disposal in March 2005, results for Afrox hospitals were fully consolidated. Since then BOC 
has reported its 20 per cent share of this business.
BOC Process Plants was combined with Linde Engineering in the US with effect from September 2002.
BOC retains an interest in the manufacture of industrial gas equipment through its Cryostar business based in
France. Cryostar makes specialist cryogenic pumps and expansion turbines that are used by most manufacturers 
of industrial gas plant. In recent years Cryostar has also developed a strong position in the market for shipboard
compressors and heat exchangers used aboard liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers. Management believes that
Cryostar is the leading manufacturer of its product range worldwide.
The main exports of the Group in 2005 were special products from the UK, helium from the US and vacuum
equipment and semiconductor manufacturing equipment from the UK, the US and Japan.Trade between Group
undertakings is conducted at fair market prices.

The BOC Group contributes to the economies of some 50 countries throughout the world.The UK is the largest
single source of sales revenue for the Group’s products and services, followed by the US. Other major geographic
areas for the Group are Australia, South Africa, Japan and other markets in the Asia/Pacific region.The business
therefore operates from a broad geographical base with local manufacturing in most of the key overseas markets.

companies.
Management organisation
BOC’s management structure is based on three global lines of business and, throughout the period 2003 to 2005,
on two specialist businesses. Each line of business serves a clearly defined type of customer and each pursues its
own strategy for growth and performance at a local level.The organisation is designed to maximise BOC’s global 
as well as local strengths.The lines of business have global responsibility to set strategy and prioritise investment.
They include operational business units and these local units are responsible to the Group chief executive for
delivering financial, safety and operational performance.The business units contribute to the development of the
strategies of the lines of business and customise and implement them in local markets.The business unit heads
collaborate in order to share best practice and to maximise growth and profit opportunities wherever they 
may appear.
Process Gas Solutions (PGS) manages all aspects of BOC’s business with customers requiring bulk supplies of
industrial gases from on-site plants or by pipeline as well as deliveries of liquefied gases.T ypical customers are found
in the oil and chemicals, food and beverage, metals, and glass sectors all round the world. Marketing, business
development and the execution of investments to provide customer specific solutions for the supply of industrial
gases are handled by Process Systems, which forms part of PGS.
Industrial and Special Products (ISP) covers BOC’s business with customers in the fabrication, medical and
leisure sectors as well as the special products and liquefied petroleum gases businesses.
BOC Edwards embraces all aspects of business with semiconductor industry customers worldwide including
the supply of bulk gases and electronic materials, vacuum and abatement technology, chemical management
systems and semiconductor-related services. BOC Edwards also serves general vacuum markets around the world
and manufactures pharmaceutical freeze-drying and packaging machinery.
The segment reported as Afrox hospitals operated through Afrox Healthcare Limited up to the end of March
2005. It owned and managed private hospitals and clinics in southern Africa. BOC’s majority-owned subsidiary,
African Oxygen Limited (Afrox), held 69 per cent of Afrox Healthcare Limited (AHealth) when the company was
sold to a consortium led by two major black economic empowerment investors in March 2005.Afrox has retained
a significant interest in the hospitals business through a 20 per cent holding in the new company.
In 2001, BOC Distribution Services was re-named Gist to reflect the changing nature of its business.
Gist operates as a separate business unit outside the lines of business structure. It remains focused on developing
business with major customers, including Marks & Spencer, and has developed capability in supply chain consultancy
and end-to-end supply chain solutions.
Group profile 15 Corporate development
Over the last three years BOC has continued to invest in its core businesses at the same time as divesting assets
and businesses that were no longer consistent with its strategy.
In October 2002, BOC acquired Environmental Management Corporation (EMC), a privately owned water
services company based in St Louis, Missouri. EMC manages water and wastewater treatment facilities for both
industrial and local municipal customers around the US. EMC forms part of the PGS line of business, which is
expanding the range of solutions offered to its industrial customer base.
BOC and Air Liquide merged their industrial and medical gases businesses in Japan in January 2003 and BOC’s
subsidiary in Japan has retained a 45 per cent interest in the combined company called Japan Air Gases Ltd.
At the end of January 2003, BOC acquired the partial oxidation syngas plant at Clear Lake,T exas, from
Celanese. Under the agreement BOC fulfils a significant proportion of the industrial gas requirements for the
Celanese chemical facility at Clear Lake.
In March 2003 BOC announced an agreement to purchase the Canadian packaged gas and related welding
equipment business of Air Products.The acquisition was completed in April 2003 following approval from the
Canadian regulatory authority.
In June 2003, BOC announced an agreement to obtain half the output of a new helium extraction facility to
be constructed in Qatar. Deliveries from the new source are now scheduled to commence during 2006.
In May 2004 BOC agreed to buy Duke Energy’s 30 per cent ownership interest in the Cantarell joint venture
company for US$59.7 million in cash.This increased BOC’s overall stake to 65 per cent on completion in
September 2004.This company supplies Pemex with nitrogen for the pressurisation of its oilfields in the Gulf 
of Mexico.
BOC completed the disposal of the packaged gas part of its US ISP business to Airgas Inc on 30 July 2004.
The initial consideration received was US$175 million in cash and a final payment of US$20 million that had 
been subject to performance conditions was recognised in 2005.These funds were received in November 2005.
All packaged gases and associated hardgoods were included in the sale.This comprised compressed industrial,
speciality (excluding electronic) and medical gases in the US, sold through BOC retail and distributor channels.
The sale did not include BOC’s bulk liquid helium, bulk medical gases and distributor businesses.
In October 2004, BOC purchased a 50 per cent holding in Asia Union Electronic Chemical Corporation
(AUECC).This acquisition expanded BOC Edwards’ electronic materials offering to include the purification, blending,
packaging and distribution of wet chemicals for flat panel display, semiconductor and solar cell manufacturers
throughout Asia.
In December 2004, BOC sold its shares in Unique Gas and Petrochemicals thereby divesting interests in the
LPG and bulk ammonia businesses in Thailand but the cylinder and aqueous ammonia business was retained.
At the end of January 2005, BOC acquired Calor Gas Limited’s UK aerosol propellants business.This includes
the sales, marketing and distribution of bulk and packaged propane, isobutene and butane blends in the UK.
The acquisition also included Calor’s CARE range of hydrocarbon refrigerants.
The segment reported as Afrox hospitals operated through Afrox Healthcare Limited up to the end of March
2005. It owned and managed private hospitals and clinics in southern Africa. BOC’s majority-owned subsidiary,
African Oxygen Limited (Afrox), held 69 per cent of Afrox Healthcare Limited (AHealth) when the company was
sold to a consortium led by two major black economic empowerment investors in March 2005.Afrox has retained
a significant interest in the hospitals business through a 20 per cent holding in the new company.
In September2005, Gist acquired G Van Dongen Holding BV, a European temperature-controlled transport
operator.The business, which had an annual turnover of some 46 million euros, expands Gist’s existing primary
food business into continental Europe by providing fresh chill and ambient transport services to food
manufacturers in the Netherlands, Spain, Germany, Portugal and France.
Industrial gases
The BOC Group is one of the major producers of industrial gases in the world. Its products include the
atmospheric gases (nitrogen, oxygen and argon) produced by air separation plants as well as hydrogen, carbon
monoxide and syngas (a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide) made by technologies including steam-
reforming or partial oxidation of hydrocarbons.The Group also markets carbon dioxide, helium and liquefied
petroleum gas.These are generally derived as by-products from chemical processes or from natural sources and
are also purchased from other producers. In addition, the Group markets dissolved acetylene and a wide range of
special gases, medical gases, gas mixtures and gaseous chemicals.
Industry structure and consolidationThe industrial gases business is capital-intensive, with increasing demand,
together with economies of scale, leading to the need for large production units and distribution networks.
The need for fixed asset investments, the trend towards global customers and the benefits from the transfer 
of applications technology worldwide have resulted in the business being handled by a relatively small number 
of companies internationally.
One or more of the other major international producers compete in each of the industrial gases markets
served by the Group, and in many of the markets there are smaller local producers as well. International
competitors include Air Liquide, Praxair,Air Products and Chemicals, Linde and Nippon Sanso.The world market
for gases and related products is estimated to be some £25 billion a year.
16 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 Group profile Principal industrial gas products Nitrogen possesses two key characteristics that make it the world’s most widely
used and versatile industrial gas. Nitrogen is almost inert and when liquefied it is intensely cold.This makes liquid
nitrogen a highly effective, versatile and non-polluting agent for freezing and chilling.
Under normal conditions nitrogen is chemically inactive.This makes it an important purging and blanketing gas
in the chemical and refining industry as well as in the electronics industry.
Oxygen, in contrast to nitrogen, is useful for its reactivity. It supports combustion and it supports life.
Oxygen has been used in welding and medicine for over 100 years and in steel production since the 1950s.
Iron and steel producers use oxygen to accelerate melting and to improve metal quality during the refining
process. It is also used by the oil and chemicals industries and many others for a variety of oxidation processes.
Mixed with fuel gases, oxygen provides a heat source for many welding, cutting and metal fabrication processes.
Argon makes up less than one per cent of the atmosphere but it is the most abundant truly inert gas. It is
used to provide a shielding atmosphere in welding, metal fabrication, aluminium processing, microelectronics, glass
coating, advanced ceramics and other industrial processes. It is also used in the steel industry, principally in the
production of stainless steel.
Hydrogen is typically produced by steam reforming or partial oxidation of natural gas, petroleum gas, or liquid
or solid hydrocarbon feedstocks. Hydrogen may also be recovered from by-products purchased by BOC from
external suppliers. Hydrogen is used primarily in the oil and chemicals industries for applications aimed at upgrading
crude oil through hydrocracking to form lighter fractions and to remove sulphur in the production of cleaner fuels.
The chemicals industry also uses hydrogen where it is required as an active ingredient in many large-scale
processes.
Helium is extracted from natural gas deposits. Only a few sources in the world contain a sufficient proportion
of helium to justify its separation.The Group’s supplies now come from the US, Poland and Russia and are secured
by long-term contracts. In June 2003, BOC announced an agreement to obtain half the output from a new helium
extraction facility to be constructed in Qatar. Deliveries from this new source are now expected to begin in 2006.
Due to its high value, helium is the only major industrial gas to be extensively traded internationally. Helium is used
in welding, leak detection, hospital MRI scanners and in the production of optical fibres. Helium gas mixtures are
used in balloons.
Carbon dioxide supplied by BOC is obtained as a by-product from other companies’ manufacturing
processes, from natural sources or recovered in the generation process for hydrogen or syngas and put to
constructive use. Solid carbon dioxide is, like liquid nitrogen, used for chilling and freezing in the food industry.
As a gas it is used to carbonate and dispense beverages of all kinds.
Acetylene is normally supplied in cylinders and used together with oxygen in metal cutting and welding
applications. BOC is a major manufacturer of dissolved acetylene.
Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is a fuel gas with a wide variety of domestic, industrial and transport
applications. BOC is a major distributor of LPG in South Africa, and its joint venture company Elgas Limited is a
major distributor in Australia. BOC has smaller market positions in several other countries.
Production of industrial gases Oxygen was first extracted from the atmosphere by a chemical process.This was
superseded over 80 years ago by the cryogenic (low temperature) process involving the liquefaction and distillation
of air.The cryogenic process is still by far the most widely used, but non-cryogenic techniques (pressure swing
adsorption and membrane diffusion), which were first developed during the 1970s, are becoming increasingly
significant for smaller or less demanding on-site applications.
Cryogenic air separation is a mature and stable technology, although incremental technical advances are still
yielding improvements in capital cost, operating cost, ease of operation and reliability.The only significant ‘raw
material’, apart from the air itself, is electricity, which is used in large quantities to drive compressors, pumps and
other equipment.The production process in modern air separation plants is highly automated, and remote
operation of BOC’s plants from control centres is becoming increasingly common.
The production of hydrogen and syngas uses steam reforming or partial oxidation of hydrocarbon feedstocks
such as natural gas, petroleum or coal to separate the hydrogen and carbon compounds.The choice of feedstock is
related to their prices in local markets.
Distribution of industrial gases Industrial gases may be supplied to customers in a variety of ways; through
pipelines from on-site or nearby cryogenic or non-cryogenic plants, by deliveries of liquefied gases in road or rail
tankers, in portable cryogenic containers or in cylinders (also called compressed or packaged gases).
Distribution is an important competitive factor in the industrial gases business and the methods of distribution
vary according to the nature of the products themselves and the customer’s volume requirements. Most gases
have to be stored and distributed either under great pressure, which requires them to be carried in heavy and
bulky cylinders, or at extremely low temperatures in specially insulated tankers, which limits how far they can be
transported before carriage costs become unacceptable. Pipeline delivery involves high capital costs and the
routing is inflexible.As a result, there is little international trade in industrial gases. Production has to occur in or near
the market being served and there is a trend towards production at customers’ own sites.
Business segments
The BOC Group reports financial results for the three lines of business and for Afrox hospitals and Gist separately.
Group profile 17 Process Gas Solutions (PGS)
This line of business covers BOC’s business with larger-scale industrial customers worldwide, typically in the oil and
chemicals, food and beverage, metals, and glass sectors. Gases and services are supplied as part of customer-specific
solutions that create the most value for customers at the lowest cost to BOC.These range from supply by pipeline
or from dedicated on-site plants to the largest users, to supply by road tanker in liquefied form to others.
T onnage (pipeline) customers are usually supplied on the basis of long-term contracts, typically containing a
fixed facility charge together with a variable charge for product supplied in excess of a set minimum quantity.
Revenues from these contracts thus have a measure of stability with respect to changes in demand for product.
T onnage plants are often built to produce merchant gases in addition to those required by the tonnage customer
and these gases can be sold to other customers.The BOC Group has substantial positions in the tonnage markets
of the UK, the US,Australia, South Africa and Asia as well as in some smaller markets.The products supplied to
tonnage customers have traditionally been the atmospheric gases oxygen, nitrogen and argon. More recently,
hydrogen and syngas are becoming significant tonnage products as are associated utilities including steam 
and power.
The delivery of liquefied gases by road or rail to the customer’s site is normally limited by transport costs to a
radius of about 200 miles. Product for this market is supplied either from merchant plants or from tonnage plants
incorporating liquefiers. Larger users are typically supplied with product in liquid form delivered in cryogenic tankers
into special storage vessels installed at customer premises.T ankers and vessels are often BOC Group owned.
Liquefied gases are usually supplied on the basis of contracts with terms of one to five years. Revenues are generally
based upon the actual quantity of gas consumed, with an additional fixed charge for the use of storage equipment.
The growth of sales and profit in this line of business is driven by investment in new production facilities. Such
investment is predominantly the result of opportunities to satisfy long-term supply contracts with one or more
heavy industrial customers for each plant.
Marketing, business development and the execution of investments to provide customer-specific solutions for
the supply of industrial gases are handled by Process Systems, which forms part of PGS.
Business development In October 2002, BOC acquired Environmental Management Corporation (EMC), a
privately owned water services company based in St Louis, Missouri. EMC manages water and wastewater
treatment facilities for both industrial and local municipal customers around the US. EMC’s management services
extend to steam systems, cold and chilled water systems and wastewater treatment. Customers include small to
medium-sized municipalities and industrial customers, many of which are in the food sector. EMC forms part of the
PGS line of business and BOC’s strategy is to expand the range of solutions offered to its industrial customer base.
At the end of January 2003, BOC acquired the partial oxidation syngas plant at Clear Lake,T exas, from
Celanese. Under the agreement BOC fulfils a significant proportion of the industrial gas requirements for the
Celanese chemical facility at Clear Lake.The Celanese facility is located on the Houston ship canal, and includes a
world scale vinyl acetate monomer plant and the world’s largest acetic acid plant.These require large quantities of
oxygen and nitrogen as well as carbon monoxide.
A new hydrogen and carbon monoxide (HyCO) plant supplying the Thai Polycarbonate Company for the
manufacture of plastic resins began production in 2003.
In October 2003, BOC commissioned a new hydrogen plant supplying Citgo’s oil refinery at Lemont, Illinois.
The hydrogen is used in the removal of sulphur to produce clean fuels.
In the same month BOC, and its joint venture partners, announced plans to invest over US$100 million in
developing three schemes in China, at T aiyuan, Suzhou and in the Pearl River region.
BOC-TISCO, the joint venture between BOC Gases and T aiyuan Iron and Steel Corporation (TISCO), has
under construction two new air separation units (ASUs) to supply 1,400 tonnes a day of oxygen each to TISCO’s
plant in Shanxi province in north-central China.The new ASUs represent an investment of US$82 million and they
are scheduled to begin coming on stream during 2006.This investment is in response to strong demand for
stainless steel in China and will support TISCO’s vigorous expansion plans.
Pearl River Gases (PRG), a joint venture between Guangzhou Iron & Steel (GIS) and BOC’s joint venture,
Hong Kong Oxygen, invested in two further ASU’s during 2005.These add some 400 tonnes a day of oxygen
capacity to support the expansion of steelmaking in southern China.
Also in 2005, BOC’s wholly owned subsidiaries in Suzhou constructed new on-site supply scheme pipelines to
meet increasing demand for industrial gases from key customers in Suzhou Industrial Park and the Suzhou New
District Industrial Park.
A new hydrogen plant to supply both a Sunoco refinery, and a nearby BP refinery is under construction at
T oledo, Ohio.The hydrogen will be used by both BP and Sunoco in the production of ultra-low sulphur gasoline
and diesel fuels.The complex will be capable of supplying over 120 million standard cubic feet a day of hydrogen.
BOC’s partner for engineering and construction is Linde BOC Process Plants of T ulsa, Oklahoma. BOC is investing
more than US$100 million in the facility.
In May 2004 BOC agreed to buy Duke Energy’s 30 per cent ownership interest in the Cantarell joint venture
company for US$59.7 million in cash.This increased BOC’s overall stake to 65 per cent on completion in
September 2004.This company supplies Pemex with nitrogen for the pressurisation of its oilfields in the Gulf 
of Mexico.
In December 2004, BOC announced a new, 20-year agreement to supply an additional 300 million standard
cubic feet a day (scf/d) of nitrogen to be used at the Cantarell and Ku Maalob Zaap oil fields.The additional supply
will lift the total nitrogen output by 25 per cent to 1.5 billion scf/d at the site. Construction of a fifth production
module has commenced and the new facility is scheduled to begin production in 2007.
18 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 Group profile In China, significant new business was won in the chemical sector. BOC has agreed to form a joint venture with the
Sinopec Shanghai Petrochemical Company (SPC) at Jinshan, near the Caojing chemical complex, to invest in
existing assets and then add further air separation capacity to satisfy the industrial gases requirements of SPC in the
region.This follows the establishment in 2003 of a similar joint venture with Sinopec YPC to supply the Sinopec and
BASF joint venture petrochemical complex at Nanjing.
BOC’s subsidiary in Thailand is investing in a venture establishing a 1,300 tonnes-a-day plant to supply TOC
Glycol Co. Ltd. (TOCGC) in Map T a Phut and to increase merchant capacity in the area.When completed in 2006,
this will be the largest air separation unit in Thailand. It will be owned and operated by a joint venture between
BOC’s Thai subsidiary,TIG, and Bangkok Industrial Gas Company.
In January 2005 BOC formed a joint venture with Maanshan Iron & Steel Company (Ma Steel) to invest
initially in the construction of two large air separation units. Each will be capable of supplying 1,400 tonnes a day of
oxygen to meet the growing needs of Ma Steel in Maanshan City, China.T otal production of oxygen, nitrogen and
argon is expected to total some 5,000 tonnes a day when commissioned during 2007.
At the same time BOC India Ltd announced that it had been awarded a contract to supply gases
requirements of approximately 1,400 tonnes a day for an expansion programme by Jindal Vijaynagar Steel Limited
at Bellary in southern India.A plant with an oxygen capacity of 855 tonnes a day will be constructed and is
expected to be commissioned in 2006.
In April 2005, BOC agreed to invest approximately US$40 million in equipment and pipelines in order to
supply hydrogen to Valero’s 170,000 barrel a day refinery at Lima, Ohio and to supply other customers in the area.
Construction of the plant has begun and it is expected to start supplying hydrogen during 2006.
In June 2005, BOC announced further refinery hydrogen business in the US with the proposed investment of
nearly US$50 million at Salt Lake City to supply Chevron and Holly Corporation’s Utah subsidiary with hydrogen
for cleaner fuels production at their refineries.The refiners are upgrading their facilities in accordance with the US
Environmental Protection Agency’s lower-sulphur requirements for gasoline and diesel fuels.
Chevron is installing additional hydrotreating capacity at its 49,000 barrel per day (bpd) refinery and will take
hydrogen and steam from BOC’s plant, which will be located on the Chevron site. Holly will also receive hydrogen
for new hydrotreating capacity at its nearby 26,000 bpd Woods Cross refinery through a five-mile pipeline
connection from the BOC facility.
Construction of the hydrogen plant has started and production is expected to begin in 2006.
Industrial and Special Products (ISP) 
Gases for cutting and welding, hospitality, laboratory applications and a variety of medical purposes are mainly
distributed under pressure in cylinders.The ISP line of business covers products and services provided to this
section of the market together with sales of packaged chemicals and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Customers are
typically in the fabrication, engineering, automotive, refrigeration, hospitality or medical sectors.The customer base is
therefore broad and varied.The number of separate customers served by ISP is much greater than the other two
lines of business and the quality of service is often the key factor in securing existing or obtaining new customers. In
order to raise service standards at the same time as reducing costs, national customer service centres have been
successfully established in all the major markets.
In addition to supplying gases, BOC also supplies a range of associated equipment in many of its major
markets.This includes cutting and welding products and, in some markets, associated safety equipment.
BOC has devoted considerable attention over the last few years to understand the requirements of 
different types of customer in its major markets and to provide the required service at an appropriate price.
Such customer segmentation programmes have been implemented in the UK, South Africa,Australia,Asia, Latin
America and are in progress elsewhere.
The cutting and welding applications are a relatively mature part of the industrial gases business and growth
opportunities are principally in other segments of the market such as medical applications, safety products,
packaged chemicals, hospitality and services. BOC is pursuing these opportunities by the development of new
products, packages and services as well as by marketing initiatives to take advantage of BOC’s global capabilities by
introducing existing products to new regions. Electronic commerce has also become an important tool for
sustaining and growing sales by making it easier for customers to manage their business with BOC as a supplier.
BOC is a leading supplier of helium and has liquid helium distribution centres, or transfills, in many markets
around the world.With 48 helium transfills in its global network, management believes that this is the largest of its
kind. Helium has a broad range of applications, including welding and the refrigeration of medical scanner magnets,
and is vital to the production of optical fibres, semiconductors and special alloys. It is also used for leak detection,
underwater breathing mixtures and lifting.
Business development In April 2002, BOC acquired Matheson Gas Products Canada Inc, one of Canada’s leading
providers of special gases and equipment. Unique Gas and Petrochemicals Public Company Limited (UGP), a
leading distributor of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and ammonia in Thailand, was acquired in May 2002. BOC’s
associated company in Malaysia acquired 35.6 per cent of the gases company Nissan Industrial Oxygen Inc (NIOI)
in March 2002 and, following a tender offer, increased its holding to 100 per cent in September 2002.At the end of
August 2002, BOC announced an agreement to purchase Praxair’s Polish gases business.The transaction was
completed in January 2003 following approval by the Polish competition authority.The business acquired includes a
high proportion of ISP sales.
Since 2002, BOC has continued its global roll-out of a light-weight medical cylinder with an integrated valve
and regulator for homecare patients and emergency services. Heliox, a helium and oxygen mixture formulated to
ease the respiratory effort associated with airway obstruction, was launched in the UK and in some other markets.
Group profile 19 Capacity at BOC’s Otis, Kansas, helium plant was expanded in 2002 to match market demands. In addition, BOC
has access to helium produced by other US plants, as well as to product from Poland and Russia. In 2003 BOC and
KRIO, a division of the Polish Oil and Gas Company, entered into a new helium supply agreement. BOC will
purchase for export all of KRIO’s helium that is not sold to its domestic customers in Poland. BOC has been
KRIO’s sole customer for bulk liquid helium since the original agreement was signed in 1972. In June 2003, BOC
announced an agreement to obtain half the output from a new helium extraction facility to be constructed in
Qatar. Deliveries from this new source are now expected to begin in 2006.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems use liquid helium to cool superconducting magnets. BOC provides
helium as well as a liquid nitrogen filling service to meet MRI operators’ total requirements. In 2002, ISP signed a
major helium supply scheme with Oxford Magnet T echnology (now Siemens) in the UK.
BOC continued to invest in refrigerant filling facilities and in 2003 new filling facilities were installed in Hong
Kong, Malaysia and the Philippines. Each of these was built to a standardised global design. BOC now supplies
refrigerants in 19 countries compared with six countries in 1999. In June 2003, BOC announced a global alliance
with Hudson T echnologies to promote technology for cleaning and recycling used refrigerants.
Significant progress in developing web-based customer portals has been made.Amongst others, ISP has
launched customer portals in the UK,Australia and New Zealand.Thousands of customers are now able to access
detailed material on BOC’s product service offers, manage and settle their accounts and place orders on-line.
BOC acquired the Canadian packaged gas and related welding equipment business of Air Products in 
April 2003.
BOC completed the disposal of the packaged gas part of its US ISP business to Airgas Inc on 30 July 2004.
The initial consideration was US$175 million in cash and a final payment of US$20 million that had been subject to
performance conditions was received in November 2005.All packaged gases and associated hardgoods were
included in the sale.This comprised compressed industrial, speciality (excluding electronic) and medical gases in the
US, sold through BOC retail and distributor channels.The sale did not include BOC’s bulk liquid helium, bulk
medical gases and distributor businesses.
In December 2004 BOC sold its shares in Unique Gas and Petrochemicals, thereby divesting interests in the
LPG and bulk ammonia businesses in Thailand but the cylinder and aqueous ammonia business was retained.
In January 2005, BOC acquired Calor’s aerosol propellants business in the UK.This includes sales and
distribution of bulk and packaged hydrocarbon blends together with Calor’s CARE hydrocarbon refrigerants range
and propylene business.
In March 2005, BOC announced plans to build a new liquid plant to extract helium from a natural gas supply
at Darwin,Australia.When it begins production in 2007, it will be the only helium production plant in Australia, and
will serve not only domestic Australian demand but also customers in New Zealand and Asia.
BOC Edwards
This line of business specialises in gases, services and equipment for the semiconductor industry as well as vacuum
products for a range of other industries.The major markets for BOC Edwards’ products are in Asia, north America
and Europe. Until September 2005 it was organised into four customer-facing divisions for sales and marketing in
Asia/Pacific, Japan, the US and Europe and into four manufacturing divisions,Vacuum and Exhaust Management,
Chemical Management, Bulk Gases and Electronic Materials. Kachina (semiconductor process tool component
management service), Coating T echnology and Pharmaceutical Systems were managed separately. BOC Edwards is
now organized around five global business units, Electronic Materials, Electronic Bulk Gases, Semiconductor
Equipment, General Vacuum Equipment and Pharmaceutical Systems.
Management believes that BOC Edwards has a unique position as a fully integrated supplier of gases, vacuum,
chemical, slurry and exhaust management products, as well as services to the global semiconductor industry and is
a leader in the design and manufacture of vacuum pumps, instrumentation and systems for both general vacuum
and semiconductor applications and of freeze-drying systems for the pharmaceutical industry.
The vacuum and exhaust product ranges are manufactured or assembled primarily in the UK, with additional
manufacturing and assembly in the US, Japan, Korea,China and Brazil.They include vacuum pumps, coating systems,
exhaust management systems, temperature control systems and heat exchangers, instrumentation and controls,
vacuum accessories and leak-detection equipment.The range also includes specially designed systems for specific
applications, depending on customer requirements.
BOC Edwards also specialises in the design, manufacture and installation of the systems used to deliver liquid
process chemicals, including planarisation slurries to the point of use within semiconductor fabrication facilities.
Manufacture of these products is located mainly in the US.
In addition to the semiconductor industry, the leading customers are in the chemicals, scientific instruments
and other industries, as well as in educational and research establishments. General vacuum products are sold to
such customers by a separate sales force.
BOC Edwards’ service facilities, including plants for cleaning semiconductor process tool parts, are located
near concentrations of semiconductor fabrication facilities around the world.
T echnology is important to maintain a competitive edge in this business, and considerable resources are
committed to enable the business to address new applications and markets.The major research centres are in the
UK, north America and Japan.
The Group’s vacuum products are sold directly by Group companies to end-users and also through
distributors and agents. Management believes that the Group is a leading manufacturer of the types of vacuum
products that it makes and provides.The business is highly competitive, with product design and quality, leading to
the lowest cost of ownership, being very significant factors.
20 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 Group profile Sales opportunities for much of BOC Edwards’ semiconductor equipment business are dependent upon capital
investment by the semiconductor industry. Management believes that semiconductor production remains on a
long-term growth trend but capital investment by semiconductor manufacturers has been subject to sharp
variations for a number of reasons, some of which arise from advances in technology.
The products of BOC Edwards Pharmaceutical Systems are tailored specifically to individual customer
requirements in the pharmaceutical industry and are used mainly for injectable products. Freeze-drying systems are
made in T onawanda, New Y ork, US. Filling, sterilising and packaging lines for the pharmaceutical industry are made at
Dongen in the Netherlands and Beijing in China.
Business developmentThroughout the period 2003 to 2005, new ranges of dry pumps for the semiconductor
industry were introduced as well as a comprehensive new range of exhaust management products.These new
products meet the needs of 300mm wafer and flat panel manufacturing facilities.
In 2004 a new range of high-speed iGX pumps were introduced, offering attractive features for
semiconductor applications such as small size, reduced power consumption and lower lifetime costs.
The range of exhaust management products was also expanded with new burners, wet scrubbers and an
advanced plasma-based system for the destruction of reaction products without the use of methane fuel.
Production of nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) gas for the semiconductor industry was started at a plant in South
Africa during 2000 and production capacity was further increased during 2003.This product is an important
etchant that is also used for in-position cleaning of semiconductor process equipment.
On-site fluorine generators were installed at a number of semiconductor and flat panel display manufacturing
facilities during 2004 and a fab-wide pilot programme at LG Philips in Korea was extended during 2005.
BOC Edwards’ range of electronic materials in Asia was expanded in October 2004 with the addition of 
ultra-pure wet chemicals through a partnership with Asia Union Electronic Chemical Corporation (AUECC) 
and through that company with Huayi, a chemical manufacturer in China.
Afrox hospitals
African Oxygen Limited (Afrox) sold its 69 per cent controlling interest in its hospitals business (Afrox Healthcare
Limited) to a consortium led by two major black economic empowerment investors in March 2005.Afrox has
retained a significant interest in the hospitals business through a 20 per cent holding in the new company.
In the period 2003 to 2004 and in 2005 prior to the disposal,Afrox Healthcare Limited owned 60 hospitals
and clinics and had a minority interest in a further seven hospitals managed by others. It also managed the Lifecare
group of chronic-care hospitals. In addition to hospitals and clinics, which were the core business,Afrox Healthcare
Limited also included Afrox Healthcare Services, which facilitated a direct medicines service for chronic medication,
and provided occupational health services, nursing training and laboratory services.
Gist
Gist is a provider of specialist supply chain solutions.The name Gist was adopted during 2001 to reflect both the
continuing focus on supply chain operations and an increased emphasis on supply chain consulting, end-to-end
supply chain solutions and logistics support to e-fulfilment opportunities.This realignment of the business followed a
planned withdrawal from most non-Marks & Spencer primary temperature controlled operations in the period
1999 to 2000.
High quality supply chain operations remain at the core of the business. Gist manages a range of supply chains
on behalf of retailers, mainly in the UK, as well as some overseas. For over 30 years Gist has been the largest supply
chain provider for Marks & Spencer. Gist currently handles all of its UK food distribution and the consolidation and
dispatch of all overseas shipments to subsidiaries and franchised operations.
During 2003, Gist ceased to operate general merchandise logistics and garment stockholding operations on
behalf of Marks & Spencer.
Gist has provided supply chain consultancy services to major supermarket and catalogue retailers in the UK
and demonstrated its capabilities in managing international supply chains. In addition an on-line wholesaling
operation has extended the range of Gist’s skills offered externally.
During September 2005, Gist expanded its primary business in continental Europe with the acquisition of 
G Van Dongen Holding BV, a temperature-controlled transport operator based in the Netherlands and Spain.
This is to provide chilled and ambient transport to food manufacturers in the Netherlands, Spain, Germany,
Portugal and France, and adds to Gist’s existing operations in the Czech Republic and the Netherlands.
Group profile 21 The BOC Group has an annual planning cycle culminating in a board review, typically held in March each year.
The strategy is aligned with the Group objectives, published in 2004, which are:‘Over a sustained period,
consistently to outperform our peers in terms of safety, customer service, revenue growth, earnings and 
cash generation.We will be the employer of choice for all existing and future employees’.
Since 2000, the main components of the strategy have been:
• T o establish a leading position for BOC in growth markets: BOC has continued to invest in production and
infrastructure facilities in the growth markets of Asia in general and China in particular. It has also expanded by
acquisition, notably adding to its gases businesses in Poland and Canada and increasing BOC Edwards’ range
with the turbomolecular pump business of Seiko Instruments. Each line of business additionally has its own
growth strategies; in Process Gas Solutions the emphasis has been on increasing the percentage of tonnage
business, particularly in the refining and chemicals sectors.
• T o improve the return on capital employed: BOC has actively pursued opportunities to improve or divest
underperforming assets resulting in, amongst others: the formation of Linde BOC Process Plants LLC in the
US; the combination of OSK with part of Air Liquide Japan to form Japan Air Gases; and the sale of the US
packaged gas business.
• T o improve business and operational efficiency: BOC has sponsored cost reduction and improved efficiency
programmes across all of its operating entities.
• T o maximise the benefits of BOC’s operating model: BOC’s structure of lines of business and business units
allows global strategies to be implemented successfully while enabling local response to be tailored to local
market needs.The operating model has now been extended to all parts of the world, with Asia being the
most recent.
• T o recruit, retain and develop the best people: BOC has developed a wide range of people programmes to
ensure it has the calibre and quantity of people needed to implement its growth strategy successfully.
The components of the strategy are referred to elsewhere in this annual report, notably in the sections on
employees, operating review and financial review.
Strategy
22 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 23
At 30 September 2005 the Group had 30,572 employees (2004: 43,383 employees, 2003: 44,507 employees).
During the year the disposal of the Afrox Healthcare business resulted in the successful transfer of over 13,000
employees to the new owner. Employees of the company and its subsidiaries were located as follows:
Europe 13,408
Americas 6,216
Africa 3,541
Asia/Pacific 7,407
Unplanned employee turnover remains low and as a result, excluding disposals, the employee base remains stable.
BOC invests time and energy in developing the potential of its people. Opportunities are reviewed and discussed
with identified individuals to provide cross-line of business experience or to set up a range of functional and
geographical assignments.This contributes to BOC's success in retaining and developing the core skills and
capabilities it needs to meet its business, customer service and health and safety targets. BOC regularly reviews its
succession planning processes and the availability of essential capabilities. Results show it has solid capability in most
areas and adequate succession depth to meet both its technical and leadership requirements.
Employee satisfaction and commitment
Employee satisfaction is measured and managed both centrally and in the business units.
Levels of employee satisfaction and commitment are generally high.A culture of accountability, collaboration,
transparency and stretch, known as ACTS, has been developed throughout BOC.The ACTS principles provide a
framework that employees can use in their dealings with each other and with customers, suppliers and other
stakeholders.
The ‘Voice of BOC’ employee survey was conducted again in 2005.The survey, managed by an independent
research company, is an opportunity for BOC’s people to rate the Group’s performance on key issues affecting
their employment. 68 per cent of employees responded to the survey.This high participation rate demonstrates
employees’ willingness to contribute to BOC’s aim of being the employer of choice.The 2005 survey built on the
employee perception data collated in 2002 regarding ACTS, customer orientation, performance management and
diversity. It also incorporated new measures on safety and the Code of Conduct.The areas where BOC employees
deemed performance to be particularly high or improved since 2002 were safety, management interest in
employee well being, the Code of Conduct, performance reviews, collaboration and diversity.The areas deemed 
to need further improvement were customer focus, which is still a core strength but slightly down on 2002, and
employee engagement, which remained at a high level but was lower than in 2002.As with previous surveys,
business units and enabling functions are developing and implementing action plans to address the results and
progress will be reviewed on a regular basis.
Employment policies and Code of Conduct
The BOC Group takes its responsibilities as a global organisation seriously. It is committed to fostering a workplace
that is safe and environmentally sound. It will always act in line with all applicable laws, regulations and industry
standards. It expects people to respect confidential information and company time and assets. It believes in open
and honest communication, fair treatment and equal opportunities. It opposes public corruption, anti-competitive
behaviour and insider trading, and it supports the fundamental principles of good governance and human rights.
In 2003 BOC launched a global Code of Conduct, a set of legal and ethical standards that apply to all BOC
employees and to contractors in their business dealings with BOC. The code is available in ten languages.
An extensive programme of communications and workshops has provided training for employees on the
substance of the code. Annual sustainability plans embed the code within the businesses and keep it visible,
accessible and relevant to all employees. In 2004, a new network of code sustainability managers was formed to
ensure that processes are in place to induct new employees, to provide refresher training and to consolidate
country-specific policies.The Code of Conduct telephone helpline has been extended to cover 49 countries and
promotional material has been created to publicise the contact number in each country. BOC operates a strict
policy of non-retaliation to protect and encourage people wishing to share their concerns.
BOC’s employee policies and procedures are aligned with the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
BOC is a signatory to the UN Global Compact, whose ten principles - six of which relate to human rights and
labour standards - are integrated into BOC’s Code of Conduct. In many areas BOC’s existing standards exceed
those set out in the Global Compact. In 2005, BOC reported progress to the Global Compact Office, according to
official guidelines.
In addition to the Code of Conduct, BOC provides guidance and human resources policies to support BOC
people in their day-to-day activities and long-term career planning.These are aligned to the corporate values and
principles.At the heart of this approach is the recognition that the energy and application of individuals and teams
throughout the organisation will determine which companies have competitive advantage in today’s complex global
market. BOC’s employment policies are designed to underpin the Group’s operating requirements and growth
strategies.The human resources units implementing these policies are aligned to the business units in each
geography and, as far as practicable, Group policies are adapted to meet local requirements.
Employees 24 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 Employees
Communication and involvement
BOC places a high priority on two-way communications with its people.The primary communication channels are
within the business units, where local managers work with their people and two-way communication is most
achievable.The Group also uses a number of formal and informal communication channels to share information
and to shape behaviour. In addition to traditional media such as videos, magazines, newsletters and briefing packs,
BOC has continued to invest in e-mail and web-based communications technologies to ensure that consistent and
coherent messages are conveyed speedily to its people around the world.
The Group actively searches for ways to involve employees in shaping the future.T eams meet to review or
jointly create processes, systems or strategies.A variety of employee structures exist for these purposes, including
peer groups, special interest groups, teams of excellence and quality teams. Multi-disciplinary and cross-geographic
groups of employees regularly meet, either face-to-face, or by using tele-, video- and web-based meeting
technologies which have been installed for these purposes.
Resourcing,training and development
Resourcing, training and development programmes are designed to ensure that the Group has a pool of 
well-qualified, gifted individuals able to meet day-to-day operational needs and plans for the future. BOC conducts a
robust annual process to assess the strengths and weaknesses of its units. It is committed to provide its people with
opportunities to develop and grow, but also to bring new blood into the organisation through targeted external
recruitment.A global, web-based recruiting platform is in place to supplement other recruitment channels.
BOC continued to place great emphasis on personal and career development over the past year. Employees
are encouraged to be proactive about their future careers and development opportunities.The aim is for all
employees to have regular discussions with their managers regarding their aspirations, prospects and development
needs.These result in the formulation of an individual development plan, which is an agreed course of action to
meet employees’ needs as well as the needs of the organisation. BOC offers many opportunities for career and
personal development. Employee development takes the form of on-the-job coaching and training, development
projects, secondments, e-learning, as well as more traditional classroom-based training.
In addition to the development that takes place to achieve current job effectiveness of all employees, high
potential employees are identified and developed with future roles in mind.The Lead programme is an ambitious
executive development programme for high potential senior managers, facilitated by world class external providers
as well as senior BOC executives. It is customised for BOC and is comprehensive in its scope.The programme
offers a tailored curriculum and is designed to equip the participants with the broad range of skills and experiences
they will need to be successful leaders within the Group.T o date, some 150 senior managers have participated in
Lead programmes.A parallel leadership development programme, iLead, has been developed for high 
potential middle managers and is run regionally around the world. Lead and iLead augment many other
management development initiatives, which are provided to all BOC’s supervisors and managers. International
assignments are used to develop high potential executives and to create opportunities within local management
teams.The success of such programmes are reviewed regularly with business unit heads as part of their
performance contracts.
BOC believes that how its employees work is as important as what they produce, which is why it has
concentrated on the behaviours associated with accountability, collaboration, transparency and stretch – the ACTS
cultural principles.Accountability comes through people knowing what they are accountable for and being
empowered to deliver. Collaboration is about drawing on the rich diversity of styles, talents and skills across the
Group to maximise achievements. BOC values transparency because it believes that visible problems can be solved
and that informed people make better decisions. Finally, stretch advocates continually pushing the boundaries 
of performance. BOC has created a set of leadership competency models, which are aligned to ACTS.
All recruitment, development, recognition and enhancement processes are being aligned to this comprehensive
and unified BOC view of leadership and management.
Reward and recognition
An organisation that aspires to excellence must recognise and reward the achievement of excellence.The Group
continues to refine the key value drivers of its business units and to ensure it can reward and recognise outstanding
individual and team performance in the fulfilment of business goals. Programmes to achieve this are cascaded
throughout the organisation to heighten focus on effective performance at all levels.
The Group continues to move towards a total reward system that allows people to structure their
remuneration and benefits to suit their individual needs. Senior executives’ remuneration is linked to a Group-wide
variable compensation plan, which is described in the report on remuneration on page 73. Retirement benefit plans 
BOC considers it important that its people provide for their retirement and fully supports their efforts in this
regard.Around the world, the Group provides opportunities for people to participate in retirement programmes
tailored to suit local conditions. Just as importantly, the board’s pensions committee takes prudent steps to monitor
and control Group-wide retirement benefit plans with local managers being responsible for safeguarding the
security of each retirement plan that they sponsor.
The financial position of the Group’s main pension funds is detailed in note 8 to the financial statements.
Diversity
BOC believes that diversity is a key driver of future organisational and operating effectiveness.As one of the UK’s
few truly global companies, BOC highly values the rich diversity of its people.While the Group consistently
champions a set of unifying values and principles, they are not imposed regardless of local sensibilities. Rather, the
Group strives to build on the qualities inherent in its global environment by encouraging people with different
views, styles and approaches.Wherever in the world it operates, BOC is committed to maintaining a workplace
free from discrimination for reasons of race, creed, culture, nationality, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age or
marital status.The success of its diversity programme is monitored and reported regularly.
Disability is not considered a barrier to employment and, as far as local conditions allow, employees are
selected on the basis of their ability to perform the job. Further necessary training is arranged, taking account of
their particular needs and the resources required to meet them.
Employee share schemes
Many BOC employees in the UK and some other countries have built up an equity interest in the Group’s business
through employee share schemes. Options may be granted at a discount to the market price at the date of grant.
The term of options granted could be from three to seven years and any option is conditional on a commitment
by the individual to make regular savings from pay that are then held by an independent organisation to purchase
shares at the end of the option period.The exercise of options under these schemes can be satisfied by the issue of
new shares or the transfer of existing shares.
Employees 25 26 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005
Exercising sound corporate responsibility is fundamental to the way BOC operates.The Group aims always to
behave ethically and to manage risk strategically. It has a process for identifying, evaluating and managing all risks in
accordance with best practice.
This section outlines the Group’s systems for managing its social, environmental and ethical (SEE) risks and
opportunities - in line with guidelines set out by the Global Reporting Initiative, the Association of British Insurers,
the UK’s Combined Code on Corporate Governance and the provisions of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002 as it
applies to foreign private issuers. More details about BOC’s risks and corporate responsibility performance can be
found in the sections on risk factors on pages 38 and 39 and on the company’s website, boc.com.
The Group works actively with its stakeholders - shareholders, customers, suppliers, employees, local
communities and governments. Underlining the Group’s adherence to best practice, BOC engages with a wide
variety of employee, safety, environmental and community bodies.
BOC is a signatory to the UN Global Compact.All Global Compact principles are integrated into BOC’s
Code of Conduct and, in many areas, BOC’s existing standards exceed those set out in the Global Compact.
In 2005, BOC submitted its communication on progress to the Global Compact Office, according to official
guidelines. BOC continues to review and adapt its business practices to achieve the Group’s SEE objectives 
and activities.
Executive responsibility
BOC has an integrated approach to SEE risks, managing them in the same way as all other business considerations
through business unit and Group risk management programmes.These processes are applied to major business
decisions such as acquisitions, disposals, new ventures and major supplier contracts. BOC’s business dealings are
guided by a global Code of Conduct.The code sets out the safety, environmental, social, legal and ethical
parameters that Group businesses and employees are expected to follow.The code is the responsibility of the
executive management board (EMB), whilst BOC’s businesses are responsible for day-to-day implementation.
EMB members are responsible for each of the code’s standards, supported by the appropriate business and
functional structures.The Group chief executive has ultimate responsibility for the code programme. He delegates
oversight to an EMB sponsor board and day-to-day management to a code advisory group.The code advisory
group is chaired by the general counsel, global compliance.
Safety, health and environmental management systems are the responsibility of the Group chief executive and
are implemented by business managers, supported by the Group director for safety, health, environment and
quality (SHEQ).Workplace issues, including labour relations, diversity, equal opportunities and human rights, are
managed by the Group director, human resources (HR). Market issues, including customer relations and ethical
trading practices, are managed by the line of business chief executives.The director of supply management oversees
BOC’s supply chain and ethical purchasing policy and reports to the Group chief executive.The Group director,
corporate relations, manages community relations, including sponsorships and charitable support.
The EMB regularly reviews Group systems for managing risks and opportunities, including business assurance
audits, legal, SHEQ and HR reviews, appropriate training and communications, and performance management and
remuneration incentives through the Group’s performance contract process. Directors are provided with
appropriate SEE training and communications. For example, they are given regular safety briefings and Code of
Conduct progress reviews.Training on defensive driving and other SHEQ priorities is provided.The EMB sets a
strategic direction with regard to all business issues, including SEE matters. Business units implement and develop
the EMB’s strategy through their own management teams.
Safety and other SEE measures, as required, are included in performance contracts. Part of the remuneration
of business unit managers and their teams is dependent on achieving these measures.
The Code of Conduct
Launched two years ago, the Code of Conduct embodies BOC’s commitment to integrity and responsible
business practice.This year, steps were taken to reinforce the effectiveness of the code and to build it into the way
that BOC does business.
The code advisory group met twice during the year.The role of the group is to establish globally consistent
ethical and legal standards, to support the business in owning and upholding these standards and to respond to
issues that may require BOC to adopt a new or revised position within the Code. Chaired by the general counsel,
global compliance, the council comprises representatives from each line of business and Gist.
A robust central tracking system was introduced to capture allegations from all the businesses and channel
them to the global compliance function.The system not only records allegations that are subsequently
substantiated, but also allegations that ultimately prove unfounded but that warranted further investigation.
BOC’s network of sustainability managers is responsible for championing the Code within the businesses.
Guidelines on communications and training were issued and each business unit head is required to report on
progress within the quarterly performance contract review.
The Code, available in ten different languages, can be accessed via boc.com, the intranet, CD or paper copy. It
is linked to a number of other systems, notably the Group’s integrated management systems and standards (IMSS).
BOC operates a confidential 24 hours a day/seven days a week helpline in 49 countries, supported by helpline
promotional material in the form of posters, wallet cards and a screensaver. In 2005, the Group introduced a
quarterly Code report, distributed to senior management for onward cascade to all employees, giving a round up
of news, recent violations, statistics and lessons relating to the Code.
Code sustainability issues are reported to the EMB and appropriate managers on a monthly basis. In 2005,
the helpline received 155 allegation cases from around the world. 19 per cent resulted in disciplinary action and 
57 per cent were found to be unsubstantiated or non-violations.The remaining cases are still being investigated.
Social, environmental and ethical performance BOC’s global management system (IMSS)
IMSS (integrated management systems and standards) is a system developed by BOC. It has three distinct parts:
the IMSS Library,Traccess and Audit Manager.The IMSS Library houses electronic copies of BOC’s reference
material, work instructions, operating procedures and management systems and standards.Traccess is BOC’s online
training and competency tracking system, storing individual learning profiles and employee training histories.Audit
Manager houses all stages of the audit cycle and verifies site performance and compliance against best practice and
minimum standards defined in the IMSS Library. IMSS documents Group knowledge from high level policies to
detailed work instructions, enabling all employees to be trained and assessed in the skills required by their roles.
IMSS outlines the correct protocols and minimum standards, and tracks the performance of actions needed to
ensure the safe, environmentally sound and efficient management of BOC businesses worldwide. IMSS and the
Code of Conduct are mutually supportive.
Stakeholders
BOC’s Code of Conduct is segmented into key stakeholder groups, each of which is addressed by specific code
standards and management structures and procedures. Details are posted under the corporate responsibility
section of boc.com. For example, BOC works with its suppliers through a supplier evaluation, selection and
performance appraisal (SESPA) system, which assures minimum standards of supplier performance, quality
assurance and legal, ethical, social and environmental compliance. BOC’s ethical purchasing policy, an integral part of
SESPA, is managed by the Group supply management function, underpinned by the Code of Conduct and
supported by IMSS and a number of other web-based platforms. Suppliers are segmented according to a
combination of two matrices: supplier risk profile and product risk profile.The highest risk category requires the
ethical purchasing policy to be included in the supplier’s signed contract with BOC, with BOC reserving the right to
terminate the contract in the event of a breach.Any employee can raise concerns about supplier ethics via the
Code of Conduct helpline and data is captured and reported as a specific category.
Identifying and prioritising SEE risks
In 2004 BOC introduced a formal process to identify and manage its SEE risks and to identify potential
opportunities. EMB directors, business unit heads and other key managers around the world submitted potential
SEE risks which were consolidated by the Group risk management function and rated using predetermined scoring
criteria. Each risk was rated according to its potential impact, the adequacy of plans to mitigate the risk, and its
urgency.
The broad areas identified by the SEE risk and mitigation process are: managing the safety of people associated
with BOC; managing major operational hazards; minimisation of greenhouse gas emissions; energy efficiency; water
conservation; global adherence to and the effective working of the Code of Conduct; managing an ethical supply
chain; and continuing enhancement of product stewardship procedures.
The Group’s SEE review found that management systems and mitigations already exist for identified risks, but
in some minor instances enhanced measures have been, or are being, put in place. One example is a screening
process to ensure that customers have the capability to handle hazardous products safely. Piloted this year in the
UK for the packaged chemicals business, the process will be rolled out to the wider Industrial and Special Products
business in 2006.
Corporate social investment strategy
BOC strives to be a good corporate citizen by: operating safely and minimising the environmental impact of its
activities; enhancing the wellbeing of local economies through employment on the bases of diversity, equal
opportunity and merit, and; fostering strong community relations.
BOC is committed to all the communities in which it operates, wherever they are in the world, and its
contribution takes on a number of forms.At the Group level BOC supports a variety of programmes broadly
aligned with the nature of the business. Key themes are the environment, education, medical research and the arts.
At the local level BOC encourages a range of volunteering, donation and sponsorship programmes, guided
from the centre but ultimately decided and implemented at country, business unit and site levels.The choice of
charitable donations is devolved through matched giving schemes.
Managing corporate responsibility performance
This year the Group continued to participate in the UK’s Business in the Community (BiTC) corporate
responsibility (CR) index.The index assesses companies’ performance against a wide range of environmental, social
and ethical measures. BOC has participated in the index’s sister survey, the Business in the Environment (BiE) index,
since 1995. BOC scored 89 per cent in BiTC’s CR index, ranking it 39th out of 144 participating companies,
including 57 from the FTSE100.The average score among participants from BOC’s comparator group was 88 per
cent. Completing the index demonstrates the Group’s commitment to managing, measuring and reporting its
corporate responsibility performance in an open and transparent way. BOC’s completed survey and BiTC’s
independent assessment of the Group’s performance are published on boc.com.The BiTC index is the Group’s
common measure and standard response to corporate responsibility and SEE enquiries.
Social, environmental and ethical performance 27 28 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 Social, environmental and ethical performance
Safety,health and the environment
There are no greater priorities for BOC than the health and safety of our employees, contractors, suppliers,
customers and local communities, and the protection of the environment. BOC is committed to excellence in
managing these areas through normal business practice assisted by its safety, health, environment and quality
(SHEQ) function.
SHEQ policies and procedures are the responsibility of the Group chief executive and are implemented by
BOC’s businesses with the support of the SHEQ function.The SHEQ department works within the businesses to
ensure that the Group has a deliverable policy, is active in its risk management and professional in its mitigation.
BOC has well-established programmes to drive improvement in SHEQ performance. Employees are required
to comply with all external regulations and the Group’s policies and Code of Conduct. Suppliers are expected to
meet minimum standards set by BOC’s ethical purchasing policy.
SHEQ management standards, procedures and tools are embedded in Group practice by the organisation’s
integrated management systems and standards (see IMSS section above). IMSS outlines the standards and actions
needed to align with, or conform to, internationally accredited certifications such as ISO 9000 (quality assurance),
ISO 14001 (environment) and ISO 18001 (health and safety).
BOC met its objectives in 2005 when the Group:
• Retained safety, health and environment as the top priority at EMB level;
• Retained SHEQ at the forefront of Group and business unit employee communications;
• Sustained emphasis on behavioural safety through the Safety in BOC programme;
• Improved safety and environmental performance against 2004 figures;
• Transitioned to using proactive measures (leading indicators), in addition to the traditionally reported lagging
indicators, to measure SHEQ performance;
• T ook positive measures to improve road transport safety;
• Continued to conduct its annual environment survey to highlight opportunities for continuous improvement;
• Set initial environmental targets for 2006 and beyond.
Along with the Code of Conduct and the Group’s ACTS operating principles, the Safety in BOC programme
ensures that SHEQ issues are managed consistently across all countries and businesses, in accordance with our
SHEQ policies and principles.
Safety
Safety is BOC’s highest priority and the Group has one simple goal: zero incidents and injuries. Safety is the first
agenda item at every EMB and business executive meeting. Great emphasis is put on providing all our employees
with the necessary training, equipment and safeguards such that no-one gets hurt. Business managers around the
world, with SHEQ support, continually strive to improve safety performance and, through our Safety in BOC
programme, are now focusing on individuals’ behaviour and the effect that safe and unsafe behaviour has on the
organisation.
Each business unit has a SHEQ function, reporting to the business unit’s executive and the Group SHEQ
function through a global peer group.This ensures that global best practice and the functional requirements of the
business and Group are always at the forefront of management thinking.
BOC manufactures and distributes products that are potentially hazardous, some being stored at very low
temperature or under pressure, and some having toxic or flammable properties. Consequently, the Group is
committed to reducing the risk of harm to people through its products. Operating safely and communicating safe
working practices are an integral part of its safety and product stewardship processes.
It is important for the Group not only to have clear and measurable performance standards practised by all
BOC employees, plants, depots and distributors, but also to disseminate these safe working practices to our
customers and suppliers. IMSS contains product safety and stewardship instructions, policies and procedures. Each
product line has specific standards attached to it. BOC undertakes research into the health and safety of its
products, keeps abreast of new scientific information and works with industry and public bodies to reduce risk and
share learning.This year BOC launched an online safety advice service, bocsafety.net, to help customers identify risks
and unsafe practices and adopt guidance on best practice to comply with the law.
BOC continuously strives to improve safety in the workplace and combat the root causes of safety incidents.
In 2005 BOC Edwards, which manufactures hazardous gases for use in processing semiconductors, was recognised
for its safety performance. In South Africa, BOC Edwards received two NOSA safety awards for occupational risk
management procedures at the nitrogen trifluoride plant in Pelindaba. In the US, BOC Edwards’ special gases plant
at Medford, Oregon, was awarded the OSHA Voluntary Protection Programs’‘Star Program’ status for self-
sufficiency in their ability to control workplace hazards. EMC, BOC’s US-based water management business, won
several Water Environment Association awards. EMC’s water treatment plant at Ligonier, Indiana, won the
prestigious Water Environment Federation’s Burke Award.
Regrettably, three Group employees died in work related activities in 2005.T wo employees tragically died in
road incidents, one in the UK and one in the US, both of which involved third parties.These incidents reinforce our
commitment to remain focused on transport safety during 2006.Another employee was killed in T aiwan, by falling
from a height at a customer location. In addition, BOC experienced six contractor fatalities during the period.
The Group chief executive, SHEQ director and business unit managers review every fatality and major
incident personally. Investigations are only closed when the chief executive is fully satisfied that the root causes of
the incident are understood and action has been taken to prevent future recurrences.

Controlling process-related risks is of the utmost importance.Any incidents that do occur are thoroughly
investigated and the lessons learned are applied throughout the organisation to minimise the likelihood of
recurrence. Safety lessons are shared throughout the gases industry and BOC continues to participate fully in the
development and application of industry-wide codes.
This year the Group built on the vision, policy and strategy put in place last year when it launched its Safety in
BOC programme. Safety in BOC, which complements and builds upon existing safety systems, standards and tools,
aims to prevent people getting hurt by effecting lasting behavioural and cultural change. It is underpinned by the
principle that safety is not a small part of someone’s job, it is ‘100 per cent of our behaviour, 100 per cent of the
time.’ The aim is to establish a culture whereby each employee thinks instinctively not just about his own safety,
but also about the safety of others, be they colleagues, contractors or members of the community.
The roadmap is the key tool that supports Safety in BOC. It shows the organisation where it is and how it can
move from its current base to world class through a series of well-defined steps and markers. It is a gap analysis
tool that enables a particular department, site or business to assess itself in terms of safety performance, plot year
by year progress on each of the nineteen roadmap components and develop a plan to progress to world class.
During 2005, the roadmap has been formally integrated into safety implementation plans within each of the
businesses, which are in turn included in business planning processes and individual performance contracts.
The focus on leading indicators continued in 2005, allowing the Group to monitor safety performance in
terms of proactive measures being taken as well as lagging indicators measuring past performance. In conjunction
with the roadmap, a series of practical steps were taken during 2005 to help embed safe behaviour and the desired
safety culture. BOC’s business units in Asia and Africa rolled out SiteSafe, a focused approach for implementing the
systems, standards and behaviours inherent in Safety in BOC. SiteSafe included various modules such as LeadSafe
workshops to promote visible leadership among management and ActSafe, a series of ‘safety through
empowerment’ seminars encouraging supervisors and front line employees to recognise unsafe acts and challenge
them through peer-to-peer conversations. During 2006 other business units will use SiteSafe to cascade and
further embed the Safety in BOC principles into the organisation.At a local level, every BOC business unit
throughout the world actively engaged employees through sustained communications, cascade briefings and
training programmes.
Approximately half the major incidents across the Group result from road transport, which is also the main
cause of fatalities. Driver training has always been a high priority at BOC, both for commercial vehicles and
passenger cars. Initiatives include defensive driver training, driver observation and feedback, vehicle design, use of
on-board monitoring technology and anti-rollover and jack-knife training. Last year, the Group appointed a director
of Group transport safety to collaborate with regional counterparts and develop a consistent global strategy for
improving road safety throughout BOC.
In 2005, this appointment has started to deliver new processes and tools to share best operating practice 
and achieve sustainable improvements in road transport safety. For example, a new transport audit protocol was
piloted in Asia and a new driver-training model will be ready for implementation in the first quarter of 2006.
A common vehicle incident reporting process was established to aid learning, while a global transport team 
of experts met twice in 2005 to prioritise initiatives to prevent fatalities or serious injuries.
Building on the Group’s total ban on making and receiving calls from mobile phones while driving, a major
campaign was launched to promote transport safety and reinforce the wearing of seatbelts.This campaign was
supported by a global transport directive to apply a minimum set of safety standards to all fleet and contractor
vehicles throughout the Group, including a requirement to fit three-point seat belts rather than lap belts where the
latter existed.At Gist, safety rails were introduced for the protection of drivers when coupling tractors to trailers
and stability systems were installed on all high-sided double-decker trailers to reduce the risk of rollover.
In addition to the leading indicators previously mentioned, used to monitor safety performance proactively,
the Group also has four reactive, or lagging, indicators to provide a consistent measure of its workplace and vehicle
safety performance.These are:
• lost workday case rate (LWCR) per 200,000 hours.This includes all accidents resulting in the loss of one
complete day of work, according to best international practice. Many companies only report cases resulting in
three or more lost workdays as deemed reportable under RIDDOR regulations;
• total recordable case rate (TRCR) per 200,000 hours.This includes all LWCRs and medical treatment cases;
• passenger car avoidable accident rate (PCAAR) per million miles;
• truck avoidable accident rate (TAAR) per million miles.
The figures for 2005, which include joint ventures and acquisitions, showed an improvement across all four lagging
indicators.The disposal of Afrox Healthcare in 2005 marked a major change in BOC’s portfolio, as the business
employed over 13,000 people representing around 30 per cent of the total workforce. BOC’s lagging indicators 
are shown with and without Afrox Healthcare, giving a basis for future comparison.The chart excluding Afrox
Healthcare gives a clearer indication of underlying improvement, with a 20 per cent improvement in both lost
workday and total recordable case rates since the launch of the Safety in BOC programme two years ago.

Occupational health and hygiene
BOC requires its businesses to manage employee health activities in accordance with local laws and regulations and
according to BOC’s codes of practice, standards and procedures.The Group’s occupational health and hygiene
(OH) function provides a global service striving to eradicate work-related health hazards and to ensure that
employees can come to work and carry out their duties safely.
Employees have access to guidance on OH from health professionals and qualified safety, health, environment 
and quality (SHEQ) managers.This is supported by a range of up-to-date training programmes, manuals, videos 
and safety data sheets, which are available through local and global SHEQ functions and on dedicated SHEQ
intranet sites.
The OH function carries out reviews in all business units to provide information and guidance on the main
health issues that exist in BOC operations globally and how best these potential hazards may be minimised or
eliminated.This is achieved by providing best practice standards and guidance to local SHEQ personnel who then
implement these standards and policies as necessary.Adverse employee health effects are monitored through local
occupational health checks around the world. Some are internal and others are outsourced to professional OH
providers. In some regions,‘Well-person’ health checks are available for employees and specific tests are done for
employees engaged in hazardous activities.These vary according to risk and requirements.
The main potential health issues that exist in BOC operations differ across business units.When dealing with
our gases businesses, the main potential health issues are:
• exposure to noise from gas compression activities and from cylinder handling;
• potential exposure to some gases filled into cylinders;
• potential exposure to chemicals used in metal cleaning and painting operations;
• ergonomic and manual handling risks.
As reported last year, the OH programmes developed to deal with these issues continue to be applied across the
Group. Other continued work has been the ongoing programme to reduce some of the hazardous solvents used
for metal cleaning and possible substitution of those used in paints with safer and more environmentally friendly
alternatives.
Of particular significance this year is the high percentage of lost workday and medical treatment cases as a
direct result of manual handling, culminating in short-term acute injury and chronic conditions such as back, hand,
arm or shoulder conditions. In the Industrial and Special Products business, attention to these activities is a high
priority with major effort being applied to risk assessment processes and the implementation of best practice
solutions to minimise identified risks.The principle of best practice has also been applied to new plants, such as the
new cylinder filling facility in Bangalore, India, which was designed to minimise manual handling of cylinders as much
as possible and hence reduce the potential risk of injury among employees.
Work has also been done to gather and analyse information relating to employee health issues, with a view 
to counteracting the costs of ill health and enabling actions to be established in the priority areas.There is also
recognition that even if ill health is not related to the job, there can still be a benefit to the employee and the
business in facilitating early recovery and return to work. In the south Pacific region, a scheme has been devised 
to speed up the diagnosis and treatment of employees suffering from injury or ill health, therefore bringing
rehabilitation forward.This process, coupled with pro-active preventative programmes, has the added benefit 
of reducing employee liability insurance costs, in real terms, such that they are significantly less than industry
benchmarks.The principles of this injury management scheme are being examined with a view to globalisation.
The environment
BOC is classified as part of the chemicals sector, but does not have the same direct or significant environmental
issues to deal with as traditional chemicals manufacturers.The nature of BOC’s activities and the type of chemicals
handled are quite different. However, in line with other industries, BOC is committed to sound environmental
practices including the conscientious stewardship of its products and services.
Across the businesses, BOC’s most significant environmental impacts fall into four main areas.These are:
• Energy consumption: Process Gas Solutions is a major consumer of electricity, used to power air separation
units.The generation of electricity directly contributes to carbon dioxide emissions.
• Vehicle transport: BOC’s gases businesses operate large fleets of vehicles worldwide for delivering gas
to customer sites, contributing principally to carbon dioxide emissions. Gist operates a logistics network 
in Europe.
• Ozone depleting potential (ODP) substance release: cryogenic air separation techniques require air to be
cooled to achieve liquefaction.This requires refrigeration, which has traditionally used refrigerant gases that
have ozone depleting potential.
• Non-hazardous and hazardous waste: this covers a range of categories and varies across business units. For
example, one of the main forms of waste from Process Gas Solutions is oil used in compressors. In Industrial
and Special Products, waste comprises packaging materials, metals, acids and alkalines used for abatement
purposes in the production of special gases, solvents from painting cylinders and waste related to transport
such as oil and batteries from vehicles. BOC Edwards’ hazardous waste includes chemicals used in
component cleaning and toxic residue from vacuum components replaced during servicing. In Gist,
the main waste is packaging materials such as paper, card and plastics. Social, environmental and ethical performance 31
The Group continues to work actively with its stakeholders to ensure that environmental issues are approached
responsibly. BOC is a signatory to the UN Global Compact and abides by its environment principles. In the US and
Australia BOC supports the chemical industry’s Responsible Care programme. BOC participates in Business in the
Community’s Environment Index and this year scored 88.86 per cent, ranking it 48th out of 168 participating
companies and number one in the chemicals sector.
BOC aims to comply fully with all material environmental laws and regulations. No prosecutions for breaches
of environmental regulations were incurred in 2005.
Management of environmental issues that are relevant to the Group’s businesses is overseen by the safety,
health, environment and quality (SHEQ) department and implemented through a worldwide environmental
management system.This includes operating instructions, training, performance tracking and auditing.The sharing of
best practice is achieved through the Group’s integrated management systems and standards (IMSS).
BOC has operated a comprehensive environmental survey of its sites for more than ten years.The annual
web-based survey, which covers approximately 550 sites around the world, highlights issues relevant to the
businesses and identifies opportunities for the development and sharing of best environmental practice.The results
are reviewed by the executive management board, business unit management teams and the Group SHEQ
director.Annual environment action plans are integrated into business unit management processes and included in
business and individual performance contracts.
Many BOC business units have programmes to achieve ISO 14001 environmental certification. Our welding
product consumables business in Germiston, South Africa, and our special gases site at Morden, UK, both achieved
ISO 14001 certification this year.Thirty key industrial sites around the world are now accredited. However, all BOC
sites operate in accordance with ISO standards even if not specifically accredited, because IMSS, containing the
Group’s global operating systems and standards, is aligned to ISO 14001.
Selecting the right supplier for BOC is fundamental to conducting business effectively and ethically.Throughout
its businesses, BOC has adopted its proprietary supplier evaluation, selection and performance appraisal (SESPA)
process, together with an ethical purchasing policy stating that suppliers must place a high regard on safety and
adhere to local legislation concerning pollution.
This year BOC appointed a manager to identify, develop, share and support the implementation of
environmental best practice.The benefits will include improvements in cost-efficiency and productivity, as well as a
reduction in emissions, waste and water consumption.
It is now widely recognised that carbon dioxide (CO2), released into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels for
heat and power, is the main greenhouse gas that has an impact on climate change. BOC’s climate impact comes
from intensive use in air separation units (ASUs) of electric power, which is still generated largely from coal-based
technologies. Improving energy efficiency is a high priority at BOC. Reductions in energy consumption benefit
everyone in terms of lower CO2 emissions, lower production and purchase costs and lower product prices.
BOC manages the purchase and use of power extremely carefully. Its ASUs are run at optimal efficiency levels
required to meet regulatory and competitive requirements. Long-established efficiency programmes anticipate
power price movements wherever possible.T o assure the highest levels of efficiency, state-of-the-art operating
centres in each global region control BOC’s production plants. Over the last four years, for example, Process Gas
Solutions has undertaken more than one thousand plant and distribution efficiency projects, delivering significant
annual savings. Managing climate change issues effectively and responsibly is a matter of business and environmental
necessity for the Group.
Carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from BOC production plants this year are estimated to be 7.9 million
tonnes (2004: 7.5 million tonnes); 7.4 million tonnes relate to emissions from using electricity and 480,000 tonnes
as a by-product of producing hydrogen by steam methane reforming.The hydrogen-related emissions are reported
for the first time this year. BOC’s electricity consumption for its production plants was approximately 11.9 T erawatt
hours (2004: 11.8 T erawatt hours).The two gases businesses, Process Gas Solutions and Industrial and Special
Products, account for 99 per cent of these emissions and in 2005 they produced 2,442 tonnes (2004: 2,521
tonnes
(1)
) of carbon dioxide equivalents from electricity usage for each £1 million of turnover.
BOC’s methodology for emission estimation and addressing emission factors
(2)
has been independently
assessed and confirmed to be appropriate.The Group uses energy data to help improve its energy efficiency with
resultant improvements in carbon dioxide emissions.
During 2005 BOC undertook a number of pilot projects, with the assistance of the Carbon Trust, to improve
energy efficiency at several UK sites. For example at BOC Edwards’ Burgess Hill manufacturing facility a site energy
assessment identified potentially 340 tonnes of CO2 equivalent savings and at ISP’s Worsley site a similar survey
identified 420 tonnes of CO2 savings.These results will be used to develop best practice in energy management
next year.
1. Adjusted for the US packaged gas business divested in 2004.
2. The methodology is consistent with all major mobile and point sources of carbon dioxide emissions within scope 1 of the Greenhouse Gas 
Protocol (World Business Council for Sustainable Development and the World Resources Institute, March 2004), all major sources of carbon 
dioxide emissions under scope 2 of the protocol and major mobile sources of emissions under scope 3 of the protocol. The figure does not 
include non-carbon dioxide global warming gases (N2O, SF6,CH4, PFCs and HFCs) or minor sources such as business travel, office electricity at 
small sites and decomposition of wastes and carbon dioxide emissions associated with heat and/or steam imported to BOC plants.

0 01 02 03 05 04 Ozone depleting potential (ODP) substance release has decreased this year by 38 per cent. In 2004, two plants
were responsible for 60 per cent of total ODP substance release and in 2005 actions were taken to remedy the
situation at these plants. For other plants annual refrigerant consumption and loss targets were set. In Process Gas
Solutions a project was undertaken to reduce ODP substance release from the refrigeration system at a nitrogen
liquefaction unit. Cleaning technology developed by Hudson T echnologies resulted in a significant reduction in ODP
substance loss and the saving of 3,000 tonnes per year CO2 equivalent.
BOC’s Industrial and Special Products business supplies a range of refrigerant gases and is phasing out those
with ozone depleting potential, according to the requirements of the Montreal protocol. BOC Edwards supplies
special gases for the semiconductor manufacturing process, which can result in ozone depleting emissions at the
end of the process. BOC Edwards has developed a wide range of abatement systems for rendering these
emissions harmless. One example is the Zenith Etch Plasma, an integrated vacuum pump and abatement system.
The product assists in achieving the World Semiconductor Council’s target for perfluorocarbon (PFC) emissions
and is closely aligned to the energy reduction philosophy of the International T echnology Roadmap for
Semiconductors (ITRS). It delivers high performance PFC destruction with total power consumption of less than
10 kW, less than a quarter that of conventional systems performing the same function, making it the most energy
efficient system of its kind on the market.
Hazardous waste and general waste performance improved in 2005 as a result of site based programmes
focused on waste minimisation.
The transport of product by road also has a potentially significant environmental impact. BOC operates its
vehicle fleet to the highest environmental standards. Emissions of carbon dioxide equivalents from our transport
operations are approximately 552,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents
(3)
.
Process Gas Solutions has put in place a global reporting card and network to focus on transport efficiency
and delivery for its tanker distribution network.The tool analyses vehicle utilisation metrics and delivery statistics.
Reports highlight trends and thus help improve transport efficiency, reduce mileage, and thereby reduce emissions.
BOC Edwards has also been working on a supply chain management project to replace air freight with sea freight
through improved planning of inventory and supply needs.
BOC’s distribution services business, Gist, undertook an efficiency programme in support of key customer
Marks & Spencer’s transport strategy. By synchronising volume more closely to store needs and implementing a
new planning process, efficiency was improved by 11 per cent and delivery schedules reduced by 2.8 million miles.
Gist and Marks & Spencer, working together, also introduced command steer trailers, drawbar Simply Foods
vehicles and double decker trailers to reduce trips and therefore mileage. Road speed was limited to 53 mph 
to save fuel and automated gearboxes were fitted to the transport fleet, resulting in an estimated average saving 
of 0.3 mpg per vehicle. In addition,‘quiet’ packs were fitted to a number of fridge trailers to reduce noise emissions
at stores.
In the past three years much work has been done to improve environmental performance and to establish
the business processes and metrics that will permit the publishing of pre-set performance targets. Every BOC
business has internal efficiency targets that have environmental benefits. Some relate to structural changes in the
businesses which, when in place, will improve the monitoring of performance patterns and enable the development
of longer-term targets.
Process Gas Solutions, which manages the Group’s air separation units and thus accounts for the majority of energy
usage, will:
• Implement 59 power saving projects in 2006, which will reduce electricity usage by 83,000 MWh, saving the
equivalent of 54,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.
• Reduce the release of ozone depleting potential materials by at least 40 per cent by 2009.
Industrial and Special Products, which has BOC’s largest distribution fleet worldwide, will:
• Establish single customer delivery vehicle scheduling centres in the UK, South Africa and south Pacific in 2006
from a current total of 22 scheduling centres. Centralised scheduling will lead to improvements in the
efficiency of the fleet.As part of the programme, cab computers will be installed to give real time feedback on
scheduling and the automatic capture of key performance data, such as kilometres driven for each cylinder
delivered and litres of fuel consumed for each 100 kilometres driven.
• Review vehicle replacement policy and commit funds in 2006 to replace old vehicles across all business units.
For instance, the average vehicle age in South Africa has fallen from 9.4 years in 2003 to 6.8 years currently.
The target is an average age of 6 years.
BOC will continue setting internal targets through business unit performance contracts at site level where individual
improvement opportunities have been highlighted by audits, the annual environmental survey and identification of
best practice.These targets include opportunities to reduce waste, conserve water and improve process efficiency.

32 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 Social, environmental and ethical performance Product stewardship programmes minimise the environmental impact arising from the manufacture of BOC’s
products and their ensuing use by customers. Growing concern about the environment and climate change has led
to increased legislation, which presents BOC with potential business opportunities, such as:
• BOC has formed a partnership with the Morgan Motor Company to develop LIFECar, the world’s first
hydrogen powered sports car.The hydrogen fuel cell produces electric energy, powering four separate electric
motors, one at each wheel.The only waste product is water.
• BOC has signed a ten-year agreement with Biofuels Corporation in the UK to supply nitrogen and
compressed air used in the production of environmentally friendly biodiesel.
• BOC and Dabbrook Services have combined solar power and hydrogen fuel cell technologies to develop an
eco-friendly water management system for the Environment Agency in the UK.
• BOC has signed several contracts in the US to supply oil refineries with hydrogen for producing cleaner fuels.
Hydrotreating meets the US Environment Agency’s requirements for lower-sulphur gasoline and diesel fuels.
• BOC and Cellex Power Products, Canada, are jointly developing hydrogen supply solutions to power forklift
trucks used in large distribution warehouses in north America.
• BOC and the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) have
developed an environmentally safe fumigant to replace methyl bromide in the treatment of soil, pests, weeds
and crop diseases.
• BOC is helping to cut the rate of ozone depleting emissions across the building sector with the introduction
of Ecomate
®
, an environmentally friendly foam blowing agent.
Commitment to the environment
The UK-based BOC Foundation for the Environment, established with an initial injection of £1 million in 1990,
continues to fund air and water quality projects. New and ongoing projects include: a review of roadside emissions
testing; development of liquid petroleum gas ‘clean’ fuel cell technology; a new oxidation technique for
pharmaceutical toxic waste; an evaluation of photovoltaics for solar power; research into the impact of electrical
and electronic hazardous waste; and a programme to develop low cost electrolysers in support of the hydrogen
economy.
This year, the Group contributed £385,000 to the Foundation and approved new awards totalling £674,000,
bringing the total combined funding to date from BOC and its co-sponsoring partners to £15 million.
BOC joined forces with the North East Process Industry Cluster (NEPIC) to launch an environment award
for schools in the north east of England. Pupils are invited to submit practical ideas on environmental issues ranging
from recycling to preservation of air and water resources.
In other parts of the world, notable contributions were made to environmental initiatives in New Zealand and
Australia. BOC’s ‘Where There’s Water’ community environment grants programme in New Zealand, which has
awarded 45 grants throughout the country since its inception three years ago, awarded £13,000 in grants, mainly 
to schools undertaking water conservation projects. In Australia, BOC donated ten hectares of land at its Wagga
Wagga operations centre to Greenfleet, a non-profit organisation that reduces the environmental impact of carbon
dioxide emissions by planting trees. BOC volunteers helped local schoolchildren to plant ten thousand trees on 
the site.
Commitment to education
BOC continues to support educational programmes in local communities through school tours, lessons in the
properties of gases, health and safety briefings, careers advice, technical support and academic research.
BOC’s Inspiring Gases education programme made further progress in terms of educational posters and
CDs, in addition to development of the web site at boc.com/education.The programme, designed to complement
the school chemistry syllabus and to stimulate young people’s interest in science, is being run in co-operation with
the Royal Society of Chemistry.This year, BOC’s UK-wide network of science ambassadors staged a spectacular
new show called ‘It’s a Gas’. Staged at the Glasgow Science Centre to coincide with the 7th Institution of Chemical
Engineers World Congress, the show demonstrated the properties and applications of gases with plenty of flashes,
bangs and vapour clouds to appeal to young audiences. Its run was extended to the end of the school summer
holidays because of its popularity.
Other educational activities in the UK included the BOC Gases Challenge, designed to encourage secondary
school students to develop chemical engineering ideas and won in its 24th year by a team of pupils from Royal
Russell School in Croydon. For the fifth year, BOC sponsored the Science, Engineering and T echnology Student of
the Y ear Awards, held at the Guildhall in London.The winner, a chemical engineering graduate undertaking a PhD,
received £500 and £500 was also donated to Loughborough University for his work on the engineering of artificial
blood for transfusions. BOC supports a range of education bodies and initiatives including:The Council for Industry
and Higher Education;The Salters’ Festival of Chemistry;The Institute of Chemical Engineers environment award;
Surrey County Council’s young entrepreneur scheme; Surrey Scholars Club; the Industrial Trust’s Open Industry
programme: SETPOINT and Surrey SATRO.
Social, environmental and ethical performance 33 Commitment to medical research
BOC made an annual grant of £10,000 to the Association of Respiratory Nurse Specialists to aid the fight against
chronic respiratory diseases in the UK.As part of its commitment to the NHS and the medical establishment as 
a whole, BOC leads or supports a number of research programmes, clinical trials and patient care opportunities,
in addition to running clinical seminars on the use of medical gases for the relief of pain and respiratory problems.
In 2005, BOC provided £400,000 to sponsor several studies on respiratory issues, lung cancer and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), with a major study being conducted on bronchiolitis at St Mary’s Hospital,
Paddington. BOC also supports several clinical bodies, jointly founding the COPD consortium with the British
Thoracic Society and others, and including the long-term sponsorship of the BOC chair of anaesthesia in the UK
and the Hong Kong College of Anaesthesiologists. In addition, it supports various patient groups including the
Patients Association in the UK.
Commitment to the arts
The fourth BOC Emerging Artist Award, created to support promising young artists in the UK, was won by
photographer Justin Coombes, a graduate of Goldsmiths College, University of London.The £20,000 award is
designed to cover a year’s studio rental and materials, a travel bursary and the costs of a London-based exhibition
at the end of the award period. Five other artists were awarded £1,000 each as runners-up.
Charitable donations and community involvement
Operating within broad guidelines set by the Group, BOC’s local businesses are responsible for choosing and
funding their own causes through discretionary volunteering, donations and sponsorships.This devolved approach
has resulted in support for a rich variety of programmes that have an impact on BOC’s people and the
communities in which they work and live.
In 2005, BOC’s global charitable donations totalled £2,032,000, including funding for the BOC Foundation for
the Environment, educational programmes, medical research and the BOC Emerging Artist Award.
In the UK, BOC donated £350,000 to UK-registered charities through a matched giving scheme operated
through the Charities Aid Foundation. In addition to the numerous causes supported by matched giving, BOC also
supported a number of Group causes, including the Royal British Legion, Macmillan Cancer Relief, Limbless
Association, Unravel Mills,Voluntary Services Surrey Heath and Royal Surrey County Hospital’s St Luke’s Cancer
Fund.The Group’s logistics business, Gist, donated £10,000 to schools and charities at the request of its staff after
they won a competition organised by key customer Marks & Spencer.The money was divided between Kent Air
Ambulance, Davington Primary School, Pilgrim’s Hospice, Bysingwood Primary School and Faversham Cottage
Hospital. BOC is a member of the PerCent Club.
In December 2004, the tsunami inflicted terrible devastation on several countries in the Indian Ocean region.
BOC people and businesses in the area responded with help of all kinds – food, clothing, blankets, medicines and
medical oxygen – as well as money.Across the world, BOC employees donated over £200,000 to help relieve this
disaster.Their personal generosity was matched in every region by BOC (double matched in most cases), bringing
the total raised for the tsunami victims to £570,000. One example of the enormous support from BOC
employees around the world was BOC in Pakistan and Bangladesh, whose employees contributed one day’s salary
to provide relief to victims.Another example was twelve employees from BOC Edwards’ manufacturing site in
Shoreham, who raised over £20,000 by cycling up Mount Snowdon in Wales.
Through matched giving, BOC and its employees also contributed £125,000 to the American Red Cross in
support of the hurricane Katrina relief effort and to a special fund to help afflicted BOC employees. BOC also
made emergency deliveries of nitrogen to a bottling plant to speed up the distribution of drinking water to local
communities around New Orleans.
In the UK, BOC Edwards sponsored Sussex Business Award’s ‘manufacturer of the year’ category for the
second year running. BOC Edwards’ sponsorship of the Seishin Judo Club in East Grinstead was matched by
government body Sportsmatch and named runner-up in their annual awards ceremony. For the second year
running, two drivers from Gist’s Faversham site delivered a trailer of much needed furniture and aid to schools in
Belarus. In July, BOC medical gas teams across the UK ensured that victims of the terrorist attacks in London got
the supplies they needed, delivering 2,500 emergency cylinders to the capital.
In the US, employees continued to assist the United Way charitable appeal through financial donations,
volunteering and collections of supplies for needy children.All financial donations were matched by the business.
BOC sponsored the building of a home for a needy family in Ohio, through the Maumee Valley Habitat for
Humanity initiative.A BOC leadership team spent a day helping to build the house in T oledo, where BOC is
building a hydrogen plant to serve oil companies producing cleaner burning fuels.
34 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 Social, environmental and ethical performance In Chile, BOC supported several charities, notably those caring for and educating disadvantaged children. In
Venezuela, BOC made regular donations to charities in Valencia in support of impoverished children, health and the
environment.A donation was also made to the health corporation in the state of Aragua. BOC in Colombia
supported the Noel children’s hospital and Aburra Norte young community leaders.
In the south Pacific, the business matches employee donations as a matter of course. BOC in Australia
launched the Rotary Y outh Driver Awareness road safety programme, influencing attitudes and behaviour of young
people before they start driving. The business continued its long-established relationship with the Malcolm Sargent
Cancer Fund, now known as Redkite. Support includes volunteering and a scholarship programme whereby six
young people with cancer receive financial support from BOC. BOC received an award from the New South
Wales Cancer Council for its long-term support of Daffodil Day.
In South Africa, employees at BOC’s subsidiary Afrox continued to support their community involvement
programme (CIP), which helps over seventy institutions dealing with disadvantaged children.As in previous years,
the main event of the year was Bumbanani Day (meaning ‘let’s build together’), when 8,000 children attended
events hosted by BOC staff. The aim of the day is to celebrate the relationship that Afrox staff have built up with
the children throughout the year and the achievements they have brought about through their involvement. In
addition, the Afrox donations committee supplemented CIP funds on certain projects. For example, a delivery van
was donated to T akalani, a home for disabled children, and four other CIP children’s homes received additional
financial support to help with upgrading and refurbishment. Gas and welding equipment were donated to a
welding school in Richards Bay and to a skills development initiative in Johannesburg. Funds were also allocated to:
build a home for destitute children in Postmasburg, a rural town in the Northern Cape; provide a borehole and
water pump at a school in Limpopo Province; purchase desks, chairs and maths sets for two other schools in the
same province; and support the University of South Africa’s Mathematics T eachers’Training Project.
Across Asia, employees supported a wide variety of charities and community organisations. Every BOC
business unit in Asia donated generously to the tsunami appeal. In Malaysia, employees sponsored several
programmes in support of local hospitals, underprivileged and handicapped children and old people’s homes. In
China, BOC provided scholarships to students in Xi’an Jiaotong University, which is the leading institution for
cryogenic engineering in the country.
In India, in addition to supporting a number of poverty, disease and disaster relief funds, BOC employees
donated gifts to several orphanages to commemorate the 70th year of BOC’s presence in India. In Pakistan, BOC
continued its support for organisations engaged in healthcare, social and literacy projects, as well as the
conservation of national heritage. During the year, recipients of donations included: the Layton Rehmatulla
Benevolent Trust, an organization dedicated to providing free eye care; Friends of APWA Pakistan, a voluntary
organization committed to the development and care of the underprivileged women and children; the Mohatta
Palace Museum that fosters awareness and appreciation of the history and cultural heritage; and the Aga Khan
Medical Hospital and Foundation.

Research and development (R&D)
Research and development is conducted around the world with key sites located in north America, the UK and
Japan.The Group T echnical Centre (GTC) in Murray Hill, New Jersey, is a primary R&D location for market
applications for Process Gas Solutions and for electronic materials for BOC Edwards. Co-ordination of R&D is
managed through the Group technology council.The council also meets regularly with the Group new business
development forum to ensure the opportunities and risks from technological change are understood and, where
appropriate, exploited.
Process Gas Solutions undertakes internal development, forms alliances and partnerships with universities and
customers, licenses or acquires technologies from third parties and leverages governmental funding to progress key
developments. Internal developments use its core technical competencies while external partnerships give access
to additional competencies.
In 2005 BOC successfully commissioned the cryogenic refrigeration system for the high temperature
superconducting (HTS) cable project at Albany, New Y ork.This 34.5 kV HTS cable will form part of the Niagara
Mohawk utility grid. BOC was responsible for the cryogenic system, monitoring and interfacing with the cable
system, working with the Niagara Mohawk utility company.The project drew on BOC’s strengths in heat and mass
transfer and its ability to manage remote operations infrastructures.
Additional licenses were signed during the year for BOC’s proprietary glass melting technology, CGM,
which is based on its combustion and modelling competencies. Major glass companies were willing to publicise
their results and allow other glass companies to visit their installations.These companies include Owens-Corning,
Pilkington,Anchor Glass and LG Philips, representing the fibreglass, flat glass, container glass and TV glass segments
respectively.
BOC’s knowledge of adsorption and materials has been applied to the continuing development of an oxygen
generation process. Based on the selective oxygen sorption properties of specific ceramic materials it has the
potential to reduce substantially the cost of oxygen for certain applications in future chemical and power plants.
As part of a European Union funded project, BOC has identified promising new materials for use in oxy-fuel coal
boiler-based power plants. Pilot demonstration of the process is being progressed with government funding in the
US and the European Union.
BOC has excellent access to hydrogen/synthesis gas production technology through Linde BOC Process
Plants. In addition, BOC continues to develop novel ceramic-based technologies that offer potential step change
improvements for the production of hydrogen and synthesis gas.
BOC is working with Ceres Power of the UK jointly to develop fuel cell-based systems for generating
electricity, using a variety of cylinder gases. BOC developed and commercialised a helium conservation system 
for the optical fibre manufacturing industry and licensed the technology to Fibre Ottiche Sud, a division of Pirelli.
This technology improves overall efficiency substantially and reduces helium wastage.
Based on its combustion and modelling competencies, BOC successfully commercialised a new way to
enhance the productivity of steel from basic oxygen furnaces and reached commercial agreements for licensing the
technology to leading steel producers.
BOC’s heat and mass transfer experience enabled it to develop and commercialise a food freezing technology
to crust-freeze luncheon meat logs prior to slicing, allowing customers to increase the speed of their production
lines and overall product yield. It also eliminates product handling, increases the efficiency of cryogenic freezing and
makes more efficient use of floor space.
For BOC Edwards, the pace of innovation in the silicon semiconductor market is unabated with leading edge
customers following a two year technology cycle. In the storage market the pace is even more rapid with storage
capacity doubling every year. Fab investments have generally been at or below those in 2004 with the exception of
the flat panel area where investments have been higher than predicted.
Emphasis in product development has been on reducing new products’ demand for power and utilities.
Monitoring and control capability helps create products with these capabilities, including active utility control.
A sensor-less turbomolecular pump with an integrated controller, which was introduced this year, is smaller, easier
to install, yet has better performance with lower vibration.
Energy and environmental concerns drive new abatement technology.The Zenith Plasma for Etch gives
excellent destruction and low cost of ownership for customers that prefer non-combustion abatement technology.
Liquid abatement systems for copper can be installed at points of use or throughout a production facility.
In the general vacuum business, new products for the scientific sector offer cost-reduction and enhanced
performance. Lower-cost web-enabled sales channels have been introduced for our broad customer base.
The pharmaceutical business supplied its first systems containing a patented non-contact weighing system.
The application, which uses nuclear magnetic resonance technology, has received approval from the US Food and
Drug Administration and is incorporated in several new vial loading products.
Industrial and Special Products installed prototypes of a new thermodynamic cylinder filling package at two
sites handling scientific and industrial gases.Thermodynamic modelling gives real time control and compensates 
for raw material impurities and other system variations, resulting in tighter mixture tolerances and better
production efficiency.
Research, development and information technology Research, development and information technology 37
Among areas of development undertaken by the industrial products technology group are oxy-fuel cutting, the
cryogenic cooling of welds, pipeline welding and shielding gas mixtures.The cold spray coating process that uses
helium or nitrogen is being used in a number of new applications and has been accompanied by the successful
introduction of a new helium recovery system.The design and development of new cylinder packages continues,
concentrating on valves with integrated regulators and valve guards.A web-based global fabrication technical library
was launched, designed to support technical and product training initiatives.
The medical business continues to research the clinical application of a variety of gases, including heliox 
(a mixture of oxygen and helium) that has demonstrated promising results in a number of areas, including asthma
and brochiolitis in infants and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults.The BOC Chair of Anaesthesia and
Intensive Care has been awarded to Professor David Menon of Cambridge University.
In special products, work continues on a new environmentally friendly fumigant,Vapormate, which has
achieved product registration in Australia and New Zealand.
T otal R&D expenditure in 2005 was £43.2 million compared to £41.6 million in 2004 and £39.9 million 
in 2003.
Information management
The information management (IM) team reports its performance against four criteria: delivering innovation, creating
value, enabling the business and operating efficiently. It also has measures for developing its people and for its safety
performance.All users are surveyed regularly to ensure IM’s performance matches their needs.As well as reporting
regularly on its short-term performance, IM this year updated and had approved its five year strategy.
Development work continues in areas as diverse as wireless technologies, network access, telephony, and
knowledge and document management.The SAP computing system has been deployed further, notably to BOC
Edwards in north America and more countries in Asia, and deployment has started of a global asset management
system.An IM helpdesk has been set up that is available to all employees, all the time. It replaces a number of
regional centres.The global data centre, based in the UK, is now well established and undertakes data processing for
BOC businesses around the world. 38 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005
This document contains certain forward-looking statements which involve risk and uncertainty as they relate to future
events and circumstances.The following risk factors,as well as those discussed on pages 56 and 57 of the financial review
could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements:
BOC is affected by the semiconductor business cycle
Manufacturers of semiconductors represent BOC Edwards’ major customer base, and BOC Edwards’ profitability 
is directly linked to the demand of these manufacturers for vacuum equipment, services and industrial gases.
The semiconductor industry has experienced significant growth over the long term, but is cyclical in nature.
Any improvements in the level of demand for BOC Edward’s products or services may not be sustained due to
reduced demand from end users of technology products and/or excess supply of semiconductors.The competitive
nature of the semiconductor industry can reduce profit margins for suppliers of products and services to
semiconductor manufacturers. Either of these factors or a combination could adversely impact BOC’s financial
results.Any long-term reduction in the growth pattern of the semiconductor industry could also have a negative
impact on BOC’s financial results.
Acquisitions may not be successful in achieving intended benefits and synergies
BOC has completed a number of acquisitions in recent years as part of its growth strategy and may make
acquisitions in the future.While BOC identifies expected synergies, cost savings and growth opportunities prior to
completing any acquisition, these benefits may not be achieved owing to, among other things:
• delays or difficulties in completing the integration of acquired companies or assets;
• higher than expected costs or a need to allocate resources to manage unexpected operating difficulties;
• diversion of the attention and resources of BOC’s management;
• inability to retain key employees in acquired companies;
• inability to retain key customers; and
• assumption of liabilities unrecognised in due diligence.
The growth of BOC’s gases business will depend on the ability to win and execute large 
projects profitably
BOC, through its Process Gas Solutions (PGS) line of business, has a strategy for growth that requires significant
investment each year to serve key customers in different geographies. Failure to execute projects successfully for
these customers will impact PGS’s ability to win new projects from these customers, and therefore may impact
BOC’s future financial results.The specific risks associated with major projects include:
• failure to complete the project on time owing to unforeseen construction problems (which may require BOC
to pay penalties under the terms of the customer contract);
• failure of the plant to deliver the contracted volumes and quantities of product required by the customer
because of design errors or errors in manufacturing or construction (which may require BOC to pay penalties
under the terms of the customer contract); and
• inability to operate the plant at costs assumed in BOC’s financial evaluation of the project.
The safety of BOC’s operations is critical to success
Industrial gases are hazardous substances and BOC recognises that managing safety in operations, transportation
and products is critical to achieve growth and financial results. Failure to maintain high levels of safety can result in a
number of negative outcomes, including:
• fines and penalties for breaches of safety laws;
• liability payments and costs to employees or third parties arising from injury or damage;
• exclusion from certain market sectors deemed important for future development of the business 
(such as medical gases); and
• damage to reputation.
Additionally managing social, environmental and ethical matters is key to BOC’s reputation.
BOC operates in over 50 different countries and is therefore exposed to economic,political,
business and natural catastrophe risks associated with international operations
BOC’s overall success as a business with global operations depends, in part, upon its ability to succeed in differing
economic, political and business conditions. BOC encounters different legal and regulatory requirements in
numerous jurisdictions.These include taxation laws, environmental regulations, regulations concerning operational
standards and competition laws. BOC is also confronted by political risks such as the expropriation of assets and
the inability to export currency.The business risks and challenges faced in each geography include the need to
manage credit risks of local customers, appointing and retaining key staff, general economic conditions locally and
currency fluctuation. Recognition of changing market conditions in local geographies is critical to BOC’s long-term
success, particularly those where BOC anticipates significant investments to achieve growth, for example China.
Additionally, a good understanding of political and economic risks is essential to achieve success from investments in
new geographies. BOC’s operations are exposed to varying degrees of natural catastrophe risk, such as earthquake
and flood, as well as security risk, in the different countries in which BOC operates.
BOC operates in a highly competitive environment
The industrial gases market is very competitive, with several large competitors and a significant number of smaller
local competitors in different territories.Although the current trend in the industry is to seek price increases for
industrial gases, the industry has experienced falling prices in previous years.There is no guarantee that the current
trend will continue and there is a risk that competitors will seek to maintain or increase market shares by reducing
prices.These price reductions would result in lower revenues, profits and cash flows.
Risk factors Risk factors 39
BOC relies on development of,or access to,technology to support business growth 
BOC’s success is dependent in part on its continued investment in technology to develop new products and
services across all businesses, new applications for existing products or to design effective means for producing
industrial gases. Failure to access or develop technology or anticipate, manage or adopt technological changes in
operations or product applications on a timely basis will have a material impact on BOC’s future results. For
example, the rapid development of technology in the semiconductor sector requires BOC Edwards to be aware 
of changes in customer technology requirements and to introduce new products to meet those requirements in a
timely manner. Failure to do so could result in reduced market share and profitability.
Recognising and anticipating changes in the manufacturing economy is key to BOC’s success 
BOC’s industrial gas businesses serve a wide range of manufacturing customers in major geographies such as the
US, UK, Japan and Australia.This is particularly true of the Industrial and Special Products line of business which
provides products and services to customers involved in the welding and cutting of metal, a major source of
revenue for this division.As customers in these traditional manufacturing-based economies seek to move their
manufacturing operations to lower cost territories in, for example,Asia and Latin America, the risk arises that
BOC’s operations in the major geographies will have lower growth opportunities. Failure to recognise these trends
and manage the consequences, through the development of alternative markets and/or meeting demand in higher
growth territories, could have a negative impact on future Group financial results.
BOC’s success depends to a significant extent on its key personnel and employees
BOC’s performance depends on the skills and efforts of its employees and management team across all of its
businesses. BOC recognises that failure to attract new talent and retain existing expertise, knowledge and skills in
operations, products and infrastructure areas such as information technology could have a negative impact on
revenues and profits. In addition, the success of BOC’s acquisitions may depend, in part, on BOC’s ability to retain
management personnel of acquired companies.
Litigation may have an adverse impact on financial results 
The global nature of BOC’s business exposes it to the potential for litigation from third parties. From time to time
BOC is involved in lawsuits, resulting from current and past operations or products.The outcome of these lawsuits
may result in damages and awards which could have a material impact on BOC’s profitability, its business operations
or financial condition. Examples of litigation in the US for past products include allegations of injury arising from the
use of welding electrodes previously manufactured and distributed by BOC in the US.
Increased energy costs could reduce profitability 
The production of industrial gases requires significant amounts of electrical energy. Energy costs are a key
component of the cost of manufacturing industrial gases, and increases in these costs can impact profitability if they
cannot be passed on to customers.Accurately predicting trends in energy costs is difficult to achieve as energy
costs are to a large extent subject to factors beyond the company’s control – for example, political conditions in oil
producing regions. BOC also operates large fleets of commercial vehicles in certain major geographies.An increase
in energy costs associated with the use of these commercial vehicles may negatively impact profit levels.
Further consolidation between major competitors may impact BOC’s competitive position 
A merger between any of the major competitors to BOC within the principal geographies, subject to competition
authority consent, could result in a longer-term deterioration of BOC’s competitive position resulting in reduced
levels of growth. Possible consequences could include:
• an uncompetitive cost base for large projects;
• an inability to participate in further consolidation due to competition concerns;
• retention and/or recruitment of key personnel;
• weakened geographical positions.
Managing joint venture relationships is a key success factor for BOC
BOC needs to ensure that the selection of joint venture partners in new ventures and the relationships with
partners in existing relationships is managed effectively to ensure the full potential for the joint venture is achieved.
Failure to achieve alignment of objectives and manage relationships effectively may negatively impact future growth
and profit levels.
Failure to renew major contracts could reduce profitability
All of BOC’s businesses operate in very competitive markets.The loss of major contracts through competitive
forces, changes in customer purchasing strategy or changes in customer location, could have a negative impact on
Group financial results.
Identifying growth opportunities and productivity improvements are necessary for longer 
term success
Failure to identify and execute growth and productivity opportunities effectively will limit increases in profitability .These
risks can materialise from inadequate processes or a lack of resources to identify opportunities and exploit them.
Adoption of accounting changes or new regulations can increase costs and reduce profitability
The implementation of new accounting requirements (for example, International Financial Reporting Standards) or
regulations (for example, the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act) can incur significant costs which reduce profitability. Increased
costs arise through recruitment of additional resources, consultancy fees to support implementation or increased
external audit fees. Introduction
The Group’s results are prepared under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and comply with 
UK Companies Act requirements.While the UK GAAP reporting basis provides the core information for users of
this report and accounts to understand the financial performance of the Group, management believes that users
will be assisted in understanding the performance relative to previous periods by presenting the results in an
alternative manner.This presentation isolates the impact of currency movements from year to year and eliminates
the impact of exceptional or non-recurring items.This is consistent with the basis used by management to measure
performance of the business and is a component of variable compensation plans.The elements of this alternative
presentation are described in more detail below.
Impact of currency movements
The Group has operations in some 50 countries around the world and the majority of its profit is generated
outside the UK. Results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange against sterling for
the year. Changes in such rates from year to year can significantly affect the Group’s results when these are
presented in pounds sterling. In some cases, such changes may make it difficult to understand underlying business
performance trends without providing additional information. For example, the average value of the US dollar to
pounds sterling changed by three per cent in 2005 compared with 2004. It is important to highlight such currency
movements to users of financial information to help them understand business and regional performance.
Consequently, management has for many years monitored business performance on a ‘constant currency’ basis.
This basis eliminates the impact of changes in the rates of exchange used to translate the results of overseas
businesses into sterling by retranslating the results of the comparative year at the rates of exchange used in the
current year.This is the basis for all internal management reporting throughout the year.
In this operating review, the comparison of financial performance between years may in places be referred to
as on this ‘constant currency’ basis. Comments on all segmental performance are on a constant currency basis.
The impact of changes in the rates of exchange used to translate the results of overseas businesses into
sterling is shown in the table below.

Exceptional or non-recurring items
Management believes that to present the results of the Group in the most meaningful way , items of an exceptional
nature should be separately identified and disclosed.This enables users of the information to have a better
understanding of underlying business performance. Examples of such items in 2005 include the profit on disposal of
the Afrox hospitals business in Africa and costs of restructuring in BOC Edwards. Included in 2004 were the loss on
disposal of the packaged gas business in the US, costs relating to the subsequent restructuring of the remaining US
business and charges relating to the integration process in Japan that began in 2003 following the merger of the
industrial and medical gases businesses there of BOC and Air Liquide to form Japan Air Gases.
40 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005
Operating review  Exceptional items include those items classified as both operating and non-operating under UK GAAP .
The review of results excluding exceptional items is part of the normal internal management reporting
process.The growth in operating profit excluding exceptional items is also one of the measures used in the variable
element of the senior management compensation scheme.
Further information regarding the exceptional items is given in the financial review on page 55.An analysis of
all operating and non-operating exceptional items is given in note 2 b) to the financial statements on page 97.
In this review, the adjustments to eliminate exceptional items have been made to operating profit (both Group
and by segment), profit before tax and earnings per share. Exceptional items are commented on in the Group
results section as well as in the individual business segments to which they relate.A reconciliation of these adjusted
items to the equivalent UK GAAP measure is shown in the profit and loss account on page 86.When any results or
measures used in this review have been adjusted to exclude exceptional items, they are referred to as ‘adjusted’.
Within the individual business segments of the operating review, operating exceptional items are commented 
on separately. Comments on other aspects of financial trends and performance are based on adjusted operating
profit.This provides more meaningful comment on underlying business performance.
A reconciliation of adjusted operating profit to operating profit is given in the table below.

Other non GAAP measures
This review also presents return on capital employed (ROCE) and adjusted return on capital employed.Adjusted
return on capital employed removes exceptional items from the measure of operating profit used in the calculation.
Adjusted return on capital employed is used by management for reasons similar to those described above.
A reconciliation of these two measures is shown below.

The Group commentary in this review also comments on free cash flow. Free cash flow is a measure often
referred to by BOC management and other users of financial information to highlight the cash flow available from
underlying ongoing business operations before acquisition and disposal activity.Whether or not this remains
positive over time is an indicator that dividends to shareholders are being paid out of cash generated by existing
Group businesses.As such it is a useful additional measure of financial performance.
A reconciliation of this measure to the nearest equivalent UK GAAP measure, net cash flow, is shown below.

Operating review 41 Group 
T urnover including the Group share of joint ventures and associates was £4,605.0 million in 2005, similar to the
£4,599.3 million reported in 2004. Operating profit was £543.5 million, down three per cent compared with
£559.5 million in 2004.After crediting operating and non-operating exceptional items totalling £87.9 million and
charging net interest and other financing items of £58.5 million, profit before tax was £593.6 million, up 44 per cent
compared with £412.3 million in 2004. Earnings per share were 74.1p, up 39 per cent compared with 53.5p in
2004. Excluding the exceptional items, adjusted operating profit for the year was £564.2 million, adjusted profit
before tax was £505.7 million and adjusted earnings per share were 67.5p, a record level for BOC.
Comparisons with 2004 are affected by exchange rate movements. For the currencies that principally 
affect the Group’s results, movements in the Australian dollar and the South African rand were favourable and
movements in the US dollar and Japanese yen were adverse. If the results of a year ago had been translated at the
rates applied to this year, turnover would have been increased by £3.8 million.There would have been an increase
in operating profit of £4.9 million and an increase in adjusted operating profit of £4.5 million.Adjusted profit 
before tax would have been £5.2 million higher and adjusted earnings per share would have been 0.5p higher.
The table set out below summarises results reported both under UK GAAP and as adjusted. Results for 
2004 are shown both as reported in that year and on a constant currency basis.

Exceptional items in 2005 amounted to a profit of £87.9 million.This comprised £84.9 million profit on the disposal
of a majority shareholding in Afrox Healthcare Limited, £13.2 million profit relating to the disposal in 2004 of the
US packaged gas business, £10.5 million profit on the disposal of the majority of a shareholding in the US beverage
dispense company, NuCo2 Inc, partly offset by a charge of £20.7 for restructuring in BOC Edwards.
Exceptional items in 2004 amounted to a charge of £92.0 million.This comprised a loss of £79.5 million on
disposal of the US packaged gas business, a charge of £14.8 million for restructuring the remaining business in the
US following the disposal, a charge of £2.6 million relating to the integration of the industrial and medical gases
businesses of BOC and Air Liquide in Japan, and a profit of £4.9 million on the disposal of fixed assets.
Adjusted return on capital employed for the year to 30 September 2005 was 16.2 per cent. Return on 
capital employed for the year to 30 September 2005 was 15.6 per cent. Free cash flow (as defined on page 41)
was £18.6 million in 2005. Net cash flow, after acquisitions, disposals and other investing activities, and including
exceptional cash items, was £91.6 million in 2005.A reconciliation of these measures is shown on page 41.
A first interim dividend for 2005 of 15.9p per share was paid in February 2005 and a second interim dividend
of 25.3p per share was paid in August 2005. In aggregate this was a 3 per cent increase over the annual dividend 
of the previous year.A first interim dividend for 2006 of 16.3p per share has been declared for payment in
February 2006.
Capital expenditure by subsidiaries (including interest capitalised) was £397.3 million in 2005, compared with
£256.1 million in 2004.This was covered by cash inflow from operating activities. Capital expenditure by joint
ventures and associates was £285.9 million in 2005, of which the BOC share was £144.0 million. Equivalent
expenditure in 2004 was £109.0 million, of which the BOC share was £49.2 million.The Group also made
acquisitions of businesses of £57.1 million in 2005 and proceeds from disposals were £224.1 million. Equivalent
items in 2004 were £50.9 million and £98.3 million respectively.

42 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005
Operating review (comparing 2005 with 2004) The principal business factors driving increased turnover in 2005 were increased selling prices to recover higher
power and energy costs, increased turnover within the Linde BOC Process Plants business in the US and strong
demand for gases in the steel sector for most of the year.The recovery of higher power and energy costs is
estimated to have added approximately one per cent to turnover in 2005.T urnover also rose because of an
increase in BOC’s ownership of the business supplying nitrogen for enhanced oil recovery in Mexico and as a result
of changes to the terms of a supply scheme contract in the US.These two factors added approximately five per
cent to turnover in 2005 compared with 2004.
New plants had a relatively smaller impact on turnover during 2005.Those contributing additional sales
included a hydrogen plant supplying Citgo in the US and a new air separation unit supplying the Sinopec and BASF
joint venture petrochemical plant in Nanjing, China. New plants added less than one per cent to turnover in 2005
compared with 2004.
Operating profit increased less rapidly than turnover principally because of the factors that raised turnover
without a corresponding impact on profit.These included increased prices to recover higher input costs and the
changed contract.
During 2005, BOC continued to be successful in winning new on-site supply contracts with major customers
in the oil and petrochemical industries and in Asia with steel customers.Three new plants are under construction
for the supply of hydrogen to US refiners for the production of cleaner-burning fuels and to improve the processing
of heavier crude feedstocks.When these plants are fully commissioned they are expected to approximately double
BOC’s worldwide hydrogen capacity.At the same time, new air separation capacity is being added to satisfy
growing demand from steel and petrochemical customers in Asia.A new plant is being built for a petrochemical
customer at Map T a Phut in Thailand and several large-scale plants are under construction in China for both steel
and chemical customers. One of the largest projects currently under way is the addition of a fifth production
module to the complex supplying nitrogen for the re-pressurisation of oil wells in the Gulf of Mexico.This facility is
already the largest nitrogen plant in the world and has already proved its worth in boosting oil production.The new
module will increase nitrogen production by approximately 25 per cent. Much of this new capacity is scheduled to
be commissioned in late 2006 and during 2007.
There were no operating exceptional items in 2005. Operating exceptional items in 2004 were for the
integration of the industrial and medical gases businesses of BOC and Air Liquide in Japan that began in 2003.
Europe Economic conditions were mixed during 2005 with some difficult trends in the UK and Ireland partly offset
by industrial growth in Poland.The adverse impact of lower merchant volumes in some sectors was to a large
extent offset by further savings from improved operating efficiency.
In the UK, industrial gases demand from the steel and chemical sectors was strong in 2005, leading to better
tonnage volumes. However, demand for liquefied gases declined as a result of generally sluggish activity in some
manufacturing sectors exacerbated by sharp increases in energy costs.These also impacted BOC’s merchant gases
business. Higher power costs were generally recovered in selling prices but increased prices led some customers to
reduce their consumption of industrial gases, while a few ceased production in the UK.
There has been another significant increase in UK power prices for 2006 and further selling price increases are
being implemented with customers.
BOC’s business in Poland continued to benefit from general economic growth and strong demand in the
steel industry.
Sales volumes were lower in Ireland as some traditional industries declined while economic growth was
concentrated in the service sectors.
Cryostar’s  business as a manufacturer of cryogenic pumps, expansion turbines and compressors continued to
grow in 2005.These devices are used for a variety of industrial gas applications and for marine liquefied natural gas
(LNG) tankers.
The Americas Buoyant conditions in the steel industry led to strong demand for tonnage gases in the US during
the first half of 2005. Some slowdown became apparent during the second half and this, together with isolated
plant outages, reduced tonnage volumes in the second half and for the year as a whole. Higher power costs were
progressively recovered by increased selling prices in the merchant market for liquefied atmospheric gases and
demand remained firm. Carbon dioxide sales benefited from strong demand for enhanced oil recovery rather than
for food and beverage applications.
During 2005, BOC invested in new carbon dioxide capacity to satisfy demand for oil recovery in T exas and
made a number of smaller investments to optimise the US supply chain network and reduce delivery costs.
In Latin America, the contribution from the joint venture supplying nitrogen to Pemex for re-pressurising its
Cantarell oilfield was increased in 2005 as a result of BOC’s acquisition of Duke Energy’s 30 per cent interest.This
transaction was completed in September 2004 and increased BOC’s overall stake to 65 per cent. Construction of
a fifth production module that will increase output by approximately 25 per cent is now under way and on
schedule. Meanwhile some improvement in the efficiency of existing production units is expected from a routine
maintenance schedule that is currently in progress.
Africa Sales volumes increased in 2005 as a result of continuing firm demand for tonnage gases in the South
African steel sector and increasing consumption of liquid nitrogen by food manufacturers. Higher selling prices also
contributed to increased turnover. New long-term supply contracts were signed with customers in the metals and
automotive components industries. During 2006, investments will be made to fulfil these contracts and to satisfy
growing demand for liquefied gases in the merchant market.
Operating review (comparing 2005 with 2004) 43 Asia/Pacific Sales growth in north Asia was supported by production from new and recently commissioned plants
in China.There was also growing demand for liquefied gases in the merchant markets not only in China but also in
Korea and in T aiwan, where available capacity was fully utilised. Further investment by China’s leading steel and
chemicals producers continued strongly in 2005 leading to opportunities for long-term supply schemes.
A new 1,400 tonnes-a-day air separation unit was commissioned by BOC’s joint venture with Sinopec in
Nanjing during the year and began to supply Sinopec’s new joint venture with BASF when that began operation in
2005.T wo new air separation plants were also commissioned in south China to supply steel customers 
during 2005.T wo 1,400 tonnes-a-day air separation units are under construction to supply gases for expanded
production at the T aiyuan Iron & Steel Corporation (TISCO), which is already the largest stainless steel producer in
China and one of the biggest in the world. Construction of a further two similarly large air separation units to
supply the Maanshan Iron & Steel Company (Ma Steel) began before the end of 2005.
In Japan, demand for industrial gases from the steel, chemical and glass industries remained strong in 2005.
During the year, BOC’s Japan Air Gases joint venture brought on stream a new 2,100 tonnes-a-day plant serving a
major steel customer.
BOC’s most important PGS businesses in south and south east Asia are in Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and
India.The major market sectors for PGS across the region are steel, petrochemicals and the food industry.
The Thai economy continued to expand in 2005 and BOC’s business there benefited from growth of the
chemical industry. Despite a continuation of US anti-dumping measures that held back prawn exports, there was
some recovery in the food-freezing sector leading to increased sales of carbon dioxide and liquefied nitrogen.
MIG Production Co. Ltd (MIGP), a joint venture between BOC’s Thai subsidiary Thai Industrial Gases PCL
and Bangkok Industrial Gas Company Ltd has been awarded a long-term contract to supply 800 tonnes a day of
oxygen to a new mono ethylene glycol project operated by TOC Glycol Co. Ltd. (TOCGC) in Map T a Phut,
Thailand. MIGP is investing US$50 million to build an air separation unit on an adjacent site to TOCGC’s new mono
ethylene glycol plant. Scheduled to come on-stream in 2006, the facility will produce 1,300 tonnes of oxygen a day,
making it the largest air separation unit in Thailand.The excess capacity from the new facility will serve the parent
companies’ tonnage and merchant markets.
Business in Malaysia was supported by buoyant conditions in the steel sector for most of the year despite
some softening of demand in the final quarter. Demand from the Malaysian chemical industry also improved 
in 2005. Business trends in Singapore were positive in 2005, led by expanding activity in the chemicals and
electronics sectors.
Strong demand for industrial gases by the steel, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and glass sectors coupled with
positive selling price trends led to accelerated growth in India.
BOC’s subsidiary, BOC India Ltd, has been awarded the contract for supplying the gases requirements for an
expansion programme being undertaken by Jindal Vijaynagar Steel Limited at Bellary in Southern India. BOC India
Ltd has signed a fifteen-year agreement to supply 1,400 tonnes a day of oxygen and nitrogen and is building a new
855 tonnes-a-day air separation unit at Bellary, which is due to be commissioned in 2006. Management sees this
latest investment of up to US$40 million as a major move in developing its strategy in southern India.
Elsewhere in the region, business developed well in Pakistan but growth in the Philippines was constrained by
product availability. Production of oxygen at BOC’s plant at Gresik in Indonesia was limited during 2005 by the
availability of natural gas to generate power. Use of diesel fuel as an alternative led to less efficient operation.
In Australia economic growth continued in 2005 but at a slower rate than in 2004 and there was relatively
little new plant investment.World commodity prices remained firm leading to sustained demand from the mineral
processing and steel industries for tonnage gases. Higher energy and labour costs in 2005 were generally recovered
by increased selling prices.
During 2005, BOC renewed its long-term contract to supply a leading titanium dioxide pigment manufacturer.
The Government of Western Australia’s environmentally friendly fuel cell bus project, which began in 2004
with three hydrogen-fuelled buses operating in the city of Perth, was commercialised in 2005. BOC’s hydrogen
purification plant and re-fuelling facility supports BP in this project.
Water services Further business was secured during 2005 with industrial rather than municipal customers, in
accordance with BOC’s strategic objectives for this business. Much of the new business continued to be with food
manufacturers but there was also increasing interest for water services in the chemicals and refining sectors.

44 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 Operating review (comparing 2005 with 2004) T urnover was lower in 2005 as a result of the disposal of BOC’s packaged gas business in the US in July 2004 and
the disposal of part of the Unique Gas business in Thailand in December 2004.These disposals accounted for a 
ten per cent decrease in turnover for 2005 compared with 2004.The effect of disposals on turnover was partly
offset by growth in Europe,Africa and the south Pacific region.
The elimination of overhead costs following the US packaged gas disposal helped towards an increase in
operating profit.This together with new business won was reflected in a £15 million increase in north American
adjusted operating profit in 2005. Other factors supporting profitability were the extension of ‘best commercial
practice’ and ‘best operating practice’ business efficiency programmes to more parts of the world.
Further progress was made with the refurbishment of retail stores - particularly in South Africa and Australia -
during 2005 and this led to increased sales. Retail outlets also supported the growth of BOC’s safety products
business.At the same time further comprehensive safety product contracts were won with major customers.
New user-friendly product packages, including lightweight cylinders for emergency services, continued to drive
sales growth of medical gases.T urnover of medical gases for BOC’s major subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates
(excluding Japan) increased by seven per cent in 2005.There was also good growth in the special products and
services business, which includes scientific gases, refrigerant gases and other packaged chemicals. Special gases
turnover increased by 11 per cent in 2005 on the same basis.
Higher petroleum prices in 2005 presented a challenge to margins in the liquefied petroleum gas businesses in
Australia and South Africa but most of the cost increases were recovered in higher selling prices.
Demand for helium remained strong worldwide, driven by increasing use of medical imaging. New helium
capacity is expected to come into production in Qatar in 2006.This will make more product available to BOC but
at a higher price than existing supplies.
There were no operating exceptional items in 2005. Operating exceptional items in 2004 were for the
integration of the industrial and medical gases businesses of BOC and Air Liquide in Japan that began in 2003, as
well as for the restructuring of the ISP business in the US following the disposal of the packaged gas business.
Europe Increased turnover reflected growing sales of medical and special products in the UK and generally
favourable business trends in Poland.The UK industrial market remained flat, but BOC’s business was expanded by
increased sales of welding products. Increased energy costs were recovered by increased selling prices.
Growth in the medical gases business was once again driven by the introduction of new lightweight cylinder
packages and by winning hospital facilities management contracts.
Increased turnover of special products was based largely on growing sales of gas mixtures for scientific
applications and additional helium business. New capacity is being added to satisfy additional requirements for
Siemens Magnet T echnology (formerly Oxford Magnet T echnology) the leading MRI scanner manufacturer. BOC
already manages Siemens’ helium requirements during manufacturing and will now provide on-site services for
Siemens magnets in hospitals.Additional sales also resulted from the acquisition of Calor’s aerosol propellants and
hydrocarbon refrigerants business in the UK.
Growth of BOC’s Sureflow hospitality gas and cellar services business was curtailed by lower sales of draught
beer in the UK during 2005.Additional business was gained in Ireland by providing cellar services for a major
brewery chain.
Changes in the provision of domiciliary oxygen in England and Wales were announced by the National Health
Service in 2005. BOC was awarded one of the 11 regional contracts and from February 2006 will supply all forms
of domiciliary oxygen to patients for the Eastern region. It is expected that this will lead to a reduction of BOC’s
home oxygen sales in the UK over the next two years. However, the majority of BOC’s UK medical gases business
is with hospitals and the emergency services, which is unaffected by this change.
The AmericasThe disposal of BOC’s US packaged gas business was completed on 30 July 2004 when initial cash
proceeds of US$175 million were received.This business had turnover of approximately US$240 million in 2003.
The ISP business in the US now consists of bulk medical gases, bulk supplies to distributors, tube trailer and
liquefied helium. BOC’s US overhead costs were reduced following the disposal, as the business was then
concentrated on a much smaller number of customers.As a result the US business became profitable in 2005.
During 2005, new distributor channels were added, new helium business was secured in the US and new bulk
industrial contracts were won with biotechnology and laser welding customers.
Buoyant conditions in the oil and gas industry helped towards an improved performance in Canada 
during 2005.
BOC’s global helium business grew strongly in 2005 with increasing demand in China and Korea. During 2006
the first supplies from a new source in Qatar will enable these markets to be served more efficiently. However the
financial impact is expected to be negative initially as additional volumes will be offset by higher feedstock costs.
Growth in Latin America was driven by increased sales in Venezuela and Colombia, where the medical sector
is the most important. However there was also growth in the industrial markets served by BOC’s associated
company based in Chile.
Africa Lower interest rates continued to stimulate South African domestic consumption and manufacturing output
during 2005, leading to better turnover for the African region. Operating profit also increased but by somewhat less
than turnover, which was additionally inflated by higher liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) prices.
T urnover grew in every part of the South African business but was led by particularly strong sales of safety
products. During 2005 Afrox Safety was launched as a business brand and an on-site safety services business was
acquired. Sales of scientific gases increased but from a relatively low base.
Despite the challenge of a strong South African rand, export business also grew considerably. Plans are in
place to expand production of welding products for local use and particularly for export.
Other African countries also produced satisfactory results with particularly good performances in Kenya 
and Zambia.
Operating review (comparing 2005 with 2004) 45 Asia/Pacific Most of the countries in south and south east Asia achieved good results in 2005 with especially strong
performances in India,Thailand and Bangladesh. Results in India were additionally supported by a profit from the
disposal of some land in Bangalore.
At the same time, trading conditions during 2005 were difficult in Malaysia and industrial activity continued to
decline in Hong Kong as production drifted to mainland China.This trend also continued to affect T aiwan but to a
lesser extent.
BOC’s industrial products business remains relatively undeveloped in China. Few attractive opportunities have
been identified but growing demand for helium provides a better prospect.
The growth of automobile production stimulated demand for welding gases and investment in special gases
and packaged chemicals production facilities supported increased sales of these products in Asia generally.
In Japan, both turnover and adjusted operating profit were similar to a year ago.
An improved performance in the south Pacific region was driven by demand from the natural resources
sector and increased sales of safety products while consumption of welding products and gases by the
manufacturing sector grew more slowly.This reflects somewhat slower growth in the Australian economy than 
in 2004.
Growth was focused in the mining regions of Western Australia, Queensland and Papua New Guinea. BOC
was also successful in winning significant contracts to supply safety and personal protective products to Xstrata in
Australia and to New Zealand Steel.These added to similar contracts won with Western Mining in 2004.
The construction of a new special gases centre is under way at Wagga Wagga, in Australia, to meet the
increasing demand for packaged chemicals such as ammonia, ethylene oxide and sulphur dioxide. Meanwhile the
gradual re-development of BOC’s retail Gas and Gear stores that began in 2004 continued in 2005 and is now
approximately two thirds completed.
BOC’s joint venture company supplying liquefied petroleum gas in Australia faced the twin challenges of a
sharp rise in input costs and the warmest winter on record in 2005. Lower consumption for heating applications
therefore led to a decline in volumes.

The upturn in semiconductor equipment spending that had helped BOC Edwards’ order intake and financial
performance in 2004 was not repeated in 2005.At the same time, margins continued to be adversely affected by
weakness of the US dollar, which is the currency in which much of BOC Edwards’ revenue is earned.The adjusted
operating profit for 2005 would have been approximately £9 million more if transactions had been conducted at
the exchange rates of a year ago.Adjusted operating profit was therefore lower in 2005, despite some initial benefit
from cost reduction programmes.
Where new semiconductor or liquid crystal display (LCD) business was placed, BOC was generally successful
in retaining or improving its market share. Demand for integrated subsystems combining vacuum and exhaust
management technologies grew in 2005. BOC Edwards is now launching a new plasma abatement system for the
destruction of ozone-depleting PFC chemicals, which are found in the exhaust streams after etch processes in
semiconductor, LCD and solar cell manufacture. BOC Edwards also became a leading supplier of subsystems for
immersion lithography. For the latest generation of LCD fabrication units, BOC Edwards has also launched its own
iFxK and iHxK high-capacity pumping systems. For semiconductor applications, a new cost-effective turbomolecular
pumping system, whose magnetic bearings are controlled without the use of sensors, was developed.
Demand for component cleaning services and electronic materials was slightly lower as some semiconductor
production rates were reduced in 2005 to reduce stock levels. During 2005 BOC Edwards formed a joint venture
to extend its component cleaning business into T aiwan.
While nitrogen trifluoride prices continued to fall in 2005, BOC Edwards made good progress with its
alternative technology of on-site fluorine generation systems for cleaning vapour deposition chambers. Production
of fluorine generators has already been established in Korea to achieve lower production and distribution costs to
serve the expanding customer base in Asia.
In October 2004 BOC Edwards expanded its electronic materials offering to include wet chemicals for flat
panel display, semiconductor, and solar cell customers throughout Asia, by purchasing a 50 per cent ownership in
Asia Union Electronic Chemical Corporation (AUECC) .This company also formed a joint venture with Shanghai
Huayi (Group) Company to supply wet process chemicals to the growing electronics manufacturing industry in
China.Through the joint venture,AUECC will use Shanghai as a base to produce, package and distribute a full range
of ultra high-purity process chemicals for the semiconductor and flat panel display industries.
In 2005 BOC Edwards retained strong positions in the bulk gases markets of T aiwan and China and improved
its position in Korea. New production capacity was added to the existing pipeline network in the Hsinchu business
park in T aiwan and additional business was obtained in the business parks at Suzhou, China. BOC Edwards has also
established a position supplying customers in the new Cheng Du park in China. In Korea, BOC won potentially
significant gases business with Samsung, having previously been a major supplier of semiconductor equipment.
BOC’s joint venture company also won new business with semiconductor manufacturers in Singapore.
46 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 Operating review (comparing 2005 with 2004) There was better demand for vacuum equipment from the chemicals industry and from the aerospace industry for
metallurgical applications in 2005.A general improvement in Asian markets also helped towards better results from
BOC Edwards’ general vacuum business.Vacuum pump production was expanded in the Czech Republic and
some system assembly operations were established in Brazil during 2005.
Deliveries of pharmaceutical freeze-drying and packaging systems were at a higher level than in 2004.The
establishment of a new low-cost manufacturing base in China has opened up new possibilities for business with the
fast-growing pharmaceutical industry in Asia generally and particularly in India.
Exceptional costs of £20.7 million were charged within BOC Edwards during 2005. Some £14 million relates
to the impairment of goodwill.The remainder is a charge for restructuring. Savings of approximately £5 million are
targeted from this restructuring.
Operating exceptional items in 2004 were for the integration of the industrial and medical gases businesses of
BOC and Air Liquide in Japan that began in 2003.

The disposal of the majority shareholding in Afrox Healthcare Limited to a consortium led by two major black
empowerment investors was completed on 22 March 2005.African Oxygen Limited (Afrox), BOC’s subsidiary 
in South Africa, retains a significant interest in the hospitals business through a 20 per cent holding in the new
company. Until disposal,Afrox Healthcare Limited was fully consolidated into the BOC Group accounts. For the
second half of 2005, a 20 per cent share of the results of the new company, with its adjusted operating profit and
net interest charge, was included in the BOC Group profit and loss account.The comparisons above are therefore
distorted by this change.
After adjusting for this disposal and change of accounting treatment, the underlying performance of the Afrox
hospitals business remained positive during 2005.
The disposal proceeds were received by Afrox in March and distributed to The BOC Group and Afrox
minority shareholders by means of a special dividend in June, followed by a share buy-back in July 2005.

3. All comments below are on a constant currency basis.
While the market for distribution services remained difficult in the UK throughout 2005, Gist continued to expand
sales with existing customers and won new business.The higher turnover was not reflected in better operating
profit, principally because of increased pension costs. Gist accounts for a substantial proportion of BOC’s UK
workforce and the impact of pension costs is therefore significant.
Food business with Marks & Spencer, Gists’ major customer, expanded in 2005 as more new retail outlets
were opened. Logistic operations for the Ocado home food service in association with Waitrose also continued to
grow. Existing services for Carlsberg (UK) were expanded in 2005 and new business was won with Woolworths.
In September 2005 the Van Dongen group of logistics companies based in the Netherlands was acquired.
This adds to Gist’s primary distribution operations, bringing products from food manufacturers into the supply
chain. It also extends the reach into continental Europe, which is becoming an increasing source of food products
for UK retailers.This wider network has already generated additional business between the UK and continental
Europe from a number of existing and new customers.
In November 2005, Gist was awarded an extension to its food logistics contract with Marks & Spencer.
The contract covers the retailer’s growing food business until 2011, confirming it as one of the UK’s largest food
logistics contracts.
Corporate
Corporate costs increased in 2005 partly as a result of additional spending on procedures to ensure compliance with
Sarbanes-Oxley legislation and discretionary spending on litigation support in the US.The corporate charge also
included a provision of £4.3 million for environmental clean-up in the US.
Operating review (comparing 2005 with 2004) 47 48 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005
Group
T urnover including the Group share of joint ventures and associates was £4,599.3 million in 2004, up six per cent
compared with £4,323.2 million in 2003. Operating profit was £559.5 million, up 28 per cent compared with
£438.6 million in 2003.After charging operating and non-operating exceptional items totalling £92.0 million and net
interest and other financing items of £72.6 million, profit before tax was £412.3 million, up 17 per cent compared
with £351.9 million in 2003. Earnings per share were 53.5p, up 20 per cent compared with 44.5p in 2003. Excluding
the exceptional items, adjusted operating profit for the year was £576.9 million, adjusted profit before tax was
£504.3 million and adjusted earnings per share were 63.2p.
Comparisons of 2004 with 2003 were affected by exchange rate movements. For the currencies that
principally affect the Group’s results, movements in the Australian dollar and the South African rand were
favourable and movements in the US dollar and Japanese yen were adverse. If the 2003 results had been translated
at the rates applied to 2004, turnover would have been reduced by £88.8 million.There would have been an
increase in operating profit of £3.3 million and a decrease in adjusted operating profit of £2.2 million.Adjusted
profit before tax would have been £2.9 million higher and adjusted earnings per share would have been 0.2p lower.

Exceptional items in 2004 amounted to a charge of £92.0 million.This comprised a loss of £79.5 million on 
disposal of the US packaged gas business, a charge of £14.8 million for restructuring the remaining business in the
US following the disposal, a charge of £2.6 million relating to the integration of the industrial and medical gases
businesses of BOC and Air Liquide in Japan, and a profit of £4.9 million on the disposal of fixed assets.
Exceptional items in 2003 comprised £43.2 million for a litigation settlement, costs of £15.5 million for
completion of restructuring programmes and £8.3 million relating to the integration of the BOC and Air Liquide
businesses in Japan.
Adjusted return on capital employed for the year to 30 September 2004 was 15.4 per cent. Return on capital
employed for the year to 30 September 2004 was 14.9 per cent. Free cash flow (as defined on page 41) was
£257.9 million in 2004. Net cash flow, after acquisitions, disposals and other investing activities, and including
exceptional cash items, was £339.2 million in 2004.A reconciliation of these measures is shown on page 41.
A first interim dividend for 2004 of 15.5p per share was paid in February 2004 and a second interim dividend
of 24.5p per share was paid in August 2004. In aggregate this was a 2.6 per cent increase over the annual dividend
of the previous year.
Capital expenditure by subsidiaries (including interest capitalised) was £256.1 million in 2004, compared 
with £281.2 million in 2003.This was covered by cash inflow from operating activities. Capital expenditure by 
joint ventures and associates was £109.0 million in 2004, of which the BOC share was £49.2 million. Equivalent
expenditure in 2003 was £81.4 million, of which the BOC share was £36.1 million.The Group also made
acquisitions of businesses of £50.9 million in 2004 and proceeds from disposals were £98.3 million. Equivalent 
items in 2003 were £135.5 million and £3.9 million respectively.

Increased turnover reflected strong demand worldwide for both steel and nonferrous metals. In addition, sales from
new production facilities accounted for approximately £14 million of the increase in turnover between 2003 and 2004.
Metal production increased in 2004 and world metal prices firmed as a result of strong demand from China.
This benefited BOC’s steel and nonferrous metal customers in all the key markets throughout the year.
For 2004 as a whole, the food sector was buoyant outside the US despite the temporary consequences of
avian flu in Asia and the imposition of US import tariffs on prawns.
The recovery in the electronics packaging industry created exceptionally strong demand for industrial gases 
in the electronics packaging sector. BOC was a leading beneficiary of this because of its strong position in 
Asian markets.
Operating review (comparing 2004 with 2003) Operating review (comparing 2004 with 2003) 49
Several significant new supply scheme contracts were won in 2004. BOC’s hydrogen business with refiners will be
substantially increased with a new plant to supply both a Sunoco refinery at T oledo, Ohio, and a nearby BP refinery.
The hydrogen will be used by both BP and Sunoco in the production of ultra-low sulphur gasoline and diesel fuels.
Outside the US, significant new business in the chemical sector was won with the Sinopec Shanghai
Petrochemical Company. BOC will form a joint venture to invest in existing assets and then add further air
separation capacity. BOC’s subsidiary in Thailand is to invest in a venture establishing a 1,300 tonnes-a-day plant to
supply TOC Glycol Co. Ltd. (TOCGC) in Map T a Phut and to increase merchant capacity in the area.
New business with steel customers was mainly concentrated in Asia. In January 2004, BOC announced that its
joint venture with the T aiyuan Iron and Steel Corporation (TISCO) would expand its existing 1,500 tonnes-a-day
capacity with the construction of two new 1,400 tonnes-a-day air separation units.
In the UK, BOC supplies Corus at its Port T albot, Scunthorpe, Rotherham and Redcar plants. BOC is to
increase its industrial gases supply to the Port T albot strip products plant by 30 per cent to increase steel
production locally.
Selling prices were generally firm during 2004 and sufficient to offset input cost inflation except in parts of
north Asia.
Operating exceptional items in 2004 were for the integration of the industrial and medical gases businesses 
of BOC and Air Liquide in Japan that began in 2003.
EuropeT urnover increased in all parts of Europe except for Ireland.Adjusted operating profit increased significantly,
mainly as a result of more efficient plant operation and careful control of costs.
In the UK, manufacturing activity remained generally weak but customer closures and relocations that had
affected business in 2003 were less evident in 2004. Rising steel production led to increased demands for oxygen.
Price increases were generally sufficient to cover higher input costs in 2004. Further increases are being
implemented in 2005 to cover sharply higher electricity prices in the UK following the expiry of a fixed price 
supply contract.
Cryostar manufactures cryogenic pumps, expansion turbines and compressors for a variety of industrial gas
applications and for marine liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers.As in 2003, turnover and adjusted operating profit
increased in 2004 principally as a result of demand for shipboard compression units on LNG tankers and following
continued investments for gases plants in Asia.
North AmericaT urnover increased as a result of including a full year of syngas production for Celanese at 
Clear Lake,T exas and the start-up of a new plant supplying hydrogen to Citgo’s refinery at Lemont, Illinois,
in October 2003.
Adjusted operating profit was lower as a result of reduced carbon dioxide volumes to our food and dry ice
customers, and reduced argon demand from the stainless steel and wholesale sectors.
In general, demand for industrial gases from steel customers was strong in 2004. Liquid nitrogen volumes for
food freezing applications strengthened during the year, mitigating the reduced carbon dioxide volumes into this
sector. BOC’s carbon dioxide business with beverage customers continued to make good progress in 2004 and
new business was won.
Selling prices remained generally firm and significant increases in fuel and energy costs were largely recovered
with surcharges or general price rises.
Latin America Revenues increased across the region during 2004, although business in Venezuela continued to 
be affected by political uncertainty. In Brazil, BOC’s new 400 tonnes-a-day plant entered production serving CST ,
the world’s biggest producer of slab steel.
The benefits of re-pressurising the Pemex Cantarell oilfield in the Gulf of Mexico with nitrogen from BOC’s
joint venture company continued to be realised during the year. In May 2004 BOC agreed to buy Duke Energy’s 
30 per cent ownership interest in the joint venture company for US$59.7 million in cash.This increased BOC’s
overall stake to 65 per cent on completion in September 2004.
AfricaT urnover increased and adjusted operating profit was further improved by cost savings and firm pricing
trends leading to better margins.Although the stronger rand adversely affected platinum and gold mining in 2004,
strong demand and firmer prices led to increased activity in the steel industry.
JapanThe combination of BOC’s and Air Liquide’s industrial and medical gases businesses in Japan took effect from
January 2003.This distorts the comparison of turnover and profit for BOC’s three lines of business between 2004
and 2003 and with earlier years.The results of Japan Air Gases were consolidated on an equity basis throughout
2004 and for the last three quarters of 2003. In 2004 turnover increased mainly as a result of equipment sales and
adjusted operating profit increased faster as a result of achieving integration cost savings as planned.
North AsiaT urnover and adjusted operating profit increased in 2004 but at a more modest pace than in 2003.
Production plants across the region were almost fully utilised and little new capacity came on stream in 2004.
In China, turnover and adjusted operating profit increased in line with economic trends but further growth
was constrained by available production capacity and by some unplanned shutdowns, mainly at customers’ plants.
BOC announced a new joint venture with Sinopec Shanghai Petrochemical Company Limited (SPC), a
subsidiary of Sinopec Corporation, to meet the industrial gases needs of SPC in the Jinshan District of Shanghai.
Economic conditions were stable in Korea but increased turnover and adjusted operating profit came from
some additional argon and hydrogen capacity to supply customers near Pohang.
T urnover in T aiwan increased as a result of full capacity utilisation but adjusted operating profit increased
significantly as a result of improved efficiency in plant operations.
Hong Kong also enjoyed a better economic climate in 2004 for the same reasons and adjusted operating
profit was sharply better. South and South East AsiaThese regions came under the same business unit management during 2004.
The economies continued to be buoyant across both regions during the year, helped by generally strong steel
demand and a more active electronics industry in Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines.
The SARS infection that had adversely affected 2003 was no longer an issue in 2004 but in Thailand and
Malaysia the food sector was hit by an outbreak of avian flu.The Thai shrimp industry was further affected by the
imposition of US tariffs on imports.
In September 2004, BOC’s subsidiary in Thailand announced a major investment in new joint venture air
separation capacity to supply oxygen for ethylene glycol production and to increase the availability of products for
sale in the expanding merchant market around Map T a Phut.
South PacificT urnover and adjusted operating profit were higher than a year ago.The Australian and New Zealand
economies remained generally strong in 2004.The strength of local currencies led to some further customer plant
closures but firm commodity prices for minerals and particularly for steel enabled leading customers to prosper.
There was some increase in tonnage volumes but volumes overall were similar to a year ago.
Electricity prices increased in eastern Australia and more so in New Zealand. Increased costs were passed
through to tonnage customers and progressively recovered in the merchant markets.At the same time, BOC’s
major plants in Australia achieved significant cost savings as a result of implementing a global plant optimisation
programme.
During 2004 BOC outsourced the transport of its bulk products to Australia’s leading transport company,
while retaining control of distribution and scheduling.This change was made only after ensuring that there would be
no diminution of safety standards or the quality of service to customers.
A hydrogen purification plant and bus re-fuelling facility to support BP in the Government of Western
Australia’s environmentally friendly fuel cell bus trial came into operation during September 2004.Three hydrogen-
fuelled buses will be operating in the city of Perth.The trial is to continue for at least the next two years.
Water services BOC acquired Environmental Management Corporation (EMC), a US water services company in
October 2002.T urnover increased modestly in 2004 but the business remained close to breakeven after the
amortisation of goodwill as a result of planned costs to increase business development resources.
BOC’s strategy for water services is to focus on its industrial customers. Significant new business was won
during 2004, including a multiyear contract for process and waste water services to a major US beef producer.
Tightening regulations for proteins in effluent seem likely to create fresh demands for water treatment in the food
industry.

3. All comments below are on a constant currency basis.
Nearly all regions delivered better results in 2004 with increased turnover in most countries and an overall
improvement in operating margin. Robust economic conditions supported a further improvement in the south
Pacific region and Africa delivered better results despite the handicap of the stronger currency on manufacturing
and mining.There was also some improvement in the US manufacturing economy.
At the same time further progress was made in successfully integrating the businesses recently acquired in
Canada and Poland.
Sales to the medical sector grew further in 2004 as a result of both gases and liquid helium sales. Heliox, a
new low-density breathing mixture was introduced in the UK and in Australia.This product enables patients with
obstructed airways to breathe more easily and thereby provides time to treat the underlying problems. Helium is
also used to cool the coils of superconducting magnets in MRI scanners. BOC not only sells the liquid nitrogen and
helium cryogens but offers a related CryoFill service, taking responsibility for filling customers’ magnets. Helium sales
also increased in T aiwan,Thailand and China, where significant growth potential has been identified and where an
important distributor agreement was signed with Meike.The cost of producing and purchasing helium continued 
to increase rapidly during 2004 but BOC was largely successful in recovering higher costs in selling prices to
customers. BOC installed helium recovery systems at the University of Liverpool in the UK and at Trane in the 
US during 2004.
Consistent progress was made in growing refrigerant sales.The alliance with Hudson T echnologies for the
reclaim of contaminated refrigerants began operation in the UK during 2004 and will be applied in South Africa 
in 2005.
BOC’s major liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) businesses in Australia and South Africa were notably successful 
in managing volatile input costs and sustaining margins during 2004 as LPG prices increased sharply.
50 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 Operating review (comparing 2004 with 2003) Sales of industrial products increased in aggregate although some developed markets continued to reflect weak
manufacturing activity. Business development was helped by upgrading the retail environment of outlets in some
major markets and by the continued introduction of safety products to the markets in the UK,Australia and 
South Africa.
Operating exceptional items in 2004 were for the integration of the industrial and medical gases businesses of
BOC and Air Liquide in Japan that began in 2003, as well as for the restructuring of the ISP business in the US
following the disposal of the packaged gas business.
EuropeT urnover and adjusted operating profit increased further in 2004. Manufacturing activity continued to
decline in the UK but BOC maintained a strong position in the market. Improved service levels enabled selling price
increases to be implemented.At the same time costs were reduced through improved productivity.
Modest increases in industrial product sales were helped by rejuvenation of retail outlets in the UK. Medical
product sales increased as a result of gaining additional National Health Service business and continued demand for
lightweight oxygen cylinders.The range of lightweight cylinders will be expanded by introducing additional sizes
during 2005.
The new business supplying helium to Oxford Magnet T echnology for medical imaging devices began in 2003
and performed well throughout 2004. It was also the first full year of the refrigerant reclaim service in the UK,
based on an exclusive global licence with Hudson T echnologies.A range of gases for scientific applications was
introduced during the year and some additional sales were generated following the launch of a mail order
catalogue for gases and related products. BOC’s Sureflow beverage dispense gas operation was expanded by new
business for Heineken outlets in Ireland during 2004.
BOC’s business in Poland was enlarged from February 2003 with the acquisition of Praxair’s Polish business.
2004 was therefore the first full year of the expanded business and there were further integration benefits.
North AmericaThe BOC Group announced on 27 January 2004 that it had signed a letter of intent to sell its US
packaged gas business to Airgas.This business had turnover of approximately US$240 million in 2003.The disposal
was completed on 30 July 2004 upon receipt of initial cash proceeds of US$175 million.
Following this transaction, the ISP business in north America consists of bulk medical gases, bulk supplies to
distributors, tube trailer and liquefied helium in the US as well as the Canadian packaged gas business. In total these
elements currently generate turnover of some US$450 million a year.
The impending disposal of the US packaged gas business created a challenging business environment for a
significant part of the year. US sales volumes and adjusted operating profit were lower in the period prior to the
disposal.
T urnover increased in Canada principally as a result of the acquisition of Air Products Canadian gases and
related products business with effect from April 2003. Cost synergies arising from the integration further boosted
adjusted operating profit in 2004.
Latin AmericaT urnover increased significantly and margins improved. Growth across the region was driven
principally by sales of medical products supplemented by sales of BOC-branded cutting and welding equipment.
Sales of packaged chemicals increased in Colombia and Venezuela.
Results improved strongly in Venezuela, despite a continuation of political unrest. BOC’s associated company
achieved better results in Chile but there was a sharper improvement in Argentina.
Selling price increases offset inflation in Venezuela and Chile but the trends were less favourable in Colombia
during 2004.A new customer service centre was opened in Venezuela and new business systems were successfully
implemented in Venezuela and Colombia during the year.
Africa Important sections of South African industry were depressed during 2004 because of the stronger currency.
Rand exchange rates reduced the profitability of gold mining and manufacturing for export in particular.At the
same time the cost of imported goods was lowered making them more competitive with those manufactured
locally. However lower interest rates began to stimulate domestic consumption towards the end of the year.
Despite the more difficult market conditions, adjusted operating profit improved significantly on the basis of 
a modest improvement in turnover. Margins improved as a result of better productivity and operating efficiency,
partly offset by increased transport costs arising from the temporary shutdown of some key supplier facilities.
Sales of cutting and welding products increased in South Africa and so did both the sales volume and the turnover
of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).T urnover of special products, including refrigerants, grew particularly rapidly.
Export sales of welding products manufactured by Afrox, BOC’s South African subsidiary, also increased
significantly.There was a modest improvement in adjusted operating profit despite the currency disadvantage.
Sales of the AfroxPac emergency oxygen kit for underground miners were substantially lower in 2004 as order
intake reflected weak activity in the gold mining sector.
A programme to renovate the Afrox retail network in South Africa with the development of a number of
‘Gas & Gear’ outlets and a range of safety products is under way. In addition a range of diving gases and a fire
suppression product have been launched in South Africa.
Good progress was made in growing both turnover and adjusted operating profit in the other southern
African countries during 2004.A new carbon dioxide plant supported growth in Nigeria.
JapanThe basis of accounting for BOC’s business in Japan changed during 2003 as a result of a merger. Full details
can be seen in the PGS section on page 49. In 2004 ISP’s turnover in Japan was slightly less than the previous year
but adjusted operating profit was higher through cost savings following the merger and from some asset disposals.
Operating review (comparing 2004 with 2003) 51 South and South East AsiaThese regions came under the same business unit management during 2004. In
aggregate there were modest improvements in both turnover and adjusted operating profit. In T aiwan, buoyant
activity in manufacturing and infrastructure development was reflected in higher turnover and adjusted operating
profit.There were also sharply better results from the industrial products business in Thailand but ammonia margins
were under strong competitive pressure and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) selling prices remained subject to
restrictive regulation. Hong Kong continued to be affected by the migration of manufacturing to mainland China
and in Singapore shipbuilding and construction activity failed to improve in 2004. Competition intensified in the
Malaysian market for industrial gases. Demand for helium was strong throughout Asia.
In south Asia, turnover increased and adjusted operating profit was further boosted by an asset disposal.
Trading conditions in Bangladesh were adversely affected by a combination of political uncertainty, strikes and
floods.
South PacificT urnover and adjusted operating profit increased in 2004 and margins were improved by holding
down costs.The economic environment remained favourable across the region. Manufacturing activity was buoyant
in Australia despite a challenging environment for export-oriented manufacturers created by the stronger currency.
New projects in the oil and gas sector and in mining generated increased demand for welding and safety products.
During 2004 BOC secured major contracts with Western Mining to meet its requirements for safety products
across Australia.
The economy also continued to grow in New Zealand but somewhat less rapidly than in Australia.There was
also an improvement in the Pacific Islands, while gold mining activity and oil refining investment led to increased
business in Papua New Guinea.
Major initiatives in 2004 included an agreement with the Australian CSIRO to commercialise ethanedinitrile,
a gas that can be used to sterilise soil and timber, and which management believes has significant potential.
The acquisition of OccCorp, an injury management provider, gives BOC entry to a largely untapped market 
by combining BOC’s safety services and products.
A dedicated refrigerant reclaim fleet was established to help customers comply with new refrigeration
regulations that make it mandatory to recover, return and safely dispose of hydrofluorocarbons. BOC’s new Heliox
gas mixture, which helps the treatment of patients with airway obstructions, and Inhalo, the new lightweight
cylinder, were both successfully launched into the medical market.
BOC commenced an extensive redevelopment program of its Gas & Gear stores, supporting traditional
industrial customers and new customers alike, giving a stronger retail position, providing better visibility, higher traffic
flow, attractive merchandising and design.
The price of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) was particularly volatile during 2004. BOC’s associated company 
in Australia, Elgas, was notably successful in preserving sales margins in these difficult circumstances and adjusted
operating profit was increased. Elgas expanded through the acquisition of a leisure gas business during the year.
The potential impact of Government plans to remove an excise tax exemption for automobile gas in the period
from 2008 to 2012 was softened by a subsequent decision to delay the introduction by three years and by an
agreement to provide capital allowances to encourage car owners to convert their vehicles to use LPG fuel.
Automobile gas is a minor part of Elgas turnover.

Operating exceptional items in 2004 were for the integration of the industrial and medical gases businesses of
BOC and Air Liquide in Japan that began in 2003.
Conditions improved in most of BOC Edwards’ key markets during 2004. Orders for semiconductor
equipment began to pick up in the first quarter leading to increased sales in subsequent quarters.At the same time
a major expansion of liquid crystal display (flat panel) manufacturing facilities got under way.This provided fresh
business opportunities for both gases and equipment. Sales of chemical management equipment for new
semiconductor fabrication plants improved only slightly and profitability continued to be affected by competitive
market conditions. Demand for scientific equipment vacuum systems and for pharmaceutical packaging machines
was better in 2004 but sales of vacuum systems for aerospace metallurgy applications remained at a low level.
At the beginning of 2004, high levels of capacity utilisation encouraged a number of semiconductor
manufacturers to add fresh capacity or upgrade existing facilities.This led to increased orders, which were reflected
in higher turnover and adjusted operating profit from the second quarter onwards.
BOC Edwards was successful in winning new equipment business with the majority of semiconductor
fabrication facilities for which construction began in 2004.These included several investments in T aiwan, Korea,
Japan, China, Europe and the US.
52 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 Operating review (comparing 2004 with 2003) New pumping and exhaust systems were introduced for semiconductor, flat panel display and other vacuum
applications.A new range of iGX pumps for the semiconductor industry provides better control and monitoring
capabilities and use less power than before. BOC Edwards also launched high capacity pumps of its own design 
and manufacture for flat panel applications. New turbomolecular and scroll pumps were designed for scientific
instrumentation.Wet chemical abatement systems were introduced to expand and complement the capabilities 
of BOC Edwards’ exhaust abatement systems.
Increased production of semiconductors was reflected in better demand for electronic materials.
Production of nitrogen trifluoride was expanded further in 2004 to over 100 tonnes a year. New investments in
semiconductor facilities also provided opportunities for nitrogen supply contracts. BOC Edwards has become one
of the leading suppliers of bulk gas to the growing semiconductor industry in China and continued to benefit from
the expansion of semiconductor manufacturing in T aiwan, Japan and Singapore. New nitrogen generators were
installed at several customer sites and further capacity was added to satisfy growing demand from customers
within the Hsinchu science park in T aiwan.
Accelerated investment in new flat panel display production facilities led to significant orders for large capacity
pumping systems in both T aiwan and Korea. Gas supply contracts were also signed with a number of display
manufacturers in T aiwan and Japan. Liquid crystal display production leads to substantial demand for chamber
cleaning chemicals. Onsite fluorine generation equipment is now installed at a number of semiconductor and flat
panel manufacturers.A full commercial-scale generator is functioning at LG Philips’ new sixth generation plant in
Korea.
Demand for pharmaceutical freeze-drying and packaging equipment picked up in 2004 leading to better sales
and adjusted operating profit.A new non-contact check-weighing machine was introduced. Nuclear magnetic
resonance technology allows every package to be checked, enables packing lines to operate at higher speeds and
facilitates immediate correction of any deviation from specification.
The basis of accounting for BOC’s gases business in Japan changed during 2003 as a result of a merger.
Full details can be seen in the PGS section on page 49. Electronic gases turnover increased significantly in 2004 as a
result of the pick up in the semiconductor industry.The benefit of increased turnover on gases adjusted operating
profit was amplified by synergy benefits arising from the merger.
Contracts were won in Asia and Europe furthering a strategy to expand the range of value-added services to
electronic manufacturers.These include gases management, chemicals supply, support services and materials
logistics. Other developments included an improved offering of gases and vacuum systems for lithography and
supercritical carbon dioxide cleaning technology.

Adjusted operating profit increased faster than turnover as a result of careful control of overhead costs and positive
pricing trends. Hospital occupancy rates remained similar to a year ago.Acquisitions were a minor factor in the
turnover increase.The Lifecare chronic care facilities and Afrox occupational health services both delivered a good
performance in 2004.
The change to a new reimbursement system that began during 2003 was completed in 2004.The previous
system of paying health care providers a fee for their services changed to a fixed payment for each kind of
procedure as well as a per day tariff structure.

3. All comments below are on a constant currency basis.
The comparison of turnover and adjusted operating profit between 2003 and 2004 is distorted by a non-recurrent
item during 2003. In 2003 a gain of some £4.1 million arising principally from the termination of operations for the
Marks & Spencer General Merchandise business was credited to adjusted operating profit.The termination of this
business also eliminated some £26 million of turnover in 2004 compared with 2003.After adjusting for this item,
underlying turnover grew principally as a result of increased food business for Marks & Spencer, as well as new
contracts and the expansion of activity with Ocado and Carlsberg UK. On the same basis, adjusted operating profit
in 2004 was at a similar level to 2003.
Primary food distribution operations were also expanded in 2004 when Gist took on the transport
operations of John Rannoch foods, one of the leading suppliers of poultry products to Marks & Spencer. Gist
manages the complex supply chain for all of Marks & Spencer’s chilled and ambient foods. During 2004, a major
investment was made to expand a chilled food facility in Kent to meet the demands of the growing network of
M&S Simply Food stores.
54 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 Operating review (comparing 2004 with 2003) Corporate transactions and restructuring
In South Africa the disposal of Afrox Healthcare Limited to a consortium lead by two major black empowerment
investors was completed on 22 March 2005.African Oxygen Limited, BOC’s subsidiary in South Africa, retains a
significant interest in the hospitals business through a 20 per cent holding in the new company.The gain on disposal
of £84.9 million has been recognised as an exceptional item.African Oxygen Limited has distributed the proceeds
of the disposal to its shareholders through a buy back of shares and a special dividend.The amount of the special
dividend payable to minority shareholders was some £54 million, which is included in the total dividends paid to
minorities in subsidiaries within the Group cash flow statement.
The sale of BOC’s packaged gas business in the US to Airgas Inc was completed in July 2004. Part of the
consideration was payable subject to certain conditions and accordingly was not recognised in 2004.This remaining
consideration amounting to US$20 million was received in November 2005 and has been recognised in 2005 as
an exceptional item.The disposal of the business in 2004 resulted in a loss of £79.5 million plus associated
restructuring costs of £14.8 million.
In 2005 £20.7 million has been charged for restructuring in BOC Edwards.This comprises £13.9 million of
goodwill impairment and severance costs. Savings of approximately £5 million are targeted from this restructuring
during 2006. Further costs are anticipated from this programme in 2006 leading to additional benefits.
Group expenditure on acquisitions of businesses was £57.1 million (2004: £50.9 million).The main acquisitions
during 2005 were G Van Dongen Holding BV, to expand Gist’s primary business into Europe, and an additional
equity investment in Compania de Nitrogeno de Cantarell (CNC) in proportion to BOC’s existing 65 per cent
equity holding.The main acquisition in 2004 was to increase BOC’s holding in CNC.

Financial review Cash flow from operationsT otal cash generated by operating activities in 2005 was £466.6 million compared to
£648.2 million in 2004.The decrease was associated with a lower net cash inflow from operating activities of
£665.5 million (2004: £758.5 million) primarily as a result of an approximate £70 million impact of the disposal of
the Afrox hospitals business part way through the year. Returns on investment and servicing of finance increased
significantly in 2005 compared with 2004.The 2005 total included approximately £54 million for the minority
interest element of the special dividend paid by African Oxygen Limited following the disposal of its majority
shareholding in Afrox Healthcare Limited in March 2005.The 2005 tax paid includes approximately £15 million 
in connection with this transaction. In 2004, the increase in cash provided by operating activities to £648.2 million
(2003: £550.0 million) was driven by higher operating profit before exceptional items of £576.9 million in 2004
(2003: £505.6 million) and improved working capital management offsetting the impact of higher contributions 
to the UK pension scheme. Higher dividends from joint ventures and associates in 2004 of £79.1 million 
(2003: £35.0 million), which included a second dividend from Japan Air Gases, also helped to improve cash flows.
Investing Cash used by investing activities was £170.9 million in 2005 (2004: £111.7 million).The increase in capital
expenditure and financial investment over the prior year reflects a higher level of expenditure in new supply
scheme projects, principally in Asia/Pacific and the Americas.The higher net cash inflow from acquisitions and
disposals in 2005 reflects the proceeds from the sale by African Oxygen Limited of its majority shareholding in
Afrox Healthcare Limited in March 2005. In 2004, the reduction in cash used by investing activities to £111.7 million
(2003: £345.3 million) reflected a lower level of expenditure on acquisitions in 2004 compared to 2003, proceeds
from the divestment of the US packaged gas business in July 2004 and receipts of £53.0 million from capital
restructuring of Japan Air Gases Ltd.
Financing Overall, net debt decreased by £122.7 million as a result of a net cash inflow of £91.6 million,
a £9.6 million inflow from the issue of shares, an inflow of £34.7 million for the net debt acquired/disposed on
business acquisitions and disposals and £(13.2) million for the effect of exchange rate and inception of finance
leases. Decreases in debt in 2005 principally relate to the repayment of £168.6 million of medium term notes.
In 2004, net debt decreased by £405.7 million as a result of a net cash inflow of £339.2 million, a £12.4 million
inflow from the issue of shares, an outflow of £4.7 million for the net debt acquired/disposed on business
acquisitions and disposals and £58.8 million for the effect of exchange rate and other movements. Decreases in
debt in 2004 principally related to the repayment of £125.0 million of 6.75% bonds due in 2004 and £42.6 million
net repayment of commercial paper.
The Group has access to a range of funding. Debt finance is raised by issuing bonds, commercial paper, other
obligations to investors and through borrowings from banks.
As well as medium and long-term borrowings, the Group maintains short-term borrowings, principally 
in the form of commercial paper and bank borrowings.At 30 September 2005, the Group had US$450 million 
(£254 million) of committed multi-currency facilities with a group of relationship banks maturing in 2008.
In October 2005 these facilities were replaced with US$600 million (£339 million) of committed multi-currency
facilities maturing in 2010.These facilities provide back-up for the issue of commercial paper as well as general
liquidity for the Group.Additional committed facilities are maintained by the principal operating units in the Group.
At 30 September 2005, the gearing ratio (net debt including finance leases as a percentage of capital
employed) was 25.6 per cent compared with 29.9 per cent in 2004 and 37.4 per cent in 2003.The net debt/equity
ratio was 40.9 per cent, compared with 51.2 per cent in 2004 and 73.4 per cent in 2003.
The Group has access to a diverse range of debt finance including commercial paper, public bonds and bank
borrowings which, it believes, will be available to meet long-term financing needs.The Group has sufficient facilities
to cover likely borrowing needs. Management anticipates that capital expenditure in 2006 will be at a higher level
than in 2005 and will be covered by cash inflow from operating activities and existing sources of financing.
Management of financial risks 
The board of directors sets the treasury policies and objectives of the Group which include controls over the
procedures used to manage currency, interest rate and credit risk.The approach to managing risk is set out below.
This approach is expected to continue during the next financial year. On a day-to-day basis, Group treasury carries
out these policies, with regular review meetings with the Group finance director. Specific and significant activities
need approval from the finance committee, which includes any two directors of the company.
The Group does not undertake any trading activity in financial instruments nor does it enter into any
leveraged derivative transactions.
Currency riskThe Group faces currency risk principally on its net assets, most of which are in currencies other
than sterling. Currency movements can therefore have a significant effect on the Group’s balance sheet when
translating these foreign currency assets into sterling. In order to reduce this effect the Group manages its
borrowings, where practicable and cost effective, to hedge its foreign currency assets.
Where possible, hedging is done using direct borrowings in the same currency as the assets being hedged or
through the use of other hedging methods such as currency swaps. Group borrowings are currently held in a wide
range of currencies and, after swaps, 79 per cent of net debt (2004: 82 per cent) is denominated in the principal
currencies affecting the Group: US dollars,Australian dollars, Japanese yen, South African rand and sterling.
The aggregate of the notional principal values of currency swaps was £341.7 million (2004: £593.1 million)
spread over a range of currencies.The fair value of such swaps is included in note 21 b) i) to the financial
statements.
56 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 Financial review The balance sheets of overseas operations are translated into sterling at the closing rates of exchange for the year
and any exchange difference is dealt with as a movement in reserves.This is explained more fully in the accounting
policy note on page 91.The profit and loss accounts of overseas businesses are translated at average rates of
exchange and this translation impact directly affects the profit and loss account of the Group.
The Group manages its currency flows to minimise currency transaction exchange risk and forward 
contracts are used as appropriate to hedge net currency flows and selected individual transactions.The Group’s
foreign exchange cover is mainly managed in the UK,Australia, Japan and South Africa.The UK manages the 
cover for exposures on net trade flows of the Group’s companies in the US and certain other countries.
The aggregate principal amount of forward cover outstanding at 30 September 2005 amounted to £222.6 million
(2004: £224.4 million).
Interest rate risk At 30 September 2005, the Group’s net debt position after interest rate hedging activity included
a net exposure of £36.6 million (2004: £74.6 million) to floating interest rates. Based on the Group’s 2005 year end
level and composition of net debt, an increase in average interest rates of one per cent per annum would result in a
decrease in future earnings, before tax, of £0.4 million per annum (2004: £0.7 million).
In order to manage interest rate risk the Group maintains both floating rate and fixed rate debt.
At 30 September 2005, there was a 4:96 ratio (2004: 8:92) between floating and fixed rate net debt. Underlying
borrowings are arranged on both a fixed rate and a floating rate basis and, where appropriate, the Group uses
interest rate swaps to vary this mix and to manage the Group’s interest rate exposure.
At 30 September 2005, the aggregate of the notional principal values of swap agreements which affect the
floating rate/fixed rate mix was £286.4 million (2004: £285.3 million).The fair value of such swaps is included in
note 21 b) i) to the financial statements.
Foreign exchange risk At 30 September 2005, the Group had outstanding forward exchange contracts totalling 
£222.6 million (2004: £224.4 million) in respect of its actual and forecast transaction exposures.The fair value of
these contracts at 30 September 2005 amounted to a gain of £0.2 million (2004: a gain of £7.5 million).A ten per
cent appreciation of sterling would increase the fair value of these contracts by £15.2 million (2004: £11.0 million).
In addition to these forward contracts, the Group is exposed to foreign exchange movements on its net debt
position.At 30 September 2005 net debt, after currency swaps, comprised net sterling liabilities of £153.2 million
(2004: £104.6 million) and net currency liabilities of £686.5 million (2004: £857.8 million). Based on the Group’s
2005 year end level and composition of net debt, a ten per cent appreciation of sterling would result in a reduction
in the value of net currency liabilities of £62.4 million (2004: £78.0 million).
Counterparty risk Cash deposits and other financial instruments give rise to credit risk on the amounts due from
counterparties. Credit risk is managed by limiting the aggregate amount and duration of exposure to any one
counterparty depending upon its credit rating and by regular reviews of these ratings.The possibility of material loss
arising in the event of non-performance by a counterparty is considered unlikely by management.
The currency and interest rate hedging profile of the Group’s borrowings at 30 September 2005 is shown in
note 21 to the financial statements. Further information on financial risk management is also given in note 21 to the
financial statements.
Interest on net debt
The net charge before the Group’s share of interest of joint ventures and associates was £47.6 million in 2005
(2004: £70.5 million, 2003: £75.8 million), which, after excluding interest income from loans to joint ventures and
associates, represented 7.2 per cent of average net borrowings during the year.After taking into account interest
capitalised of £1.1 million (2004: £0.1 million, 2003: £0.8 million) and the Group’s share of the net interest of joint
ventures and associates of £29.1 million (2004: £17.9 million, 2003: £20.3 million), the net charge was £76.7 million.
Adjusted interest cover (the number of times that the interest charge on net debt is covered by adjusted operating
profit) increased to 7.4 times (2004: 6.5 times, 2003: 5.3 times).
Net interest on pension financing items
The interest on pension scheme liabilities was £128.9 million in 2005 (2004: £117.4 million, 2003: £110.2 million).
The expected return on pension scheme assets was £147.1 million in 2005 (2004: £133.2 million, 2003:
£119.6 million).The increase in the expected return on scheme assets was a result of the increased value of the
Group’s pension assets.This reflects the increase in the value of world equity markets and the impact of the
additional cash contributions made by the Group to the UK pension scheme.
Debt maturity profile
The maturity profile of the commitments relating to the Group’s gross borrowings and the estimated associated
interest cost, if the debt runs to the full term, is as follows:
2005 2004
Principal Interest Principal Interest

T otal 1,030.7 275.8 1,190.6 346.3
Financial review 57 At 30 September 2005, the Group had US$450 million (£254 million) of committed multi-currency facilities with a
group of relationship banks maturing in 2008. In October 2005 these facilities were replaced with US$600 million
(£339 million) of committed multi-currency facilities maturing in 2010.These facilities provide back-up for the issue
of commercial paper as well as general liquidity for the Group.Additional committed facilities are maintained by the
principal operating units in the Group.
Additional information on the Group’s gross borrowings can be found in note 20. Details of the Group’s share
of net debt of joint ventures and associates, the majority of which is non-recourse, are given in note 13 a).

See also note 25 to the financial statements for further information on operating leases and unconditional purchase
obligations.
Off-balance sheet arrangements
The Group has provided guarantees of £49.3 million to third parties at 30 September 2005 as shown in note 
26 a) to the financial statements.The guarantees include performance bonds in the Cantarell joint venture, a
guarantee of the borrowings of a joint venture in China and other guarantees provided in the ordinary course of
business. Other than disclosed, there are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to
have a current or future material effect on the Group’s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
T axation
The tax charge on profit before exceptional items for 2005 of £131.5 million is calculated in accordance with UK
accounting standards, including FRS19 (deferred tax), under which full provision is made for deferred taxes.
The effective tax rate on adjusted profit in 2005 was 26 per cent (2004: 29 per cent, 2003: 29 per cent).
The main reason for the reduction in the tax rate was the resolution of various matters with the US tax authorities,
including the utilisation of tax losses.The total tax rate in 2005 was 26.9 per cent (2004: 24.7 per cent, 2003:
27.4 per cent).The Group pays corporation tax in the UK at a rate of 30 per cent.Additional information on tax
rates is shown in note 4 to the financial statements.
The Group is currently liable to pay federal tax at the rate of 35 per cent in the US.This is reduced by the
existence of tax credits. In the other principal subsidiaries, the tax rate is typically between 29 per cent and 
42 per cent.
Contingencies
The Group monitors all contingent liabilities including matters relating to litigation and the environment via a
process of consultation and evaluation which includes senior management, internal and external legal advisers and
internal and external technical advisers.This process results in conclusions with respect to potential exposure and
provisions are made or adjusted accordingly. Management believes that the Group has adequately provided for
contingencies which are likely to become payable in the future.
Legal proceedings
BOC Group companies are parties to various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including some
in which claims for damages in large amounts have been asserted.
The outcome of litigation to which BOC Group companies are party cannot be readily foreseen, but the
directors believe that such litigation should be disposed of without material adverse effect on the Group’s financial
condition or profitability.
Welding fumes litigation A US subsidiary of BOC,The BOC Group, Inc., currently is party to a number of lawsuits
in the US for alleged injuries resulting from exposure to manganese, asbestos and/or toxic fumes in connection
with the welding process. The BOC Group, Inc. has not manufactured welding rods in the US since 1986 when the
welding electrodes business was sold.The BOC Group, Inc. ceased selling welding rods in the US manufactured by
others when the sale of the US packaged gas business, including the operations that distributed packaged gases and
welding equipment, was completed in July 2004.

0 03 05 04 Manganese litigation At 30 September 2005, there were a total of approximately 8,574 claimants (‘T otal Claimants’)
in pending manganese related cases in both US federal and state courts that name The BOC Group, Inc. as a
defendant, a net decrease of approximately 1,100 claimants from 30 September 2004.The BOC Group, Inc. is
typically one of several defendants in these cases that claim compensatory and punitive damages, in most cases for
unspecified amounts, for alleged neurological injury, including Parkinson’s disease, through exposure to manganese
in welding fumes. Of the T otal Claimants, approximately 4,607 claimants have filed in, or been transferred for 
pre-trial purposes to, the federal district court in the Northern District of Ohio, where a multi-district litigation
(MDL) proceeding has been commenced, and approximately 50 claimants are in process to be transferred to or
from the MDL.The MDL proceeding is a vehicle for coordinating pre-trial proceedings in cases pending in different
federal district courts in the US. It is currently contemplated that the MDL court will try three cases during the
MDL proceeding.The first such case is currently scheduled for February 2006. In addition to the cases in federal
court,The BOC Group, Inc. is a defendant in a number of similar cases pending in state courts, which are in
different stages of procedural development, and certain cases are scheduled for trial from time to time.The BOC
Group, Inc. has been a co-defendant in other manganese related claims that have been resolved as follows. From 1
January 1997 to 30 September 2005, 3,965 claims were dismissed.Through 30 September 2005, seven cases were
tried to final jury verdicts in favour of the defendants, including The BOC Group, Inc., and one case was tried to a
final jury verdict in favour of the plaintiffs, which is being appealed.
Asbestos litigation At 30 September 2005, there were a total of approximately 15,966 claimants in pending
asbestos related cases that name The BOC Group, Inc. as a defendant, a net decrease of approximately 600 from
30 September 2004.The BOC Group, Inc. is typically one of a large number of defendants in these cases that claim
compensatory and punitive damages, in most cases for unspecified amounts, for alleged injuries, including cancer,
through exposure to asbestos in welding fumes or from welding consumables.A very small number of these
claimants allege injuries from exposure to asbestos in non-welding rod products and premises. The BOC Group,
Inc. has been a co-defendant in other asbestos related claims that have been resolved as follows. From 1 January
1997 to 30 September 2005, 11,776 claims were dismissed and 75 claims were dismissed on summary judgments.
Through 30 September 2005, nine cases were tried to final jury verdicts in favour of the defendants, including The
BOC Group, Inc., and one case was tried to a final jury verdict in favour of the plaintiffs, which is being appealed.
The BOC Group, Inc. believes that it has strong defences to the claims asserted in all of the various manganese and
asbestos related cases and intends to defend vigorously such claims. In the manganese related claims,The BOC
Group, Inc. believes that recent relevant scientific literature, based on epidemiological studies, strongly supports its
defence of such claims. Based on its experience to date, together with its current assessment of the merits of the
claims being asserted and applicable insurance, BOC believes that continued defence and resolution of the welding
fumes litigation will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or profitability and no provision has
been made. Nonetheless, it is not possible to predict either the number of future claims or the number of claimants
that any future claims may present. In addition, the outcome of welding fume cases, either involving BOC or other
defendants, is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict, and BOC cannot provide any assurances that any
future resolutions of these types of claims will necessarily be consistent with its experience to date. In the event of
an adverse outcome to any of the proceedings, a liability would be recognised if it was considered likely that it
would give rise to an outflow of future economic benefits. Where there is applicable insurance, this would be
recognised when its recoverability was virtually certain.
Fluorogas litigation In February 2003, the company was notified that a jury verdict in the US District Court for 
the Western District of T exas (the District Court) was obtained for US$132 million against Fluorogas Limited,
The BOC Group, Inc. and The BOC Group plc.The verdict arose primarily out of an alleged breach of a
memorandum of understanding by Fluorogas Limited before it was acquired by The BOC Group plc in September
2001. In March 2003, the court also awarded interest and costs against the defendants, making them jointly and
severally liable for a total of US$174 million.A bond for the full amount was posted with the District Court as part
of the normal appeals process.
In August 2004, the appellate court reversed the entire judgement against the BOC entities and all but
US$170,000 in reliance damages against Fluorogas Limited. In addition, the appellate court remanded for
reconsideration by the District Court an award of attorney’s fees on the US$170,000 recovery.
Fluorogas Limited was placed in administration under the Insolvency Act of 1986 pursuant to an order of an
English Court. In January 2005 the parties resolved the outstanding matters to their satisfaction.The appeal bond
was released and Fluorogas Limited applied for, and received, a discharge from the administration order.
Insurance
Operational management is responsible for managing business risks. Several Group departments advise
management on different aspects of risk and monitor results. Insurance cover is held against major catastrophes.
For any such event, the Group will bear an initial cost before external cover begins.
Financial review 59 Inflation
Over the last three years, inflation has not had a material impact on the revenue or profit of the Group.
Critical accounting policies
The principal accounting policies affecting the results of operations and financial condition are set out on pages 91
and 92 of the financial statements.The application of certain of these policies requires assumptions or subjective
judgements by management. Management bases these on a combination of past experience and any other
evidence that is relevant to the particular circumstances.
The application of these assumptions and judgements affects the reported amounts of profit during the year
and the assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date.Actual results may differ from the estimates calculated using
these assumptions and judgements. Management believes that the following are the critical policies where the
assumptions and judgements made could have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.
T angible fixed assets A significant part of the capital employed of the Group, particularly in the Process Gas
Solutions and Industrial and Special Products lines of business, is invested in tangible fixed assets.The nature of the
business demands significant capital investment to renew or increase production capacity or to enable the business
to achieve greater productivity and efficiency.
It is the Group’s policy to depreciate tangible fixed assets, except land, on a straight line basis over the effective
lives of the assets.This ensures that there is an appropriate matching of the revenue earned with the capital costs of
production and delivery of goods and services.A key element of this policy is the estimate of the effective life
applied to each category of fixed assets which, in turn, determines the annual depreciation charge. In deciding the
appropriate lives to be applied, management takes into account various factors including, among other things, the
accumulated experience of the effective asset lives from historic business operations and an assessment of the likely
impact of any changes in technology.
While Group earnings in any period would fluctuate if different asset lives were applied, in some cases the
original estimated life of an asset is closely related to contractual arrangements with large customers. Some of the
earnings impact of choosing a different asset life would be mitigated, as the different life may reflect different
contractual arrangements with such customers. Nevertheless, variations in the effective lives could impact the
earnings of the business through an increase or decrease in the depreciation charge. It is estimated that a change 
of one year in the effective life of all plant, machinery, vehicles and cylinders would have an impact of between 
£15 million and £20 million on annual Group operating profit.A change in the effective life of buildings would have
only a negligible impact.
Intangible fixed assets In a similar manner to tangible fixed assets, management uses its judgement to determine
the extent to which goodwill arising from the acquisition of a business has a value that will benefit the performance
of the Group over future periods. It is the Group’s policy to amortise goodwill on a straight line basis over its useful
economic life.This takes into account, among other things, the maturity of the business acquired and its product and
customer base.Any change in these assumptions would have an impact on the earnings of the Group.
It is estimated that a change of one year in the useful economic life of all goodwill would have an impact of
approximately £1 million on annual Group operating profit.
Retirement benefits Results of the Group include costs relating to the provision of retirement benefits for
employees. It is the directors’ responsibility to set the assumptions used in determining the key elements of the
costs of meeting such future obligations.The assumptions are based on actual historical experience and are set after
consultation with the Group’s actuaries.They include the assumptions used for regular service costs and for the
financing elements related to the pension schemes’ assets and liabilities.Whilst management believes that the
assumptions used are appropriate, a change in the assumptions used would affect both the operating profit and net
interest cost of the Group.
There are a number of elements used in the assumptions and these vary for the different countries in which
the Group operates.There may also be an inter-dependency between some of the assumptions, making it
potentially misleading to consider any approximate impact on Group results of a change in any one assumption in
isolation. Nevertheless, for the UK and US schemes together, it is estimated that an absolute 0.25 per cent change
in the assumptions on rates of inflation, discount rates and return on equities in pension scheme assets would
individually result in changes of approximately £6 million, £3 million and £3 million respectively in the total pension
cost in annual Group profit before tax.A similar change in the assumptions on all other schemes would have only a
negligible impact.
Environmental provisions In certain parts of the business, mainly in the US, the Group has obligations to carry out
environmental clean-ups at former and current production sites. Many of these obligations will not arise for a
number of years, and the costs are difficult to predict accurately. Management uses its judgement and experience to
provide an appropriate amount for the likely cost of such clean-ups, and the amounts, if material, are discounted to
present values. Both the amount of anticipated costs, and the interest rates used to discount such costs, are
subjective.The use of different assumptions would impact the earnings of the Group.
It is estimated that a change of one per cent in the interest rate used to discount such costs would have an
impact of approximately £1 million on annual Group profit before tax.
60 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 Financial review Current asset provisions In the course of normal trading activities, management uses its judgement in establishing
the net realisable value of various elements of working capital – principally stocks, work-in-progress and accounts
receivable. Provisions are established for obsolete or slow moving stocks, bad or doubtful debts and product
warranties.Actual costs in future periods may be different from the provisions established and any such differences
would affect future earnings of the Group.
The provisions are established at levels appropriate to the circumstances within individual Group business
units, and not on a Group-wide systematic basis. It is therefore considered that any estimate of the impact on
annual Group operating profit of any change in such provisions may not be meaningful. Nevertheless, a change of
ten per cent in the level of provision for bad and doubtful debts at 30 September 2005 would have an impact of
approximately £3 million on annual Group operating profit.
The areas covered by critical accounting policies under UK GAAP do not materially differ from those 
under US GAAP . Further details of the differences between UK and US GAAP are given in note 30 to the 
financial statements.
Accounting
The Group’s accounting policies are based on accounting principles generally accepted in the UK (UK GAAP).
During the year, the following new UK standards were issued:
FRS22 – Earnings per share
FRS23 – The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates
FRS24 – Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies
FRS25 – Financial instruments: Disclosure and presentation
FRS26 – Financial instruments: Measurement
FRS27 – Life assurance
FRS28 – Corresponding amounts
RS1– Operating and financial review
None of these standards are effective for the Group for the financial year ended 30 September 2005.The accounts
for the financial year ended 30 September 2005 have therefore been prepared on an accounting basis consistent
with that applied in the financial year ended 30 September 2004.With effect from 1 October 2005 the Group’s
accounting policies will be based on International Financial Reporting Standards, as outlined in the following section.
International Financial Reporting Standards
In accordance with EU legislation, the Group is required to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) in accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2005.Accordingly, IFRS will first apply to the
Group’s financial statements for the financial year commencing 1 October 2005. Results for the quarter ending 
31 December 2005, which will be announced in February 2006, will be presented on an IFRS basis. In January 2006
the Group intends to present results for each quarter of the financial year to 30 September 2005 restated 
on an IFRS basis.
The Group established an IFRS project team in 2003.This is overseen by a formal steering committee, which
includes the Group finance director.There have been regular reports on progress to the audit committee and
executive management board.A comprehensive training programme has been undertaken covering Group finance
personnel worldwide.The Group’s auditors have been kept informed of, and consulted on, the development of the
IFRS project and the preparation and implementation of the new Group accounting policies.
The Group is still in the process of finalising the full effects of adopting IFRS but management is confident that
all areas have been identified where significant differences will arise between UK GAAP and IFRS.These areas are
set out below.This is based on the IFRS that are expected to be in effect for the year to 30 September 2006.
However, it is possible that there could be further changes to IFRS and interpretations prior to this date.The Group
has elected to adopt early the amendment to IAS19 as set out below, but does not currently intend to adopt early
any other IFRS or interpretations.
The principal differences which management expects to affect the Group are as follows:
a) Goodwill. Under UK GAAP , goodwill is amortised over a period up to a maximum of 20 years. Under IFRS,
goodwill is not amortised but instead is reviewed for impairment annually.
b) Share based payments. Under UK GAAP the cost of share options is calculated by reference to their intrinsic
value, which means that there is no charge for options granted at the market price. Under IFRS, the Group will
record a charge for the fair value of all share options including Save As Y ou Earn schemes.
c) T axation. Preliminary estimates indicate that the tax rate will be slightly higher under IFRS and the impact will
be fully quantified as part of the restated results to be announced in January 2006.
d) Pensions.The Group has already adopted FRS 17 under UK GAAP .The equivalent IFRS is IAS 19 and the
Group intends to adopt early the amendment to IAS 19 allowing for immediate recognition of actuarial gains
and losses in a Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.Accordingly, the impact of accounting for
pensions under IFRS will be similar, although not identical, to UK GAAP and as a result management does not
expect a significant impact on earnings.There will be a difference in presentation in the balance sheet, and
differences relating to the calculation of certain assets and liabilities. Under UK GAAP , net pension assets or
liabilities are shown after deduction of the appropriate deferred tax. Under IFRS, net pension assets or
liabilities are shown before the deduction of any deferred tax, which is then included with other deferred 
tax items.
Financial review 61 e) Foreign exchange.There are certain differences in the requirements of IAS 21 compared to UK GAAP in
respect of functional currencies and in relation to the accounting for foreign exchange on loans between
Group companies.This is an area where there may be increased volatility in the Group’s ongoing results on an
IFRS basis compared to UK GAAP arising from exchange gains and losses.
f) Financial instruments.The Group will adopt IAS 39 on 1 October 2005 in line with the exemption under IFRS 1.
This standard impacts the accounting for a range of financial instruments and embedded derivatives.The
Group has few financial instruments and they are predominantly related to managing currency and interest
rate risk.The Group has reviewed its financial instruments and has concluded that at present they meet the
requirements to enable it to apply hedge accounting. Embedded derivatives typically arise from escalation
clauses in contracts with customers to recover cost increases.Whilst the impact is not material at 1 October
2005,embedded derivatives may give rise to greater volatility in the Group’s earnings arising from marking to
market the underlying derivative.
The adoption of IFRS will also result in a number of changes to the presentation of the financial statements
including disclosures. For example, the Group’s share of the post-tax profit arising in joint ventures and associates
will be shown as one line in the income statement rather than as part of Group turnover, operating profit and
interest.There will be a number of other presentational changes including reclassifications within the balance sheet
and a change to the layout of the cash flow statement.
Overall, management believes that the impact of IFRS on earnings and net assets will be broadly neutral
subject to the effects of IAS 21 and IAS 39 as noted above. Cashflows and the underlying economics of the
business will not change.
US GAAP
The financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with UK GAAP , which differs in certain
respects from US GAAP .
The US accounting information in note 30 to the financial statements gives a summary of the principal
differences between the amounts determined in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies (based on UK
GAAP) and amounts determined in accordance with US GAAP , together with the reconciliation of net profit 
and shareholders’ funds from a UK GAAP basis to a US GAAP basis and a movement in shareholders’ funds 
on a US GAAP basis.
The net income for the year ended 30 September 2005 under US GAAP was £326.7 million (2004:
£297.7 million, 2003: £264.3 million), compared with the net profit of £367.0 million in 2005 (2004: £264.0 million,
2003: £219.1 million) under UK GAAP . Shareholders’ funds at 30 September 2005 under US GAAP were 
£2,122.2 million (2004: £1,920.1 million), compared with £1,942.0 million (2004: £1,675.3 million) under UK GAAP .
The difference primarily results from the differing accounting treatment of pensions, goodwill, financial instruments,
investments, fixed asset revaluations, deferred tax and variable interest entities.
Related party transactions
During the year, interest income of £13.8 million (2004: £7.3 million, 2003: £7.6 million) was received from the
Cantarell joint venture in Mexico.
During the year, the Group was invoiced £45.9 million in respect of purchases of production plants from 
Linde BOC Process Plants in the US.At 30 September 2005, £1.9 million was payable in respect of these invoices.
No material purchases were made in 2004 or 2003.
The Group had no other material related party transactions that might reasonably be expected to 
influence decisions made by the users of these accounts.
Exchange rates 
The majority of the Group’s operations are located outside the UK and operate in currencies other than sterling.
The effects of fluctuations in the relationship between the various currencies are extremely complex and
variations in any particular direction may not have a consistent impact on the reported results. In terms of average
rates for the year, in 2005 sterling strengthened against two of the four principal currencies affecting the Group:
by three per cent against the US dollar and by two per cent against the Japanese yen. Sterling weakened by 
two per cent against the Australian dollar and by three per cent against the South African rand.
In 2004, sterling strengthened against the US dollar and the Japanese yen. Sterling weakened against the
Australian dollar and the South African rand.
In 2003, sterling strengthened against the US dollar and the Japanese yen. Sterling weakened against the
Australian dollar and the South African rand.

arrangements negotiated with suppliers and then paying according to those terms. In addition the UK-based
businesses have committed to the ‘Better Payment Practice Code’. A copy of the code can be obtained from the
Department of Trade and Industry, DTI Publications Orderline,Admail 528, London SW1W 8YT .

Financial review 63 The BOC Group is committed to business integrity, high ethical values and professionalism in all its activities.
As an essential part of this commitment, the board supports the highest standards of corporate governance.
Combined Code on Corporate Governance
BOC has applied the principles contained in Section 1 of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance issued
by the Financial Reporting Council and has complied throughout the year with the provisions set out therein as
they applied to the company.
US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
BOC has securities registered in the US and, as a result, is required to comply with the provisions of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley) that apply to foreign private issuers.Whilst the company already has a robust
corporate governance framework in line with best practice under UK standards, the requirements of Sarbanes-
Oxley were considered and adjustments made to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley as far as it applies to BOC.
The board continues to monitor the implementation of the rules to ensure continued compliance.
As recommended by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), BOC has established a disclosure
committee.The committee comprises the Group finance director, Group legal director and representatives from
the finance, company secretarial, treasury, investor relations, risk management and human resources functions.
The committee meets regularly. It is responsible for overseeing and advising on the disclosure process for the
quarterly announcements and on the content and form of the annual report and Form 20-F.T o permit the signing
of the certifications required by Sarbanes-Oxley the committee makes recommendations to the executive
management board on the adequacy of Group disclosure controls and procedures.
New Y ork Stock Exchange Corporate Governance Listing Standards
The New Y ork Stock Exchange (NYSE) has in place listing standards related to the corporate governance practices
of listed companies. BOC, as a foreign private issuer with American Depositary Shares listed on the NYSE, is
required to comply with certain of these rules, in particular as they relate to audit committees, and must disclose
any significant ways in which its corporate governance practices differ from those followed by US domestic
companies under the NYSE listing standards.At this time BOC does not believe that there are any significant
differences in the corporate governance practices followed by the company as compared to those followed by US
domestic companies, except that the membership of the nomination committee is not composed entirely of
independent non-executive directors.The membership of the nomination committee is however in line with the
Combined Code on Corporate Governance, which permits membership of this committee to be composed of a
majority of independent non-executive directors.
The board
There are 12 members of the board namely the chairman, five executive directors and six non-executive directors
who collectively have responsibility for leadership of the company.This is considered to be the optimum size for the
board, providing a balance between executive management and non-executives and bringing a good mix of skills
and experience.As has been demonstrated during 2005 changes to the board’s composition can be managed
without undue disruption.The directors holding office at the date of this report and their biographical details are
given on pages 8 and 9.The executive directors are the chief executive, Group finance director and the three chief
executives of the lines of business. Kent Masters was appointed chief executive, Industrial and Special Products and
a member of the board on 1 March 2005 in place of John Walsh who resigned from the board on 1 March 2005.
Alan Ferguson joined the company as Group finance director on 15 September 2005 and was appointed to the
board on 30 September 2005 in place of René Médori who resigned on 31 May 2005.
The board believes that executive directors and members of the executive management board can gain
valuable experience and knowledge by taking on non-executive directorships of other listed companies. Such
appointments are subject to review by the nomination committee and approval of the board and, unless otherwise
agreed, only one non-executive directorship may be held in a FTSE100 company. Executives are permitted to
retain any fees in respect of such external appointments, details of which are set out in the report on remuneration
on page 76.
The roles of chairman and chief executive have been separate since 1994. Rob Margetts as chairman leads the
board, ensuring that each director, particularly the non-executive directors, is able to make an effective contribution.
He monitors, with assistance from the company secretary, the information distributed to the board to ensure that
it is sufficient, accurate, timely and clear. He meets twice a year with the non-executive directors without the
executive management present. Between meetings, the chairman has responsibility for maintaining the integrity and
effectiveness of the board.This requires his interaction with the chief executive between board meetings, as well as
his contact with other board members and shareholders.T ony Isaac as chief executive maintains day-to-day
executive management responsibility for the Group’s operations, implementing Group strategies and policies
agreed by the board.The division of responsibilities between the chairman and chief executive has been agreed by
the board.
64 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005
Corporate governance During the year Rob Margetts’ commitments have not changed. Details are set out in his biography on page 8.
During 2005, as part of the board evaluation process, the non-executive directors, led by Sir Christopher
O’Donnell as the senior independent director, reviewed the chairman’s performance and considered this against
the background of his other commitments. In their view the chairman has performed well against all the measured
criteria. He has consistently demonstrated full commitment to his responsibilities at BOC and he has always made
himself available when circumstances have required additional time commitment. Rob Margetts’ appointment as
chairman assumes he will spend approximately one and a half days a week on activities at BOC.The board is
satisfied that he has the personal commitment, the available time, including additional time should circumstances
demand it, to fulfil his responsibilities as chairman. Furthermore, the board is of the view that Rob Margetts’
expertise and the continuity that he brings to the post of chairman, is of great benefit to BOC.
The senior independent director is Sir Christopher O’Donnell. He has responsibility for chairing meetings of
the non-executive directors at which the chairman’s performance is appraised. He is also available to shareholders
should they have any concerns which contact through other channels has failed to resolve or for which such
contact may be inappropriate.
During the year Iain Napier and Julie Baddeley resigned as independent non-executive directors on 
22 December 2004 and 28 February 2005 respectively. Rebecca McDonald was appointed as a non-executive
director on 1 July 2005. Non-executive directors are initially appointed for a three year term after which, whilst 
not automatic, their appointment may be extended for a second term subject to mutual agreement and
shareholder approval.
The Group has long recognised the vital role that non-executive directors play in ensuring high governance
standards. BOC has for many years had high calibre non-executive directors who bring a wide range of experience
and expertise to the BOC board.The board has determined that all the non-executive directors are independent
in accordance with the definition of that term in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance and the New
Y ork Stock Exchange listing standards and that they have no relationships which could materially interfere with the
exercise of their independent judgement.
The board has considered the position of Matthew Miau and determined that he is independent,
notwithstanding that he is also a non-executive director of BOC Lienhwa Industrial Gases Company Limited, a
50:50 joint venture in T aiwan between BOC and Lien Hwa Industrial Corporation. He is a representative of Lien
Hwa Industrial Corporation, a T aiwanese company. He does not have any executive responsibilities with either
company. Matthew Miau is the chairman of MiTAC-Synnex Group, a major electronics organisation with a turnover
greater than that of BOC, and he brings considerable expertise in the electronics and semiconductor markets and
an Asian business perspective to the board of BOC.The turnover of the joint venture attributable to BOC
represents approximately one per cent of the Group’s total turnover.The board has satisfied itself that neither this
association nor the time period with which he has been connected with the company are of sufficient significance
to either BOC or Matthew Miau to compromise his independence.
The board has a formal schedule of matters reserved to it. In particular the board’s main focus is on strategic
and policy issues, reviewing objectives and performance and the overall management of the Group.The board also
has responsibility for the review and monitoring of key company policies in such areas as risk management,
corporate governance, treasury matters and corporate social responsibility including safety, environment and the
Code of Conduct as well as all matters relating to the company’s listings on the London and New Y ork Stock
Exchanges. On an annual basis the board reviews the senior managers and their succession and development plans.
The board has to approve all Group commitments in excess of £25 million. Presentations are made to the board
on major projects and periodic reviews are given by management from each of the lines of business and Gist.The
board delegates certain functions to committees.There are six board committees, details of which are given below.
The board meets six times a year, with two meetings held at major operating subsidiaries. One of the board
meetings is combined with a strategy meeting lasting over a two day period.The meetings held at operating sites
provide the opportunity for the board to meet with the local management teams and receive presentations about
the local business operations. During 2005 the board visited the Group’s operations in South Africa and Poland.

Throughout 2005 the company continued to maintain directors’ and officers’ insurance.
There is a well established procedure enabling any director, in the furtherance of his or her duties as a BOC
director, to seek independent professional advice at the company’s expense.
All directors have access to the advice and services of the company secretary.The company secretary is
responsible for ensuring that the correct board procedures are followed and advises the board on all corporate
governance matters. In addition the company secretary manages the provision of information and documentation,
notably meeting papers, to the board promptly with enough time to enable them to prepare fully for any meeting.
Both the appointment and the removal of the company secretary are matters for the whole board.
Induction and professional development
Upon joining the board, new directors are required to undertake a full induction comprising, as appropriate to the
individual, site visits, meetings with the line of business chief executives, each member of the executive management
board and also key advisers. New directors are also advised of their legal and other duties and obligations as a
director of a listed company.This is supplemented by a reference binder, which is regularly updated, including
information about the board, the committees, directors’ duties, procedures for dealing in the company’s shares and
other regulatory and governance matters.
Appropriate training and briefings are available to all directors on appointment and subsequently, as necessary,
taking into account their individual qualifications and experience and any training requirements identified during the
annual performance review process.The company secretary monitors the availability and suitability of external
courses, details of which are circulated to the board. During the year certain directors attended external seminars
relating to specific areas of their responsibility.The board receives regular briefings on governance and regulatory
matters affecting the Group and its market sector activity and also on litigation relating to the Group.
The non-executive directors have full access to management and both internal and external auditors, and are
encouraged to stay fully abreast of the Group’s business, aided by site visits and meetings with senior management.
66 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 Corporate governance Performance evaluation
In line with the board’s decision to alternate each year between an internally and an externally facilitated review
process, during 2005 an externally facilitated review was undertaken with the emphasis on continuous
improvement and effectiveness of the board, its committees and the individual directors.The review focused on
matters such as the role and organisation of the board, the monitoring of Group performance, board leadership
and culture and board priority tasks including strategy and safety.The effectiveness of each of the principal
committees was evaluated as was the performance of each director.The chairman met with each director to give
feedback on his or her individual performance.
The results of the review were presented to the board.The chairmen of each of the audit, nomination 
and remuneration committees reviewed the results of the evaluation of each committee at meetings of their
respective committees.The results were very positive, showing an improvement in performance overall since the
previous review.Where areas for improvement have been identified, actions are being agreed. From the results of
the 2005 review the board and principal committees are comfortable that they are operating effectively and that
all directors continue to contribute effectively and are committed to their respective roles at BOC.
Sir Christopher O’Donnell, as senior independent director, led a meeting of the non-executive directors to
review the performance of the chairman. Comments on the chairman’s performance are given on page 65.
Board committees
There are six board committees to which the board delegates specific areas of responsibility as described below.
The terms of reference of the audit, nomination and remuneration committees are available on the company’s
website (www.boc.com) or upon request to the company secretary.
Whilst only the members of each committee are entitled to attend the respective committee meetings, the
chairmen of each committee invite, as they consider appropriate, management and advisers to certain meetings to
assist the committees in carrying out their duties.
Audit committee
Members:Andrew Bonfield, Guy Dawson, Rebecca McDonald, Matthew Miau, Sir Christopher O’Donnell
(chairman) and Anne Quinn.All members are independent non-executive directors. Secretary: Nick Deeming.
The primary objective of the audit committee is to assist the board of directors in fulfilling its responsibilities 
related to:
• financial reporting and quarterly results announcements;
• ensuring the independence and objectivity of the Group’s external auditors;
• determining the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal control environment.
The audit committee reviews its terms of reference on an annual basis.
The audit committee meets four times a year, the agendas being organised around the company’s financial
reporting cycle. Members’ attendance at meetings is detailed on page 66 and their qualifications are on pages 
8 and 9.Time is set aside at one of these meetings for the committee to meet with the internal and the external
auditors separately without the executive management present.The committee reviews the effectiveness of
internal controls, matters raised by the internal and external auditors in their regular reports to the committee 
and the quarterly financial statements prior to their release, as well as the arrangements by which staff of the
Group may, in confidence, raise concerns.The committee also monitors that an appropriate relationship between
BOC and the external auditors is maintained and reviews the policies and procedures in place to ensure the
independence and objectivity of the audit.The work undertaken by the committee during 2005 is described in
more detail in its report below.
Andrew Bonfield is considered by the board to be the audit committee financial expert. He is considered to
be independent in accordance with the definition of that term in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance
and the New Y ork Stock Exchange listing standards.All other members of the committee are financially literate.
Corporate governance 67 Audit committee report
In 2005 the audit committee discharged its responsibilities as set out in the terms of reference and the specific
matters reviewed by the committee included:
i) interim and full year financial results and announcement statements;
ii) interim and full year report from the internal audit function of progress against the 2005 audit plan and
effectiveness of internal controls;
iii) the Group’s project to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
This review included the project plan, progress against the plan and matters arising in the implementation of
the plan;
iv) details of the Group’s project to transition to International Financial Reporting Standards from 2006;
v) the external audit plan for 2005 presented by the Group’s auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC).
This review included the audit objectives, auditor independence and objectivity policies managed by PwC,
partner rotation, audit scope, team, timetable deliverables and fee proposal;
vi) the annual report disclosure items relevant to the audit committee. Included in this review were the Group’s
critical accounting policies, the going concern statement, the report on risk and internal controls and the risk
factors statement.The audit committee also reviewed the disclosure control review procedures employed by
the Group which enabled the chief executive and Group finance director to sign the Section 302 and 906
certificates pursuant to the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act;
vii) the external auditors’ report to the committee for 2005;
viii) the independence and objectivity of the external auditors, including a review of non-audit fees.The audit
committee has reviewed and approved a policy for the provision of non-audit services by the external
auditors.This policy has been in place since 2002 and defines services which can be provided by the auditors.
The policy also specifies which services cannot be provided.The policy requires all non-audit services to be
approved in advance by the audit committee, which has delegated this task to the chairman of the audit
committee.The approval process requires full disclosure of the objectives and scope of the services to be
performed and fee structure.The audit committee reviews all approved services at subsequent meetings.
The auditors are permitted to perform non-audit services only if the scope of work is within the terms of the
policy and there is a business benefit to the Group in these services being performed by the external auditors
rather than an alternative supplier.The level of the fee spend is closely monitored to ensure independence 
and objectivity of the audit is maintained. Further details of actual fees paid to external auditors are given in
note 2c) on page 97;
ix) the procedures by which staff can report, in confidence, any matters of a financial or non-financial nature
alleging breaches of the Group’s Code of Conduct.The audit committee also reviewed the procedures by
which allegations are reported to senior management and the audit committee.
During this period the audit committee met with the Group’s external auditors without the presence of
management.The audit committee also met with the Group’s head of internal audit without the presence of
management.The head of internal audit has access to the chairman of the audit committee, if necessary, outside 
of meetings.
Regular attendees to audit committee meetings, at the invitation of the chairman of the committee, include:
the chairman, chief executive, Group finance director, director of risk management, head of business assurance
audit, director financial planning and control, and the external auditors. Other senior managers are invited to attend
as required to participate in presentations or discussions to enable the committee to discharge its duties.
The audit committee concludes that, based on the foregoing, it has discharged its responsibilities as set out in
the terms of reference and is satisfied that auditor independence and objectivity have been maintained.
Nomination committee
Members:Andrew Bonfield, Guy Dawson,T ony Isaac, Rob Margetts (chairman), Rebecca McDonald, Matthew Miau,
Sir Christopher O’Donnell and Anne Quinn.The majority of members are independent non-executive directors.
Secretary: Nick Deeming.
The nomination committee reviews its terms of reference on an annual basis.
The nomination committee meets periodically as required but at least annually. During 2005 the committee
met six times. Members’ attendance at meetings is detailed on page 66.The committee primarily monitors the
composition and balance of the board and its committees, and identifies and recommends to the board the
appointment of new directors.The committee also keeps under review the board committee structure and the
composition of each committee and makes recommendations to the board of any changes considered necessary.
Whilst the chairman of the board chairs this committee he is not permitted to chair meetings when the
appointment of his successor is being considered or during discussions regarding his performance.
The committee reviews annually the succession plans for the executive directors and the executive
management board. During 2005 the vacant roles of chief executive, Industrial and Special Products and Group
human resources director were both filled by internal candidates.The committee also considers the reappointment
of non-executive directors upon expiry of their term of office and the proposals for re-election of directors retiring
by rotation at the Annual General Meeting. Directors submit themselves for re-election at regular intervals and at
least every three years in accordance with the company’s Articles of Association and the Combined Code on
Corporate Governance. During these deliberations consideration is given to the results of the annual board
evaluation.The evaluation process is explained in more detail above.The Notice of Annual General Meeting is
contained in a separate circular and details the directors who will be standing for election and re-election at 
the meeting.
68 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 Corporate governance During the year one new non-executive director and two executive directors were appointed to the board.
When considering the appointment of new directors the committee reviews the current balance of skills and
experience on the board.A detailed specification is drawn up to include any specific knowledge or expertise that is
considered of future benefit to the board and having regard to the business throughout the Group and the overall
business strategy. For executive vacancies internal candidates identified through the succession planning process 
are always considered in the first instance. External search consultants are used to identify suitable candidates for
non-executive positions or where alternative candidates are required for executive vacancies.The consultant 
draws up a short list of candidates for consideration.The committee then reviews and evaluates the short listed
candidates before submitting its recommendation to the board as a whole.
Remuneration committee

recommendation from the committee.
Accountability and audit
Statements of the respective responsibilities of the directors and auditors for these accounts are set out on 
pages 84 and 85.
Risk management and internal controls
This statement of compliance with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance in respect of risk management
and internal controls is in line with the arrangements set out by the Financial Reporting Council.
The board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of risk management and internal controls.
The schedule of matters reserved to the board ensures that the directors maintain full and effective control over all
significant strategic, financial, organisational and compliance issues.
Risk management in BOC The BOC risk management programme assists management throughout the Group to
identify, assess and mitigate business risk on a continuous basis.
The objective of risk management within BOC is to improve performance and decision making through
identification, assessment and mitigation of key risks.
A dedicated central team of risk management specialists is responsible for delivering the risk management
programme. During 2005 approximately 86 risk workshops or reviews have been conducted covering a broad
range of matters.These include risks in strategy, risks in meeting business unit targets, risks in acquisitions or ventures
and risks in major projects.
The risk management process operates on a global basis and covers the Group’s key risks, lines of business,
business units and corporate functions.
The output from each risk assessment is a set of prioritised risks with associated action plans.
Line management retains responsibility for completion of action plans. Progress of action plans is monitored 
and reported.
A report on the risk management process is provided to the board twice a year.These reports include
reviews of key strategic risks to the Group as well as the individual lines of business and identifies the status of
action plans against key risks.
Corporate governance 69 Internal controls in BOC The directors have delegated to executive management the establishment and
implementation of a system of internal controls appropriate to the various business environments in which it
operates.The Group operates under a system of controls that has been developed and refined over time to meet
its current and future needs and the risks and opportunities to which it is exposed.These controls, which are
communicated through various operating and procedural manuals and processes, include but are not limited to:
• The definition of the organisational structure and the appropriate delegation of authorities to operational
management;
• Procedures for the review and authorisation of capital investments through the investment committee
including post-acquisition reviews and appraisals;
• Strategic planning and the related annual planning process including the ongoing review by the board of the
Group’s strategies;
• The establishment of individual business unit annual performance targets and the quarterly business review of
actual performance;
• The monthly financial reporting and review of financial results and other operating statistics such as the health
and safety reports as well as the Group’s published quarterly financial statements, which are based on a
standardised reporting process;
• Accounting and financial reporting policies to ensure the consistency, integrity and accuracy of the Group’s
accounting records;
• Specific treasury policies and objectives and the ongoing reporting and review of all significant transactions and
financing operations.
The internal control system is monitored and supported by an internal audit function that operates on a global
basis and reports its results on the Group’s operations to management and the audit committee.The work of the
internal auditors is focused on the areas of greatest risk to the Group determined on the basis of a risk
management approach to audit.
There have been regular reviews by the audit committee of the board of the effectiveness of the Group’s
overall internal control processes throughout the year.
During 2005 the Group has developed and progressed its plan to meet the requirements of Section 404 
of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002 which is a requirement for BOC with effect from 2006.The internal audit
function has played an important role in developing and implementing the plan to identify, document and test key
controls over financial reporting as required by Section 404 and will have a significant role in supporting
management’s evaluation of design effectiveness and operational effectiveness of these controls.
The directors therefore believe that the Group’s system of risk management and internal controls provides
reasonable but not absolute assurance that assets are safeguarded, transactions are authorised and recorded
properly and that material errors and irregularities are either prevented or would be detected within a 
timely period.
Having reviewed its effectiveness, the directors are not aware of anything in the Group’s system of internal
controls during the period covered by this report and accounts which would render them ineffective.
There were no changes in the Group’s internal controls over financial reporting that occurred in the year
ended 30 September 2005 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to affect, the Group’s internal
control over financial reporting.
Disclosure controls and procedures
The chief executive and Group finance director, based on the evaluation of the effectiveness of the Group’s
disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report and accounts,
have concluded that, as of such date, the Group’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
Going concern
The directors’ report on going concern is included in the financial review on page 63.
Communication with shareholders
The board considers communication with shareholders, whether institutional, private or employee shareholders,
to be extremely important.A variety of communication mechanisms are used by the company. Financial results are
published quarterly, and half year and annual reviews are sent to all shareholders. Copies of the full annual report
are available by election or on request.The company’s website (www.boc.com) provides financial and other
business information about The BOC Group. It contains an archive of past announcements and annual reports,
share price information and a calendar of events as well as BOC’s social responsibility policies, including the
company’s Code of Conduct.There are also facilities in place to enable shareholders to receive communications
from the company in electronic form rather than by mail and for shareholders to provide their proxy votes for the
Annual General Meeting by electronic means.
The Annual General Meeting provides an opportunity for shareholders to question directors about the
company’s activities and prospects.The chairmen of each of the principal board committees are normally present.
Members of the board meet informally with shareholders after the meeting. During the year responses are given
to letters received from shareholders on a variety of subjects.
Separate resolutions are proposed for each substantially separate item of business proposed at the Annual
General Meeting.All resolutions will be voted on by taking a poll, with an indicative result advised to the meeting
and the verified result announced as soon as practicable after the meeting.The proxy voting result will also be
available on the company’s website (www.boc.com).
70 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 Corporate governance There is a programme of regular dialogue with major institutional shareholders and fund managers which is led by
the chief executive and Group finance director although the chairman, senior independent director and other
board members are offered the opportunity to attend meetings with major shareholders and are expected to do
so if shareholders request.The company also maintains contact, when appropriate, through the chairman of the
remuneration committee and other executive management to discuss overall remuneration policies and plans.
Summaries of these discussions and meetings are provided to the board. In addition the board receives copies of
most analysts’ and brokers’ reports issued on the company. Periodically the board receives presentations from
external advisers on investor perceptions.These summaries, reports and presentations enable the directors to gain
an understanding of the views and opinions of those with an interest in the company.
The directors are supported by the company’s investor relations department, which is in regular contact with
institutional shareholders, analysts and brokers.All contact with major shareholders, analysts, brokers and the media
is controlled by strict company guidelines to ensure that any price sensitive information that has not been made
generally available to all shareholders and potential investors is protected.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting will be held at the Institution of Electrical Engineers (Lecture Theatre), Savoy Place,
London WC2R 0BL on Friday 27 January 2006 commencing at 11.00 am.The Notice of Annual General Meeting,
which includes explanations of all resolutions, is contained in a separate circular which is being sent to all
shareholders more than 20 working days before the meeting.

Corporate governance 71 The remuneration committee 
The remuneration committee comprises all the independent non-executive directors, namely Guy Dawson
(chairman),Andrew Bonfield, Matthew Miau, Sir Christopher O’Donnell,Anne Quinn and Rebecca McDonald
(appointed 1 July 2005).Whilst neither the Group chairman nor the chief executive are members of the
remuneration committee they both attend the meetings by invitation but are not present when their personal
remuneration is discussed and reviewed.The Group human resources director acts as secretary to the committee
and provides it with information and data from national and international surveys. He is assisted by the Group
compensation and benefits director. In addition the remuneration committee has appointed T owers Perrin to advise
on the remuneration arrangements for senior executives.
The remuneration committee sets the overall remuneration policy of the Group and makes
recommendations to the board on the framework of executive remuneration. It meets six times a year. Individual
member attendance at the meetings is shown on page 66.The terms of reference are reviewed annually to ensure
that they conform with best practice. Specifically, the remuneration committee determines, on behalf of the board,
the detailed terms of service of the executive directors and other members of the executive management team
including basic salary, performance-related bonus arrangements, benefits in kind, long-term incentives and pension
benefits.The remuneration committee also reviews the remuneration of the chairman, following a
recommendation from the chief executive and the senior independent director.The board as a whole determines
the non-executive directors’ fees.
Remuneration policy 
BOC’s remuneration policy for executive directors and other executive management is designed to attract and
retain executives of the highest calibre so that the Group is managed successfully to the benefit of its stakeholders.
In setting remuneration levels the remuneration committee takes into account the remuneration practices found in
other UK listed companies of similar size, internationality and complexity.The policy is to pay salaries and total
remuneration around mid-market levels for on target performance and to provide the opportunity, via annual and
long-term incentives, for executives to be rewarded at the 75th percentile if this is justified by the achievement of
top of the range performance goals. It is the view of the remuneration committee that performance-related
remuneration should form a substantial element of total remuneration. Based on assumptions about expected
values for awards from the Long-T erm Incentive Plan (LTIP) and the Share Matching Plan (SMP), the proportion 
of performance-related remuneration to fixed remuneration (excluding pensions and benefits in kind) for current
arrangements is approximately 67 per cent to 33 per cent (see chart 1).
Last year, the remuneration committee made a number of changes to the performance-related elements 
of the executive remuneration package.These changes were approved by shareholders at the Annual General
Meeting in January 2005.The changes included the ceasing of option awards under the Executive Share Option
Scheme, an increase in target and maximum value of the Variable Compensation Plan (VCP) with one third of the
bonus being compulsorily transferred into a new SMP , and an increase in the maximum award level for the LTIP .
The increase in the maximum LTIP award level was to ensure that the remuneration committee has the flexibility
to remain fully competitive in the event that a higher level of award was required for an appointment to an
executive role.The remuneration committee does not propose to make any significant changes to the executive
remuneration package this year.
Remuneration components 
Basic salary Salaries for executive directors and executive management board members are based on median
market rates drawn from market data provided by remuneration consultants,T owers Perrin, and take account 
of an executive’s experience, responsibilities and performance. Performance is assessed both from an individual 
and business perspective. Remuneration for those executives of businesses outside the UK is denominated in the
local currency.
Benefits in kind Benefits in kind comprise company car benefits and membership of BOC’s healthcare insurance
scheme.Where appropriate, directors on international assignment receive overseas allowances such as housing and
children’s education fees.These allowances are on similar terms to those applying to other employees on the
international programme. Such benefits are in line with those offered by peer group companies. Benefits in kind do
not form part of pensionable earnings.

72 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005
Report on remuneration Variable Compensation Plan (VCP)The executive directors and senior management participate in the variable
compensation bonus plan.The plan focuses on annual objectives and links individual performance with business
plans. Last year, as part of the review of performance-related elements of the executive remuneration package, the
remuneration committee agreed that the target and maximum value of the VCP be increased to 110 per cent and
160 per cent of salary respectively and that one third of the VCP bonus be compulsorily deferred into the Share
Matching Plan. Details of the plan are shown on page 74.The financial targets for the executive directors and other
executive management board members are set on an annual basis by the remuneration committee and
performance against these targets is reviewed by the remuneration committee on a six monthly basis.The
remuneration committee considers that a six monthly review acts as a significant incentive and is conducive to
sustaining performance throughout the year.The financial targets are based equally on adjusted earnings per share
(EPS) and adjusted return on capital employed (ROCE) at Group level.Adjusted means excluding exceptional
items. Bonuses are assessed two thirds on these financial targets with the remaining third based on personal
objectives.These are based on BOC’s strategic priorities and include safety, growth, people and change
management and productivity. Performance is measured against key performance indicators determined during
formal appraisals.There is a threshold performance level below which no bonus is paid. For the financial year 2005
the financial targets set by the remuneration committee were EPS 66p and ROCE 15.3 per cent and the
achievement against these targets was EPS 64.3p and ROCE 15.3 per cent.The bonus payable in respect of the
financial targets amounts to 58.6 per cent of salary. In addition, an amount equal to 29.3 per cent of salary has been
deferred into the Share Matching Plan.
The bonuses for the executive directors and other members of the executive management board are paid
half yearly following the remuneration committee review. Details of the payments to directors are included in the
directors’ remuneration for the year on page 78.
Current long-term incentive arrangements 
Long-T erm Incentive Plan (LTIP) Executive directors, members of the executive management board and a number
of other key executives selected from the company’s global operations participate in the LTIP .The remuneration
committee has the discretion to grant awards up to a maximum of 2.5 times salary.The award made in November
2004 to the chief executive was based on 2 times salary and for other board directors 1.5 times salary.There are
three performance conditions: total shareholder return (TSR), adjusted earnings per share (EPS) and adjusted
return on capital employed (ROCE). Up to one third of the award could vest in respect of each performance
condition.
The TSR performance condition compares BOC’s TSR performance with two separate comparator groups, a
UK comparator group comprising 31 industrial and manufacturing companies and a global industrial gases group of
six leading companies as follows:
UK group
Aggregate Industries BPB Invensys Scottish & Southern Energy 
AMEC Centrica Johnson Matthey Scottish Power
Anglo American Corus Group Kelda Group Severn Trent
A WG FKI National Grid T ransco Shell T ranspor t & T rading
BAE Systems Hanson Pilkington Smiths Group
BG Group IMI Rio Tinto T omkins
BHP Billiton ICI RMC Group United Utilities
BP International Power Rolls-Royce
Aggregate Industries and RMC Group were taken over in 2005.Their TSR performance to the point at which they
were taken over has been included in the performance measurement.
Global gases group
Airgas (US – S&P 500 Index)
Air Liquide (France – CAC 40 Index)
Air Products & Chemicals (US – S&P 500 Index)
Linde (Germany – DAX 30 Index)
T aiyo Nippon Sanso (Japan – NIKKEI 225 Index)
Praxair (US – S&P 500 Index)
The BOC Group (UK – FTSE100 Index)
When determining BOC’s performance relative to the global gases group, the TSR for BOC and the comparator
companies is adjusted (adjusted TSR) so that it reflects the excess (or shortfall) in returns relative to the local
stockmarket index where each company has its primary listing.The nationality and the local stockmarket index 
that is used to calculate the adjusted TSR for each company is shown in the parentheses.
Report on remuneration 73 For the awards made in November 2004 which will vest in November 2007, the target set by the remuneration
committee is such that if the company’s TSR position measured over a three year period is median in respect of
both comparator groups, then 40 per cent of the shares in respect of the TSR part of the award will vest. If the
company’s TSR position is upper quartile, all of the shares in respect of the TSR part of the award will vest. If the
TSR performance is between the median and upper quartile, a proportion of between 40 per cent and all of the
shares in respect of the TSR part of the award will vest. If the company’s TSR position is below the median for both
comparator groups, the TSR part of the award will lapse.The same TSR performance criteria were used for the
awards made in the financial year 2004.The remuneration committee has decided that for any awards made in the
financial year 2006 onwards, 25 per cent rather than 40 per cent of the shares for the TSR part of the award will
vest at median.
The adjusted EPS performance condition is based on the company’s EPS relative to three year targets on a
sliding performance scale. For the awards made in November 2004 which will vest in November 2007, the target
set by the remuneration committee is 70.3p at the end of the three year performance period for minimum vesting.
If this is achieved, 40 per cent of the shares in respect of the EPS part of the award will vest.All of the shares in
respect of the EPS part of the award will vest if the company achieves 80.8p at the end of the three year
performance period. If the EPS performance is between 70.3p and 80.8p, a proportion of between 40 per cent
and all of the shares in respect of the EPS part of the award will vest. If EPS is less than 70.3p at the end of the
three year period, the EPS part of the award will lapse.The EPS targets for the financial year 2004 awards were
60.3p for threshold vesting and 69.3p for full vesting.
The adjusted ROCE performance condition is based on the company’s ROCE relative to three year targets
on a sliding performance scale. For the awards made in November 2004, and for further awards, the remuneration
committee decided that it would be appropriate to widen the ROCE band.The threshold  target set by the
remuneration committee for the November 2004 awards, which will vest in November  2007, is 13.5 per cent at
the end of the three year performance period. If this is achieved, 40 per cent of the shares in respect of the ROCE
part of the award will vest.All of the shares in respect of the ROCE part of the award will vest if the company
achieves a ROCE of 16 per cent. If the ROCE performance is between 13.5 per cent and 16 per cent a proportion
of between 40 per cent and all of the shares in respect of the ROCE part of the award will vest. If the ROCE is less
than 13.5 per cent the ROCE part of the award will lapse.The ROCE targets for the financial year 2004 awards
were 13.5 per cent for threshold vesting and 15 per cent for full vesting.
In setting three performance conditions for the LTIP awards, the remuneration committee took the view that
these were the most important measures that drive or measure sustainable improvements in shareholder value:
the TSR performance condition measures comparative performance while EPS and ROCE reflect a core part of
the company’s business strategy, enabling high levels of both earnings growth and capital efficiency. Details of the
awards made to directors are shown on page 82.
For the awards made for the financial year 2003, the performance conditions have been met to the extent
that 52.6 per cent of the shares vest on the third anniversary of the award date.
Share Matching Plan (SMP)The plan was adopted by shareholders at the 2005 Annual General Meeting. Executive
directors, members of the executive management board and other senior managers who participate in the VCP
are eligible to participate in the SMP . One-third of any VCP award is compulsorily applied to the acquisition of BOC
shares.The executives will become entitled to these shares only if they are still in service with BOC three years
after the award is made or are considered to be ‘good leavers’.The executives will receive an additional number of
shares equal to the value of the dividends paid during the deferral period of the shares and they may also receive a
matching share award of up to 100 per cent of the number of shares originally allotted.The percentage award will
depend on the company’s performance over the deferral period.Adjusted EPS will account for 75 per cent of the
performance weighting, with TSR accounting for the remaining 25 per cent.The adjusted EPS performance
condition is based on the company’s EPS relative to three year targets.These targets will be on a sliding scale,
where five per cent per annum growth rate over three years is required for threshold vesting of 25 per cent of that
portion. Full vesting will be achieved if EPS growth is 12 per cent per annum over the three year period.
The TSR performance condition compares BOC’s TSR performance against the same UK comparator group
as used for the LTIP .Awards will vest for this portion where BOC’s TSR position is median, measured over three
years.At this point 25 per cent of this portion of the award will vest. Full vesting occurs if the company is ranked at
or above the upper quartile. Details of the value of VCP awards for directors that will be applied to the acquisition
of BOC shares under the SMP are shown on page 78.
Executive Share Option Scheme 2003 (ESOS 2003)The last grant under the ESOS 2003 to executive directors
and employees who participate in the SMP took place in November 2003. The scheme was retained for selected
middle management throughout the company’s global operations. However, it is intended to develop an alternative
scheme for this group in the financial year 2006.The performance condition set for the ESOS 2003 by the
remuneration committee is that the growth in the adjusted EPS over a three year performance period must be
equal to or greater than the growth in the UK retail prices index (RPI) plus three per cent per annum over the
three year performance period. In line with current corporate governance best practice there is no rolling re-
testing of performance. In the event that the performance condition is not satisfied over the original three year
period then the remuneration committee has the discretion to re-test performance after five years, but only where
the remuneration committee believes the extension to be a fair and reasonable basis for assessing the sustained
underlying performance of the company.
74 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 Report on remuneration Awards under the LTIP , SMP and ESOS 2003 which vest may be satisfied in cash, for example, where it is necessary
for legal or tax reasons.The amount to be paid will, in the case of share options, be equal to the participant’s gain
on the exercise of the share option.Also, the remuneration committee may decide, prior to grant, that an award
shall be expressed to be a right to acquire a cash sum rather than shares.This type of award, known as a phantom
award, will normally only be granted to participants in jurisdictions where, because of local securities laws or
exchange control provisions, it is difficult to issue or transfer shares to employees.The LTIP , SMP and ESOS 2003
awards may be satisfied by using existing shares purchased in the market through The BOC Group plc Employee
Share Trust or by issuing new shares. In addition, the SMP awards may be satisfied by using shares held in treasury.
Awards under the LTIP , SMP and ESOS 2003 are not pensionable.
The current performance measures as a percentage of salary for on target performance are shown in chart 2.
Savings Related Share Option Schemes New schemes were adopted by shareholders at the 2005 Annual General
Meeting .These are operated in the UK,Australia, New Zealand and Ireland and are open to all employees,
including executive directors, with one year’s service or more.The UK scheme is approved by HM Revenue and
Customs.
TSR performance 
The graph to the left has been included to meet the requirement set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report
Regulations 2002. It shows BOC’s TSR performance, assuming dividends are reinvested, compared with all FTSE100
companies.This has been chosen because it provides a basis for comparison against companies in a relevant, broad
based equity index of which BOC is a constituent member.The remuneration committee decided that other
comparator groups were more appropriate as performance measurement for the LTIP .A graph showing BOC’s
TSR performance compared with the six major gases companies relative to respective local indices, which is one of
the comparator groups chosen for the LTIP , is shown in the chairman’s statement on page 5.
Former long-term incentive arrangements
Executive Share Option Scheme 1995The last grant of options to the executive directors and members of the
executive management board took place in February 2002 and the last award to other Group employees took
place in December 2002. No further awards will be made under this scheme.The options vest when the
company’s adjusted EPS growth is equal to, or exceeds, the growth in the retail prices index (RPI) by three per cent
per annum over any three year performance period.
Details of directors’ individual remuneration, share options, LTIP awards, amounts deferred from VCP bonus 
to SMP and shareholdings are given on pages 78 to 82.
Retirement benefits 
Pension arrangements for executive directors are in line with those of comparable executives in the countries in
which the directors are located.
In the UK, the BOC senior executive pension scheme is a funded, tax-approved, defined benefit pension
arrangement.Where necessary, the director’s pensionable pay is limited by the ‘earnings cap’ provisions of the
Finance Act 1989. In such cases, the company pays the director a salary supplement on earnings above the earnings
cap to reflect the loss of pension coverage.This supplement is recorded in the director’s emoluments and is not
taken into account in calculating bonuses or any other form of remuneration.
BOC closed its UK defined benefit pension arrangements to all new employees on 30 June 2003.
Pension arrangements for new employees are provided under a defined contribution Retirement Savings Plan.
The company makes contributions to the plan equal to two times the employee’s core contributions which can 
be three, four or five per cent of salary.
From 6 April 2006, the new Life Time Allowance rules will apply to UK pension provision. BOC will continue
to provide benefits under its defined benefit and defined contribution pension arrangements as set out above.
As an alternative, it will allow employees whose benefits will, or are likely to, exceed the Life Time Allowance to 
opt out of some, or all, further tax-approved pension provision. In such cases, the company will pay the individual 
a salary supplement on earnings which no longer benefit from pension coverage. For members of the defined
benefit arrangements, the supplement will be at the same rate as now applies to earnings above the ‘earnings cap’
and for members of the defined contribution pension arrangements, the supplement will be at the rate which
would have been paid into the Retirement Savings Plan. In both cases the supplement, when paid, will be similarly
recorded in the director’s emoluments.
In the US, the Cash Balance Retirement Plan is a funded, tax-qualified, defined benefit arrangement.
In the US, the BOC Senior Executive Retirement Plan is an un-funded, non-tax-qualified, defined benefit
arrangement which tops up the benefits provided under the Cash Balance Retirement Plan.
In Australia, the BOC Gases Superannuation Fund is a funded, defined contribution arrangement underpinned
by a defined benefit guarantee for long-serving employees who were members under a prior benefit structure.

75 Outside appointments 
The remuneration committee’s view is that non-executive directorships are a significant benefit in broadening
executives’ experience.Any such appointments are subject to review by the nominations committee and the
approval of the board.The executive is permitted to retain any fees for the service.T ony Isaac received fees of
£50,000 as a non-executive director of International Power plc and US$70,000 and an annual award of 2,000
shares as a non-executive director of Schlumberger Ltd. Dr Raj Rajagopal received fees of US$15,000 and an
option over 15,000 shares at an option price of $4.21 as a non-executive director of FSI International Inc. and
£13,542 as a non-executive director of Foseco plc.
Non-executive directors 
Non-executive directors are initially appointed for a three year term after which, whilst not automatic, their
appointment may be extended for a second term subject to mutual agreement and shareholder approval.The fees
are set at a level which will attract individuals with the necessary experience and ability to make a significant
contribution to The BOC Group’s affairs and are benchmarked with those fees paid by other UK listed companies.
The basic fees for the non-executive directors are £40,000 per annum, £10,000 of which, less tax, is invested in
BOC shares. In addition, the fees for chairing a committee are £10,000 per annum, £5,000 of which, less tax, is
invested in BOC shares. Following a review in November 2005 the board agreed that the basic fee should be
increased by £5,000 per annum with effect from 1 January 2006.This increase, less tax, will be invested in BOC
shares.The fee for Rob Margetts, company chairman, is £260,000 per annum.
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts.They do not participate in the Group’s variable
compensation arrangements, its long-term incentive arrangements or its pension arrangements.They do not
receive any benefits in kind.
Appointment of director 
Alan Ferguson joined the company on 15 September 2005 and was appointed a director on 30 September 2005.
As permitted under 9.4.2R(2) of the Listing Rules, Mr Ferguson received an award of shares to the value of
£550,000 on the day he joined the company.T wo thirds of this award will vest in March 2006.The remaining shares
will vest in March 2007. He also received an award of shares to the value of 200 per cent of salary under the LTIP .
Vesting will be in accordance with the performance conditions and performance period set by the remuneration
committee for the November 2004 LTIP award. In addition, the number of shares vesting will be pro-rated to the
number of months worked during the performance period.This will amount to twenty four months at the
expected vesting date.These awards were used to facilitate the recruitment of Mr Ferguson. He held a significant
number of share options and restricted shares under his previous employer’s share plans.The value of the awards
provided was calculated on a straight swap basis and will be payable unless his employment is terminated by reason
of summary dismissal.The details of Mr Ferguson’s contract are included below.
Future arrangements for chief executive 
T ony Isaac, the chief executive is due to retire in 2007.The remuneration committee wish to ensure that he
continues to be rewarded appropriately.With this in mind the remuneration committee has decided that he should
continue to participate in the long-term incentive arrangements during the financial year 2006. However for the
financial year 2007 the remuneration committee have agreed that he should not participate in these arrangements
and propose to award delivery of his 2007 objectives solely in cash, based on salary and cash bonus and linked to
additional specific and rigorous performance conditions.This approach will align Mr Isaac‘s pay with that of the
other directors, although at a lower level of deferred pay.
Service contracts
The company’s policy is for all executive directors to have contracts of employment that terminate on the
attainment of retirement age. In order to mitigate its liability on early termination, the company’s policy is that it
should be able to terminate such contracts on no more than 12 months’ notice, and that payments on termination
are restricted to the value of salary, car benefit and bonus entitlement (calculated on the basis of the average of
actual payments over the preceding two years) for the unexpired portion of the notice period.The company has
revised this policy further for all new appointments, so that in the event of early termination, the company will pay
either monthly compensation calculated as per the terms set out above for the unexpired portion of the notice
period, or else a lump sum payment equal to the base salary pro-rated to the unexpired portion of the notice
period. In the event that monthly compensation is paid, should an individual obtain alternative employment during
the period of the monthly payments, the company’s obligation is reduced by the amount of the monthly
remuneration from the alternative employment.The revised policy has applied to all new appointments during the
financial year and will apply to subsequent appointments. Pension provisions on termination are detailed in the
individual service contracts below.
76 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 Report on remuneration Individual service contracts Mr Bevan has a contract dated 5 December 2002 that can be terminated by the
company on 12 months’ notice. In the event of early termination, the contract provides for the payment of
compensation based on the value of salary, car benefit and bonus entitlement (calculated on the basis of the
average of actual payments over the preceding two years) for the unexpired portion of the notice period.
Mr Bevan would also be entitled to his deferred pension, with the unexpired portion of the notice period being
added to his pensionable service in the calculation of his pension entitlement.
Mr Isaac has a contract dated 19 November 2002, varied by letter dated 1 June 2004, which expires upon 
the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting in 2007 subject to possible extension by mutual agreement.
The contract can be terminated by the company on 12 months’ notice. In the event of early termination, the
contract provides for the payment of compensation based on the value of salary, car benefit and bonus entitlement
(calculated on the basis of the average of actual payments over the preceding two years) for the unexpired portion
of the notice period. Mr Isaac would also be entitled to a contribution to his funded unapproved retirement benefit
scheme amounting to the sum of 40 per cent of his pay above the ‘pension cap’ imposed by the Finance Act 1989
and 58.33 per cent of his pay up to the cap for the unexpired portion of his notice period.
Dr Rajagopal has a contract dated 1 May 1999, amended 22 November 2002, that can be terminated by 
the company on 12 months’ notice. In the event of early termination, the contract provides for the payment of
compensation based on the value of salary, car benefit and bonus entitlement (calculated on the basis of the
average of actual payments over the preceding two years) for the unexpired portion of the notice period.
Dr Rajagopal would also be entitled to have his deferred pension from the UK senior executive pension scheme
(a) calculated with the inclusion of the unexpired portion of his notice period in the calculation of pensionable
service; and (b) paid without actuarial reduction from age 55.
Mr Masters has a contract dated 11 March 2005, effective from 1 March 2005, that can be terminated by the
company on 12 months’ notice. In the event of early termination, the contract provides for the monthly payment 
of compensation based on the value of salary, car benefit and bonus entitlement (calculated on the basis of the
average of actual payments over the preceding two years) for the unexpired portion of the notice period. Should
Mr Masters obtain alternative employment during the period for payment of the monthly payments then each
monthly payment still outstanding would be reduced by the basic monthly remuneration received from his
alternative employment.
Alternatively, the contract also provides for the company to pay a lump sum termination payment in lieu of
the unexpired portion of the notice period instead of the monthly termination payments. Such a payment would
be equal to the base salary pro-rated to the unexpired portion of the notice period.The unexpired portion of 
Mr Master’s notice period would be added to his pensionable service in the calculation of his pension entitlement
from the US Senior Executive Retirement Plan. His US Cash Balance Retirement Plan and Savings Investment Plan
benefits would be credited with an amount equivalent to the amount the company would have contributed during
the unexpired portion of his notice period. His active participation in the Cash Balance Retirement Plan and Savings
Investment Plan would cease on termination.
Mr Ferguson has a contract dated 5 May 2005 that can be terminated by the company on 12 months’ notice.
In the event of early termination, the contract provides for the monthly payment of compensation based on the
value of salary, car benefit and bonus entitlement (calculated on the basis of the average of actual payments over
the preceding two years) for the unexpired portion of the notice period. Should Mr Ferguson obtain alternative
employment during the period for payment of the monthly payments then each monthly payment still outstanding
would be reduced by the basic monthly remuneration received from his alternative employment.
Alternatively, the contract also provides for the company to pay a lump sum termination payment in lieu of
the unexpired portion of the notice period instead of the monthly termination payments. Such a payment would
be equal to the base salary pro-rated to the unexpired portion of the notice period. Mr Ferguson would be
entitled to a contribution to his personal pension plan or a cash amount in lieu of his pay supplement for the
unexpired portion of his notice period.
If the contract is terminated within two years of his date of appointment, the company, with Mr Ferguson’s
agreement, has the discretion to make such termination payments in one lump sum or on a monthly basis.
All of the above contracts can be terminated by the individual director on six months’ notice.
Mr Walsh resigned from the board on 1 March 2005 and left the company on 31 March 2005. He received
no severance payment.All of his long-term incentive plans lapsed on his resignation.
Mr Médori resigned from the board and left the company on 31 May 2005. He received no severance
payment. He was entitled to exercise one vested share option which he was granted under the Executive Share
Option Scheme 1995 within three months of leaving the company.All of his other long-term incentives lapsed on
his resignation.
Shareholding guidelines 
The remuneration committee encourages the executive management group to grow personal shareholding in the
business over time. It is anticipated that each executive would build towards a shareholding of one times salary.
The remuneration committee believes that the vehicle of the long-term incentive arrangements will facilitate the
building of such a shareholding over a period of time.

Responsibility of the directors
For preparation of the financial statements
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and
fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the Group at the end of the year and of the profit or loss for
the year. In preparing those financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the financial statements;
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
company and the Group will continue in business.
The directors confirm that the financial statements comply with the above requirements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy
at any time the financial position of the company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial
statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.The directors also have general responsibility for taking
reasonable steps to safeguard the assets of the company and the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and
other irregularities.
A copy of the financial statements of the company is placed on the website of The BOC Group plc.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of statutory and audited information on the
company’s website. Information published on the Internet is accessible in many countries with different legal
requirements. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. Report by the independent auditors

Independent auditors’ report to the members of The BOC Group plc
We have audited the financial statements which comprise the Group profit and loss account, the Group balance
sheet, the Group cash flow statement, the total recognised gains and losses, the movement in shareholders’
funds, the balance sheet of The BOC Group plc, Group undertakings, accounting policies and the related notes.
We have also audited the disclosures required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 contained 
in the report on remuneration (‘the auditable part’).
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with
applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards are set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities.
The directors are also responsible for preparing the report on remuneration.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the auditable part of the report on remuneration in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the
Auditing Practices Board.This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the company’s
members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose.
We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person 
to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent
in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether
the financial statements and the auditable part of the report on remuneration have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985.We also report to you if, in our opinion, the report of the directors  is
not consistent with the financial statements, if the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not
received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding
directors’ remuneration and transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report and consider the implications for our 
report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements.
The other information comprises only the financial highlights, chairman’s statement, chief executive’s review,
board of directors, executive management board, Group five year record, Group profile, strategy, employees,
social, environmental and ethical performance, research and development and information technology, risk factors,
operating review, financial review, the unaudited part of the report on remuneration, responsibility of the directors,
shareholder information, cross reference to Form 20-F and glossary of terms.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the company’s compliance with the nine
provisions of the 2003 FRC Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority, and we report if it does not.We are not required to consider whether the board’s statements on
internal control cover all risks and controls, or to form an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s or Group’s
corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements and the auditable part of the report on remuneration. It also includes an assessment of the significant
estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we
considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial
statements and the auditable part of the report on remuneration are free from material misstatement, whether
caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the
presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and the
Group at 30 September 2005 and of the profit and cash flows of the Group for the year then ended; the financial
statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and those parts of the
report on remuneration required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

A E Isaac Director A M Ferguson Director Accounting policies
91
General
• Basis of preparationThese financial statements are based on the historical cost accounting convention in accordance with the Companies Act 1985
and comply with all applicable UK accounting standards.
UK accounting standards differ in certain respects from those generally accepted in the US and the major effects of these differences in the
determination of net income and shareholders’ funds are shown in note 30 to the financial statements. Disclosure requirements of both the 
UK and US are incorporated throughout the notes to these financial statements.
• Basis of consolidationThe Group accounts include the accounts of the parent undertaking and of all subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates.
The results of businesses acquired during the year are included from the effective date of acquisition.The results of businesses disposed of
during the year are included up to the date of relinquishing control. Material, separately identifiable business segments disposed of are analysed as
discontinued operations and prior years’ analyses are restated to reflect those businesses as discontinued.
• Accounting policiesThese accounts have been prepared on an accounting basis consistent with that applied in the financial year ended 
30 September 2004.
• Exchange Profit and loss and other period statements of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at average rates of exchange for the financial
year.Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the financial year end.Assets or liabilities
swapped into other currencies are accounted for in those currencies. Exchange differences are dealt with as a movement in reserves where they
arise from:
i) the translation of the opening net assets of overseas operations;
ii) the retranslation of retained earnings of overseas operations from average to closing rates of exchange; and 
iii) the translation or conversion of foreign currency borrowings taken to hedge overseas assets.
All other exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.The principal exchange rates affecting the Group are shown in the financial
review on page 63.
Revenue recognition
T urnover is based on the invoiced value of the sale of goods and services, and includes the sales value of long-term contracts appropriate to the state 
of completion. It excludes sales between Group undertakings,VAT and similar sales-based taxes.T urnover for goods and services is recognised when the
significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer.This is determined to be when delivery has occurred, title of the goods has
passed to the purchaser, and where the price is fixed or determinable and reflects the commercial substance of the transaction. Sales returns are not a
significant business issue in the industries in which the Group operates.
Revenue on long-term supply contracts with customers generally contains two elements:
i) a fixed charge for the use of production or storage facilities.This is recognised on a straight line basis over the period of the contract.Where the
charge is in respect of production facilities, it will also typically include the supply of a specified volume of product;
ii) a variable charge for the supply of product, or the supply of product in excess of a specified contract volume.This is recognised when the risks and
rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer.
Profit on long-term contracts is recognised on a percentage of completion basis. Provision is made for all losses incurred together with any foreseeable or
anticipated future losses.
Retirement benefits
Retirement benefits are accounted for under FRS17.
For defined benefit schemes the regular service cost of providing retirement benefits to employees during the year is charged to operating profit in
the year.The full cost of providing amendments to benefits in respect of past service is also charged to operating profit in the year.
A credit representing the expected return on the assets of the retirement benefit schemes during the year is included within other net financing
income.This is based on the market value of the assets of the schemes at the start of the financial year.
A charge representing the expected increase in the liabilities of the retirement benefit schemes during the year is included within other net financing
income.This arises from the liabilities of the schemes being one year closer to payment.
Differences between actual and expected returns on assets during the year are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses in the
year, together with differences arising from changes in assumptions.
For defined contribution schemes the cost of providing benefits is charged to operating profit as incurred.
Research and development
Revenue expenditure on research and development is written off when incurred.
Operating leases
The cost of operating leases is written off on the straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Intangible fixed assets
• Goodwill Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a business, being the excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets
acquired, is capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over its useful economic life, generally up to a maximum period of 20 years.
An impairment review is carried out at the end of the first full financial year following acquisition.Any impairment in the value of goodwill, calculated
by discounting estimated future cash flows, is dealt with in the profit and loss account in the period in which it arises. Negative goodwill, being the
excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired over the fair value of the purchase price, is capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis,
generally over a period equivalent to the realisation of the non-monetary assets acquired.
Goodwill, both positive and negative, arising on acquisitions before 30 September 1998 was taken to reserves and has not been reinstated on
the balance sheet.This is in line with the relevant accounting standard on goodwill, FRS10.This goodwill will remain in reserves until such time as it
becomes impaired or the business or businesses to which it relates are disposed of, at which time it will be taken to the profit and loss account or
statement of total recognised gains and losses where appropriate.
• Intangibles Other material intangible assets acquired, such as patents and trademarks, are capitalised and written off on the straight line basis over
their effective economic lives. T angible fixed assets
T angible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. No depreciation is charged on freehold land or construction in progress.
Depreciation is charged on all other fixed assets on the straight line basis to write them down to their residual values over the effective lives. Straight line
depreciation rates vary according to the class of asset, but are typically:
Per annum
Freehold property 2%–4%
Leasehold property (or at higher rates based on the life of the lease) 2%–4%
Plant and machinery 3%–10%
Cylinders 4%–10%
Motor vehicles 7%–20%
Computer hardware and major software 15%–25%
• Until 30 September 1999, land and buildings were revalued periodically. Following the adoption of FRS15, land and buildings are no longer revalued.
At 1 October 1999, the net book value of assets previously revalued is regarded as the historical cost.
• Interest costs on major fixed asset additions are capitalised during the construction period and written off as part of the total cost.
• Where finance leases have been entered into, the capital element of the obligations to the lessor are shown as part of borrowings and the rights in
the corresponding assets are treated in the same way as owned fixed assets.
• Any impairment in the value of fixed assets, calculated by comparing the carrying value against the higher of the net realisable value or value in use,
is dealt with in the profit and loss account in the period in which it arises.
Investments
Investments which are held for the long term and in which the Group has a participating interest and exercises joint control with one or more other
parties are treated as joint ventures and accounted for on the gross equity method. Investments which are held for the long term and in which the Group
has a participating interest and exercises significant influence are treated as associates and accounted for on the equity method. In both cases, the Group’s
share of the results of the investment is included in the profit and loss account, and the Group’s share of the net assets is included in investments in the
balance sheet. Other investments are shown on the balance sheet at cost less any provision for impairment.
Stocks
Stocks and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost where appropriate includes a proportion of overhead expenses.
Work in progress is stated at cost less progress payments received or receivable. Cost is arrived at principally on the average and ‘first-in, first-out’ (FIFO)
basis.The amount of long-term contracts, net of amounts transferred to cost of sales and after deducting foreseeable losses and payments on account, is
included in stocks as long-term contract amounts.
Deferred tax
The Group provides for deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in the financial
statements and their recognition for tax purposes. Deferred tax assets are only recognised where it is more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Provisions
Provisions are made when an obligation exists for a future liability in respect of a past event and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably
estimated. Restructuring provisions are made for direct expenditures of a business reorganisation where the plans are sufficiently detailed and well
advanced, and where appropriate communication to those affected has been undertaken at the balance sheet date. Provisions for warranties are based 
on contractual arrangements with customers and experience of product performance.
Financial instruments
The Group uses financial instruments, including interest rate and currency swaps, to raise finance for its operations and to manage the risks arising from
those operations.All transactions are undertaken only to manage interest and currency risk associated with the Group’s underlying business activities and
the financing of those activities.The Group does not undertake any trading activity in financial instruments.
• Foreign exchange transaction exposuresThe Group generally hedges actual and forecast foreign exchange exposures up to two years ahead.
Forward contracts are used to hedge the forecast exposure and any gains or losses resulting from changes in exchange rates on contracts designated 
as hedges of forecast foreign exchange are deferred until the financial period in which they are realised. If the contract ceases to be a hedge, any  gains
and losses are recognised through the profit and loss account.
• Balance sheet translation exposures A large proportion of the Group’s net assets are denominated in currencies other than sterling.Where
practicable and cost effective the Group hedges these balance sheet translation exposures by borrowing in relevant currencies and markets and by 
the use of currency swaps. Currency swaps are used only as balance sheet hedging instruments, and the Group does not hedge the currency
translation of its profit and loss account. Exchange gains and losses arising on the notional principal of these currency swaps during their life and at
termination or maturity are dealt with as a movement in reserves. If the swap ceases to be a hedge of the underlying transaction, any gains or losses
are recognised in the profit and loss account.
• Interest rate risk exposuresThe Group hedges its exposure to movements in interest rates associated with its borrowings primarily by means 
of interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements. Interest payments and receipts on these agreements are included with net interest payable.
They are not revalued to fair value and are not shown on the Group balance sheet at the balance sheet date.

In 2004 following the sale of the packaged gas business in the US, costs of £14.8 million were incurred to restructure the footprint of the remaining
business in the US.This covered the severance costs and other costs of restructuring those functions which are shared by BOC’s businesses in the US.
Restructuring costs in 2004 also included a charge of £2.6 million (2003: £8.3 million) relating to the integration of BOC’s gases business and part of the
Air Liquide business in Japan to form Japan Air Gases.
The restructuring costs in 2003 related to various programmes including programmes under the business initiative announced in August 2001.
The major programmes covered investments in information management systems, the restructuring of BOC Edwards’ manufacturing capacity and
restructuring to deliver operational efficiencies in Process Gas Solutions and Industrial and Special Products.These programmes were completed in 2004.
Cash flow from operating activities includes an outflow of £16.9 million (2004: £11.9 million, 2003: £28.3 million) in respect of the various
restructuring programmes.
ii) Litigation settlement
An action was filed in the US against The BOC Group Cash Balance Retirement Plan (the Plan). It was alleged that the Plan improperly calculated lump
sum distributions from the Plan in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. In November 2003, the parties reached an agreement 
to settle at US$69 million (£43.2 million).The settlement was approved by the court in March 2004.The full amount was provided in 2003 as an
exceptional item.The settlement is being paid out of Plan assets.

iii) Disposal of businesses
The sale of Afrox Healthcare Limited in South Africa was completed on 22 March 2005.African Oxygen Limited, BOC’s subsidiary in South Africa, retains
a significant interest in the hospitals business through a 20 per cent holding in the new company.The gain on disposal was £84.9 million.
The sale of the packaged gas business in the US was completed on 30 July 2004.The loss on disposal of £79.5 million in 2004 included the write-off
of the assets associated with the business, severance and other disposal costs. It also included a goodwill write-off of £19.9 million, of which £15.3 million
had been written off to reserves in the years up to, and including, 1998 in accordance with prevailing UK GAAP at that time. Part of the consideration was
payable subject to certain conditions and accordingly was not recognised in 2004.This remaining consideration was received in November 2005 and has
been recognised in 2005 as an exceptional item.
iv) Profit on disposal of fixed assets
The sale of an investment in the US in 2005 resulted in a profit of £10.5 million, which has been accounted for as an exceptional item.The sale of property
in the UK in 2004 resulted in a profit of £4.9 million, which was accounted for as an exceptional item.

3. The audit fees for the Afrox hospitals business are £0.4 million for 2005.These fees are not included in the above figures for 2005 following the disposal by BOC’s South African subsidiary of its
majority shareholding in Afrox Healthcare Limited in March 2005.
BOC operates a number of policies designed to ensure auditor independence and objectivity.The audit committee is responsible for overseeing
implementation of these policies including the review of all expenditure related to non-audit services.The audit committee, by delegation to the chairman
of the audit committee, approves in advance any non-audit services and has approved a policy that prevents the use of the auditor for any services that
could threaten the independence or objectivity of the audit.

d) Factors that may affect future tax charges
The total charge in future periods will be affected by any changes to the corporation tax rates in force in the countries in which the Group operates.
The current tax charge will also be affected by changes in the excess of tax depreciation over book depreciation and the use of tax credits.
e) Unused tax credits
On a consolidated basis, the Group has net operating loss carryforwards of £1.3 million. If not offset against taxable income, these losses will expire as
follows:
Net

2006 –
2007 –
2008 –
2009 –
2010 –
Thereafter, or no expiry date 1.3
For US Federal tax purposes, the Group has investment tax credits and general business tax credits to carry forward of approximately £7.8 million, which
are available to reduce income taxes otherwise payable.These do not expire until 2006 or thereafter.
In addition, the Group has alternative minimum tax credits for US Federal income tax purposes of approximately £27.3 million which can be carried
forward to reduce regular tax liabilities of future years.There is no expiration date on these credits.
Investment tax credits are accounted for by the flow-through method whereby they reduce income taxes currently payable and the provision for
income taxes in the period in which the assets giving rise to such credits are placed in service. Deferred tax assets, subject to the need for a valuation
allowance, are recognised to the extent that the investment tax credits are not currently utilised.

Notes to the financial statements 101 7.Options and incentive schemes
a) Policy
Executive options that are granted at the market price of the company’s shares at the time of the grant do not attract a compensation expense under UK
GAAP . For those executive options, including the Long-T erm Incentive Plan, that are granted at a discount to the market price of the company’s shares at the
time of the grant, the compensation expense is charged to the profit and loss account over the life of the option.The Group takes advantage of the exemption
granted under UITF17 (revised 2003), Employee Share Schemes, whereby no compensation expense need be recorded for employee schemes that are
granted at a discount.
b) Summary of movements
BOC operates share option schemes for both executives and employees.The features of these are given in the report on remuneration on pages 73 
to 75 and in the employees report on page 25.

102 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 Notes to the financial statements 8.Pensions and other retirement benefits
a) UK GAAP Group
The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world.The larger schemes are self-administered and the schemes’ assets are held
independently of the Group’s finances. Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries.
Contributions to funded defined benefit schemes are based on advice from independent actuaries using actuarial methods, the objective of which is
to provide adequate funds to meet pension obligations as they fall due. For the two largest schemes, in the UK and US, the dates of the latest actuarial
reviews are 31 March 2002 and 1 January 2004 respectively.
In South Africa, under the Pension Funds Second Amendment Act 2001, surpluses in pension funds have to be used in a manner specified in
Regulations to the Act to improve current and former members’ benefits before the employer can obtain any benefit from the surpluses. Consequently,
it is considered unlikely that the company will obtain any benefit from the surpluses in the South African schemes.Therefore, in accordance with FRS17,
the surpluses at 30 September 2005 have been written off in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
In Europe, company contributions to the main scheme in respect of current service are currently payable at a rate of 13.8 per cent of payroll. In the
year ended 30 September 2005 the company made additional contributions of £36 million to this scheme in order to reduce the funding valuation deficit.
The level of additional contributions for the year to 30 September 2006 is expected to be up to 20 per cent higher than in 2005.
In the Americas, company contributions to the main pension plan remain suspended as the plan continues to be in surplus.
In Africa, company contributions were payable at rates ranging from 11 per cent to 21 per cent of payroll and are expected to remain at that level for
the year to 30 September 2006.
In Asia/Pacific, company contributions to the main scheme were payable at rates ranging from 9 per cent to 20 per cent of payroll and are expected
to remain at that level for the year to 30 September 2006.
Some of the defined benefit schemes, including the UK scheme, are closed to new members. It is therefore expected that under the projected unit
method prescribed by FRS17 the contribution rate in respect of current service will increase as the members of the schemes approach retirement.
The most recent actuarial funding valuations have been updated by independent qualified actuaries, in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes at 
30 September 2005 for the purposes of FRS17. Scheme assets are stated at their market value at 30 September 2005.

b) UK GAAP parent company
The company accounts for pension costs in accordance with FRS17 on retirement benefits. In accordance with the standard, the company treats
contributions to defined benefit schemes as if they were contributions to a defined contribution plan.This is because the underlying assets and liabilities of 
the defined benefit schemes cover a number of the Group’s UK undertakings and cannot readily be split between each undertaking on a consistent and
reliable basis.
The pension cost recognised in the company’s accounts is the total of company contributions payable to Group UK pension schemes in the year.
The assets of all Group UK pension schemes are held independently of the Group’s finances.The largest schemes are self-administered.
c) US GAAP
For the purposes of US GAAP , the pension costs of the largest schemes have been reclassified in the following tables in accordance with the requirement
of SFAS132.The changes in projected benefit obligation, plan assets and details of the funded status of these retirement plans, together with the changes in
the accumulated other post-retirement benefit obligations of the Group’s US business, are given below.The measurement date for UK and US pension
plans is 30 June and the measurement date for the Australian and South African plans is 30 September.The difference between the UK and US GAAP
information disclosed in note 8a) and c) is included in note 30.
Investment strategy for the schemes is generally set by their respective trustee or fiduciary, after taking advice from their investment advisers,
and in consultation with the company.The strategy reflects the funding position of the schemes, and a careful assessment of the risks inherent over 
the long term in various asset classes.The assets of the schemes are diversified by asset class, by investment manager and by geography, in order to 
reduce risk. Strategy is reviewed periodically.
At 30 June 2005 the measurement date for SFAS132 reporting, the target asset allocation and actual asset allocation of the main UK scheme was:
2005 2004
T arget Actual Actual
Equity securities 68% 69% 72%
Debt securities 18% 17% 19%
Real estate 14% 13% 8%
Cash 0% 1% 1%
In the US, the fiduciary invests in short-term bonds to broadly cash match the liabilities that are expected to fall due within three years.The balance of the
plan’s assets is currently invested in equities. Following this policy, the actual asset allocations of the plan at 30 June 2005 were as follows:
2005 2004
Equity securities 84.9% 77.5%
Debt securities 15.1% 22.5%
The company establishes the long-term expected rate of return on the schemes’ assets by developing a long-term rate of return assumption for each
asset class, taking into account such factors as the market yield on bond investments of appropriate duration, and the expected risk premium for other
asset classes, based on long-term historical trends.A single, long-term return assumption is then calculated as a weighted average return, based on the
expected returns for each asset class.

For the post retirement medical benefits plan at 30 September 2005, the initial health care cost trend rates for valuing the medical benefits and drug
benefits post age 65 were 10.0 per cent (2004: 9.0 per cent) and 2.5 per cent (2004: 3.2 per cent) respectively.The rates for valuing post age 65 medical
benefits are assumed to reduce gradually to 4.5 per cent in 2013 (2004: 4.5 per cent in 2011).The rates for valuing drug benefits post age 65 are assumed
to reduce gradually to 0.55 per cent in 2013 (2004: 0.65 per cent in 2011). For valuing pre age 65 medical and drug benefits, a blended health care trend
rate of 10.0 per cent was used for 30 September 2005 (2004: 9.0 per cent).This blended rate was assumed to reduce gradually to 4.5 per cent in 2013
(2004: 4.5 per cent in 2011).

10.Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to Ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue 
during the year.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potential dilutive shares.
The company has only one category of potential dilutive shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the
average market price of the company’s shares during the year and where any performance conditions have been met at the balance sheet date.
Adjusted earnings per share (excluding exceptional items) are presented in order to show the underlying earnings performance of the Group.

c) Short-term interest rates
The average interest rate on commercial paper for the year to 30 September 2005 was 4.4 per cent (2004: 3.3 per cent) and on other short-term
borrowings was 8.2 per cent (2004: 9.3 per cent).
d) Facilities
The Group maintains a number of short and medium-term committed lines of credit.The main medium-term facilities are multi-currency agreements 
with a group of relationship banks, under which the Group may borrow up to US$450 million (£254 million) (2004: US$450 million (£249 million)) for
general corporate purposes.These facilities were undrawn both at 30 September 2005 and 30 September 2004.The following table shows the maturity
profile of these facilities.

In October 2005, these facilities were replaced with US$600 million (£339 million) of committed multi-currency facilities maturing in 2010.
Additional committed facilities are maintained by the principal operating units in the Group.
e) Security
The secured loans, maturing between 30 September 2005 and 2019, are principally secured by charges over the property, plant and machinery, stocks and
trade debtors of certain overseas subsidiaries.
21.Financial instruments
a) Interest rate, currency and counterparty exposure
The Group’s approach to managing currency and interest rate risk and its use of swaps in that process is described on page 56 in the financial review
under the heading ‘management of financial risks’.
Interest rate swaps
At 30 September 2005, the Group had entered into five interest rate swap agreements (2004: five) with its main relationship banks with notional principal
amounts of £286.4 million (2004: £285.3 million).The swaps’ underlying currencies are sterling, US dollars and Japanese yen.The following table shows the
maturity profile and weighted average interest rates payable and receivable on interest rate swaps at 30 September:

286.4 285.3
% %
Weighted average receivable swap rate 4.1 3.8
Weighted average payable swap rate 4.8 4.5
The weighted average receivable/payable swap interest rate is calculated by applying the notional swap interest received or paid, using rates applicable at
the financial year end, to the notional principal of outstanding swaps at the financial year end.
During 2004, the Group also entered into four interest rate swap agreements that are due to commence in 2006 and 2007 for a period of five years.
The notional principal amounts of these swaps are £106.4 million and their underlying currencies are US dollars and Japanese yen.

Currency swaps
At 30 September 2005, the Group had entered into 12 currency swap agreements (2004: 25) with its main relationship banks with notional principal
amounts of £341.7 million (2004: £593.1 million).The maturity dates range between one month and 36 months from the balance sheet date (2004:
between one month and 48 months).The following table illustrates the impact of the currency swaps on the Group’s net debt at 30 September:

The weighted average receivable interest rate on currency swaps was 4.4 per cent (2004: 3.9 per cent) and the weighted average payable interest rate
was 4.3 per cent (2004: 4.1 per cent).The weighted average receivable/payable swap interest rate is calculated by applying the notional swap interest
received or paid, using rates applicable at the financial year end, to the notional principal of outstanding swaps at the financial year end.
The currency and interest rate exposure of the net borrowings of the Group at 30 September, after taking into account interest rate and currency
swaps entered into by the Group, is given in the table below.

Counterparty risk
The Group is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments, but does not expect any
counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.There are procedures and policies in place limiting the Group’s exposure to concentrations of credit or
country risk.

1. For those bearing either no interest or a floating rate of interest it is deemed that the carrying amount approximates to the fair value. For those bearing a fixed rate of interest an assessment of
the interest rate at which the Group could make the same loan under current market conditions has been made. Unless this differs significantly from the fixed rate it is also deemed that the
carrying amount approximates to the fair value.Where this does differ significantly, the fair value is based on the discounted value of future cash flows.
2. For equity instruments listed on a recognised stock exchange the fair value is the quoted market price. For other equity instruments it is deemed that the carrying amount approximates to the 
fair value.
3. The fair value is the quoted market price.Where no quoted market price exists, it is deemed that the carrying amount approximates to the fair value.
4. As all bear either no interest or a floating rate of interest it is deemed that the carrying amount approximates to the fair value.
5. For those bearing a floating rate of interest it is deemed that the carrying amount approximates to the fair value. For those bearing a fixed rate of interest the fair value is either the quoted
market price where a liquid market exists or has been calculated using well established pricing models.
6. The carrying amount is deemed to approximate to the fair value.
7. The fair value is based on market valuations at the balance sheet date.
8. This category of derivative financial instruments includes: the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts of £0.2 million (2004: £7.5 million) and the fair value of natural gas futures contracts
of £6.9 million (2004: £nil).The fair values are based on market prices and forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
9. Includes foreign currency and interest rate swap agreements.
ii) Hedges
As explained on page 56 of the financial review under the heading ‘management of financial risks’,the Group’s policies are to use forward foreign exchange
contracts to hedge transactional currency exposures (principally arising through anticipated sales and purchase transactions) and swap agreements to manage
interest rate risks and hedge structural currency exposures.
Currency swaps are only held to change the currency of the Group’s borrowings to match better its net investments in its overseas subsidiaries.
In accordance with the Group’s accounting policies,the assets and liabilities arising from these swap agreements are translated into sterling at the spot rate ruling 
at the balance sheet date.The resulting exchange gains or losses are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses (to match the exchange 
gains or losses on the net investments in the overseas subsidiaries).
The carrying amount of the swap agreements (as shown in note 21 b) i)) is the result of the exchange gains and losses recognised in the statement
of total recognised gains and losses, and is analysed in the deferred gains and losses table shown below.

Under US GAAP , hedge accounting is not used in respect of the derivative financial instruments included in the table above.
c) Currency exposures
As outlined on page 56 in the financial review under the heading ‘currency risk’, it is the Group’s policy to hedge against the potential impact on its profit
and loss account of the currency gains and losses arising from monetary assets and liabilities not denominated in the operating or functional currency of
the operating unit involved.
After taking account of the hedging transactions, there was no significant net profit and loss account exposure to currency gains and losses arising
from monetary assets and liabilities at 30 September 2005.

Financial assets on which no interest is received comprise £13.2 million (2004: £24.3 million) of non-redeemable equity instruments in other companies
and £5.1 million (2004: £15.2 million) of loans to joint ventures and associates which have no fixed date of repayment.
The floating rate financial assets, which principally comprise cash and deposits, current asset investments and loans to joint ventures and associates,
carry interest based on different benchmark rates depending on the currency of the balance.
The principal benchmark rates for floating rate financial assets are LIBOR for sterling balances, US LIBOR for US dollar balances,Australian bank bill
rate for Australian dollar balances, South African prime rate for South African rand balances and Japanese yen LIBOR for Japanese yen balances.

The floating rate financial liabilities principally comprise debt which carries interest based on different benchmark rates depending on the currency of 
the balance.
The principal benchmark rates for floating rate financial liabilities are LIBOR for sterling balances, US LIBOR for US dollar balances,Australian bank bill
rate for Australian dollar balances, South African prime rate for South African rand balances and Japanese yen LIBOR for Japanese yen balances.
The maturity profile of borrowings is set out in note 20 b). Floating rate financial liabilities other than borrowings are mainly employee incentive
provisions.These are expected to be utilised over the period to 2016 depending on the future choices of the relevant employees. Financial liabilities on 
which no interest is paid principally relate to creditors due after more than one year.The majority of the amount relates to deposits for cylinder rentals.
It is not anticipated that this balance will reduce significantly in the short to medium term.The remaining balances falling due after more than one year 
are expected to be paid or utilised by 2009.

124 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 Notes to the financial statements 22.Provisions for liabilities and charges continued
Incentive and other employee provisions include long-term share incentive awards and deferred compensation plans. Note 7 contains further details of
the long-term share incentive units.
Provision for uninsured losses covers third party liabilities or claims. Due to the time frame that is often involved in such claims, a significant part of this
provision is subject to actuarial valuation.Where this is not appropriate, other external assessments are used.
Environmental provisions have been set aside to cover the costs of remediation for a number of hazardous waste sites.The costs are expected to be
incurred between 2006 and 2030. Due to the period over which this expenditure is likely to be incurred, the provision has been discounted at a rate of 
four per cent.The effect of discounting is £5 million. Management expects that payments will be approximately £7 million in 2006, approximately 
£3 million each year for the next four years and £12 million in total thereafter. Management uses its judgement and experience to make an appropriate
provision. Management believes that there is no reasonable possibility of a loss materially in excess of the amounts provided.
During the year, the provision for de-commissioning costs was reviewed.As a result of revising previous estimates, an amount of £20.2 million was
recognised for future obligations with a corresponding increase in the carrying value of tangible fixed assets. Due to the period over which this expenditure
is likely to be incurred, between 2006 and 2054, and the different regions in which it will be incurred, the provision has been discounted at rates of
between four and six per cent.The effect of discounting is £32 million.The timing of actual expenditure will vary depending on contractual supply
arrangements with customers.
Further information on deferred tax is disclosed in note 4.

b) Legal proceedings
BOC Group companies are parties to various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including some in which claims for damages in large
amounts have been asserted.
The outcome of litigation to which BOC Group companies are party cannot be readily foreseen, but the directors believe that such litigation should
be disposed of without material adverse effect on the Group’s financial condition or profitability.
Welding fumes litigation A US subsidiary of BOC,The BOC Group, Inc., currently is party to a number of lawsuits in the US for alleged injuries resulting
from exposure to manganese, asbestos and/or toxic fumes in connection with the welding process. The BOC Group, Inc. has not manufactured welding
rods in the US since 1986 when the welding electrodes business was sold.The BOC Group, Inc. ceased selling welding rods in the US manufactured by
others when the sale of the US packaged gas business, including the operations that distributed packaged gases and welding equipment, was completed 
in July 2004.
Manganese litigation At 30 September 2005, there were a total of approximately 8,574 claimants (‘T otal Claimants’) in pending manganese related cases in
both US federal and state courts that name The BOC Group, Inc. as a defendant, a net decrease of approximately 1,100 claimants from 30 September
2004.The BOC Group, Inc. is typically one of several defendants in these cases that claim compensatory and punitive damages, in most cases for
unspecified amounts, for alleged neurological injury, including Parkinson’s disease, through exposure to manganese in welding fumes. Of the T otal Claimants,
approximately 4,607 claimants have filed in, or been transferred for pre-trial purposes to, the federal district court in the Northern District of Ohio, where
a multi-district litigation (MDL) proceeding has been commenced, and approximately 50 claimants are in process to be transferred to or from the MDL.
The MDL proceeding is a vehicle for coordinating pre-trial proceedings in cases pending in different federal district courts in the US. It is currently
contemplated that the MDL court will try three cases during the MDL proceeding.The first such case is currently scheduled for February 2006. In addition
to the cases in federal court,The BOC Group, Inc. is a defendant in a number of similar cases pending in state courts, which are in different stages of
procedural development, and certain cases are scheduled for trial from time to time.The BOC Group, Inc. has been a co-defendant in other manganese
related claims that have been resolved as follows. From 1 January 1997 to 30 September 2005, 3,965 claims were dismissed.Through 30 September 2005,
seven cases were tried to final jury verdicts in favour of the defendants, including The BOC Group, Inc., and one case was tried to a final jury verdict in
favour of the plaintiffs, which is being appealed.
Asbestos litigation At 30 September 2005, there were a total of approximately 15,966 claimants in pending asbestos related cases that name The BOC
Group, Inc. as a defendant, a net decrease of approximately 600 from 30 September 2004.The BOC Group, Inc. is typically one of a large number of
defendants in these cases that claim compensatory and punitive damages, in most cases for unspecified amounts, for alleged injuries, including cancer,
through exposure to asbestos in welding fumes or from welding consumables.A very small number of these claimants allege injuries from exposure to
asbestos in non-welding rod products and premises.The BOC Group, Inc. has been a co-defendant in other asbestos related claims that have been
resolved as follows. From 1 January 1997 to 30 September 2005, 11,776 claims were dismissed and 75 claims were dismissed on summary judgments.
Through 30 September 2005, nine cases were tried to final jury verdicts in favour of the defendants, including The BOC Group, Inc., and one case was tried
to a final jury verdict in favour of the plaintiffs, which is being appealed.
The BOC Group, Inc. believes that it has strong defences to the claims asserted in all of the various manganese and asbestos related cases and intends 
to defend vigorously such claims. In the manganese related claims,The BOC Group, Inc. believes that recent relevant scientific literature, based on
epidemiological studies, strongly supports its defence of such claims. Based on its experience to date, together with its current assessment of the merits 
of the claims being asserted and applicable insurance, BOC believes that continued defence and resolution of the welding fumes litigation will not have 
a material adverse effect on its financial condition or profitability and no provision has been made. Nonetheless, it is not possible to predict either the
number of future claims or the number of claimants that any future claims may present. In addition, the outcome of welding fume cases, either involving
BOC or other defendants, is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict, and BOC cannot provide any assurances that any future resolutions of
these types of claims will necessarily be consistent with its experience to date. In the event of an adverse outcome to any of the proceedings, a liability
would be recognised if it was considered likely that it would give rise to an outflow of future economic benefits.Where there is applicable insurance, this
would be recognised when its recoverability was virtually certain.
Fluorogas litigation The Fluorogas litigation is now settled and is no longer the subject of any legal proceedings. More details are given on page 59.

In September 2005, BOC acquired G Van Dongen Holding BV, expanding Gist’s primary business into Europe.
In March 2005, BOC acquired 50 per cent of Maanshan BOC-Ma Steel Gases Co Limited, the joint venture formed to supply the industrial gases
needs of Ma Steel in China.
During 2005, BOC made an additional equity investment in Compania de Nitrogeno de Cantarell (CNC) in proportion to its 65 per cent equity
shareholding.
In March 2005, BOC’s South African subsidiary,African Oxygen Limited (Afrox) completed the sale of its majority shareholding in Afrox Healthcare
Limited to a consortium led by two major black empowerment groups. Profit on disposal of this business amounted to £84.9 million.Afrox has retained a
significant interest in the hospitals business through a 20 per cent holding in the new company. Following this disposal,Afrox accounts for its share of the
business on an equity basis, taking its share of operating profit and net interest into account.
In 2005, the Group also recognised a further £13.2 million profit on disposal of the US packaged gas business.The additional proceeds, received in
November 2005, had been subject to certain conditions at the time of disposal in July 2004.
In December 2004, BOC, through its subsidiary Thai Industrial Gases Public Co Limited, sold its shares in Unique Gas and Petrochemicals Public Co
Limited.

During the year, interest income of £13.8 million (2004: £7.3 million, 2003: £7.6 million) was received from the Cantarell joint venture in Mexico.
During the year, the Group was invoiced £45.9 million in respect of purchases of production plants from Linde BOC Process Plants in the US.
At 30 September 2005, £1.9 million was payable in respect of these invoices. No material purchases were made in 2004 or 2003.
The Group had no other material related party transactions that might reasonably be expected to influence decisions made by the users of 
these accounts.
Notes to the financial statements 131 30.US accounting information
a) Summary of differences between UK and US generally accepted accounting principles and other US accounting information
The financial statements of The BOC Group plc are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the UK (UK GAAP), which
differ in certain significant respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the US (US GAAP).
Set out below is a summary of the more significant adjustments which would be required if US GAAP had been applied, together with reconciliations
of net profit and shareholders’ funds from a UK GAAP to a US GAAP basis.Also presented on a US GAAP basis are a movement in shareholders’ funds,
a consolidated cash flow statement, information on earnings per share, information on stock based compensation and details of recently issued US
accounting pronouncements.
Goodwill and other intangible assets
Under UK GAAP , goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1998 accounted for under the purchase method has been eliminated against shareholders’ funds.
Additionally, UK GAAP requires that on subsequent disposal or closure of a business, any goodwill previously taken directly to shareholders’ funds is then
charged against income.The Group adopted FRS10 in 1999, which requires goodwill on subsequent acquisitions to be capitalised and amortised over a
period not exceeding 20 years.
Under UK GAAP the Group has recognised negative goodwill on certain acquisitions. Under US GAAP , the excess of the amounts assigned to the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed over the acquisition cost is adjusted against the values of the acquired long-lived assets in accordance with SFAS 141.
This does not result in a difference between the shareholders’ funds under UK GAAP and US GAAP , although there is a difference in the classification
between tangible and intangible assets.
Under US GAAP (SFAS142) goodwill continues to be capitalised, although no amortisation is charged to the income statement. Instead, an annual
impairment test is carried out, with any identified impairment loss recorded in the income statement.
Other intangible assets with a finite life continue to be amortised under both UK and US GAAP . UK GAAP is highly prescriptive with regard to the
recognition of intangible assets, although US GAAP rules result in the recognition of a greater amount of intangible assets.Therefore, differences arise in the
classification of some intangible assets and goodwill between UK and US GAAP .Amortisation that has been charged against goodwill under UK GAAP is
added back in the reconciliation to net income on a US GAAP basis.
The average life of other intangible assets is ten years and the annual amortisation charge under US GAAP is expected to be approximately £1 million.
Impairment of goodwill
Under UK GAAP , goodwill impairment reviews are carried out at the end of the first financial year following an acquisition, and also when an indicator of
impairment exists.The impairment is measured by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill with the higher of the net realisable value and the value in use.
Under US GAAP , goodwill impairment reviews are also conducted when an indicator of impairment exists, in addition to an annual goodwill
impairment test, as required by SFAS142.The impairment is measured by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its fair value.Where the
carrying value is greater than the fair value, the impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of goodwill in the reporting unit over the
implied fair value of the goodwill.
Profit or loss on the partial disposal of Group companies
Under UK GAAP (UITF 31), gains on the partial disposal of Group companies involving non-monetary consideration are recorded in the statement of
total recognised gains and losses. Under US GAAP , such gains and losses are recorded in the income statement.
Deferred tax
Under UK GAAP , full provision for deferred tax is recognised in the financial statements. Under US GAAP , deferred tax is recognised on a similar basis.
In addition, however, US GAAP requires provision for deferred tax on the unremitted earnings of overseas businesses that are not deemed to be
permanently reinvested.This is not permitted under UK GAAP except in respect of any dividends that have been accrued as receivable.
Revaluation of fixed assets
UK GAAP allowed for the periodic revaluation of land and buildings with depreciation then being calculated on the revalued amount.Any surplus or deficit
(to the extent that the revaluation reserve was in surplus) on the revaluation was then taken directly to shareholders’ funds.With the Group’s adoption of
FRS15 in 2000, the Group no longer revalues fixed assets. Under US GAAP , revaluations of fixed assets are not permitted and, as a result, the reconciliation
restates fixed assets to historical cost.The depreciation charge and any write downs of previously revalued assets are adjusted accordingly.
Impairment of tangible fixed assets
Under UK GAAP , a tangible fixed asset is reviewed for impairment if an indication exists that the asset may be impaired. If necessary, an impairment loss 
is recorded.A value in use calculation is carried out, based on discounted pre-tax future cash flows from the asset (or income generating unit to which the
asset belongs).
Under US GAAP , a preliminary review of the tangible fixed asset is carried out using undiscounted future cash flows. If the undiscounted future cash
flows are less than the asset’s carrying value, an impairment loss is required.The impairment loss will be calculated using discounted future cash flows, or
the asset’s market value.
Under US GAAP , the reversal of previously recognised impairment losses is not permitted.
Provisions 
Under UK GAAP , general requirements for liabilities and charges are contained in FRS 12 which states that provisions are made when a present obligation
exists in respect of a past event, where it is probable that a transfer of economic benefits will be required and where the amount of the obligation can be
reliably estimated. Under US GAAP the general requirements for loss contingencies of SFAS 5 require that, a provision is made when it is probable that an
asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.The UK GAAP policy is substantially the same as
the US GAAP policy and no adjustment is required.
Restructuring costs
Under UK GAAP , when a decision has been taken to restructure, supported by a detailed formal plan and the creation of a valid expectation in those
affected that the restructuring will take place, the necessary provisions are made for impairment of asset values together with severance and other costs.
Under US GAAP (SFAS146), the requirements for charging restructuring costs to income are more prescriptive and all significant actions arising from
the restructuring plan and their completion dates must be identified by the balance sheet date.
Pensions
For UK GAAP reporting (FRS17 – Retirement benefits), the pension asset or liability in the balance sheet represents the difference between the market
value of pension scheme assets at the balance sheet date and the present value of pension scheme liabilities at that date, net of deferred tax.
Under US GAAP (SFAS87), plan assets are valued by reference to market-related value at the date of the financial statements. Liabilities are assessed
using the rate of return obtainable on fixed or inflation-linked bonds.
FRS17 requires that past service costs are recognised in full in the period in which they become vested. SFAS87 requires past service costs to be
amortised over the remaining service lives of the employees to whom the amendments relate.
132 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 Notes to the financial statements 30.US accounting information continued
There is a significant difference in the treatment of actuarial gains and losses arising during the accounting period. UK GAAP recognises the actuarial gains
and losses in full in the year in which they arise in the statement of total recognised gains and losses. Under US GAAP , the actuarial gains and losses which
exceed ten per cent of the value of the assets or liabilities at the start of the accounting period are amortised over the remaining service lives of 
scheme members.
Where an additional minimum liability exists under US GAAP , (ie where the amount provided for any scheme does not cover the unfunded
accumulated benefit obligation for that scheme), this must be recognised in the balance sheet under SFAS87.The adjustment resulting from the recognition
of an additional minimum liability is reported as an intangible asset to the extent of the unrecognised prior service cost, after eliminating amounts
previously shown as a prepaid benefit cost.Any excess above these amounts is reported in comprehensive income.
Where surpluses exist in pension schemes under UK GAAP , a company should recognise the associated asset only to the extent that it is able to
recover that surplus either through reduced contributions or through refunds from the scheme. Regulations in South Africa concerning surpluses (as set out
in the Pension Funds Second Amendment Act 2001) specify that recognition of any surpluses in a retirement fund cannot be made by a company unless it is
either as a result of a surplus apportionment exercise, or if a fund‘s rules allow it.As a result, any surpluses in South Africa are not recognised under UK
GAAP and are written off in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
There is no specific requirement under US GAAP relating to the treatment of irrecoverable surpluses.As a result, the associated surplus is retained
under US GAAP in line with SFAS 87.
Post retirement medical costs
For UK GAAP reporting (FRS17 – Retirement benefits), the post retirement medical liability is discounted using the bond yield on suitable high quality
corporate bonds, and disclosed net of related deferred tax.
For US GAAP (SFAS106), the liabilities are assessed and discounted using the rates of return obtainable on high quality fixed income investments.
Differences between the UK and US GAAP figures arise largely from the treatment of actuarial gains and losses.
Securities investments
Under UK GAAP , current asset investments (of all types) are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Fixed asset investments are stated at cost,
or alternatively, at market value or at directors’ valuation.
Under US GAAP , securities which are determined to be ‘available-for-sale’ are stated at fair value and any unrealised gains or losses included as a
separate component of shareholders’ funds.The deferred tax consequences of unrealised gains or losses are also charged or credited to shareholders’ funds.
Contingent consideration
Under UK GAAP , contingent consideration is provided for as a liability when the likelihood of payment is considered to be probable.
Under US GAAP , contingent consideration is not recognised until the liability is determined beyond reasonable doubt.The elimination of 
contingent consideration for US GAAP purposes also impacts on the value of goodwill arising on acquisitions, therefore there is no net impact on
shareholders’ funds.
Financial instruments
The Group enters into a number of currency swaps, interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to currency and
interest rate risks. Under UK GAAP , such instruments are shown at their carrying value.
Under US GAAP , these instruments are marked to market and any change in value is recognised in either the income statement or through
comprehensive income in accordance with SFAS133 depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if it is, the 
type of hedge transaction.
Accounting for swaps
Under UK GAAP , gains or losses on closing out interest rate swap contracts taken to hedge the Group’s fixed/floating interest rate position can be taken
to profit immediately.
US GAAP requires any gain or loss to be deferred over the remaining hedge period.
Share of results and net assets of joint ventures and associates
The Group’s share of the results and net assets of its joint ventures and associates (as calculated under UK GAAP) is shown within fixed asset investments.
For the purposes of the reconciliations set out below, the Group’s share of the results and net assets of its joint ventures and associates has been adjusted
to recognise a difference in the method of reporting profits under US GAAP .
Leasing
Under US GAAP (EITF 01–8) certain arrangements with customers (modified or entered into since 1 October 2003) concerning the use of some items
of the Group’s plant and machinery are deemed to contain leases.Where such arrangements qualify as finance leases under SFAS13, an appropriate
adjustment is made to net income and shareholders’ funds under US GAAP . UK GAAP does not contain this same requirement.
Sale and leaseback transactions
Under UK GAAP , any profit or loss on the sale and operating leaseback of fixed assets can generally be taken to profit immediately.
US GAAP requires any gain or loss to be deferred over the contract lease period.
Comprehensive income
Under US GAAP , SFAS130 establishes requirements for the reporting of comprehensive income and its components (revenue, expenses, gains and losses)
in a full set of general purpose financial statements. Components of comprehensive income for the Group determined on a UK GAAP basis include profit
for the financial year, pension actuarial gains and losses, and foreign currency translation gains and losses. Information regarding the Group’s foreign currency
translation gains and losses is included in the statement of total recognised gains and losses under UK GAAP on page 89.
b) Selected financial information under US GAAP
In addition to the Group five year record on page 12, for SEC reporting the Group is required to disclose, on a US GAAP basis, certain key selected financial
information under item 3.A.2. of form 20–F.

g) Consolidated cash flow statement 
The Group cash flow statement on page 88 has been prepared in accordance with UK accounting standard FRS1, the objectives and principles of which
are similar to those set out in US accounting principle SFAS95, Statement of Cash Flows.The principal differences between the standards relate to
classification of items within the cash flow statement and with regard to the definition of cash and cash equivalents.
Under FRS1, cash flows are presented separately for: a) operating activities; b) dividends from joint ventures and associates; c) returns on investments
and servicing of finance; d) tax paid; e) capital expenditure and financial investment; f) acquisitions and disposals; g) equity dividends paid; h) management of
liquid resources; and i) financing. Under SFAS95, however, only three categories of cash flow activity are reported: a) operating activities; b) investing
activities; and c) financing activities. Dividends from joint ventures and associates, cash flows from returns on investments and servicing of finance (excluding
dividends paid to minorities) and tax paid under FRS1 would be included in operating activities under SFAS95; capital expenditure and acquisitions and
disposals would be included in investing activities under SFAS95; equity dividends would be included as a financing activity under SFAS95.
Under FRS1, cash is defined as cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand with any qualifying financial institution, less overdrafts from any
qualifying financial institution repayable on demand. Under SFAS95, cash is defined as cash in hand and deposits but also includes cash equivalents which
are short-term, highly liquid investments. Generally only investments with original maturities of three months or less come within this definition.

h) Stock-based compensation
For US reporting purposes the company applies APB Opinion 25,Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related interpretations, in accounting for
its share option plans.
Prior to 2005, by applying this statement, the employee share schemes were deemed non-compensatory since share options were granted at a
discount of ten per cent to market price.Accordingly, grants under these schemes did not result in an expense under US GAAP . In 2005, share options
under the company’s employee share schemes were granted at a discount of 20 per cent to the market price.Accordingly, they are deemed
compensatory, which has resulted in a charge of £0.2 million (£0.1 million net of related tax) in 2005 (2004: £nil, 2003: £nil).
Grants of executive share options are made at the market price of the company’s shares at the time of grant and are therefore deemed non-compensatory .
The Long-T erm Incentive Plan schemes are deemed compensatory and a charge is recognised when certain performance conditions are met.
This has resulted in a charge of £6.1 million (£4.3 million net of related tax) in 2005 (2004: £nil, 2003: £nil).
If compensation cost for the Group’s share option plans had been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards under those 
plans consistent with the method of SFAS123,Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the Group’s net income under US GAAP would have been:
2005 2004 2003
£ million £ million £ million

Basic – as reported 66.0 60.4 53.7

Diluted – as reported 65.8 60.3 53.6
Diluted – pro forma 64.7 59.1 52.2
The Black-Scholes model was used to measure the compensation expense under SFAS123.The assumptions used for grants in 2005 included a dividend
yield of 4.5 per cent (2004: 4.5 per cent, 2003: 4.5 per cent), expected share price volatility of 27.2 per cent (2004: 29.5 per cent, 2003: 30.6 per cent),
a weighted average expected life of 4.9 years (2004: 4.9 years, 2003: 5.0 years) and a weighted average interest rate of 4.6 per cent (2004: 4.8 per cent,
2003: 4.0 per cent).The weighted average interest rate is based on UK Gilts on the date of grant with a maturity similar to the related options.
i) Goodwill
For US reporting purposes the company applies SFAS142 in accounting for goodwill.The changes in the carrying value of goodwill for the year ended 
30 September 2005 are as follows:
Industrial 
Process and Special BOC Afrox

EITF04–1 – Accounting for Pre-existing relationships between the Parties to a Business Combination
In October 2004, the Emerging Issues T ask Force (EITF) reached a consensus on EITF issue 04–1. Issue 04–1 applies when two parties that have a 
pre-existing contractual relationship enter into a business combination. If it is determined that assets of an acquired entity are related to a pre-existing
contractual relationship, thus requiring accounting separate from the business combination, management will evaluate whether the acquiring entity of the
Group should recognise contractual relationships as assets separate from goodwill in that business combination. EITF 04–1 did not have a material impact
on the Group’s results and financial position in the year.
l) Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet implemented
SFAS151 – Inventory costs
SFAS151 was issued in November 2004 and is effective for all inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after 15 June 2005.This statement
amends ARB 43 and requires all idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double freight and re-handling costs to be recognised as current-period charges
regardless of whether they meet the criterion of  “so abnormal” (as previously stated in ARB 43). In addition, ARB 43 requires that the allocation of fixed
production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. Unallocated overheads are recognised as an
expense in the period in which they are incurred. Management does not believe that this statement will have a material effect on the Group’s results and
financial position under US GAAP in future periods.
SFAS153 – Exchanges of non-monetary assets
SFAS153 was issued in December 2004 and is effective for all non-monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after15 June 2005.
This statement amends APB Opinion 29, which is based on the principle that exchanges of non-monetary assets should be measured based on the fair
value of the assets exchanged. SFAS153 provides a general exception for exchange transactions that do not have commercial substance – that is,
transactions that are not expected to result in significant changes in the cash flows of the reporting entity. Management does not believe that this
statement will have a material effect on the Group’s results and financial position under US GAAP in future periods.
SFAS123(R) – Share-based payment (revised 2004)
SFAS123(R) was issued in December 2004 and is effective for the first annual reporting period that starts after 15 June 2005. It supersedes APB Opinion
25,Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS123(R) is concerned with how to account for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity
instruments for goods or services. It also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the
fair value of the entity’s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments.The main effect of this revised standard is a
move from an intrinsic value method to a fair value based method. It will therefore result in an additional charge relating to the fair value of share options
in the Group’s income statement. Management does not believe that this will have a material effect on the Group’s results and financial position under US
GAAP in future periods.
SFAS154 – Accounting changes and error corrections – a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3.
SFAS154 was issued in May 2005 and is effective for fiscal years beginning after 15 December 2005.This statement replaces APB Opinion 20,Accounting
Changes, and SFAS 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements.This Statement requires voluntary changes in accounting principles to
be reported via retrospective application, unless impracticable. Previous guidance given in APB Opinion 20 for reporting the correction of an error in
previously issued financial statements or a change in accounting estimates is unchanged in SFAS154. Management does not believe that this statement will
have a material effect on the Group’s results and financial position under US GAAP in future periods.
FIN47 – Accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations
FIN47 was issued in August 2005 and is effective for fiscal years ending after 15 December 2005.This interpretation clarifies the term ‘conditional asset
retirement obligation’ as used in SFAS143,Accounting for asset retirement obligations. FIN47 requires an entity to recognise a liability for the fair value 
of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated.The fair value of a liability for the conditional asset
retirement obligation should be recognised when incurred - generally upon acquisition, construction, or development and/or through the normal
operation of the asset. Uncertainty about the timing and/or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the
measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists. Management does not believe that this interpretation will have a material effect on the
Group’s results and financial position under US GAAP in future periods.
m) Other information
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant estimates 
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Shareholder information 141 T axation
A summary of the principal tax consequences for certain beneficial holders of Ordinary shares of BOC and ADSs representing Ordinary shares is set 
out below.This summary applies to citizens or residents of the UK or US, or otherwise who are subject to UK tax or US federal income tax on a net
income basis in respect of such securities. It is not intended to be a comprehensive analysis of all of the potential tax consequences of holding Ordinary
shares or ADSs and does not purport to deal with persons who hold their Ordinary shares or ADSs in special circumstances, such as financial institutions,
tax exempt organisations, insurance companies, dealers in securities, persons who own, directly or indirectly or by attribution, ten per cent or more of the
outstanding share capital or voting stock of BOC, persons holding Ordinary shares or ADSs as part of a ‘hedge’,‘straddle’ or other risk reduction
transaction, or who acquired such Ordinary shares or ADSs through the exercise of an employee stock option or otherwise as compensation.All holders
and investors are advised to consult their tax advisors on the tax implications of their particular holdings, including the consequences under applicable state
and local law.
The statements of tax laws set out below are based on the laws in force at the date of this report unless otherwise noted, and are subject to any
subsequent changes in UK and US law, or in any double tax convention between the UK and the US.
UK shareholders
The following information applies to individuals who hold Ordinary shares and who are resident or ordinarily resident in the UK for UK tax purposes 
(UK resident holders).
Taxation of capital gains 
A UK resident holder will be liable to UK tax on the gain from the disposal of Ordinary shares. For the purposes of calculating the gain from the disposal of
Ordinary shares, a UK resident holder who held Ordinary shares prior to 31 March 1982 may substitute the market value of such shares as at that date for
the original cost of such shares.The market value of Ordinary shares on 31 March 1982 was 168.75p per Ordinary share.
A UK resident holder may also be entitled to indexation relief and taper relief when selling shares. Indexation relief is calculated on the market 
value of shares held at 31 March 1982 and on the cost of any subsequent purchases from that date. Indexation relief is not available for periods after 
1 April 1998.T aper relief provides UK resident holders with relief from tax on gains accrued on the disposal of Ordinary shares held or acquired after 
5 April 1998.The amount of taper relief available depends on the length of time such shares have been held and on the UK resident holder’s individual facts
and circumstances.
Taxation of dividends 
A UK resident holder is entitled to a tax credit on receipt of a cash dividend.The tax credit is a fixed proportion of the dividend and is currently 
1
/9
th of the
cash dividend received.
The income subject to UK income tax is the sum of the dividend and the attached tax credit, with the tax credit being available as a deduction against
any resulting tax liability.
Special rates of tax apply to dividend income: the ‘ordinary rate’ is ten per cent and applies to individuals liable to tax at the basic or lower rates of tax;
the ‘upper rate’ is 32.5 per cent which applies to the extent that income exceeds the basic rate band.
For a UK resident holder liable to income tax only at the basic or lower rates of tax, there will thus be no further tax liability in respect of the dividend
received. If, however, the UK resident holder is subject to income tax at the higher rate there will be a further tax liability on the sum of the cash dividend
received and the associated tax credit.Where a UK resident holder’s tax liability is less than the associated tax credit, no refund is available.
By way of example, the payment by BOC of a cash dividend of £90 would have an associated tax credit of £10 and a UK resident holder is treated as
receiving a gross dividend of £100.The upper rate tax of 32.5 per cent on the gross dividend is £32.50.Therefore the UK resident holder liable to tax at the
upper rate will have a tax liability of £22.50, being the tax liability on the gross dividend of £32.50 less the tax credit of £10.
Stamp duty 
Stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax at the rate of 0.5 per cent of consideration payable is normally payable on the purchase price of shares.
Inheritance tax 
Individual shareholders may be liable to inheritance tax on the transfer of Ordinary shares. Inheritance tax may be charged on the amount by which 
the value of a shareholder’s estate is reduced as a result of any transfer by way of gift or other gratuitous transaction made by them or treated as made 
by them.
US holders
For the purposes of this summary, a US holder is a beneficial owner of ADSs who is an individual citizen or resident of the US, a corporation or other entity
organised under the laws of the US or any state thereof, an estate the income of which is subject to US federal income taxation regardless of its source, or
a trust if a court within the US is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more US persons have the authority
to control all substantial decisions of the trust.
US holders of ADSs are treated as owners of underlying Ordinary shares for the purposes of the convention relating to estate and gift tax (the Estate
T ax Convention) and for the purposes of the US Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code).
142 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 Shareholder information Taxation of dividends 
Under current UK tax legislation, no tax will be withheld from dividend payments made by BOC.
Dividends received by a US holder will be foreign source income for US federal income tax purposes in the amount equal to the US dollar value of
the dividend on the date of such payment. Generally, dividends will not be eligible for the ‘dividends received’ deduction allowed to US corporations under
the Code.
The US dollar amount of any dividends received by a non-corporate US holder prior to 1 January 2009 that constitute qualified dividends will be
taxable to the holder at a maximum rate of 15 per cent, provided that certain holding periods are met. BOC currently believes that dividends paid with
respect to its ADSs should be treated as qualified dividends for the 2005 taxable year and BOC intends to report its dividends as qualified dividends on
Forms 1099-DIV delivered to US holders. US holders are urged to consult their own tax advisers regarding the availability of the reduced dividend tax rate
in light of their own particular situations.
The US Treasury has expressed concern that parties to whom ADSs are released may be taking actions that are inconsistent with the claiming of
deductions in respect of qualified dividends by US holders of ADSs.Accordingly, the analysis of the availability of qualified dividend treatment could be
affected by future actions that may be taken by the US Treasury with respect to ADSs.
Taxation of capital gains 
Generally, a US holder who is not resident or ordinarily resident in the UK for tax purposes should not be subject to UK tax on any gain from the disposal
of ADSs, but will be subject to US tax on any capital gain realised on the sale or other disposal of ADSs.
US information reporting and backup withholding
Dividend payments made with respect to ADSs and proceeds from the sale or other disposal of ADSs may be subject to information reporting to the US
Internal Revenue Service and backup withholding at a current rate of 28 per cent. Holders should consult their own advisors as to the application to them
of the information reporting and backup withholding rules.
Stamp duty 
In practice no UK stamp duty is payable on the transfer of an ADS, provided that the separate instrument of transfer is not executed in, and always remains
outside of, the UK. No stamp duty reserve tax is payable on an agreement to transfer ADSs.
Estate and gift tax 
Under the Estate T ax Convention, a US holder generally is not subject to UK inheritance tax.
Exchange controls and other limitations affecting security holders 
There are currently no exchange controls or other limitations in the UK affecting security holders.

T otal 564.2 100 Y our board has again fully reviewed and
approved BOC’s strategy, which is being
effectively implemented by T ony Isaac and 
his management team. The strategy has 
seen BOC confirm its leading position in 
Asia, develop a strong base in China and
invest strongly in other growth markets.
It has seen a continuing commitment to 
safety and to improve the efficiency and
environmental performance of our 
operations. It has seen the divestment 
of underperforming businesses allied to 
a well implemented acquisition strategy.
Rewarding our shareholders
In 2005 BOC raised its first interim dividend to 15.9p. Combined 
with the second interim dividend of 25.3p, this represents an increase
of three per cent on the previous year as we continue to build 
our dividend cover towards two-times over the medium term.
Y our board has decided to raise the first interim dividend to be paid
on 1 February 2006 by 2.5 per cent to 16.3p.
I have updated the graphs I have shown here every year since 2001.
They show BOC’s total shareholder return since October 2000
compared with the FTSE100 and our major gases competitors.
We have continued to outperform the FTSE100. Industrial gases
companies have proved to be a rewarding investment over recent
years and in the last year or so we have matched our competitors’
performance, although a gap remains from earlier years. In his 
review, T ony Isaac will explain in more detail how we have progressed
this year.
Corporate Governance
This year your company has completed its work to comply with 
one new set of requirements, the Combined Code on Corporate
Governance, and has made good progress on two others, namely
changing over to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
and meeting the provisions of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
The quarterly results to be announced in February 2006 will be 
the first in accordance with IFRS. We estimate that meeting the
requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley cost your company some £10 million
this year. We are likely to spend the same next year before the costs
reduce somewhat. BOC has to comply with these provisions because
we are registered in the US, but being a complex and diverse business
working globally means that the cost of such compliance is very high.
Next year we will, in common with all UK companies, publish an
operating and financial review (OFR) as part of our annual report.
The intention of the OFR is to help you, our shareholders, assess our
strategies and the likelihood of their success.
External checks and reporting requirements may help but I believe the
best assurance for shareholders is to ensure high standards of integrity
and transparency throughout the organisation, overseen by a strong
and independent group of non-executive directors. BOC has both 
04 The BOC Group plc Annual review and summary financial statements 2005
Implementing our
strategy effectively
Chairman’s statement
  of these. It has a strong and well-implemented Code of Conduct and 
a management team committed to the principles of accountability,
collaboration, transparency and stretch, known in BOC as ACTS.
Y our board regularly reviews the management of our social,
environmental and ethical risks. These have now been integrated into
the company’s overall risk management programme. Each year our
performance is judged against criteria set by the UK’s Business in the
Community (BiTC). T o be as transparent as possible we publish on
our website, boc.com, both our comprehensive submission to BiTC
and its independent assessment of our performance.
An important feature of BOC’s corporate responsibility programme is
to enable people at all levels of the organisation to become involved
and support things that matter to them. Our joint giving scheme is an
example. This year countries around the Indian Ocean suffered from
the appalling effects of the tsunami. Our businesses in the countries
affected responded immediately with medical oxygen and with 
other practical help. BOC extended its joint giving scheme to match
two-to-one our employees’ donations to the relief effort for both the
tsunami and hurricane Katrina. BOC again responded when the
Pakistan earthquake struck in October 2005. In total the community
of BOC gave over £570,000 to the tsunami appeal and we await the
final totals for hurricane Katrina and the Pakistan earthquake.
One of our US subsidiaries, along with other companies in the
welding products industry, has been the subject of allegations that
manganese in welding fumes causes Parkinson’s disease or symptoms
similar to Parkinson’s. Again this year there were no adverse jury
verdicts; the only adverse jury verdict was in 2003 and this is the
subject of appeal in the Illinois court system.
Board of Directors
We appointed two new executive directors this year: Kent Masters,
chief executive for Industrial and Special Products, joined the board 
in March, replacing John Walsh who resigned to return to his native
United States; and Alan Ferguson joined in September as Group
finance director in place of René Médori who resigned to take up a
similar role at Anglo American. Rebecca McDonald was appointed 
as a non-executive director in July. Rebecca is president, gas and
power, for BHP Billiton. During the year two non-executive directors
resigned: Iain Napier, following his appointment as deputy chairman of
Imperial T obacco, and Julie Baddeley because of increasing demands
on her time. John Walsh and René Médori each served BOC for
some 20 years, Iain Napier and Julie Baddeley for a somewhat shorter
time, and I would like to thank them all for their contributions.
Every year we review the performance of the board and each
individual director. In alternate years, which included 2005, we
conduct these reviews with external facilitation. They confirmed 
that each director contributes effectively and is committed to his 
or her role at BOC.
Thanks
BOC’s 30,000 people around the world provide products and
services that are essential to everyday life. I thank them for their
dedication and professionalism. I thank the customers they serve for
entrusting their business to BOC. I thank all those with whom we
work and in the communities where we operate for their support.
And I thank you, our shareholders, for your continuing support.

Chief executive’s review
2005 was a year of underlying strong
performance punctuated by events that
challenged and brought out the best in 
BOC and its people. We continue to see 
an accelerating rise in energy prices, the 
move of manufacturing activity from higher- 
to lower-cost economies and relatively slow
growth in an historical context for the
semiconductor industry. Faced with these
long-term trends we have responded by
investing for growth while concentrating on
energy efficiency, cost containment and high
levels of customer service.
In the year, the biggest structural change in the Group was the
reduction in our ownership of Afrox hospitals. Elsewhere, among 
the highlights, we continued our penetration of the north American
refinery market with a string of new hydrogen orders, maintained the
pace of our developments in China, and saw BOC Edwards enter
into an important customer relationship in Korea. In contrast, events
such as the Asian tsunami, the London bombings, hurricane Katrina
and most recently the Pakistan earthquake saw BOC businesses
helping where they could, notably with medical gases, and BOC
people giving freely of their time and money.
Against this background BOC produced good results, with turnover
similar to last year at £4,605.0 million, adjusted operating profit down
three per cent to £564.2 million, adjusted profit before tax down 
one per cent at £505.7 million and record adjusted earnings per share
of 67.5p. Adjusted figures eliminate exceptional items. Y ear-on-year
comparisons at constant currency show the performance of our
businesses in the markets where they operate without any distortions
from changes in the sterling exchange rate. Our statutory results
include exceptional items and reflect currency movements and on this
basis turnover was similar to last year with operating profit down by
three per cent and profit before tax up by 44 per cent.
Our two gases lines of business, Process Gas Solutions and Industrial
and Special Products, contribute over 80 per cent of Group operating
profit and both of them made good progress. Process Gas Solutions
continues to increase the percentage of its business that comes from
long-term tonnage schemes, with the emphasis recently on winning
hydrogen contracts and building on our strong position in Asia, and
particularly in China. There has been a steady flow of new orders
with some £500 million of new plant due to enter service over the
next couple of years. Our Process Systems team works closely with
customers to identify and deliver solutions for their industrial gases
needs. This approach has seen us win a disproportionate share of 
the new business available. In China our success has been founded 
on our willingness to enter joint ventures with our key customers,
enabling us to share the risks and rewards of China’s industrial growth.
Our joint venture plant building operation, Linde BOC Process Plants,
gives us reliable and cost-effective plant to fulfil our customers’ needs.
This year Process Gas Solutions grew turnover by 16 per cent and
adjusted operating profit by nine per cent. Industrial and Special Products continues to extract value from its
extensive distribution network and its high standards of product
stewardship. The core industrial business continues to evolve as
manufacturing processes change. We now offer a wider range of
products and services to our industrial customers. We have
developed sizeable businesses based on liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)
and in several of our markets we are taking advantage of similar
opportunities for safety products. Our medical business, which serves
hospitals and delivers oxygen therapy to patients in their homes, is
continuing to grow, particularly in Asia. The special products portfolio
is also developing well, serving growth markets with products such as
helium, packaged chemicals, refrigerants and propellants. Industrial and
Special Products saw turnover decline by four per cent following 
the sale of the US packaged gas business last year, while adjusted
operating profit rose by six per cent as profitability improved in 
the US.
BOC Edwards’ core semiconductor market remained broadly stable
without returning to the activity levels seen last year. Despite this,
BOC Edwards continued to improve its market position and
embarked on a restructuring programme to achieve cost savings.
It saw an increase in turnover of two per cent with adjusted operating
profit down 21 per cent.
Gist saw some organic growth from new and existing customers 
and towards the end of the year it expanded into Europe with the
acquisition of Van Dongen, a temperature-controlled transport
business operating in a number of countries. In November 2005 
it extended until 2011 its contract to manage the distribution of 
Marks & Spencer’s chilled and ambient food. This provides long-term
security for a significant portion of Gist’s business. Gist’s turnover for
the year rose eight per cent while adjusted operating profit fell by
two per cent, impacted by higher pension and compliance costs.
In March we disposed of most of our shareholding in Afrox
Healthcare Limited to a consortium led by two major black
empowerment investors. Our African Oxygen Limited subsidiary
retains a 20 per cent interest in the business. We received the
disposal proceeds in March. Afrox Healthcare was a large employer
and its disposal has reduced the number of Group employees by 
over 10,000. The disposal also had the effect of reducing the 
Group’s earnings per share by approximately one penny this year 
and an expected further one penny in 2006.
We had another good year for cash generation, helped by the Afrox
Healthcare disposal. With our strong balance sheet we are in a good
position to fund our growth projects, notably the ones already won
by Process Gas Solutions and those still in the pipeline.
Safety remains our number one priority. It is unacceptable that anyone
is hurt in the course of our business and we continue to emphasise
that safety must be 100 per cent of our behaviour, 100 per cent 
of the time. At the start of this report we set out our objectives as a
Group. We intend to outperform our competitors and to do this we
must be the employer of choice for talented people. We are working
hard on all aspects of our business to achieve these objectives.
Three members of the executive management board resigned 
this year. René Médori became group finance director for Anglo
American plc while John Walsh and Rob Lourey returned with their
families to new jobs in their home countries of the United States 
and Australia respectively. I wish all of them success in their new
careers and thank them for their contributions to BOC. Kent Masters
was appointed chief executive, Industrial and Special Products, in
March and James Cullens joined the executive management board in
April as Group human resources director. Alan Ferguson joined us as
Group finance director in September from Inchcape plc.
I thank our employees for their hard work over the past year and 
for their continued emphasis on high standards of customer service.
I thank our customers, our shareholders, our suppliers and those with
whom we work on a daily basis. BOC contributes to the economic
life of many countries around the world and I thank you all for helping
us to do so.

Getting 
the most 
from a
precious
resource
BOC has grown its hydrogen business by 
30 per cent each year since the turn of the
century. Underlying this surge in growth are
environmental concerns and the desire of 
refiners to extract as much of the most valuable
products as possible from increasingly expensive
barrels of oil.
Making a difference
  09
Oil refiners face tough legal limits on the amount of sulphur allowed
in gasoline and diesel fuel while at the same time they have to deal
with increasing quantities of ‘sour’ crude, containing five per cent or
more sulphur. Hydrogen is the answer. It reacts with sulphur in the
presence of a catalyst and the resulting hydrogen sulphide can be
removed and safely processed.
In 2000 BOC opened the largest hydrogen plant in the southern
hemisphere at BP’s Bulwer Island refinery in Australia. In 2002 it built
England’s largest hydrogen plant to serve Huntsman’s chemical plant
on T eesside. And in 2004 it acquired its first plant serving the
petrochemical complex on the Gulf coast of the US. Since then a
series of refinery contracts has been won across the US. One of the
largest hydrogen plants in north America will supply BP and Sunoco
refineries in Ohio. Elsewhere in Ohio BOC is building a further plant
to serve Valero, while at Salt Lake City in Utah a new plant will begin
supplying hydrogen to Chevron and Holly refineries in 2006.
Hydrogen holds the promise of revolutionising energy supply later 
in this century as sources of hydrocarbon fuel are further depleted.
Until then it will play its role, helping to maximise the benefits from
each barrel of oil and minimising the environmental impact. 10 The BOC Group plc Annual review and summary financial statements 2005 Making a difference
Flat panel televisions are some of the hottest
consumer products around. The leading variant,
TFT -LCD, is based on liquid crystal display
technology that has been around since the1970s
but really only started to make its commercial
mark in the early1 990s. Since then the industry
has grown at such a pace that it has spent well in
excess of US$40 billion on production equipment
and facilities since 2000.
It’s
becoming 
a flat 
world 11
The TFT -LCD market has many similarities to the semiconductor
market that BOC Edwards has served successfully for many years:
vacuum, gases, chemical management and exhaust abatement are 
all needed. The difference is that semiconductor manufacturers 
are making their devices ever smaller, while the flat panel makers
are busy building plants to make larger and larger products.
Engineers have overcome the manufacturing constraints that limited
TFT -LCD displays to screen sizes of less than 20 inches, or 51cm,
at the end of the 1990s and displays up to 65 inches, or 165cm,
are now commercially available. T o reduce costs, these large displays
are made on huge glass panels more than two metres wide and less
than one mm thick. These are then bonded together to sandwich the
liquid crystal and cut to size.
BOC Edwards works with fleet-footed industries where product
cycles are counted in months and multibillion dollar markets develop
just as quickly. It has to be equally fleet of foot. It is established as a
leading equipment supplier to the new generation of 300mm
semiconductor fabs as well as to the TFT -LCD sector.
The major manufacturers of TFT -LCD displays are based in 
Asia, as are many of the leading semiconductor manufacturers.
In common with other parts of the Group, BOC Edwards has 
built its Asian presence over many years. As its customers seek 
out the markets of the future, BOC Edwards is there to serve them. 12 The BOC Group plc Annual review and summary financial statements 2005 Making a difference 13
More 
than 
just gas
Industrial and Special Products (ISP) makes much
of its money from selling small volumes of gas to
large numbers of customers. It also sells them a
variety of products and services to help them do
their jobs more efficiently. And it has a well
deserved reputation for doing all this safely.
These traditional strengths of ISP are also the foundations for new
growth businesses. It has carved a niche for itself in the supply of
safety products, such as personal protective equipment for use at
work and in the home. Large customers such as New Zealand Steel
have entrusted us to source and supply products to keep their
employees safe. In our retail Gas and Gear stores customers can buy
these same safety products straight off the shelves and increasingly
these stores offer a wider range of consumer goods, such as power
tools and accessories for the home handyman.
ISP also knows how to handle large volumes of potentially hazardous
or environmentally-damaging products and to package them safely in
smaller containers more suitable for our customers. We have used
this expertise to grow our packaged chemicals business. We sell
hydrocarbon propellants that are used in consumer products as
diverse as shaving foam and hair spray. We have a refrigerants
business that now operates globally, providing products for 
everything from supermarket chilled displays to the air conditioning
systems in cars.
New ideas combined with the skills of ISP and the strength of its
distribution network produce new business opportunities – and these
profitable additions are often about more than just gas. 14 The BOC Group plc Annual review and summary financial statements 2005
Shoppers on Britain’s busy high streets rely 
on BOC for some of the better things in life.
Industrial gases are used in the manufacture of
most things we buy and Gist plays a big part in
getting these goods to the shops.
Modern retailing relies on efficient logistics. It sounds a simple task to
get what’s needed, where it’s needed, when it’s needed. But, if the
process doesn’t work well, shelves can stand empty or excess product
can reach its sell-by date. A lot of technology is hidden behind the
scenes. Goods checked into Gist’s warehouses are picked and
despatched to individual stores within hours. Despite congested 
roads and town centre locations, our drivers are often given only 
a 15 minute time window in which to make each delivery.
As with our gases delivery fleet, sophisticated scheduling systems
work out the best initial sequence and route for each journey.
Satellite tracking systems can follow a truck’s progress, using traffic 
and accident information to update the schedule and avoid delays.
For some Marks & Spencer deliveries, specialised double-deck vehicles
have been introduced, making journeys even more efficient. The aim 
is to get the job done in the fewest miles with the lowest possible 
fuel consumption.

The unseen
presence 
on the 
high street 15 Growing countries need steel and Chinese
growth has recently provided a healthy export
market for many of the world’s traditional steel
manufacturers. Chinese steel producers,
many of which are already large by world
standards, are also expanding to meet domestic
demand and BOC has partnerships with two of
the most important.
16 The BOC Group plc Annual review and summary financial statements 2005 Making a difference
Continued
growth in
China 17
T aiyuan Iron and Steel (TISCO) is already the largest manufacturer 
of stainless steel in China and is among the top ten in the world.
When its current expansion programme is complete it will be the
largest stainless steel producer on a single site anywhere in the world.
As an integrated manufacturer it can supply 90 per cent of its iron
ore and coke needs from its own nearby mining operations. BOC is
a long time partner of TISCO and next year two new air separation
units will come on stream, delivering a further 2,800 tonnes a day of
oxygen for steelmaking.
Ma Steel, on the banks of the Yangtze River, is the fifth largest steel
producer in China and rated ‘world-class’ by industry consulting 
firm World Steel Dynamics. Already a major supplier for the
construction and railway industries, it is targeting the fast growing
automotive industry and will produce high quality flat steel products
that are currently imported. BOC has a joint venture with Ma Steel
that will see a further two 1,400 tonnes-a-day air separation units
installed at the site.
As China develops, BOC is there contributing to industries as 
diverse as chemicals and electronics. Some of its earliest investments
were in support of the steel industry and steel remains one of the
major forces driving China’s growth. 18 The BOC Group plc Annual review and summary financial statements 2005
BOC reports results on a statutory basis and also in a 
form that isolates the impact of currency movements 
from year to year and eliminates the impact of exceptional
or non-recurring items. BOC’s management believes this
second approach will assist shareholders in comparing
performance with previous periods. Where exceptional 
or non-recurring items are eliminated the results are
referred to as adjusted.
T urnover and operating profit details on each basis for 
each line of business and specialist business will be found 
at the start of each section. The discussion of business
performance that follows is based on figures adjusted for
exceptional items and constant currency.
Process Gas Solutions continued to grow as new plants came on
stream and economic activity linked to steel, petrochemicals and
refining remained high. T urnover increased more than adjusted
operating profit because of a change in the terms of a supply scheme
contract in the US and higher energy costs, which rose to record
levels. Natural gas is a feedstock in some of our processes and we
endeavour to pass on increased gas costs directly to our customers.
Electricity represents most of the cost of running our air separation
units and again we seek to recoup higher costs through higher prices.
In both cases, this inflates revenue numbers without increasing profit.
Some of our older plants also experienced reliability issues during the
year, leading to some lost production. These issues were promptly
corrected. Overall, levels of plant efficiency have been much increased
by the introduction of operations centres which now remotely control
the majority of our large plants around the world.
Much of the growth remained focused on Asia and on China in
particular. Continuing Chinese demand for steel in the first half of 
the year led to high levels of production by steelmakers around the
world as well as providing investment opportunities in China itself.
In the US, demand for hydrogen to remove sulphur in the production
of cleaner fuels to meet environmental regulations also generated 
new business opportunities. For the merchant market, we have
established a new food equipment manufacturing facility in Thailand
and introduced successful new applications such as cryowave freezing
technology and a process for thinly slicing products such as salami 
and luncheon meat for the north American market.
In Asia three new plants came on stream in China, one serving the
Nanjing BOC-YPC Gases joint venture and two for joint venture
operations in southern China. Four large 1,400 tonnes-a-day air
separation units are also at various stages of completion, two for 
the joint venture serving the T aiyuan Iron and Steel Corporation in
north-central China and two for the joint venture formed this year
with Maanshan Iron & Steel in Anhui province. Steel and chemicals
have driven tonnage growth across the region. The merchant liquid
business is also growing in China, Korea, T aiwan, Thailand and Malaysia
as industries such as electronic packaging and food freezing continue
to expand. Our Japan Air Gases joint venture has seen the successful
completion of its integration programmes and brought on stream a
2,100 tonnes-a-day plant serving a major steel customer. In India 
BOC signed a 15 year contract to supply Jindal Vijaynagar Steel with
1,400 tonnes a day of oxygen and nitrogen.

  In north America, the tonnage business saw strong demand 
from steel producers moderate in the second half of the year.
Higher energy prices led to increased demand for carbon dioxide 
for injection into rock formations to enhance the recovery of oil and
gas. Price surcharges were imposed in the merchant market in
response to rising fuel prices. Merchant plants in particular regions 
of the US are operating close to capacity and a decision was taken 
to build a new 720 tonnes-a-day air separation unit in Georgia to
serve the large and growing market in the south-eastern states.
Our water services business continues to develop in the industrial,
rather than the municipal, market with new customers based in the
food, refining and chemical sectors. In Mexico, we started the
scheduled five-year maintenance programme for the existing four
modules of the world’s largest nitrogen complex serving off-shore 
oil fields in the Gulf of Mexico. In parallel, work began on the
construction of a fifth module which is due to enter service during
financial year 2007.
Australia benefited from increased demand not only for steel from
China but also for a range of minerals, such as nickel and copper.
This trend helped compensate for the loss of volume following the
closure last year of Port Kembla Copper. As elsewhere, electricity
costs rose, resulting in higher prices, while productivity improvements
counteracted increases in labour costs driven by skills and labour
shortages. In South Africa consumer demand drove economic growth
which fed through to increased steel and stainless steel production
and growing demand for liquid nitrogen for food freezing. Throughout
the country liquid gas production for the merchant market is very
close to capacity.
In Europe, Poland continues to benefit from the long-term trend 
of industrial capacity moving from higher cost economies. The UK,
on the other hand, saw further industrial closures, exacerbated by 
the largest energy price increases in the region. Ireland’s economy
continues to grow, but the emphasis is now on service industries that
are not extensive users of industrial gases. Our specialist business,
Cryostar, had another successful year following further orders for
liquefied natural gas ships for which it supplies a range of equipment.
Industrial and Special Products generated increased adjusted operating
profit despite reduced turnover. The turnover decline largely reflects
the sale in July 2004 of our packaged gas business in the US and the
sale in December 2004 of the Unique Gas Petrochemicals business in
Thailand. The growth in adjusted operating profit was a combination
of good performance from a reduced cost base by our substantial
remaining business in the US, continuing benefits from well-integrated
acquisitions in Poland and Canada, and robust performance from
other parts of the world. In Poland growth comes not only from an
improving economy but also from BOC introducing tried and tested
concepts such as cylinder rental and hospitality gases into this new
market. BOC manages its Industrial and Special Products line of
business as three global entities – industrial products, medical and
special products – and ensures it transfers knowledge quickly through
best operating and commercial practice programmes.

2. Adjusted operating profit excludes exceptional items. The industrial products business continues to respond to underlying
trends that have seen manufacturing activity move to lower-cost
environments. This has typically been characterised as a move from 
the western economies to those of Asia, but within Asia core industrial
markets have moved from places such as Hong Kong and T aiwan to
mainland China. Elsewhere, in some Asian countries such 
as Singapore, service and other industries that are not large users of
industrial gases are coming more to the fore. Growth areas for
industrial products include the Indian subcontinent, Thailand,
South Africa and China, where the automotive market is a significant
factor, particularly for argon-based gases. Our joint venture, Indura,
in Latin America performed well. Our South African and south Pacific
businesses both feature large liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) operations
that are growing in volume but are subject to major changes in input
costs in common with other energy sources. Managing the resulting
rapid price changes is an important factor in maintaining profit margins.
This year the LPG businesses had to manage record cost increases as
well as the warmest winter on record in Australia.
In developed economies the industrial products business has
maintained its position by extending the range of products and
services it offers in areas such as safety. In New Zealand, for instance,
BOC was successful in a tender to become the primary supplier of
safety and personal protective equipment to New Zealand Steel.
The business has also adjusted its infrastructure to reflect changes in
market demand; this year, for example, the dissolved acetylene plant
at Derby was closed with all acetylene production for the UK now
centralised at Bristol. Changes such as these have enabled the UK
business to maintain its position despite the fundamental decline in UK
manufacturing. Our business in the US concentrates on delivering bulk
supplies to distributors and industrial customers whereas in Canada
the business has benefited from increased exploitation of western
Canada’s oil and gas reserves.
The medical business continues to grow, spurred by increased
healthcare spending, the introduction of innovative gas packages,
and the development of applications in consultation with healthcare
professionals. In South Africa the business won two important tenders
– to supply home oxygen therapy to all state patients and to supply all
the government’s gas, the great majority of which is for medical
purposes, and welding needs.
The market for special products grew in the UK, as in other countries.
A new helium transfill site is being established at Thame to meet
demand in southern England that has outgrown the existing site at
Leeds. Further transfills have been added or developed to meet
increased demand in China, T aiwan and Korea. A container staging
facility was also commissioned in Dubai to manage deliveries from a
new helium source in Qatar. In Australia a new packaged chemicals
plant is being developed at Wagga Wagga in New South Wales to
meet the growth needs for these products. We also completed the
first stage of upgrading our Johannesburg facility in South Africa,
commissioned a regional production facility for scientific gases and
packaged chemicals in Thailand, and expanded our packaged
chemicals business in Canada, Asia and Latin America. A small
acquisition from Calor this year in the UK extended the range of
propellants the business can offer for consumer products such as
shaving foam and spray-on deodorants. In Ireland our hospitality
business has expanded into cellar services, servicing the cellar
equipment for a major brewer.

supplies vacuum, exhaust and chemical dispense products for new
plants, and material and gases for use in the production process at

Strong demand from western
Canada’s oil and gas industries. semiconductor plants was down while existing plants reduced
production levels to match lower demand and trim inventory levels,
particularly in the US. The liquid crystal display (LCD) flat screen
display market that has risen significantly in recent years also paused in
its growth this year. The result for BOC Edwards was lower turnover
and adjusted operating profit to which it responded by reducing
operating and overhead costs. Among initiatives to reduce production
costs it has moved some manufacturing to the Czech Republic,
established the manufacture of fluorine generators and the assembly
of pumps for semiconductor and LCD applications in Korea, and
started assembling vacuum systems in Brazil to serve the Latin
American market. BOC Edwards has also established a freeze dryer
joint venture together with the manufacture of general vacuum
systems in China.
Despite general market weakness, BOC Edwards developed its
leading position in 300mm semiconductor wafer fabs and the new
‘generation 7’ LCD manufacturing facilities. There was an increase in
sales of new sub-systems that combine both vacuum and exhaust
technologies and it introduced a new range of pumps that are able 
to meet the higher-volume pumping demands of the new, large 
LCD fabs.
A range of gases is used in semiconductor and LCD manufacturing
and BOC Edwards has been awarded gas supply contracts for a
number of new fabs being built in China. It is also adding further
capacity at Hsinchu in T aiwan and has gained an important entry
position with Samsung in Korea. The new fluorine generator business
is also progressing well with installations for both semiconductor and
LCD plants. Looking to the future, BOC Edwards has established or
developing positions in immersion lithography, liquid abatement for
copper-based processes, plasma abatement for etch applications,
which includes the recycling of high global warming potential
Perfluorocarbon (PFC) gases, and the application of xenon for lasers
in extreme ultra-violet lithography. It has also developed a new type 
of turbomolecular pump that is more efficient, smaller and has
reduced vibration.
The market for general vacuum products was better in Asia and 
for aerospace metallurgy and chemicals applications. The market 
for pharmaceutical systems remained strong, although the emphasis
moved from larger to smaller projects.
Gist continues to perform well in what has been a challenging 
marketplace. Revenue grew satisfactorily but higher pension costs 
in particular prevented a similar rise in operating profit. From the
existing customer base growth came from Marks & Spencer,
Gist’s largest customer, as it opened more of its ‘Simply Food’ stores
and from the continued expansion of Ocado. New business wins
included Woolworths, which is now served from a new distribution
centre at Bedford. T owards the end of the year Gist expanded into
Europe with the purchase of the Van Dongen logistics business, which
added significantly to Gist’s primary distribution capabilities. Within
weeks, this wider network produced additional business between the
UK and continental Europe from a number of existing and new
customers.
Afrox hospitals
On 22 March 2005 African Oxygen Limited (Afrox), BOC’s South
African subsidiary, completed the disposal of Afrox Healthcare Limited
to a consortium led by two major black economic empowerment
investors. Afrox retains a significant interest in the hospitals business
through a 20 per cent holding in the new company. This process
began in November 2003 when Afrox announced its intention to sell
to the consortium. Afrox Healthcare Limited performed consistently
during the first six months of the year, during which it remained in

around the Indian Ocean; in September the hurricane season saw
Katrina bring death and hardship to the southern United States; and 
in October the south Asian earthquake killed many thousands and
made millions more homeless. Each of these natural disasters affected
countries where BOC and its employees earn their living. Thankfully 
all our employees and their immediate families survived these disasters
and the local BOC businesses and the global community of BOC
combined to do what they could in the aftermath. BOC’s matched-
giving schemes ensured that employee donations counted for more,
amounting to over £570,000 in total for the victims of the tsunami.
The response of local teams was epitomised by BOC Pakistan: the
company gave money and emergency material and three days’ paid
leave for every employee to help in the earthquake relief effort and
the employees themselves gave two days’ pay to the relief fund having
already, like their colleagues in Bangladesh, given one day’s pay to the
tsunami relief efforts. If examples were needed, these disasters show
one aspect of the role of business in communities and of the innate
generosity of people confronted by others’ misery.
BOC makes a contribution to the economies where it works in many
ways. It provides essential products to industry and commerce and a
livelihood for its employees, while striving to make the work
environment as safe as possible. It delivers technologies that minimise
some of the potentially harmful environmental effects of economic
development while doing what it can to reduce its own emissions and
waste. And it supports worthwhile projects that reflect the character
of its business and the wishes of its employees.
Safety is the number one priority in BOC. It has traditionally been
measured by counting the number and severity of incidents and
injuries. We continue to measure these and to see an improvement in
performance. Now we also measure and report leading indicators of
safety – things that, if we get them right, will have an impact on safety
in the future, such as training, the speed of rectifying faults, and the
quality of investigations into incidents. It is unacceptable that anyone 
is hurt in the course of us doing our business, which is why we
concentrate on making safety 100 per cent of our behaviour,
100 per cent of the time. In Australia our business there has built on
BOC’s own commitment to safety by sponsoring the Rotary Y outh
Driver Awareness road safety programme. Y oung drivers in their 
last years at school are helped to understand the dangers of driving.
In the words of one attendee the course “is a very important step 
in educating young drivers and making them safer when behind 
the wheel of a car”.
BOC operates in a hazardous industry, which is why safety is 
the priority, but we need to manage a range of other social,
environmental and ethical risks. Our Code of Conduct was 
launched three years ago and is now established in all our businesses.
The challenge now is to make sure it is sustained and we have a
programme to do this. We have a help line that is available, free of
charge, in 49 countries. Employees can speak to an independent
organisation, anonymously if they wish, and raise any concerns they
may have. Our employee policies and procedures are aligned with the
United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 
we have signed the UN’s Global Compact and incorporated its 
ten principles in the BOC Code of Conduct. For the first time this
year the regular Voice of BOC survey was sent to every employee 
in the Group, either electronically or on paper. Some 68 per cent
responded, which is a very high level for such surveys, and they 
told us we were doing well on safety, employee well-being, the Code
of Conduct, performance reviews, collaboration and diversity but
needed to focus more on customers and engage employees more.

  Again this year BOC participated in Business in the Community’s
(BiTC) corporate responsibility index. The completed qualifying
questionnaire has grown to over 130 pages, making it one of the
most comprehensive analyses of an organisation’s performance.
We publish the completed questionnaire, together with BiTC’s
assessment of our performance, on boc.com. This is the most
transparent way of reporting what we do and more efficient than
answering a multiplicity of bespoke questionnaires.
Industrial gases have many environmentally friendly applications.
Using oxygen instead of air in many combustion processes reduces
the levels of harmful emissions. BOC is already helping deliver cleaner
fuels today through the use of hydrogen in oil refining and it is
investing in hydrogen technology that holds the promise of a more
environmentally friendly future. Its partnerships include a trial project
that combines solar power and hydrogen fuel cell technology for
water management systems in the UK, the development of hydrogen
systems to power forklift trucks operating in north American
warehouses, and a prototype hydrogen powered sports car whose
only emission is water. Elsewhere, BOC has combined with Australia’s
research organisation CSIRO to develop an environmentally safe
fumigant to replace methyl bromide in agriculture. The BOC
Foundation continues to fund environmentally promising technologies.
It seeks projects involving air and water quality that are beyond the
early research phase but need help getting to the stage where they
can be widely adopted and applied. In New Zealand, BOC’s ‘Where
There’s Water’ community environment grants programme has now
been running for three years; this year most of its grants went to
schools running water conservation projects.
Schools and education are supported by BOC through our Inspiring
Gases programme run in co-operation with the Royal Society of
Chemistry. Helping young people develop an interest in science,
and in chemistry in particular, is important for our business and for
our wider economic welfare. Chemistry can be fun and this year
BOC supported the Institution of Chemical Engineers’ seventh world
congress in Glasgow by staging a spectacular show called ‘It’s a Gas’
at the Glasgow Science Centre which, not surprisingly, used bangs,
pops, flames and vapour clouds to show the properties of gases to
young audiences.

Business review 
A review of the Group’s business activities and their performance can be
found on pages 18 to 21. The report of the directors deals with other issues
that the board and management regard as important to the conduct of the
company’s affairs.
Employment policies
BOC’s employment policies are designed to underpin the Group’s operating
requirements and growth strategies. Where practicable, policies are adapted
to meet local requirements.
Communication and involvement BOC places a high priority on
communicating with its people and has invested in web-based
communications technology to convey consistent and coherent messages 
to employees around the world.
Resourcing, training and development Programmes are designed to ensure
that the Group has a pool of well-qualified, gifted individuals able to meet
both its day-to-day operational needs and its plans for the future.
Reward and recognition Reward and recognition programmes are designed
to endorse outstanding individual and team performance.
Retirement benefit plans BOC fully supports its people’s efforts to provide
for their retirement and provides a range of opportunities for them to
participate in programmes tailored to suit local conditions.
Employee share schemes Employees are encouraged to share the 
financial benefits of the Group’s success through a number of option 
and incentive schemes.
Diversity BOC values the diversity of its workforce and is committed to
maintaining a workplace free from discrimination for reasons of race, creed,
culture, nationality, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age or marital status.
Safety, health and environment
BOC operates in a hazardous industry and the safety of all those associated
with our business is our highest priority. Hazards encountered by our
employees include flammable and toxic gases and operations involving high
pressures and extreme temperatures. The movement of product is central 
to all our businesses, involving exposure to hazards associated with driving,
distribution and service operations. The Group has traditionally measured its
safety performance against a set of reactive or lagging indicators, such as lost
workday cases, and has additionally recently introduced a set of predictive,
or leading, indicators.
BOC has an on-line environmental survey gathering data from all its sites 
as part of a comprehensive environmental programme. BOC aims to
minimise the environmental impact from its sites and to comply fully with 
all material environmental laws and regulations. BOC also contributes a 
variety of products and technologies to meet the environmental needs of 
its customers.
Supplier payment policy
The Group applies a policy of agreeing and clearly communicating the 
terms of payment as part of the commercial arrangements negotiated 
with suppliers and then paying according to those terms. In addition, the 
UK-based businesses have committed to the ‘Better Payment Practice Code’.
Corporate donations
The Group made donations of £2,032,000, of which £350,000 went to
UK-registered charities. £385,000 was used to support The BOC Foundation
for the Environment. As in previous years, no political donations were made
in the European Union.
Dividends
T wo dividends were paid in 2005. A first interim dividend of 15.9p per 
share was paid in February and a second interim dividend of 25.3p per share
was paid in August. A first interim dividend of 16.3p per share has been
declared for payment on 1 February 2006 and participation in the dividend
reinvestment plan will be available to shareholders whose applications have
been received by Lloyds TSB Registrars by 11 January 2006.
Corporate governance
The BOC Group is committed to business integrity, high ethical values and
professionalism in all its activities. As an essential part of this commitment,
the board supports the highest standards of corporate governance.
BOC has applied the principles contained in Section 1 of the Combined
Code on Corporate Governance issued by the Financial Reporting Council
and has complied throughout the year with the provisions set out therein 
as they applied to the company.
The New Y ork Stock Exchange (NYSE) has in place listing standards 
related to the corporate governance practices of listed companies.
BOC, as a foreign private issuer with American Depositary Shares listed 
on the NYSE, is required to comply with certain of these rules, in particular
as they relate to audit committees, and must disclose any significant ways in
which its corporate governance practices differ from those followed by 
US domestic companies under the NYSE listing standards. At this time,
BOC does not believe that there are any significant differences in the
corporate governance practices followed by the company, as compared 
to those followed by US domestic companies, except that the membership
of the nomination committee is not composed entirely of independent
non-executive directors. The membership of the nomination committee 
is however in line with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance,
which permits membership of this committee to be composed of a 
majority of independent non-executive directors.
Risk management and internal control The board of directors has overall
responsibility for the Group’s system of risk management and internal controls.
The BOC risk management programme assists management throughout 
the Group to identify, assess and mitigate business risk. During 2005
approximately 86 risk workshops or reviews have been conducted.
The output from each assessment is a set of prioritised risks with 
associated action plans. A report to the board is made twice a year of 
the key risks facing the Group and actions to manage these key risks.
Report of the directors
28 The BOC Group plc Annual review and summary financial statements 2005
  The directors have delegated to executive management the establishment 
and implementation of a system of internal controls. The internal control
system is monitored and supported by an internal audit function that
operates on a global basis and reports its results to management and the
audit committee of the board. The system is rigorous and designed to ensure
that directors maintain full and effective control over all significant strategic,
financial, organisational and compliance issues.
Having reviewed its effectiveness, the directors are not aware of anything in
the Group’s system of internal controls during the period covered by this
report which would render them ineffective.
The board and committees A complete list of the company’s directors,
with their biographies, photographs, and board committee memberships 
can be found on pages 24 and 25. A summary and explanation of their
remuneration is given on pages 31 to 33.
Board committees
Audit committee The audit committee meets four times a year, the agendas
being organised around the company’s financial reporting cycle. Time is set
aside at one of these meetings for the committee to meet with the internal
and the external auditors separately without the executive management
present. The committee reviews the effectiveness of internal controls,
matters raised by the internal and external auditors in their regular reports 
to the committee and the quarterly financial statements prior to their release
as well as the arrangements by which staff of the Group may, in confidence,
raise concerns. The committee also monitors that an appropriate relationship
between BOC and the external auditors is maintained and reviews the
policies and procedures in place to ensure the independence and objectivity
of the audit. The committee comprises only independent non-executive
directors and is chaired by Sir Christopher O’Donnell.
Nomination committee The nomination committee meets periodically as
required but at least annually. During 2005 the committee met six times.
The committee primarily monitors the composition and balance of the 
board and its committees and identifies and recommends to the board 
the appointment of new directors. The committee also keeps under review
the board committee structure and composition of each committee and
makes recommendations to the board of any changes considered necessary.
All independent non-executive directors, the chairman and the chief executive
serve as members of this committee. The committee is chaired 
by Rob Margetts. Whilst the chairman of the board chairs this committee 
he is not permitted to chair meetings when the appointment of his successor
is being considered or during discussions regarding his performance.
Remuneration committee The remuneration committee meets six times 
a year. The committee recommends to the board the policy on executive
directors’ remuneration and the specific remuneration, benefits and terms of
employment of each executive director. The committee comprises only
independent non-executive directors and is chaired by Guy Dawson.
Pensions committee The pensions committee meets twice a year and
oversees the review of governance and control procedures applying to all
employee retirement benefit plans and reviews and makes recommendations
on the investment policies and strategies applied to the Group’s retirement
benefit plans. The committee comprises an independent non-executive
director, the chairman, chief executive and Group finance director.
The committee is chaired by Guy Dawson.
Executive management board The executive management board meets
regularly having primary authority for the day-to-day management of the
Group’s operations and policy implementation in line with the Group’s
strategy agreed by the board. The committee comprises the chief executive,
the other executive directors and certain senior managers and is chaired by
T ony Isaac. Further details are given on page 26.
Investment committee The investment committee meets regularly and
reviews and approves Group commitments up to £25 million as delegated 
by the board. Group commitments over £25 million are presented to the
board for approval on recommendation from the committee. The committee
comprises the chief executive, the other executive directors and certain senior
managers and is chaired by T ony Isaac.

Report of the directors 29 We have examined the summary financial statement of The BOC Group plc.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual review and summary
financial statements in accordance with applicable law. Our responsibility is to

statement within the annual review and summary financial statements with
the annual financial statements, the directors’ report and the directors’
remuneration report and its compliance with the relevant requirements of
Section 251 of the United Kingdom Companies Act 1985 and the regulations
made thereunder. We also read the other information contained in the annual

inconsistencies with the summary financial statement.
This statement, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the
company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 251 of the
Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this
opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any
other person to whom this statement is shown or into whose hands it may
come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Basis of opinion
We conducted our work in accordance with Bulletin 1999/6, ‘The auditors’
statement on the summary financial statement’ issued by the Auditing
Practices Board for use in the United Kingdom.
Opinion
In our opinion the summary financial statement is consistent with the annual
financial statements, the directors’ report and the directors’ remuneration

Independent auditors’ statement
T o the members of The BOC Group plc
30 The BOC Group plc Annual review and summary financial statements 2005
  The report below is a summary of the directors’ remuneration report.
The full report setting out the composition of the remuneration committee,
the remuneration policy, together with full details of the directors’
emoluments, pensions, share options and shareholdings, is contained within
the report and accounts 2005 on pages 72 to 83. Copies of the full directors’
remuneration report can be obtained, free of charge, from BOC or may be
viewed on, or downloaded from, BOC’s website, www.boc.com
The remuneration committee
The remuneration committee comprises all the independent non-executive
directors. It sets the overall remuneration policy of the Group and makes
recommendations to the board on the framework of executive remuneration.
It meets six times a year. Specifically, the remuneration committee determines,
on behalf of the board, the detailed terms of service of the executive
directors and other members of the executive management team including
basic salary, performance-related bonus arrangements, benefits in kind,
long-term incentives and pension benefits. The remuneration committee also
reviews the remuneration of the chairman, following a recommendation 
from the chief executive and the senior independent director. The board 
as a whole determines the non-executive directors’ fees.
Non-executive directors
Non-executive directors are initially appointed for a three year term after
which, whilst not automatic, their appointment may be extended for a
second term subject to mutual agreement and shareholder approval.
The fees are set at a level which will attract individuals with the necessary
experience and ability to make a significant contribution to The BOC Group’s
affairs and are benchmarked with those fees paid by other UK listed
companies. The non-executive directors do not have service contracts.
They do not participate in the Group’s variable compensation arrangements,
its long-term incentive arrangements or its pension arrangements. They do
not receive any benefits in kind.
Remuneration policy
BOC’s remuneration policy for executive directors and other executive
management is designed to attract and retain executives of the highest calibre
so that the Group is managed successfully to the benefit of its stakeholders.
In setting remuneration levels the remuneration committee takes into account
the remuneration practices found in other UK listed companies of similar 
size, internationality and complexity. The policy is to pay salaries and total
remuneration around mid-market levels for on target performance and to
provide the opportunity, via annual and long-term incentives, for executives to
be rewarded at the 75th percentile if this is justified by the achievement of top
of the range performance goals. It is the view of the remuneration committee
that performance-related remuneration should form a substantial element of
total remuneration. Based on assumptions about expected values for awards
from the Long-T erm Incentive Plan (LTIP) and the Share Matching Plan,
the proportion of performance-related remuneration to fixed remuneration
(excluding pensions and benefits in kind) for current arrangements is
approximately 67 per cent to 33 per cent.
Remuneration components
Basic salary Salaries for executive directors and executive management board
members are based on median market rates drawn from market data
provided by remuneration consultants, T owers Perrin, and take account of an
executive’s experience, responsibilities and performance. Performance is
assessed both from an individual and business perspective. Remuneration 
for those executives of businesses outside the UK is denominated in the 
local currency.
Variable compensation plan (VCP) The executive directors and senior
management participate in the variable compensation bonus plan. The plan
focuses on annual objectives and links individual performance with business
plans. Last year, as part of the review of performance-related elements of the
executive remuneration package, the remuneration committee agreed that
the target and maximum value of the VCP be increased to 110 per cent and
160 per cent of salary respectively and that one third of the VCP bonus be
compulsorily deferred into the Share Matching Plan. The financial targets for
the executive directors and other executive management board members 
are set on an annual basis by the remuneration committee and performance
against these targets is reviewed by the remuneration committee on a six
monthly basis. The remuneration committee considers that a six monthly
review acts as a significant incentive and is conducive to sustaining
performance throughout the year. The financial targets are based equally on
adjusted earnings per share (EPS) and adjusted return on capital employed
(ROCE) at Group level. Adjusted means excluding exceptional items.
Bonuses are assessed two thirds on these financial targets with the remaining
third based on personal objectives. These are based on BOC’s strategic
priorities and include safety, growth, people and change management and
productivity. Performance is measured against key performance indicators
determined during formal appraisals. There is a threshold performance level
below which no bonus is paid. For 2005 the financial targets set by the
remuneration committee were EPS 66p and ROCE 15.3 per cent and the
achievement against these targets was EPS 64.3p and ROCE 15.3 per cent.
The bonus payable in respect of the financial targets amounts to 58.6 per cent
of salary. In addition, an amount equal to 29.3 per cent of salary has been
deferred into the Share Matching Plan.
Long-T erm Incentive Plan (LTIP) Executive directors, members of the
executive management board and a number of other key executives 
selected from the company’s global operations participate in the LTIP .
The remuneration committee has the discretion to grant awards up to a
maximum of 2.5 times salary. The award made in November 2004 to the
chief executive was based on 2 times salary and for other board directors 
1.5 times salary. There are three performance conditions: total shareholder
return (TSR), adjusted earnings per share (EPS) and adjusted return on capital
employed (ROCE). Up to one third of the award could vest in respect of
each performance condition.
Directors’ remuneration

  The TSR performance condition compares BOC’s TSR performance with two
separate comparator groups, a UK comparator group comprising 31 industrial
and manufacturing companies and a global industrial gases group of six leading
companies as follows:
UK group
Aggregate Industries FKI RMC Group
AMEC Hanson Rolls-Royce
Anglo American IMI Scottish & Southern Energy
AWG ICI Scottish Power
BAE Systems International Power Severn Trent
BG Group Invensys Shell Transport & Trading
BHP Billiton Johnson Matthey Smiths Group
BP Kelda Group T omkins
BPB National Grid Transco United Utilities
Centrica Pilkington
Corus Group Rio Tinto
Aggregate Industries and RMC Group were taken over in 2005. Their TSR
performance to the point at which they were taken over has been included 
in the performance measurement.
Global gases group
Airgas (US – S&P 500 Index) 
Air Liquide (France – CAC 40 Index) 
Air Products & Chemicals (US – S&P 500 Index) 
Linde (Germany – DAX 30 Index) 
T aiyo Nippon Sanso (Japan – NIKKEI 225 Index) 
Praxair (US – S&P 500 Index) 
When determining BOC’s performance relative to the global gases group,
the TSR for BOC and the comparator companies is adjusted (adjusted TSR)
so that it reflects the excess (or shortfall) in returns relative to the local
stockmarket index where each company has its primary listing. The nationality
and the local stockmarket index that is used to calculate the adjusted TSR for
each company is shown in the parentheses.
For the awards made in November 2004 which will vest in November 2007,
the target set by the remuneration committee is such that if the company’s
TSR position measured over a three year period is median in respect of both
comparator groups, then 40 per cent of the shares in respect of the TSR 
part of the award will vest. If the company’s TSR position is upper quartile all
of the shares in respect of the TSR part of the award will vest. If the TSR
performance is between the median and upper quartile a proportion of
between 40 per cent and all of the shares in respect of the TSR part of the
award will vest. If the company’s TSR position is below the median for both
comparator groups the TSR part of the award will lapse. The same TSR
performance criteria were used for the award made in the financial year 2004.
The remuneration committee has decided that for any awards made in the
financial year 2006 onwards, 25 per cent rather than 40 per cent of the
shares for the TSR part of the award will vest at median.
The adjusted EPS performance condition is based on the company’s EPS
relative to three year targets on a sliding performance scale. For the awards
made in November 2004 which will vest in November 2007, the target set
by the remuneration committee is 70.3p at the end of the three year
performance period for minimum vesting. If this is achieved, 40 per cent of
the shares in respect of the EPS part of the award will vest. All of the shares
in respect of the EPS part of the award will vest if the company achieves
80.8p at the end of the three year performance period. If the EPS
performance is between 70.3p and 80.8p, a proportion of between 
40 per cent and all of the shares in respect of the EPS part of the award will
vest. If EPS is less than 70.3p at the end of the three year period, the EPS part
of the award will lapse. The EPS targets for the financial year 2004 awards
were 60.3p for threshold vesting and 69.3p for full vesting.
The adjusted ROCE performance condition is based on the company’s ROCE
relative to three year targets on a sliding performance scale. For the awards
made in November 2004, and for further awards, the remuneration
committee decided that it would be appropriate to widen the ROCE band.
The threshold target set by the remuneration committee for the November
2004 awards, which will vest in November 2007, is 13.5 per cent at the end 
of the three year performance period. If this is achieved 40 per cent of the
shares in respect of the ROCE part of the award will vest. All of the shares in
respect of the ROCE part of the award will vest if the company achieves a
ROCE of 16 per cent. If the ROCE performance is between 13.5 per cent
and 16 per cent a proportion of between 40 per cent and all of the shares 
in respect of the ROCE part of the award will vest. If the ROCE is less than
13.5 per cent the ROCE part of the award will lapse. The ROCE targets for
the financial year 2004 awards were 13.5 per cent for threshold vesting and 
15 per cent for full vesting.
In setting three performance conditions for the LTIP awards, the
remuneration committee took the view that these were the most important
measures that drive or measure sustainable improvements in shareholder
value: the TSR performance condition measures comparative performance
while EPS and ROCE reflect a core part of the company’s business strategy,
enabling high levels of both earnings growth and capital efficiency.
For the awards made for the financial year 2003, the performance conditions
have been met to the extent that 52.6 per cent of the shares vest on the
third anniversary of the awards date.
Share Matching Plan (SMP) The plan was adopted by shareholders at the
2005 Annual General Meeting. Executive directors, members of the
executive management board and other senior managers who participate in
the VCP are eligible to participate in the SMP . One third of any VCP award is
compulsorily applied to the acquisition of BOC shares. The executives will
become entitled to these shares only if they are still in service with BOC
three years after the award is made or are considered to be ‘good leavers.’
The executives will receive an additional number of shares equal to the value
of the dividends paid during the deferral period of the shares and they may
also receive a matching share award of up to 100 per cent of the number 
of shares originally allotted. The percentage award will depend on the
company’s performance over the deferral period. Adjusted EPS will account
for 75 per cent of the performance weighting, with TSR accounting for the
remaining 25 per cent. The adjusted EPS performance condition is based on
the company’s EPS relative to three year targets. These targets will be on a
sliding scale, where five per cent per annum growth rate over three years is
required for threshold vesting of 25 per cent of that portion. Full vesting 
will be achieved if EPS growth is 12 per cent per annum over the three 
year period.
The TSR performance condition compares BOC’s TSR performance against
the same UK comparator group as used for the LTIP . Awards will vest for this
portion where BOC’s TSR position is median, measured over three years.
At this point 25 per cent of this portion of the award will vest. Full vesting
occurs if the company is ranked at or above the upper quartile. Details of the
value of VCP awards for directors that will be applied to the acquisition of
BOC shares under the SMP are shown below.
Executive Share Option Scheme 2003 (ESOS 2003) The last grant under 
the ESOS 2003 to executive directors and employees who participate in the
SMP took place in November 2003. The scheme was retained for selected
middle management throughout the company’s global operations. However,
it is intended to develop an alternative scheme for this group in the financial 
year 2006. The performance condition set for the ESOS 2003 by the
remuneration committee is that the growth in the adjusted EPS over a three
year performance period must be equal to or greater than the growth in the
UK retail prices index (RPI) plus three per cent per annum over the three
year performance period. In line with current corporate governance best
practice there is no rolling re-testing of performance. In the event that the
performance condition is not satisfied over the original three year period then 
32 The BOC Group plc Annual review and summary financial statements 2005 Directors’ remuneration the remuneration committee has the discretion to re-test performance after
five years, but only where the remuneration committee believes the extension
to be a fair and reasonable basis for assessing the sustained underlying
performance of the company.
Awards under the LTIP , SMP and ESOS 2003 are not pensionable.
Savings Related Share Option Schemes
New Schemes were adopted by shareholders at the 2005 Annual General
Meeting. These are operated in the UK, Australia, New Zealand and Ireland,
and are open to all employees including executive directors with one year’s
service or more. The UK scheme is approved by HM Revenue and Customs.
TSR performance
The graph above has been included to meet the requirement set out in the
Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002. It shows BOC’s total
shareholder return (TSR) performance, assuming dividends are reinvested,
compared with all FTSE100 companies. This has been chosen because it
provides a basis for comparison against companies in a relevant, broad based
equity index of which BOC is a constituent member. The remuneration
committee decided that other comparator groups were more appropriate 
as performance measurement for the LTIP . A graph showing BOC’s TSR
performance compared with the six major gases companies relative to
respective local indices, which is one of the comparator groups chosen 
for the LTIP , is shown in the chairman’s statement on page 5.
Service contracts
The company’s policy is for all executive directors to have contracts of
employment that terminate on the attainment of retirement age. In order to
mitigate its liability on early termination, the company’s policy is that it should
be able to terminate such contracts on no more than 12 months’ notice,
and that payments on termination are restricted to the value of salary, car
benefit and bonus entitlement (calculated on the basis of the average of actual
payments over the preceding two years) for the unexpired portion of the
notice period. The company has revised this policy further for all new
appointments, so that in the event of early termination, the company will pay
either monthly compensation calculated as per the terms set out above for
the unexpired portion of the notice period, or else a lump sum payment
equal to the base salary pro-rated to the unexpired portion of the notice
period. In the event that monthly compensation is paid, should an individual
obtain alternative employment during the period of the monthly payments,
the company's obligation is reduced by the amount of the monthly
remuneration from the alternative employment. The revised policy has
applied to all new appointments during the financial year and will apply to
subsequent appointments.
Pensions
During the year, five directors accrued benefits under the defined benefit plans
operated by the company. Contributions amounting to £308,000 were paid
by the company to money purchase plans in respect of three directors.

shipping costs, and any other assignment allowances not covered in this indicative listing.
2. Mr Masters and Mr Bevan are international assignees, and Mr Walsh was an international assignee prior to his resignation. The pay of international assignees is managed under 
a tax equalisation programme funded by the company. This programme ensures that they are not penalised financially by accepting roles of an international nature which would
result in higher taxation costs than would have been the case if they had remained in their home country, as in the case of Mr Walsh and Mr Masters, or benefit from a tax
windfall as in the case of Mr Bevan. Mr Bevan’s basic salary/fees is set by reference to his UK notional salary of £342,000.

1. Basis of preparation
• These accounts are based on the historical cost accounting convention in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and comply with all applicable UK
accounting standards.
• The accounts are prepared on the going concern basis. This means that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable
future.
• The Group accounts include the accounts of the parent undertaking and of all subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates. Subsidiary undertakings are those
businesses controlled by the Group and their results are fully included. Joint ventures are those businesses which the Group jointly controls with one or
more other parties. Associates are those businesses in which the Group has a participating interest and exercises significant influence.
• The results of businesses acquired are included from the effective date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions during the year (the difference between the
fair value of the purchase price of a business and the fair value of the net assets acquired) is capitalised and amortised over its useful economic life.
2. Exchange rates
The majority of the Group’s operations are located outside the UK and operate in currencies other than sterling. Profit and loss and other period statements
of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at average rates of exchange for the financial year. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies
are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the end of the financial year.
The rates of exchange to sterling for the currencies which have principally affected the Group’s results were:

  4. Legal proceedings
BOC Group companies are parties to various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including some in which claims for damages in large
amounts have been asserted.
The outcome of litigation to which BOC Group companies are party cannot be readily foreseen, but the directors believe that such litigation should be
disposed of without material adverse effect on the Group’s financial condition or profitability.
Welding fumes litigation A US subsidiary of BOC, The BOC Group, Inc., currently is party to a number of lawsuits in the US for alleged injuries resulting
from exposure to manganese, asbestos and/or toxic fumes in connection with the welding process. The BOC Group, Inc. has not manufactured welding rods
in the US since 1986 when the welding electrodes business was sold. The BOC Group, Inc. ceased selling welding rods in the US manufactured by others
when the sale of the US packaged gas business, including the operations that distributed packaged gases and welding equipment, was completed in July 2004.
Manganese litigation At 30 September 2005, there were a total of approximately 8,574 claimants (‘T otal Claimants’) in pending manganese related cases in
both US federal and state courts that name The BOC Group, Inc. as a defendant, a net decrease of approximately 1,100 claimants from 30 September 2004.
The BOC Group, Inc. is typically one of several defendants in these cases that claim compensatory and punitive damages, in most cases for unspecified
amounts, for alleged neurological injury, including Parkinson’s disease, through exposure to manganese in welding fumes. Of the T otal Claimants,
approximately 4,607 claimants have filed in, or been transferred for pre-trial purposes to, the federal district court in the Northern District of Ohio, where 
a multi-district litigation (MDL) proceeding has been commenced, and approximately 50 claimants are in process to be transferred to or from the MDL.
The MDL proceeding is a vehicle for coordinating pre-trial proceedings in cases pending in different federal district courts in the US. It is currently
contemplated that the MDL court will try three cases during the MDL proceeding. The first such case is currently scheduled for February 2006. In addition 
to the cases in federal court, The BOC Group, Inc. is a defendant in a number of similar cases pending in state courts, which are in different stages of
procedural development, and certain cases are scheduled for trial from time to time. The BOC Group, Inc. has been a co-defendant in other manganese
related claims that have been resolved as follows. From 1 January 1997 to 30 September 2005, 3,965 claims were dismissed. Through 30 September 2005,
seven cases were tried to final jury verdicts in favour of the defendants, including The BOC Group, Inc., and one case was tried to a final jury verdict in 
favour of the plaintiffs, which is being appealed.
Asbestos litigation At 30 September 2005, there were a total of approximately 15,966 claimants in pending asbestos related cases that name 
The BOC Group, Inc. as a defendant, a net decrease of approximately 600 from 30 September 2004. The BOC Group, Inc. is typically one of a large
number of defendants in these cases that claim compensatory and punitive damages, in most cases for unspecified amounts, for alleged injuries, including
cancer, through exposure to asbestos in welding fumes or from welding consumables. A very small number of these claimants allege injuries from exposure
to asbestos in non-welding rod products and premises. The BOC Group, Inc. has been a co-defendant in other asbestos related claims that have been
resolved as follows. From 1 January 1997 to 30 September 2005, 11,776 claims were dismissed and 75 claims were dismissed on summary judgments.
Through 30 September 2005, nine cases were tried to final jury verdicts in favour of the defendants, including The BOC Group, Inc., and one case was 
tried to a final jury verdict in favour of the plaintiffs, which is being appealed.
The BOC Group, Inc. believes that it has strong defences to the claims asserted in all of the various manganese and asbestos related cases and intends 
to defend vigorously such claims. In the manganese related claims, The BOC Group, Inc. believes that recent relevant scientific literature, based on
epidemiological studies, strongly supports its defence of such claims. Based on its experience to date, together with its current assessment of the merits of 
the claims being asserted and applicable insurance, BOC believes that continued defence and resolution of the welding fumes litigation will not have a material
adverse effect on its financial condition or profitability and no provision has been made. Nonetheless, it is not possible to predict either the number of future
claims or the number of claimants that any future claims may present. In addition, the outcome of welding fume cases, either involving BOC or other
defendants, is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict, and BOC cannot provide any assurances that any future resolutions of these types of claims
will necessarily be consistent with its experience to date. In the event of an adverse outcome to any of the proceedings, a liability would be recognised if it
was considered likely that it would give rise to an outflow of future economic benefits. Where there is applicable insurance, this would be recognised when 
its recoverability was virtually certain.
Fluorogas litigation The Fluorogas litigation is now settled and is no longer the subject of any legal proceedings.
